overview the s p 500 set a new record high and close yesterday but the lift to global markets was not strong enough to overcome the disappointing chinese pmi although chinese equities traded higher on ideas that the news will spur additional stimulative measures other asian markets were mixed samsung s profit miss weighed on korean shares and the won which is the worst performing currency today shedding about 0 8 european stocks are trading heavily and the dow jones stoxx 600 is off about 0 2 in late morning turnover the possible first loss in three sessions bond yields are firmer and the german 10 year bund yield is back above zero where the better than expected emu gdp is most expressed is the euro s climb above 1 12 where it appeared to have broken out from last week the dollar is seeing its recent gains pared against all the major currencies the move began last week and the inability of the dollar to extend its gains in a meaningful way after the stronger than expected q1 gdp was an early signal confirming what the failure of the australian dollar to close below 0 7000 had hinted asia pacific china s manufacturing pmi slipped to 50 1 from 50 5 and the non manufacturing pmi eased to 54 3 from 54 8 that pushed the composite to 53 4 from 54 0 while disappointing the data is not horrible the composite pmi averaged 53 2 in q1 19 and 52 8 in q4 18 new orders slowed and while new export orders improved they are still below the 50 boom bust level the caixin measure whose sample is more weighted to small and medium firms eased to 50 2 from 50 8 more stimulative measures from china continues to seem reasonable though we had not given up on cut in reserve requirements even before today s reports south korea reported a 1 4 rise in march s industrial output which narrowed the year over year decline to 2 8 from 3 4 in february this was not sufficient to offset the drag from samsung s disappointing earnings report recall that last week south korea reported an unexpected 0 3 contraction in q1 gdp tokyo markets remain closed this week but the yen strengthened to three week highs the dollar has been sold a little through jpy111 30 in the middle of last week it set the year s high near jpy112 40 the next band of support jpy110 75 jpy111 00 initial resistance is seen near jpy111 60 the disappointing economic news from china spurred almost knee jerk sales of the australian dollar it took out yesterday s low by 1 100 of a cent and continues to hover around 0 7050 last week s low the first violation of 0 7000 since january 3 was quickly reversed and we thought one of the early tells that the us dollar s leg up was likely complete the yen and the aussie have moved back into their previous ranges as the greenback s breakout tested however to maintain the corrective pressure the australian dollar needs to rise through the 0 7070 area the dollar appears to have moved into a new short term range against the chinese yuan it had been hovering near cny6 70 and since the middle of last week has traded between about cny6 7260 and cny6 7500 the philippine peso strengthened 0 4 on news that s p upgraded the sovereign debt rating to bbb stable outlook it was off fractionally in q1 but its 1 2 gain led the asian currencies this month europe the eurozone reported stronger than q1 gdp and underscores our sense that the survey data was more pessimistic than the real economy gdp rose 0 4 in q1 for a 1 2 year over year pace in q4 18 growth of 0 2 translated into a 1 2 year over year gain as well revised up from 1 1 france reported earlier that it grew 0 3 from a 1 1 year over year rate ostensibly helped by macron s tax cuts in the yellow vest protests spain s economy went from strength to strength with q1 growth of 0 7 after 0 6 in q4 18 the year over year rate edged up to 2 4 from 2 3 catalonia seemed to be a bigger issue in last weekend s elections than the economy italy s gdp surprised on the upside expanding 0 2 in q1 and lifted the year over year rate for the first time in five quarters the 0 1 year over year rise contrasts with forecasts for a 0 1 contraction italy also reported its unemployment fell to 10 2 in march from a revised 10 5 in february it is the lowest level since last august when the cyclical low was recorded 10 1 last march it was just below 11 german unemployment was unchanged at 4 9 unemployment in emu slipped to 7 7 a new cyclical low from 7 8 in march 2018 it was at 8 5 separately preliminary april cpi data has been reported france italy and spain have reported increases all the german states that reported show stronger price pressures the national figures are due out shortly and the risk appears to be on the upside of the median forecast in the bloomberg survey for a 0 5 increase on the month and 1 7 year over year rise from 1 4 the preliminary emu figure will be published at the end of the week and headline is expected to increase to 1 6 from 1 4 the combination of stronger growth and firmer price pressures cannot be to the ecb s dislike leaders of local tory parties have marshaled efforts to push prime minister may out reports suggest it is the first time in 185 years that this tactic is being used recall earlier this month there was talk that the party elders were considering changing the rules so may would face a second confidence vote in a year there appears to be little progress in cross party talks and although may continues to reject a customs union arrangement labour s position does not appear fixed like on a second referendum the striking thing is that the brexit mess has not catapulted the labour party in the polls the tories though are likely to be punished in this week s local elections but labour may not be the largest beneficiary therein lies the problem that referendum that was to unite the tory party is on the verge of institutionalizing the split within it meanwhile may has offered to step down once bexit passes now the question is when will she step down if it does not pass by seeking to delay the queen s speech in which the legislative agenda is presented by the government it could hint that may intends to leave over the summer or early q4 the euro broke down and tested 1 11 late last week goosed by the data the single currency returned to the scene of the crime the breakout 1 1200 it has approached 1 1220 area which is the halfway mark of its decline since april 17 high near 1 1325 the 1 1240 1 1250 may offer stronger resistance and also houses about 1 5 bln euros in options that expire today a close back below 1 12 would show dollar bulls are fighting back but if it is to take place after the fomc and before the employment data seems more likely sterling is going for the ride it is higher against the dollar but has yet to resurface above 1 30 it is a little heavier than the euro the dollar s gains against the turkish lira were reversed following a threat by the central bank to hike rates if necessary recall that dropping it from the recent central bank statement fanned selling pressures america there are several economic reports from the us today q1 unit labor costs chicago ism house prices pending home sales and the conference board s consumer confidence survey but they are overshadowed by tomorrow s fomc meeting tomorrow the treasury will announce the details of the quarterly refunding yesterday it

canada s decision to drop the reference to a rate hike last week seems to have already made the adjustment this suggests the reported may have limited impact while the euro yen and australian dollar have returned to the ranges that were broken last week the canadian dollar has not however the greenback looks poised to test the cad1 3400 area in the near term mexico reports q1 gdp a 0 3 expansion

financial metrics for the first quarter is shown below balance sheet as a result of the adoption of ifrs 16 9 6 billion of right of use assets and 10 3 billion of lease liabilities have been included in the group balance sheet as at 31 march 2019 the majority of these were previously reported as operating leases and so were not previously recognized on the balance sheet the total lease liability also includes leases that were previously classified as finance leases under ias 17 which totalled 0 7 billion at 31 december 2018 lease liabilities are now presented separately on the group balance sheet do not form part of finance debt and are not included in net debt and gearing in the financial framework income statement the increase in depreciation from recognizing right of use assets and interest on the lease liability is largely offset by the absence of operating lease expenses resulting in no material overall effect on group profit measures cash flow in prior years operating lease payments were presented as operating cash flows or capital expenditure lease payments are now split into payments of principal that are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest that are presented as operating cash flows there were 0 6 billion of lease payments of principal included within financing cash flows for the first quarter of 2019 bp estimates that 0 5 billion of these

following the introduction of ifrs 16 the positive impacts on operating cash flow and organic capital expenditure are fully offset in the cash flow statement by a new line lease liability payments

reported an underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax of 1 292 million for the first quarter compared with 1 398 million for the same period in 2018 the year on year movement was driven by lower refining margins partially offset by a strong contribution from supply and trading and higher fuels marketing earnings the refining result for the quarter reflects the impact of lower industry refining margins and narrower north american heavy crude oil discounts the fuels marketing result for the quarter primarily reflects year on year retail earnings growth benefiting from higher premium volumes the continued roll out of our convenience partnership model and further expansion in new markets most notably mexico in the quarter we opened our first bp branded retail station in shandong province through our joint venture with dongming this marks the start of our plan to add 1 000 new sites over the next five years to our existing network in china of more than 740 sites lubricants the lubricants business reported an underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax of 272 million for the first quarter compared with 331 million for the same period in 2018 the result for the quarter reflects continued adverse foreign exchange rate movements and one off impacts related to the completion of a systems implementation petrochemicals the petrochemicals business reported an underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax of 169 million for the first quarter compared with 97 million for the same period in 2018 the result for the quarter reflects increased margin optimization and a lower level of turnaround activity in the quarter we agreed an expansion of capacity at our joint venture petrochemicals facility in south korea which will help us to meet the region s growing acetyls demand we also continued to make progress in our commitment to a low carbon future signing an agreement with virent and johnson matthey to further advance the development of bio paraxylene a key raw material for the production of renewable polyester outlook looking to the second quarter of 2019 we expect higher industry refining margins a similar level of

standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb ifrs as adopted by the european union eu and in accordance with the provisions of the uk companies act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under ifrs ifrs as adopted by the eu differs in certain respects from ifrs as issued by the iasb the differences have no impact on the group s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented the financial information presented herein has been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies expected to be used in preparing bp annual report and form 20 f 2019 which are the same as those used in preparing bp annual report and form 20 f 2018with the exception of the adoption of ifrs 16 leases from 1 january 2019 new international financial reporting standards adopted bp adopted ifrs 16 leases which replaced ias 17 leases and ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease with effect from 1 january 2019 further information is included in bp annual report and form 20 f 2018 financial statements note 1 significant accounting policies judgements estimates and assumptions impact of new international financial reporting standards ifrs 16 provides a new model for lessee accounting in which the majority of leases are accounted for by the recognition on the balance sheet of a right of use asset and a lease liability agreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases a lease liability is recognized at the present value of future lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are not included in the lease liability the right of use asset is recognized at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments lease incentives initial direct costs and any restoration obligations the subsequent amortization of the right of use asset and the interest expense related to the lease liability are recognized in the income statement over the lease term the group recognizes the full lease liability rather than its working interest share for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the primary responsibility for making the lease payments if the right of use asset is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint operators a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators bp elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach in which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in opening retained earnings at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods financial information comparative information in the group balance sheet and group cash flow statement has however been re presented to align with current year presentation showing lease liabilities and lease liability payments as separate line items these were previously included within the finance debt and repayments of long term financing line items respectively amounts presented in these line items for the comparative periods relate to leases accounted for as finance leases under ias 17 ifrs 16 introduces a revised definition of a lease as permitted by the standard bp elected not to reassess the existing population of leases under the new definition and will only apply the new definition for the assessment of contracts entered into after the transition date on transition the standard permits on a lease by lease basis the right of use asset to be measured either at an amount equal to the lease liability as adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments or on a historical basis as if the standard had always applied bp elected to use the historical asset measurement for its more material leases and used the asset equals liability approach for the remainder of the population bp also elected to adjust the carrying amounts of the right of use assets as at 1 january 2019 for onerous lease provisions that had been recognized on the group balance sheet as at 31 december 2018 rather than performing impairment tests on transition top of page 18 note 1 basis of preparation continued the effect of the adoption of ifrs 16 on the group balance sheet is set out below adjustment 31

taxation credit charge 7 90 11 11 426 50 bp uses derivative instruments to manage the economic exposure relating to inventories above normal operating requirements of crude oil natural gas and petroleum products under ifrs these inventories are recorded at historical cost the related derivative instruments however are required to be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in the income statement this is because hedge accounting is either not permitted or not followed principally due to the impracticality of effectiveness testing requirements therefore measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses occur gains and losses on these inventories are not recognized until the commodity is sold in a subsequent accounting period gains and losses on the related derivative commodity contracts are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into on a fair value basis using forward prices consistent with the contract maturity bp enters into physical commodity contracts to meet certain business requirements such as the purchase of crude for a refinery or the sale of bp s gas production under ifrs these physical contracts are treated as derivatives and are required to be fair valued when they are managed as part of a larger portfolio of similar transactions gains and losses arising are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into ifrs require that inventory held for trading is recorded at its fair value using period end spot prices whereas any related derivative commodity instruments are required to be recorded at values based on forward prices consistent with the contract maturity depending on market conditions these forward prices can be either higher or lower than spot prices resulting in measurement differences bp enters into contracts for pipelines and other transportation storage capacity oil and gas processing and liquefied natural gas lng that under ifrs are recorded on an accruals basis these contracts are risk managed using a variety of derivative instruments that are fair valued under ifrs this results in measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses the way that bp manages the economic exposures described above and measures performance internally differs from the way these activities are measured under ifrs bp calculates this difference for consolidated entities by comparing the ifrs result with management s internal measure of performance under management s internal measure of performance the inventory transportation and capacity contracts in question are valued based on fair value using relevant forward prices prevailing at the end of the period the fair values of derivative instruments used to risk manage certain oil gas and other contracts are deferred to match with the underlying exposure and the commodity contracts for business requirements are accounted for on an accruals basis we believe that disclosing management s estimate of this difference provides useful information for investors because it enables investors to see the economic effect of these activities as a whole in addition fair value accounting effects include changes in the fair value of the near term portions of lng contracts that fall within bp s risk management framework lng contracts are not considered derivatives because there is insufficient market liquidity and they are therefore accrual accounted under ifrs however oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments used to risk manage the near term portions of the lng contracts are fair valued under ifrs the fair value accounting effect reduces timing differences between recognition of the derivative financial instruments used to risk manage the lng contracts and the recognition of the lng contracts themselves which therefore gives a better representation of performance in each period

holdings group continued to develop and to consolidate its hydropower concessions located in india 571 mw which have made significant progress mainly in the land acquisition procedure the rodeio bonito plant generated 21 more power than in 2017 which was a very severe drought year power generation remained very moderate due to precipitation levels still below historical average in 2018 at constant foreign exchange rate the turnover despite the increase in electricity generation is stable because of the mre energy reallocation mechanism negative impact in euro the turnover is down by 17

indonesia through the sale of its last advanced hydropower project there the redelong hep 18 mw velcan holdings also continued to manage actively its treasury by continuing the diversification of its financial investments portfolio but it was impacted by the general poor performance of the financial markets the rise of the usd against the euro impacted favorably the net result slightly positive at eur 0 5 m vs eur 9 6 in 2017 financial year 2018 management comments on the business india the group continued to develop the hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the state of arunachal pradesh progress has been made towards the acquisition of the land the procedure of which has passed successfully the preparation of the social impact assessment the related public hearings the positive recommendation of the expert group and finally the official consent of the land owners and village councils to the acquisition of their land which is a major step for the projects following which the state government was bound to issue the section 11 notification by 27th march 2019 within 12 months following the expert group recommendation such notification validates the procedure previous steps sia hearings etc acknowledges the consent of the land owners and approves that the land is to be acquired by the government for a particular project however due to the preparation of local elections during the month of april 2019 and the applicability of the code of conduct during such pre elections period which prevents the government from undertaking anything else than day to day current affairs the state government has issued in late march 2019 an extension of time until 26th september 2019 for the issuance of the section 11 notification once section 11 will be issued the state government will have to conduct another set of surveys and procedural steps such as detailed and individual census of affected families marking land boundaries hearing of individual objections preparation of rehabilitation resettlement plans section 19 public hearing on such plans financial awards sections 23 and 31 and the physical possession of the land section 38 administrative issues related to land status are still the most sensitive and significant issues and keep slowing down the development of the projects as per the current concession agreement the acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the responsibility of the licensing government the concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer negotiations with the government of arunachal pradesh for such an extension of the concession agreement and the update of installed capacities are still opened but have not progressed in 2018 the timely availability of appropriate road infrastructure is also an important issue that velcan holdings has been attending with the central government whenever possible although no progress has been made by the government on this side during fy2018 the scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade are still scheduled in 2022 and the budgets for speeding the works and bringing such date forward have not yet been sanctioned however the new hydropower policy published on 7th march 2019 provides for budgetary support to be granted to hydropower for road infrastructure development which may help in the future to speed up road works completion see below for a several years the indian commercial and financial market conditions have been unfavorable to the sale of hydropower as the market has remained constrained by the indirect competition of solar and wind tariffs the bad financial health of electricity distribution companies discoms the insufficient regulatory framework not allowing the sale of power through long term bankable ppas and the heavy exposure of the banking sector to bad infrastructure loans the government of india has however undertaken to reverse the above negative conditions by publishing on 7th march 2019 a new hydropower policy which features the following main measures all hydropower projects including above 25mw to be declared as renewable energy source hydro purchase obligation hpo will be imposed on discoms which means discoms will be obliged to purchase hydropower annual hpo targets and necessary amendments will be introduced in the tariff regulations which are yet to be notified tariff rationalization measures including providing flexibility to the developers in order to lower the first years tariffs the computation modalities are yet to be determined by the central electricity regulatory commission cerc budgetary support to be granted by the government towards development of roads and bridges on case by case basis limited to rs 15 m 193 keur per mw for projects up to 200 mw like tato 1 hep and to rs 10 m 128 keur per mw for projects above 200 mw like heo hep although the results will take some time and depend on implementation modalities not yet known this policy is a significant measure and positive sign towards the recovery of the hydropower market which could help the development of the projects in terms of long term power demand even if some states are in power surplus scenario on the short term 1 2 years they should all be experiencing peak and average deficits at the end of 20221 the demand could even become significantly larger 20 gw if new ministry of environment and forest norms for coal based power plants are enforced to meet emissions standards and if renewable energy capacities are under achieved that should leave room for the procurement of hydropower by discoms if a proper regulatory framework is in place the group s team pushes all project activities which are now mainly the post tec site investigations and studies the land acquisition the transport infrastructure the amendment of the concession agreements the stage 2 forest clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable ppa however apart from the site investigations these requirements are mainly under the purview and responsibility of the state and central governments and the group scope of work in this regard is to file applications to attend requests to provide support to government services and to follow up and pursue the procedures the search for a ppa will be tightly linked to the recovery of the market as explained above no additional provision has been decided for fy 2018 in view of the uncertainties of the indian market and the delays encountered the company had already decided to book a provision in 2017 of eur 2 2m 16 on the intangible value of the indian projects brazil the production of 49 987mw during 2018 against 41 321 mwh in 2017 21 was moderate due to the rainfall in rodeio bonito catchment still well below the historical long term average this reflects the low precipitation levels in brazil in 2018 this resulted in an overall mre ensured energy mechanism in deficit as it has been the case since 2014 and a negative impact amounting to brl 1 5m in 2018 compared to brl 4 6m for 2017 for rodeio bonito translated in euros the consumed

administrative blockages encountered including the unavailability of satisfactory ppas the redelong hep was the last project of the group in indonesia the group has fully divested the project on 28th june 2018 sold to an indonesian industrial group the small size of the redelong project 18 mw did not economically justify having operations in the country like other projects of the group in indonesia the redelong project costs were already fully impaired as of 31st december 2017 the sale price which is to remain confidential allowed only a partial recovery of such costs given the uncertainties affecting the sector in indonesia as of the date of this report the company has shut down its entire operations in indonesia financial assets as it has done since 2005 and very actively

but the us dollar strengthening has compensated the losses the group has invested in bonds since 2008 and it has proved a good way to enhance the profits of the group so far the fact that the group

equity eur 1 3m and direct lending eur 3 3m most of the private equity and direct lending investment are invested in the shipping sector given the recent poor performance of this sector these

block transactions are defined as gains losses on the early extinguishment of non recourse funding obligations early termination fees for other financing restructuring and or resulting gains losses on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business the company excludes net investment gains losses and infrequent or unusual non operating items because the company does not consider them to be

timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles in addition the size and timing of other investment gains losses can be subject to the company s discretion and are influenced

insurance block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss because in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends infrequent or unusual non operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss if in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends while some of these items may be significant components of net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders in accordance with u s gaap the company believes that adjusted operating income loss and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income loss including adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income loss attributable to the ongoing operations of the business management also uses adjusted operating income loss as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts however the items excluded from adjusted operating income loss have occurred in the past and could and in some cases will recur in the future adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders or net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of adjusted operating income loss may differ from the definitions used by other companies in the first quarter of 2019 the company revised how it taxes the adjustments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders to adjusted operating income loss to align the tax rate used in the reconciliation to each segment s local jurisdictional tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2019 the company used a tax rate of 27 percent and 30 percent for its canada and australia mortgage insurance segments respectively to tax effect their adjustments its domestic segments remain at a 21 percent tax rate in 2018 the company assumed a flat 21 percent tax rate on adjustments for all of its segments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders and adjusted operating income loss these adjustments are also net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests and net investment gains losses are adjusted for dac and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves prior year amounts have not been re presented to reflect this revised presentation however the previous methodology would not have resulted in a materially different segment level adjusted operating income loss the company recorded a pre tax expense of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 related to restructuring costs as it continues to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses there were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from

accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting this press release includes the non gaap financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and its domestic businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent the company s tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pretax income loss of each segment which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between u s gaap and local tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of the company s revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force insurance in force for the company s mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date risk in force for the company s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance for risk in force in the mortgage insurance businesses in canada and australia the company has computed an effective risk in force amount which recognizes that the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor of 35 that represents the highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of the mortgage insurance businesses in canada and australia in australia the company has certain risk share arrangements where it provides pro rata coverage of certain loans rather than 100 coverage as a result for loans with these risk share arrangements the applicable pro rata coverage amount provided is used when applying the factor the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of the businesses these operating performance measures enable the company to compare its operating

alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thank you sergio and good morning to everyone thank you for attending this first quarter s results conference call well the quarter has been from the macro environment relatively challenging in this environment we ve been able to continue to grow the commercial dynamics with having changed in the quarter we continue to grow both in the number of customers being active being digital customers at the group base we re transforming this growth in customers into growth in the volumes of loans deposits and mutual funds we are growing in the 4 5 so overall i wouldn t say that the quarter shows a significant slowdown in the commercial activity of the bank and we were able to transform this into a result that in the statutory profit quarter we got eur1 840 million that is 10 below the same quarter last year mainly due to the extraordinary provisions resulted with it as a result of the restructuring we re doing mainly in poland and in uk in the quarter also we have some capital gains from prisma in argentina and capital losses due to the disposal of real estate in spain net net is eur108 million charge to the p l so the underlying profit was more in the line of close to eur1 550 million in the quarter so the results are affected mainly in the quarter by what i call here in the slide market environment it affects mainly cib business so the wholesale businesses as you ve seen inside the cib the market related business inside cib and the accounting impact that you very well known is the change in ifrs and the high inflation adjustment in argentina argentina last year as you remember in the first and second quarter they were producing in the region of eur60 million to eur70 million results this quarter came as a result of the high inflation accounting like eur10 million so we had a significant slow down there yeah in terms of profitability we continued to produce in the quarter a significantly higher return on tangible equity than our peers and the capital generation in the quarter was good we guide you for an average around the year around 10 basis points per quarter this quarter came double than this due to the fact that the risk weighted asset barely grew in the quarter as a result of this the core equity tier 1 at the end of the quarter was 11 25 after absorbing almost 30 basis points of regulatory effects that i will elaborate later on so we update you in our mid term view in our investor day at the beginning of this month so i have nothing to add to what do we say at the time and while we still face significant uncertainties in the short run mainly the lower for longer interest rates and brexit uncertainties being the main ones but not the only ones in the first quarter as i mentioned customers continue to grow in a good way we transformed this into higher volumes the customer revenue is growing at 4 and that we ve been affected in the quarter by the effects i already mentioned profitability basically is i ll call it slightly lighter lower but i would say underlying profitability is progressing well the solvency i mentioned and credit quality is still improving 40 basis point npl down and cost of credit below 100 basis points so i wouldn t say there is no news here so in relation with customers i mentioned that we continue to gain significant market share in some key markets particularly in brazil and mexico we are gaining share inaudible well in the states and you see in the numbers the volumes are going well and we are holding up basically the volumes more in continental europe where but consumer finance that is still growing and is growing above the market advertisement advertisement when it comes to the volumes i already mentioned we are growing 4 5 both loans and deposits you see on the loan side some deleverage is still going on in spain and portugal we are growing very much in line with the market in spain although we are reducing our booking mainly in cib and institutional lending where the book is falling for different reasons some of them related with more activity in capital markets some of them is because profitability by around double digit while in smes and consumer we are growing the book and this quarter the book was basically flat all the other markets as i mentioned we are growing well in the us brazil mexico according to our expectations remember that we told you in our investor day that we expect our latin american business to grow around in double digit territory in volumes the same cannot be applied to customer funds where we are growing across the aboard some recovery in the quarter in the asset management thus the four quarter last year was very bad in terms of assets under management due to market conditions we recovered somehow in the quarter also the fee income is not still filling through the p l just because it was recovery for the quarter you have here the numbers quarter on quarter the attributable profit i already mentioned the figures you have the comparison with the first quarter and the four quarter the comparisons you know that the several accounting effect particularly that is a negative in net interest income a positive in provisions you have here in the p l compared with the first quarter 2018 what we have is here customer revenue increase driven by net interest income and fee income costs are starting to reflect the synergies we re getting in europe particularly in spain portugal and it will come more from the uk also in the us that we anticipate to you several quarters ago after the regulatory drive we re going to see a better cost performance in the us and as a result of this the net operating income going up by 1 inaudible and profit before tax plus 3 taking into account the benign credit scenario i already mentioned lastly in the net the tax rate in the quarter was higher 36 compared with 34 7 a year ago and minority interest grew 16 mainly due to the strong performance of santander consumers us in the net capital gains and provision the number is a charge of eur108 million this comes from a positive capital gain on the sale of prisma the acquiring business in argentina that is eur150 million positive capital loss from the sale of properties is basically the anticipation of future commissions that we should pay for those properties with cerberus eur180 million and restructuring costs in poland and uk eur78 million so looking at the p l lines starting with the net interest income excluding the fx effect is 5 better due to higher volumes we rose in 7 out of the 10 markets it was lower in the first quarter for three reasons we have the tdrs in the us that we mentioned in the previous quarter that is fully compensated for lower loan loss provisions positive in nii is a negative in loan loss provision second ifrs 16 the impact is eur80 million and eliminating this impact net income will have risen by 1 on a like for like basis it s growing 1 quarter on quarter fee income was higher than the fourth quarter and year on year i will elaborate on this later on and other operating income while it was weak is pretty much related with the activity of cib and alco portfolios that were lower than it was the previous year going to the net interest income you have here the drivers overall growing 5 mature market growing 2 developing markets 8 you see volumes and nim we matched to get a higher net interest margin in mature markets increased 2 basis points customer nim and developing markets some margin compression that we were advising anticipating you mainly in some markets 26 basis points down those are the main components of the net interest income advertisement advertisement when it comes to fees i will say fee income 3 up reflecting and what i told you the number of customers greater loyalty greater customer loyalty both in individuals and companies and well you see the activity growth in mutual funds and particularly in cars and insurance premiums that are growing very nicely on the right side of the slide you have a deeper detail of what s going on with the fee income retail banking is growing 5 wealth management 1 and scib that the quarter was weaker as i anticipated by markets you have mature markets going down by 3 mainly affected by cib that where the activities are stronger in mature markets is the market making activities while developing markets are still growing in 9 so those are the components in costs while as i mentioned at the beginning we are seeing the costs as the result of integrations popular integration both on spain and portugal and the cost control in the us where the cost in all three markets the costs are going down also in the corporate center are going down nominal basis on real time basis compared with inflation costs are going down in the majority of the markets but poland due to the integration of deutsche bank operations mexico where you know we are in an investment plan that drives the cost up and argentina well you compare it with inflation is very high inflation and when you actualize salaries back with inflation some quarters come significantly up or down cost of credit quality inaudible cost of credit south of 100 basis points npl is continuing the right way and coverage ratio as usual stays very high capital the quarter was capital generation was good in the range of 20 basis points we absorbed 29 basis points due to the regulatory impact you have in the bottom which regulatory impacts were there the ifrs 16 was the most important one 19 basis points and you have another minus one including the trim that was 5 basis points organic capital generation 20 basis points is more changes in perimeter i mentioned prism in argentina the sale of the acquiring business and always that is pluses minuses mainly related with pension funds on the right side you have the other capital ratio the other relevant capital ratio the total capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio and all of them our numbers are good and well we already comply with mrel requirements as of the end of the quarter so the ratios tangible net asset value per share went up by 3 we reduced slightly the return on tangible equity the quarter was a bit quicker as i mentioned that the bottom line and the underlying rorwa suffered a little bit as a result of this advertisement advertisement so i ll hand over to jose that will elaborate on the different units of the different subsidiaries jose garcia cantera chief financial officer good morning everyone thank you jose antonio in the quarter we increased slightly the weighting of the americas relative to europe to 52 due to the higher weighting of brazil and the us in terms of underlying attributable profits seven out of our ten core markets had a positive evolution and we had double digit growth in the us brazil and mexico before i go into the different units i want to make some general comments that affect almost all of them on the one hand jose antonio already alluded to these weak market conditions which affected gains on financial transactions and fee income ifrs 16 that had a negative impact on net interest income of eur81 million in the quarter and compared to the fourth quarter we had two fewer days that meant eur190 million less net interest income somehow these issues disguise a better trends in the underlying business in the customer business that we have in the different countries advertisement advertisement starting with brazil good quarter again following the positive trends we saw in 2018 double digit growth in loans and funds with demand deposits and time deposits growing 11 and 15 respectively we continue to gain market share selectively in auto finance 8 basis points credit cards 103 basis points payroll based credit 144 basis points getnet 132 basis points so these are just examples of the market share gains that we are producing in brazil looking at year on year profits significant growth with return on tangible equity at 21 net interest income increased based on more volumes and fee income with basically raises in all lines costs very much under control growing lower than inflation and improving efficiency to record levels down a hundred basis points year on year lower loan loss provisions with cost of credit up 3 88 the lowest in many years and well below 4 which was our prediction a couple of years ago quarter on quarter higher profits basically on lower costs and reduced provisions net interest income fell due to the impact that i just mentioned ifrs 16 fewer days two fewer days on the other hand customer related net interest income increased in the quarter 1 and if we exclude the two fewer days the net interest income increased 3 quarter on quarter fee income was obviously as you know affected by the seasonally higher fee income that we had in the fourth quarter associated with the renewal of the insurance policies advertisement advertisement in spain we are progressing according to our plan in the integration of banco popular we have already integrated 600 branches which is more or less 40 of the total and the plan is to finish the integration in july underlying profit fell 11 year on year particularly affected this quarter by capital markets activity and alco portfolio management excluding these impacts profit would have grown mid single digits we had positive evolution of net interest income due to significant improvement as you can see in the cost of deposits and reduced fee income mainly due to weak wholesale businesses and mutual funds costs were down 6 if we exclude the higher costs in some activities on openbank cost in spain in the retail bank in spain were down 8 in the quarter showing the benefits of the integration with popular provisions were down cost of credit was 34 basis points in the quarter which is already a low level in terms of activity since december total customers are up 50 digital customers up 350 this is translated in more activity and a significant growth in deposits that increased eur6 billion in the quarter double digit growth in demand deposits that more than offset the fall in time deposits again more customers more operations and as some examples for instance we had new insurance premium contracts up 16 and point of sale turnover up 12 stock of loans remain unchanged over the fourth quarter fell 3 year on year mostly due as jose antonio said to the contract to the decline in the stock of mortgages and the deleveraging in wholesale banking and public institutions compared to the fourth quarter gross income was 3 higher and better conditions of the 123 accounts and the impact of the lower obviously we had a contribution to the deposit guarantee fund in the fourth quarter more than offset the lower accrual of interest fewer number of days as i said and the alco portfolio the negative impact of ifrs 16 so overall a good performance in net interest income when we look at the underlying customer trends costs were lower and provisions increased coming from a particularly low level in the fourth quarter looking ahead we see flat to slightly positive net interest income and as it will benefit from the change in the conditions of the 123 account while costs will continue to reflect the optimization measures carried out as the integration of banco popular progresses moving to santander consumer it continued to grow backed by commercial agreements and the increased sales through digital channels for example in march we signed an agreement with hyundai kia to acquire 51 of their financial arm in germany which will strengthen our leadership in the country new lending rose 2 despite that actually car sales in europe were down 3 and this is due to the fact that our brands are gaining market share all across europe first quarter profit was up 1 by lines gross income increased mainly due to higher net interest income higher volumes and slightly lower funding costs operating expenses were flat despite business growth the efficiency ratio improved by 119 basis points year on year advertisement advertisement loan loss provisions were stable despite the impact of higher portfolio sales in the first quarter of last year we had none this year cost of credit at 38 basis points is below the average through the cycle looking ahead we see our business growing faster than the market and cost of risk normalizing in the united kingdom our business was carried out against the backdrop of very strong competition particularly in mortgages and the uncertainty associated with brexit lending went up slightly year on year fueled by mortgages and other retail loans that we are up eur4 billion year on year we continued to reduce commercial real estate customer funds changed to more than demand deposits that continued to increase up 2 first quarter underlying profit was 16 lower year on year due to reduced gross income we had as i said pressure on mortgage margins and lower svr balances also lower fee income from corporate banking activities and reduced gains from financial transactions slightly increasing costs up 1 due to investments in technology and projects although in real terms costs were down 1 cost of credit remained at very low levels only 7 basis points in the quarter in addition we had a restructuring charge of eur 66 million associated with the closing of 140 branches and the renovation of another 100 branches the closure affecting 1200 employees looking ahead in terms of revenues we continue to see a strong competition therefore a strong pressure on net interest income particularly now that all interest rate hikes seem to have been pushed forward significantly costs however should be flat or down in real terms looking at other units i will go very briefly over the main of the ones although you have all the details in the appendix in mexico our strategic focus is threefold on the one hand transform our retail and commercial banking improve customer attention models and focus on digitalization all of this is reflected in greater customer attraction and retention and the launch of new businesses loyal customers year on year are up 28 digital customers are up 57 we had a stronger growth in lending especially large companies and payroll based lending growth in funds were driven by deposits of individuals and smes profit was 12 higher year on year underpinned by net interest income double digit growth due to volume and interest rates and the fall in provisions cost of credit which improved to the best level in the last six years in short greater loyalty and activity higher profits and profitability with a return on tangible equity of 20 we expect these trends to continue in the coming quarters advertisement advertisement in the us we had an excellent quarter with good evolution of both volumes with lending increasing at double digits as well as the main p l lines where attributable profit actually increased 35 year on year the good performance was driven by increase in gross income costs and provisions profit grew strongly quarter on quarter benefiting from seasonal factors remember that in the fourth quarter at santander consumer trends tend to be the weakest of the year with higher costs and higher provisions while those in the first quarter tend to be the lowest also remember that in the fourth quarter of last year we had a methodological change in the accrual of troubled debt restructuring tdrs with almost no impact on the bottom line but there was a top line impact of eur150 million in summary in the appendix you have all the details of the impact of these adjustment by line in summary positive evolution we expect will continue in the coming quarters with again seasonality in santander consumer with a stronger first half relative to the second half in chile the economy is growing at 3 is expected to grow 3 this year and next year and on the back half these loans are growing well growing at 8 and also improving the mix of customer funding all demand deposits time deposits mutual funds are also growing underlying attributable profit was up 1 very much affected by lower inflation in the quarter inflation was zero and because of the inflation adjusted products these had a negative impact of eur45 million already in april inflation was 0 3 and we had a gain of around eur20 million so this tends to be some volatility associated with this but again the underlying customer the trends in terms of customers and business are very positive and we would expect them to continue so in the coming quarters in portugal strong lending with clear gains in market shares in almost all products our new production market share is in the region of 20 for almost all the products the stock of loans dropped year on year due to portfolio sales last year more or less eur1 billion deposits are up 9 year on year profit s also up 7 year on year due to higher revenues lower costs reflecting the synergies of the integration of banco popular and provisions which were at slightly positive in the quarter s p upgraded the rating of our bank to bbb and it was chosen as the brand with the best reputation in portugal among the banks in portugal in poland the acquisition of deutsche bank poland has strengthened our competitive position in the country and we are now the second largest bank in the country the integration obviously explains the abnormally high year on year growth rates that you see in the p l and the balance sheet the very good business performance is not driven all the way down to the p l because of higher contribution to the banking tax which by the way it s not tax deductible and lastly we had a eur12 million restructuring charge in the quarter affecting the closure of 70 branches and more or less 1400 employees advertisement advertisement finally in argentina the business was very conditioned by the very high inflation 50 inflation 50 depreciation of the peso and almost 70 interest rates attributable profit was eur161 million including the capital gain from the sale of our stake in prisma excluding these the underlying profit was eur11 million there was an inflation adjustment of eur53 million the monetary adjustment was eur38 million and through currency adjustment eur15 million on the business side we see positive performance of customer revenues and positive cost control finally on the corporate center the underlying profit was hit by higher costs associated with foreign currency hedging and in the net interest income we also had higher costs higher financial costs or due to higher stock of issuances and the impact of ifrs 16 in terms of cost 1 lower here we had two forces in opposite directions on the one hand we had the simplification measures and the streamlining on the other hand the investments in global projects also ifrs 16 had a positive impact on costs lastly we include here a loss of eur118 million from the sale of a portfolio of real estate assets to cerberus capital management in the quarter and now i ll turn it back to jose antonio for his closing remarks thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thanks jose let me to finish this presentation yes summing up a little bit what the environment in the q1 well in this environment that was not great we increased our customer volume and customer base the underlying trends are solids year on year growth in customer revenue cost control and lower loan loss provisions the capital generation was good in the quarter as we mentioned before and tangible net asset value per share significantly increased 3 in the quarter so underlying rote return on tangible equity higher than our competitors affect by market weakness in the quarter in the very shorter view looking forward we see a deterioration in the macro scenario with lower growth expected in our markets probably we should expect on component growth of 1 5 gdp growth in this environment we re going to have mixed trend volumes probably growing keep growing around double digit in the americas and growing the customer base but not that much in volumes in europe we expect good cost control the synergies and efficiencies we announced in the investor day and the cost of credit remained relatively low levels and our aim is continue gain market sharing in our main markets and improve our profitability and strengthen our balance sheet let me to finish through elaborating the two operations we announced the same month the first one was the voluntary tender offer for the 25 of the shares of our subsidiary in mexico this is very much in line with the strategy we announced and it meets our financial criteria with a expected return on investment of 14 5 at the same time for santander minority shareholders this is an opportunity to monetize their shares and gain exposure to a global bank and diversified bank like santander we believe we do this offer because we believe in the financial sector in mexico and the potential growth going forward through a higher banca legislation and large numbers of customers in the country second operation we announced in the same month was we signed a memorandum of understanding with credit agricole for our custody and asset servicing businesses this operation is also consistent with our strategy the business are very complementary in a business where the scale matters a lot we get a better position in the combined entity to be facing competitor in this niche of the market in europe and the americas well this operation as we already communicate to you will produce at the closing an estimated capital gain of eur 700 million that we expect to record in extraordinary charges and provisions overall the line of extraordinary charges in provisions at the year and the quarter was minus eur108 million overall in the year will be basically zero positives and negative will offset each other this operation has also had a slightly positive impacting capital 3 basis points and the profit going forward expected profit going forward based on the business plan of the combined entity will mean a slightly increase in our eps finally just to remember you our main targets financial targets that we announced to you in the investor day i think the quarter in the underlying basis shows a that we are progressing toward our goals we are showing that the business is growing as we were expecting in america in the americas we are showing that our efficiency gains that we announced to you in europe and you see in the numbers in europe that we are starting to gather momentum there and the capital generation has been good in the quarter and we ve been able to offset the regulatory headwinds and this will transform as we are expecting higher profitability and translate in higher dividend and higher profitability for shareholders thank you and now we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have questions and answers sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks jose antonio indeed we have now time to open the q a so please operator we can proceed with the first question operator ladies and gentlemen the q a session starts now operator instructions the first question comes from jose abad from goldman sachs please go ahead jose maria abad hernandez goldman sachs group inc analyst hello good morning and thank you very much for the presentation two questions from my side the first one is was the impact from the regulatory equivalents with argentina really positive and also i mean a follow up question on this is whether actually the positive impact from this in case there is one is included in the 50 bps impact from management actions that you guided in in deed in your investor day the second question is on litigation there was an article in expansion i believe last week talking about the supreme court in brazil forcing santander to compensate workers from banespa from their bonuses back to actually in 1986 the article quantifies the potential impact of actually north of brl1 billion so i think it will be useful for us actually if you could actually clarify what s the potential impact from these and any litigation reserve that you may already have against these contingencies thank you very much jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thank you jose i will elaborate on the second question i pass the first one to the cfo that will elaborate on the equivalents in argentina that was approved as you know by the eu in april or in march jose garcia cantera chief financial officer in april jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer yeah so the article you referred the case you referred in the court in brazil well it s related as you know the litigation related with labor claims in brazil is pretty high as a matter of fact the provisioning we have in the balance sheet for labor claims is close to brl4 billion in the country and we appealed this ruling of the court and we think that we are well provide for the plenty of for the significant litigation labor claims that we have in brazil were well provided not only specifically for this one for the overall litigations claims that we have that is a very high number taking into account one by one jose garcia cantera chief financial officer specifically the article referred to brl1 billion so we re talking really eur150 million worst case scenario and again this is a process that will take quite a long time we don t expect this to be actually to finish at least within the next seven eight years and i didn t get the first question jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer the first question was about the equivalents in argentina clearing for the eu the european union argentina the regulatory equivalence how much of this impact our capital inaudible jose garcia cantera chief financial officer 6 basis points jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer 6 basis points yeah so this is new for those who are not familiar with this that as a matter of fact the significant reserve requirements in argentina and when we gather deposits we need to reserve with the central bank some of these deposits for regulatory reasons and those deposits had risk weighting when the local regulator is declared equivalent by the eu the risk weighting goes to zero and this is a reduction in risk weighted assets and translating what jose said 6 basis point of capital sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations next question please operator the next question comes from vanessa guy from jpmorgan please go ahead vanessa maria pilar guy vazquez jp morgan chase co analyst hi good morning my first question was on capital i was wondering if you could provide some guidance on what capital impacts you would expect over the next coming quarters for 2019 and my second question is regarding the us and how the chrysler agreement is progressing thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer so on capital we guide you in investor day 50 basis points yeah 50 basis points to 60 basis points we already had in the quarter 30s another 20 basis points to 30 basis points to come yeah so this is what this is going to come from what we expect to come from the regulatory headwinds including many items there yeah on the other side question related with chrysler fsa we are still holding with fsa what i will qualify as a constructive dialog in relation with the business we are operating for them in the us i cannot at this point tell you where this dialog will end but i will say at this point that inaudible comes through different we are looking for a solutions how to make the business how to have a better business for both helping them to sell more cars and having a sound and solid finance business going forward sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks vanessa next question please operator the next question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano saenz de tejada morgan stanley analyst good morning a question on capital and then on restructuring for me on capital you ve built 20 basis points in the quarter from organic generation can you maybe give us some color why it s higher than your usual 10 basis point run rate is it faster dta rundown or something that we could extrapolate and when we look forward you ve obviously done mexico the buyout you ve done the mou with casa can you maybe walk us through an updated list of some more efficiency and optimization we could look forward to so you ve talked in the past about uk model we ve got the 6 basis points that you just mentioned on argentina is can we look forward to further securitizations you ve got a stake in inaudible that presumably is a source of capital just some general color on that and the second on restructuring i was can you maybe give us a feel for the timing of the restructuring in spain and uk i think you mentioned spain for july the last headcount reduction but in the uk given the revenue trend it s very difficult for any substantial change in those revenue trends at least in the short term given the rate outlook if you could maybe this talk us through you mentioned costs flat versus inflation this year but can we look forward to further reductions and when those restructuring and those reductions might happen thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer okay going into the first question capital generation in the quarter 20 basis points compared with our guidance on average 10 basis points i will say i will stress the word average yeah on average we generated 10 basis points this quarter came better the reason is we are being more efficient in managing risk weighted assets at the same time we have much more demand in i mentioned in the when i was talking about spain we have much more demand in particularly in those exposures that well we think are below the cost of equity and for that reason we are heading at what we qualify in our investor day as a lighter capital model and this is the reflection of this you mentioned also mexico and the buyout in mexico and the agreement with the credit agricole that has more positives in capital well but i will not the capital management as you can imagine became a priority for the group several years ago with the higher capital requirements and we are refining all the capital models with a internal big project that is called that is managed by the cfo office we are improving significantly the tools to match capital across the group and some of this is going to be reflected in the numbers going forward so being more efficient on one side inducing the capital in new operations on the other side being having margin developments in a way that provides a higher return the second question was restructuring spain you mentioned the spain uk timing of course i ll talk about the timing in spain we called the unions i think it was yesterday to have the first meeting in a week next monday i think to start the negotiation process with the unions well it s very difficult to say when the process is going to finish on the other side the integration process the branch integration process that jose also mentioned we already integrated 600 branches out of 1 600 we expect to finish the 1 600 branches integration at the end of july more or less and after that we start the reduction of number of branches provided that we reach an agreement with the unions that we re going to have the discussion in the same time so in our mind it has been to finish the process this year in spain you mentioned uk uk we guide you to a strict cost control and at the same time in the investor day we guide you to a return on tangible equity in a tougher revenue environment higher than the current one this mainly will be done through the cost still that we plan to grow some businesses in the uk we are growing cib and the related business but we are suffering and we are betting on a tough environment for the mortgage business that is the one who is more affected at this stage and we expect to have to be able to show a better cost control not only better cost control probably some reduction in cost going forward is something that expect to get sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks alvaro next question please operator your next question comes from carlos cobo from societe generale please go ahead carlos cobo societe generale analyst hello thank you very much for the presentation and a couple of questions from my side in the uk as a quick follow up not only that you ve seen some cost inflation nii is weak fees are not particularly strong i was wondering whether you are considering more actively the potential cut in the 123 account as you did in spain as a way to compensate the profitability challenges in the uk second in spain cost of risk was just slightly higher than the run rate last year i was wondering if you could provide some color here outlook for the whole year and whether there is any exceptional or some seasonality that you tend to charge higher provisions in the first q thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer you mentioned the uk we re going to take i will say we are managing the business and we re going to take measure both on the business front and in the cost front in the business front you mentioned the 123 account we don t have a specific decision for this specific account at this stage but it is sure that we should look for a new sources of revenue and at the same time that we reduce the cost that this is the plan going forward in the uk the cost of risk in spain i will expect the cost of risk in spain to remain nothing new the quarter was a small spike but i will expect to be in the region of 30 basis points in the 30s yeah for the year nothing new here in this front sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks carlos next question please operator your next question comes from ignacio ulargui from deutsche bank please go ahead ignacio ulargui deutsche bank ag analyst hi good morning just have two questions one on the brazilian nii if you could update us on the trends that we should see you have been guiding for a high single digit supported by loan growth what are the recent downgrades that we have seen in gdp may affect a bit lending demand and how do you see that the second question on the competitive landscape in spain particularly on the mortgage market and the implication of the new mortgage loan how do you see that should impact margins going forward thanks jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer well nii in brazil in the quarter as you know came down this is more due to the non customer related activities last year interest rates of the previous year in 2017 interest rate came down sharply as a result of this in 2018 we ve got significant revenue on this on the customer front i remain we ve been guiding due for double digit kind of growth in the country and we ve been guiding you for a lower growth in nii so mid maybe to high mid to high or mid single digit in brazil so some margin compression we expecting in brazil when you refer to spain as you said rightly the market remains fairly competitive not only in mortgages i will say all across the board it s true that we managed this quarter to increase our net interest margin on customers you saw it through a reduction in the funding costs at the same time a slight increase in the deal we are getting from our assets so we are happy with this you specifically referred to mortgages mortgages remains fairly competitive i haven t seen a extra reduction in prices from the one we had one quarter or two quarters ago remains competitive but it is true that we managed to get a higher yield due to the fact that in the quarter we remained flat on the loan book but grew sme lending and grew in consumer lending that reflects into higher yield in the loan book at the same time we reduced the funding costs as i said mortgages i will say the market remains competitive i don t expect a big the figure to remain where it is at this stage sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks ignacio next question please operator the next question comes from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri mediobanca analyst yes good morning two questions one on capital and one on hedging on capital there have been changes to crd rules i m talking to crd v and specifically to the sme support factor and to the possibility to exclude from intangible deductions some software components could you give us your indicative impacts for next year and can you also clarify on the regulatory headwinds i was left at 50 basis points and then before maybe you said 50 basis points to 60 basis points and finally the trim impact when you guided the 50 basis points is it all in 2019 or there is still a part in 2020 regarding the low default portfolio on the hedging could you update us on your hedging strategy and how you re adjusting to a more dynamic use of this tool what was the p l cost and the capital impact in q1 thank you jose garcia cantera chief financial officer okay so hedging the strategy remains the same so we hedge the capital ratio so that is why despite the risk weighted assets due to currency depreciation went up eur8 billion in the quarter there was no impact on the capital ratio the cost of that strategy in the first quarter is more or less 4 basis points of capital we also hedge the p l let s say on an opportunistic basis based on the outlook that we have and the risks that we see in the different countries right now we have fully hedged the pound and the mexican peso and 75 hedged the expected results that we have in brazil the cost of that in the first quarter was eur60 million on the other hand obviously you have the positive of the translation of the results in local currencies into euros all throughout the p l jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer on the numbers you asked about capital depicted 50 basis points regulatory headwinds is for this year is for 2019 we already absorbed as i said before 29 basis points so we expect the rest to come along the year when you were referring to the crd v eventually impacting changing in sme support factor and intangibles as you know we have a significant exposure to smes mainly after this decision of popular although a significant portion of the smes around the world are in a standard model yes so we have the smes in the corporate business in uk us and latin america and still standard model we have our own internal rate based model for spain so but we have significant exposure there and changes in the support factor effects us accordingly in intangibles you mentioned this well intangibles there is a door open there to have a discussion of what the intangibles we ve been very vocal on this because we think that in this at this particular juncture where we are investing significantly in digitalization so what means basically investing in software there is an inaudible treatment when you invest yourself and inaudible when you buy from someone else when you invest yourself its intangibles and you did that 100 from capital when you buy from someone else the treatment is totally different we ve been as you know our software we control our software and we continue to invest significantly in our software this will be a significant deal for us it s very difficult to say at this stage because software there are different type of software for how long the software remains being useful for the bank is probably too early to call but we have intangibles if i remember well is eur2 8 billion or something like that in the balance sheet how much this may be affected i have no idea at this stage that is too early sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks andrea next question please operator the next question comes from mario ropero from fidentiis please go ahead mario ropero fidentiis analyst fee income trends in spain which has been very negative quarter after quarter for a while presumably due to corporate and investment banking so i was wondering if you can give us an indication on the weight of this business in the fee income line and when do you expect this line to bottom out and then on the npl ratio in spain i noticed that it has remained flat since mid 2018 so please if you could comment and clarify what s going on here thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer fee income in spain as you rightly mentioned went down by 3 is explained basically for cib activities if i look for the whole year i will expect some growth in this slightly positive some growth in fee income assuming that the cib business behaves in a normal way i will say having the same activity than last year the other question was about npls jose garcia cantera chief financial officer npls in spain jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer well npl well we re still in the credit quality in spain for it has good trends i don t remember exactly the npl number it is flat probably you re right but i don t have in my mind any significant probably in the reduction of both non performing assets i mean both loans and properties we are progressing a good pace in the reduction of this and also the provision of this we feel comfortable with the level of provisions we have already for all of these as provisions sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks mario next one please operator the next question comes from daragh quinn from kbw please go ahead daragh quinn kbw analyst hi good morning a question on spain just with a view on the new incoming government we saw the socialist party campaign on the idea of a minimum effect of corporate tax rates in spain and i m just wondering if you see any risk to the amount of taxes you pay out of the legal entity in spain and then a second question on asset quality and provisions in the uk and the european consumer finance business you ve indicated before that you expect to see a normalization of credit charges there i was wondering if you could just update us again on a the time that it ll take for those provisions to normalize and at what level do you expect them to normalize thanks jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer so in spain well it s too early to say yeah so the tax rate in the spain well it s too early to say naturally it was inaudible for the legal entity in the spain to the corporate tax in the spain and as you know our corporate tax is already higher than the other sector well i m not going to speculate on higher or lower tax rate at this stage in asset quality provisions you mentioned in uk consumer finance yes so we told you in the investor day that we are having a cost of risk lower than the expected loss across the cycle the distance in the consumer finance we have been having around 40 basis points 40 basis points or even lower and the expected loss is basically double than this we are not seeing any sign of deterioration in the credit quality and probably for this year if i need to bet probably will remain closer to the 40s than to any other number but well we have always in mind that if our models are right at some point it should normalize your question is when probably to seek when we need to look at the unemployment numbers yeah the unemployment number is the main factor that drives the cost of credit cost of risk in our consumer business not only in europe also in us inaudible and with the uk we gave you the figures our basic book in the uk it s mortgages is 80 of book yeah so the remaining 20 is a mix between corporate and some consumer lending a small fraction as do our loan to value is one of the lowest in the market and our front book will be much more conservative than some of our peers there and on our buy to let exposure is low well when you have a cost of risk that is south of 10 basis points well inaudible jose garcia cantera chief financial officer obviously the one way to go jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer yes it s only one way to go that is up when well again inaudible retail business our exposure is with households and the main driver as in consumer finance tend to be unemployment yeah so we have not seen any sign of deterioration of unemployment rates all across europe including uk sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks daragh next question please operator the next question comes from your next question comes from britta schimdt of autonomous research please go ahead britta schimdt autonomous research analyst yeah hi there i ve got two questions please in brazil one of the competitors on the credit card merchant acquiring business has changed pricing on selected credit card transactions and i was interested to get your opinion on whether you think that will have any impact on getnet or the merchant acquiring fees in brazil and secondly could you let us know what the ifrs 16 impact was on costs i might have missed that and can you confirm that this likely cost reduction was already part of the business as usual costs being flat that you ve given at the investor day jose garcia cantera chief financial officer so if you want i ll take the second and let me give you the throughout the p l ifrs 16 in the first quarter had as i said a negative impact on net interest income of eur81 million and costs were reduced by eur59 million so net bottom line net impact was negative eur22 million and when we look at cost trends obviously this is a one off so obviously this will affect the year on year comparison this year but obviously we consider this as a one off jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer in relation with brazil competition in acquiring business well new competitors came to the market this is a market that was a market basically where two competitors five six years ago we came along with our proposal in getnet we went from very low market share or almost no market share to close to 15 market share and the last two or three years with newcomers into the market newcomers with a strong proposition particularly for e commerce related and the small tickets and the market is becoming much more competitive but you know the fees in this market were significant there were three sources of revenues in the market the interchange fee the flow business that was significant because the payment date was like 20 plus b plus 20 so the business was significant in this front the income generation from the front and finally rent of the gadgets that the merchants use for this purpose the competition is coming in the i will say in the three fronts our business is i think is much resilient than others because our business is not just a acquiring business it is a business that we bundled the acquiring business with banking services some lending embedded there and a package mainly to the small merchants in the market so we were expecting somehow this competition to come sooner or later it s coming now and we expect to keep gaining market share and approaching us over time to a market share closer to 20 that was our original aspiration when we started this business six years ago seven years ago and we ve got from 1 2 to 13 14 close to 15 and we expect to keep going up in our market share in a more competitive market and with lower unitary fee income but higher volumes don t forget the volumes the volumes that we ve been gaining market share growing well in double digit close to 20 year after year in the previous year we were even growing at 30 we expect to keep growing significantly in this business sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks britta next question please operator the next question comes from inaudible from barclays please go ahead unidentified speaker barclays analyst hello thank you for taking my question my question is regarding the us and the cost i see that the cost of santander bank is still up on a cost income ratio at 77 more or less i wonder what further actions you have in mind in order to come this figure down thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer so performance in cost is i ll do the performance in costs only in the last quarter the last couple of quarters has been good in the us still you re right our cost income compared with our peers sbna compared with our peers in the market is still very high and we re working on this in two different fronts yeah so one front is getting more internal synergies in the that means that as you remember we are managing the us as a separate business one side private bank and another side consumer finance and other side sbna and another side cib and in the new york branch and the broker dealer when the holding company came along on the regulatory pressure we build we are still in the process of building the holding operations in the us and we are in a project that is what they internally call one santander that means exactly one operation in the us where we can extract synergies from the operation having said that and you should expect a good cost control volume forward in the us this is just one part of the business on the revenue side when we compare ourselves with our peer our revenues are weaker in this regard we are progressing well and we are starting to show significant progress not only in consumer business but inaudible in sbna we are showing some progress in cib business where our revenues are growing starting from very low levels close to 20 our c i business is showing significant progress the multi family inaudible business that we have basically in new york is showing significant progress and still we have more things to do in the retail arena with the households and individual customers so on one side and we mentioned in the investor day that one of the key elements for improving our profitability in us was the operating leverage we have a high cost income as you rightly mentioned and we expect to keep this well under control or even in some cases going down and at the same time being able to improve with infrastructure we have the revenue lines in the segments i mentioned to you and with these two elements we expect to reduce significantly our cost income and improve our profitability in the us in sbna in particular sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations ph fernando last question please operator the last question comes from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto caixabank bpi analyst hello good morning hey thank you for taking my call my question will be on the corporate center i was wondering if you could shed some light on the evolution of the funding costs at the corporate center which went up 14 quarter on quarter if i m not mistaken 27 year on year that would be well yeah that would be my only pending question thank you jose garcia cantera chief financial officer i think there s nothing there we ve had more issuance along the way compared with the first quarter of last year particularly to comply with mrel requirement as jose antonio said we already fully comply with the requirements of the srb there is nothing special there and also the cost of the hedging which are included as part of the cost of the corporate center which i mentioned were eur60 million in the quarter sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations so thanks very much everyone for joining and obviously the ir team is at your disposal for any follow up thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thank

financial measures entitled adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share adjusted operating income loss per share is derived from adjusted operating income loss the chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income loss the company defines adjusted operating income loss as income loss from continuing operations excluding the after tax effects of income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net investment gains losses goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt gains losses on insurance block transactions restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non operating items gains losses on insurance block transactions are defined as gains losses on the early extinguishment of non recourse funding obligations early termination fees for other financing restructuring and or resulting gains losses on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business the company excludes net investment gains losses and infrequent or unusual non operating items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the company s segments and corporate and other activities a component of the company s net investment gains losses is the result of impairments the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles in addition the size and timing of other investment gains losses can be subject to the company s discretion and are influenced by market opportunities as well as asset liability matching considerations goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt gains losses on insurance block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss because in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends infrequent or unusual non operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss if in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends while some of these items may be significant components of net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders in accordance with u s gaap the company believes that adjusted operating income loss and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income loss including adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income loss attributable to the ongoing operations of the business management also uses adjusted operating income loss as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts however the items excluded from adjusted operating income loss have occurred in the past and could and in some cases will recur in the future adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders or net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of adjusted operating income loss may differ from the definitions used by other companies in the first quarter of 2019 the company revised how it taxes the adjustments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders to adjusted operating income loss to align the tax rate used in the reconciliation to each segment s local jurisdictional tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2019 the company used a tax rate of 27 percent and 30 percent for its canada and australia mortgage insurance segments respectively to tax effect their adjustments its domestic segments remain at a 21 percent tax rate in 2018 the company assumed a flat 21 percent tax rate on adjustments for all of its segments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders and adjusted operating income loss these adjustments are also net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests and net investment gains losses are adjusted for dac and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves prior year amounts have not been re presented to reflect this revised presentation however the previous methodology would not have resulted in a materially different segment level adjusted operating income loss the company recorded a pre tax expense of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 related to restructuring costs as it continues to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses there were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from adjusted operating income loss during the periods presented other than fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to genworth holdings inc s bond consent solicitation of 6 million for broker advisor and investment banking fees the tables at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders to adjusted operating income loss for the three months ended march 31 2019 and march 31 2018 as well as for the three months ended december 31 2018 and reflect adjusted operating income loss as determined in accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting this press release includes the non gaap financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and its domestic businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent the company s tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pretax income loss of each segment which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between u s gaap and local tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of the company s revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force insurance in force for the company s mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date risk in force for the company s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance for risk in force in the mortgage insurance businesses in canada and australia the company has computed an effective risk in force amount which recognizes that the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor of 35 that represents the highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of the mortgage insurance businesses in canada and australia in australia the company has certain risk share arrangements where it provides pro rata coverage of certain loans rather than 100 coverage as a result for loans with these risk share arrangements the applicable pro rata coverage amount provided is used when applying the factor the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of the businesses these operating performance measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources cautionary note regarding forward

solid us growth and muted inflation boosts us dollar and wall street but other majors sag as disappointing chinese pmis revive growth fears fed to start two day monetary policy meeting unlikely to alter stance dollar eases from 22 month high but remains supported ahead of fomc meeting the us currency was outperforming its peers early on tuesday as there was further evidence on monday that growth in the world s largest economy is picking up speed personal consumption in the us rose at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years in march while the fed s preferred inflation gauge the core pce price index unexpectedly slipped to 1 6 year on year the lowest in 14 months the data reinforced the view that the federal reserve will keep interest rates on hold on wednesday when it concludes a two day meeting that starts today the fed has little reason to tighten policy when underlying inflation is weakening even as growth is rebounding from a short lived soft patch in comparison pmi figures released in china earlier today raised fresh concerns about the growth outlook outside of the united states both the official and caixin markit manufacturing pmis missed expectations in april easing slightly from the prior month the relative strength of the us economy drove the greenback higher against its peers with the dollar index edging higher to 97 86 not far from last week s 26 month top however against the japanese currency the dollar was slightly lower at 111 38 as the safe haven yen was lifted from the risk off mood triggered by the chinese pmis aussie dips after china pmis as risk sentiment sours the australian dollar took a knock from the soft manufacturing numbers out of china as risk appetite deteriorated with investors shrugging off yesterday s strong performance on wall street both the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite closed at an all time high following the us data and a raft of upbeat earnings results however it was a more subdued picture in asia and europe where concrete signs of a turnaround have yet to be seen the risk sensitive aussie was down about 0 2 at 0 7040 heading back towards last week s near 4 month lows the yen was broadly firmer even with japanese markets closed for the entire week to celebrate the enthronement of a new emperor the negative market mood wasn t enough to dent commodity prices however as both oil and gold turned higher wti oil attempted to recover from the 3 week lows touched last week when it slumped on reports that us president trump had again asked opec to lower prices gold also moved higher after coming under pressure yesterday from the strong us data euro flat ahead of eurozone gdp figures the focus in the european trading will be first quarter gdp numbers out of the eurozone the euro area is projected to have expanded by 0 3 quarter on quarter in the first three months of the year but many market participants are more pessimistic so if growth does come in line with expectations than the euro could enjoy a bit of a boost the single currency was last trading flat on the day at around 1 1180 the pound was also little changed at around 1 2940 there was only limited reaction in forex markets to several reports in the past 24 hours that progress is being made in the talks between the uk government and the opposition labour party to find a solution to the brexit impasse as traders maintained caution also coming up later today is the canadian monthly gdp estimate for february the canadian dollar has been on the backfoot following last week s dovish bank of canada meeting and friday s slide in oil prices today s gdp data may provide the loonie some support if it does not disappoint but a better than expected figure may fail to generate much of a rally
san earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 banco santander s a san 0 81 q1 2019 earnings call 4 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations good morning everyone and thanks for joining the 2019 earnings presentation as every three months our group ceo mr jose antonio will address in detail the group performance followed by our group chief financial officer mr jose cantera who will address as well in detail the different business areas performance for the first quarter and our ceo will take again the floor for concluding remarks as always we ll have plenty of time to take your questions so now with no further delays jose antonio please jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thank you sergio and good morning to everyone thank you for attending this first quarter s results conference call well the quarter has been from the macro environment relatively challenging in this environment we ve been able to continue to grow the commercial dynamics with having changed in the quarter we continue to grow both in the number of customers being active being digital customers at the group base we re transforming this growth in customers into growth in the volumes of loans deposits and mutual funds we are growing in the 4 5 so overall i wouldn t say that the quarter shows a significant slowdown in the commercial activity of the bank and we were able to transform this into a result that in the statutory profit quarter we got eur1 840 million that is 10 below the same quarter last year mainly due to the extraordinary provisions resulted with it as a result of the restructuring we re doing mainly in poland and in uk in the quarter also we have some capital gains from prisma in argentina and capital losses due to the disposal of real estate in spain net net is eur108 million charge to the p l so the underlying profit was more in the line of close to eur1 550 million in the quarter so the results are affected mainly in the quarter by what i call here in the slide market environment it affects mainly cib business so the wholesale businesses as you ve seen inside the cib the market related business inside cib and the accounting impact that you very well known is the change in ifrs and the high inflation adjustment in argentina argentina last year as you remember in the first and second quarter they were producing in the region of eur60 million to eur70 million results this quarter came as a result of the high inflation accounting like eur10 million so we had a significant slow down there yeah in terms of profitability we continued to produce in the quarter a significantly higher return on tangible equity than our peers and the capital generation in the quarter was good we guide you for an average around the year around 10 basis points per quarter this quarter came double than this due to the fact that the risk weighted asset barely grew in the quarter as a result of this the core equity tier 1 at the end of the quarter was 11 25 after absorbing almost 30 basis points of regulatory effects that i will elaborate later on so we update you in our mid term view in our investor day at the beginning of this month so i have nothing to add to what do we say at the time and while we still face significant uncertainties in the short run mainly the lower for longer interest rates and brexit uncertainties being the main ones but not the only ones in the first quarter as i mentioned customers continue to grow in a good way we transformed this into higher volumes the customer revenue is growing at 4 and that we ve been affected in the quarter by the effects i already mentioned profitability basically is i ll call it slightly lighter lower but i would say underlying profitability is progressing well the solvency i mentioned and credit quality is still improving 40 basis point npl down and cost of credit below 100 basis points so i wouldn t say there is no news here so in relation with customers i mentioned that we continue to gain significant market share in some key markets particularly in brazil and mexico we are gaining share inaudible well in the states and you see in the numbers the volumes are going well and we are holding up basically the volumes more in continental europe where but consumer finance that is still growing and is growing above the market when it comes to the volumes i already mentioned we are growing 4 5 both loans and deposits you see on the loan side some deleverage is still going on in spain and portugal we are growing very much in line with the market in spain although we are reducing our booking mainly in cib and institutional lending where the book is falling for different reasons some of them related with more activity in capital markets some of them is because profitability by around double digit while in smes and consumer we are growing the book and this quarter the book was basically flat all the other markets as i mentioned we are growing well in the us brazil mexico according to our expectations remember that we told you in our investor day that we expect our latin american business to grow around in double digit territory in volumes the same cannot be applied to customer funds where we are growing across the aboard some recovery in the quarter in the asset management thus the four quarter last year was very bad in terms of assets under management due to market conditions we recovered somehow in the quarter also the fee income is not still filling through the p l just because it was recovery for the quarter you have here the numbers quarter on quarter the attributable profit i already mentioned the figures you have the comparison with the first quarter and the four quarter the comparisons you know that the several accounting effect particularly that is a negative in net interest income a positive in provisions you have here in the p l compared with the first quarter 2018 what we have is here customer revenue increase driven by net interest income and fee income costs are starting to reflect the synergies we re getting in europe particularly in spain portugal and it will come more from the uk also in the us that we anticipate to you several quarters ago after the regulatory drive we re going to see a better cost performance in the us and as a result of this the net operating income going up by 1 inaudible and profit before tax plus 3 taking into account the benign credit scenario i already mentioned lastly in the net the tax rate in the quarter was higher 36 compared with 34 7 a year ago and minority interest grew 16 mainly due to the strong performance of santander consumers us in the net capital gains and provision the number is a charge of eur108 million this comes from a positive capital gain on the sale of prisma the acquiring business in argentina that is eur150 million positive capital loss from the sale of properties is basically the anticipation of future commissions that we should pay for those properties with cerberus eur180 million and restructuring costs in poland and uk eur78 million so looking at the p l lines starting with the net interest income excluding the fx effect is 5 better due to higher volumes we rose in 7 out of the 10 markets it was lower in the first quarter for three reasons we have the tdrs in the us that we mentioned in the previous quarter that is fully compensated for lower loan loss provisions positive in nii is a negative in loan loss provision second ifrs 16 the impact is eur80 million and eliminating this impact net income will have risen by 1 on a like for like basis it s growing 1 quarter on quarter fee income was higher than the fourth quarter and year on year i will elaborate on this later on and other operating income while it was weak is pretty much related with the activity of cib and alco portfolios that were lower than it was the previous year going to the net interest income you have here the drivers overall growing 5 mature market growing 2 developing markets 8 you see volumes and nim we matched to get a higher net interest margin in mature markets increased 2 basis points customer nim and developing markets some margin compression that we were advising anticipating you mainly in some markets 26 basis points down those are the main components of the net interest income when it comes to fees i will say fee income 3 up reflecting and what i told you the number of customers greater loyalty greater customer loyalty both in individuals and companies and well you see the activity growth in mutual funds and particularly in cars and insurance premiums that are growing very nicely on the right side of the slide you have a deeper detail of what s going on with the fee income retail banking is growing 5 wealth management 1 and scib that the quarter was weaker as i anticipated by markets you have mature markets going down by 3 mainly affected by cib that where the activities are stronger in mature markets is the market making activities while developing markets are still growing in 9 so those are the components in costs while as i mentioned at the beginning we are seeing the costs as the result of integrations popular integration both on spain and portugal and the cost control in the us where the cost in all three markets the costs are going down also in the corporate center are going down nominal basis on real time basis compared with inflation costs are going down in the majority of the markets but poland due to the integration of deutsche bank operations mexico where you know we are in an investment plan that drives the cost up and argentina well you compare it with inflation is very high inflation and when you actualize salaries back with inflation some quarters come significantly up or down cost of credit quality inaudible cost of credit south of 100 basis points npl is continuing the right way and coverage ratio as usual stays very high capital the quarter was capital generation was good in the range of 20 basis points we absorbed 29 basis points due to the regulatory impact you have in the bottom which regulatory impacts were there the ifrs 16 was the most important one 19 basis points and you have another minus one including the trim that was 5 basis points organic capital generation 20 basis points is more changes in perimeter i mentioned prism in argentina the sale of the acquiring business and always that is pluses minuses mainly related with pension funds on the right side you have the other capital ratio the other relevant capital ratio the total capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio and all of them our numbers are good and well we already comply with mrel requirements as of the end of the quarter so the ratios tangible net asset value per share went up by 3 we reduced slightly the return on tangible equity the quarter was a bit quicker as i mentioned that the bottom line and the underlying rorwa suffered a little bit as a result of this so i ll hand over to jose that will elaborate on the different units of the different subsidiaries jose garcia cantera chief financial officer good morning everyone thank you jose antonio in the quarter we increased slightly the weighting of the americas relative to europe to 52 due to the higher weighting of brazil and the us in terms of underlying attributable profits seven out of our ten core markets had a positive evolution and we had double digit growth in the us brazil and mexico before i go into the different units i want to make some general comments that affect almost all of them on the one hand jose antonio already alluded to these weak market conditions which affected gains on financial transactions and fee income ifrs 16 that had a negative impact on net interest income of eur81 million in the quarter and compared to the fourth quarter we had two fewer days that meant eur190 million less net interest income somehow these issues disguise a better trends in the underlying business in the customer business that we have in the different countries starting with brazil good quarter again following the positive trends we saw in 2018 double digit growth in loans and funds with demand deposits and time deposits growing 11 and 15 respectively we continue to gain market share selectively in auto finance 8 basis points credit cards 103 basis points payroll based credit 144 basis points getnet 132 basis points so these are just examples of the market share gains that we are producing in brazil looking at year on year profits significant growth with return on tangible equity at 21 net interest income increased based on more volumes and fee income with basically raises in all lines costs very much under control growing lower than inflation and improving efficiency to record levels down a hundred basis points year on year lower loan loss provisions with cost of credit up 3 88 the lowest in many years and well below 4 which was our prediction a couple of years ago quarter on quarter higher profits basically on lower costs and reduced provisions net interest income fell due to the impact that i just mentioned ifrs 16 fewer days two fewer days on the other hand customer related net interest income increased in the quarter 1 and if we exclude the two fewer days the net interest income increased 3 quarter on quarter fee income was obviously as you know affected by the seasonally higher fee income that we had in the fourth quarter associated with the renewal of the insurance policies in spain we are progressing according to our plan in the integration of banco popular we have already integrated 600 branches which is more or less 40 of the total and the plan is to finish the integration in july underlying profit fell 11 year on year particularly affected this quarter by capital markets activity and alco portfolio management excluding these impacts profit would have grown mid single digits we had positive evolution of net interest income due to significant improvement as you can see in the cost of deposits and reduced fee income mainly due to weak wholesale businesses and mutual funds costs were down 6 if we exclude the higher costs in some activities on openbank cost in spain in the retail bank in spain were down 8 in the quarter showing the benefits of the integration with popular provisions were down cost of credit was 34 basis points in the quarter which is already a low level in terms of activity since december total customers are up 50 digital customers up 350 this is translated in more activity and a significant growth in deposits that increased eur6 billion in the quarter double digit growth in demand deposits that more than offset the fall in time deposits again more customers more operations and as some examples for instance we had new insurance premium contracts up 16 and point of sale turnover up 12 stock of loans remain unchanged over the fourth quarter fell 3 year on year mostly due as jose antonio said to the contract to the decline in the stock of mortgages and the deleveraging in wholesale banking and public institutions compared to the fourth quarter gross income was 3 higher and better conditions of the 123 accounts and the impact of the lower obviously we had a contribution to the deposit guarantee fund in the fourth quarter more than offset the lower accrual of interest fewer number of days as i said and the alco portfolio the negative impact of ifrs 16 so overall a good performance in net interest income when we look at the underlying customer trends costs were lower and provisions increased coming from a particularly low level in the fourth quarter looking ahead we see flat to slightly positive net interest income and as it will benefit from the change in the conditions of the 123 account while costs will continue to reflect the optimization measures carried out as the integration of banco popular progresses moving to santander consumer it continued to grow backed by commercial agreements and the increased sales through digital channels for example in march we signed an agreement with hyundai kia to acquire 51 of their financial arm in germany which will strengthen our leadership in the country new lending rose 2 despite that actually car sales in europe were down 3 and this is due to the fact that our brands are gaining market share all across europe first quarter profit was up 1 by lines gross income increased mainly due to higher net interest income higher volumes and slightly lower funding costs operating expenses were flat despite business growth the efficiency ratio improved by 119 basis points year on year loan loss provisions were stable despite the impact of higher portfolio sales in the first quarter of last year we had none this year cost of credit at 38 basis points is below the average through the cycle looking ahead we see our business growing faster than the market and cost of risk normalizing in the united kingdom our business was carried out against the backdrop of very strong competition particularly in mortgages and the uncertainty associated with brexit lending went up slightly year on year fueled by mortgages and other retail loans that we are up eur4 billion year on year we continued to reduce commercial real estate customer funds changed to more than demand deposits that continued to increase up 2 first quarter underlying profit was 16 lower year on year due to reduced gross income we had as i said pressure on mortgage margins and lower svr balances also lower fee income from corporate banking activities and reduced gains from financial transactions slightly increasing costs up 1 due to investments in technology and projects although in real terms costs were down 1 cost of credit remained at very low levels only 7 basis points in the quarter in addition we had a restructuring charge of eur 66 million associated with the closing of 140 branches and the renovation of another 100 branches the closure affecting 1200 employees looking ahead in terms of revenues we continue to see a strong competition therefore a strong pressure on net interest income particularly now that all interest rate hikes seem to have been pushed forward significantly costs however should be flat or down in real terms looking at other units i will go very briefly over the main of the ones although you have all the details in the appendix in mexico our strategic focus is threefold on the one hand transform our retail and commercial banking improve customer attention models and focus on digitalization all of this is reflected in greater customer attraction and retention and the launch of new businesses loyal customers year on year are up 28 digital customers are up 57 we had a stronger growth in lending especially large companies and payroll based lending growth in funds were driven by deposits of individuals and smes profit was 12 higher year on year underpinned by net interest income double digit growth due to volume and interest rates and the fall in provisions cost of credit which improved to the best level in the last six years in short greater loyalty and activity higher profits and profitability with a return on tangible equity of 20 we expect these trends to continue in the coming quarters in the us we had an excellent quarter with good evolution of both volumes with lending increasing at double digits as well as the main p l lines where attributable profit actually increased 35 year on year the good performance was driven by increase in gross income costs and provisions profit grew strongly quarter on quarter benefiting from seasonal factors remember that in the fourth quarter at santander consumer trends tend to be the weakest of the year with higher costs and higher provisions while those in the first quarter tend to be the lowest also remember that in the fourth quarter of last year we had a methodological change in the accrual of troubled debt restructuring tdrs with almost no impact on the bottom line but there was a top line impact of eur150 million in summary in the appendix you have all the details of the impact of these adjustment by line in summary positive evolution we expect will continue in the coming quarters with again seasonality in santander consumer with a stronger first half relative to the second half in chile the economy is growing at 3 is expected to grow 3 this year and next year and on the back half these loans are growing well growing at 8 and also improving the mix of customer funding all demand deposits time deposits mutual funds are also growing underlying attributable profit was up 1 very much affected by lower inflation in the quarter inflation was zero and because of the inflation adjusted products these had a negative impact of eur45 million already in april inflation was 0 3 and we had a gain of around eur20 million so this tends to be some volatility associated with this but again the underlying customer the trends in terms of customers and business are very positive and we would expect them to continue so in the coming quarters in portugal strong lending with clear gains in market shares in almost all products our new production market share is in the region of 20 for almost all the products the stock of loans dropped year on year due to portfolio sales last year more or less eur1 billion deposits are up 9 year on year profit s also up 7 year on year due to higher revenues lower costs reflecting the synergies of the integration of banco popular and provisions which were at slightly positive in the quarter s p upgraded the rating of our bank to bbb and it was chosen as the brand with the best reputation in portugal among the banks in portugal in poland the acquisition of deutsche bank poland has strengthened our competitive position in the country and we are now the second largest bank in the country the integration obviously explains the abnormally high year on year growth rates that you see in the p l and the balance sheet the very good business performance is not driven all the way down to the p l because of higher contribution to the banking tax which by the way it s not tax deductible and lastly we had a eur12 million restructuring charge in the quarter affecting the closure of 70 branches and more or less 1400 employees finally in argentina the business was very conditioned by the very high inflation 50 inflation 50 depreciation of the peso and almost 70 interest rates attributable profit was eur161 million including the capital gain from the sale of our stake in prisma excluding these the underlying profit was eur11 million there was an inflation adjustment of eur53 million the monetary adjustment was eur38 million and through currency adjustment eur15 million on the business side we see positive performance of customer revenues and positive cost control finally on the corporate center the underlying profit was hit by higher costs associated with foreign currency hedging and in the net interest income we also had higher costs higher financial costs or due to higher stock of issuances and the impact of ifrs 16 in terms of cost 1 lower here we had two forces in opposite directions on the one hand we had the simplification measures and the streamlining on the other hand the investments in global projects also ifrs 16 had a positive impact on costs lastly we include here a loss of eur118 million from the sale of a portfolio of real estate assets to cerberus capital management in the quarter and now i ll turn it back to jose antonio for his closing remarks thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thanks jose let me to finish this presentation yes summing up a little bit what the environment in the q1 well in this environment that was not great we increased our customer volume and customer base the underlying trends are solids year on year growth in customer revenue cost control and lower loan loss provisions the capital generation was good in the quarter as we mentioned before and tangible net asset value per share significantly increased 3 in the quarter so underlying rote return on tangible equity higher than our competitors affect by market weakness in the quarter in the very shorter view looking forward we see a deterioration in the macro scenario with lower growth expected in our markets probably we should expect on component growth of 1 5 gdp growth in this environment we re going to have mixed trend volumes probably growing keep growing around double digit in the americas and growing the customer base but not that much in volumes in europe we expect good cost control the synergies and efficiencies we announced in the investor day and the cost of credit remained relatively low levels and our aim is continue gain market sharing in our main markets and improve our profitability and strengthen our balance sheet let me to finish through elaborating the two operations we announced the same month the first one was the voluntary tender offer for the 25 of the shares of our subsidiary in mexico this is very much in line with the strategy we announced and it meets our financial criteria with a expected return on investment of 14 5 at the same time for santander minority shareholders this is an opportunity to monetize their shares and gain exposure to a global bank and diversified bank like santander we believe we do this offer because we believe in the financial sector in mexico and the potential growth going forward through a higher banca legislation and large numbers of customers in the country second operation we announced in the same month was we signed a memorandum of understanding with credit agricole for our custody and asset servicing businesses this operation is also consistent with our strategy the business are very complementary in a business where the scale matters a lot we get a better position in the combined entity to be facing competitor in this niche of the market in europe and the americas well this operation as we already communicate to you will produce at the closing an estimated capital gain of eur 700 million that we expect to record in extraordinary charges and provisions overall the line of extraordinary charges in provisions at the year and the quarter was minus eur108 million overall in the year will be basically zero positives and negative will offset each other this operation has also had a slightly positive impacting capital 3 basis points and the profit going forward expected profit going forward based on the business plan of the combined entity will mean a slightly increase in our eps finally just to remember you our main targets financial targets that we announced to you in the investor day i think the quarter in the underlying basis shows a that we are progressing toward our goals we are showing that the business is growing as we were expecting in america in the americas we are showing that our efficiency gains that we announced to you in europe and you see in the numbers in europe that we are starting to gather momentum there and the capital generation has been good in the quarter and we ve been able to offset the regulatory headwinds and this will transform as we are expecting higher profitability and translate in higher dividend and higher profitability for shareholders thank you and now we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have questions and answers sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks jose antonio indeed we have now time to open the q a so please operator we can proceed with the first question operator ladies and gentlemen the q a session starts now operator instructions the first question comes from jose abad from goldman sachs please go ahead jose maria abad hernandez goldman sachs group inc analyst hello good morning and thank you very much for the presentation two questions from my side the first one is was the impact from the regulatory equivalents with argentina really positive and also i mean a follow up question on this is whether actually the positive impact from this in case there is one is included in the 50 bps impact from management actions that you guided in in deed in your investor day the second question is on litigation there was an article in expansion i believe last week talking about the supreme court in brazil forcing santander to compensate workers from banespa from their bonuses back to actually in 1986 the article quantifies the potential impact of actually north of brl1 billion so i think it will be useful for us actually if you could actually clarify what s the potential impact from these and any litigation reserve that you may already have against these contingencies thank you very much jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer thank you jose i will elaborate on the second question i pass the first one to the cfo that will elaborate on the equivalents in argentina that was approved as you know by the eu in april or in march jose garcia cantera chief financial officer in april jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer yeah so the article you referred the case you referred in the court in brazil well it s related as you know the litigation related with labor claims in brazil is pretty high as a matter of fact the provisioning we have in the balance sheet for labor claims is close to brl4 billion in the country and we appealed this ruling of the court and we think that we are well provide for the plenty of for the significant litigation labor claims that we have in brazil were well provided not only specifically for this one for the overall litigations claims that we have that is a very high number taking into account one by one jose garcia cantera chief financial officer specifically the article referred to brl1 billion so we re talking really eur150 million worst case scenario and again this is a process that will take quite a long time we don t expect this to be actually to finish at least within the next seven eight years and i didn t get the first question jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer the first question was about the equivalents in argentina clearing for the eu the european union argentina the regulatory equivalence how much of this impact our capital inaudible jose garcia cantera chief financial officer 6 basis points jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer 6 basis points yeah so this is new for those who are not familiar with this that as a matter of fact the significant reserve requirements in argentina and when we gather deposits we need to reserve with the central bank some of these deposits for regulatory reasons and those deposits had risk weighting when the local regulator is declared equivalent by the eu the risk weighting goes to zero and this is a reduction in risk weighted assets and translating what jose said 6 basis point of capital sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations next question please operator the next question comes from vanessa guy from jpmorgan please go ahead vanessa maria pilar guy vazquez jp morgan chase co analyst hi good morning my first question was on capital i was wondering if you could provide some guidance on what capital impacts you would expect over the next coming quarters for 2019 and my second question is regarding the us and how the chrysler agreement is progressing thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer so on capital we guide you in investor day 50 basis points yeah 50 basis points to 60 basis points we already had in the quarter 30s another 20 basis points to 30 basis points to come yeah so this is what this is going to come from what we expect to come from the regulatory headwinds including many items there yeah on the other side question related with chrysler fsa we are still holding with fsa what i will qualify as a constructive dialog in relation with the business we are operating for them in the us i cannot at this point tell you where this dialog will end but i will say at this point that inaudible comes through different we are looking for a solutions how to make the business how to have a better business for both helping them to sell more cars and having a sound and solid finance business going forward sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks vanessa next question please operator the next question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano saenz de tejada morgan stanley analyst good morning a question on capital and then on restructuring for me on capital you ve built 20 basis points in the quarter from organic generation can you maybe give us some color why it s higher than your usual 10 basis point run rate is it faster dta rundown or something that we could extrapolate and when we look forward you ve obviously done mexico the buyout you ve done the mou with casa can you maybe walk us through an updated list of some more efficiency and optimization we could look forward to so you ve talked in the past about uk model we ve got the 6 basis points that you just mentioned on argentina is can we look forward to further securitizations you ve got a stake in inaudible that presumably is a source of capital just some general color on that and the second on restructuring i was can you maybe give us a feel for the timing of the restructuring in spain and uk i think you mentioned spain for july the last headcount reduction but in the uk given the revenue trend it s very difficult for any substantial change in those revenue trends at least in the short term given the rate outlook if you could maybe this talk us through you mentioned costs flat versus inflation this year but can we look forward to further reductions and when those restructuring and those reductions might happen thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer okay going into the first question capital generation in the quarter 20 basis points compared with our guidance on average 10 basis points i will say i will stress the word average yeah on average we generated 10 basis points this quarter came better the reason is we are being more efficient in managing risk weighted assets at the same time we have much more demand in i mentioned in the when i was talking about spain we have much more demand in particularly in those exposures that well we think are below the cost of equity and for that reason we are heading at what we qualify in our investor day as a lighter capital model and this is the reflection of this you mentioned also mexico and the buyout in mexico and the agreement with the credit agricole that has more positives in capital well but i will not the capital management as you can imagine became a priority for the group several years ago with the higher capital requirements and we are refining all the capital models with a internal big project that is called that is managed by the cfo office we are improving significantly the tools to match capital across the group and some of this is going to be reflected in the numbers going forward so being more efficient on one side inducing the capital in new operations on the other side being having margin developments in a way that provides a higher return the second question was restructuring spain you mentioned the spain uk timing of course i ll talk about the timing in spain we called the unions i think it was yesterday to have the first meeting in a week next monday i think to start the negotiation process with the unions well it s very difficult to say when the process is going to finish on the other side the integration process the branch integration process that jose also mentioned we already integrated 600 branches out of 1 600 we expect to finish the 1 600 branches integration at the end of july more or less and after that we start the reduction of number of branches provided that we reach an agreement with the unions that we re going to have the discussion in the same time so in our mind it has been to finish the process this year in spain you mentioned uk uk we guide you to a strict cost control and at the same time in the investor day we guide you to a return on tangible equity in a tougher revenue environment higher than the current one this mainly will be done through the cost still that we plan to grow some businesses in the uk we are growing cib and the related business but we are suffering and we are betting on a tough environment for the mortgage business that is the one who is more affected at this stage and we expect to have to be able to show a better cost control not only better cost control probably some reduction in cost going forward is something that expect to get sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks alvaro next question please operator your next question comes from carlos cobo from societe generale please go ahead carlos cobo societe generale analyst hello thank you very much for the presentation and a couple of questions from my side in the uk as a quick follow up not only that you ve seen some cost inflation nii is weak fees are not particularly strong i was wondering whether you are considering more actively the potential cut in the 123 account as you did in spain as a way to compensate the profitability challenges in the uk second in spain cost of risk was just slightly higher than the run rate last year i was wondering if you could provide some color here outlook for the whole year and whether there is any exceptional or some seasonality that you tend to charge higher provisions in the first q thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer you mentioned the uk we re going to take i will say we are managing the business and we re going to take measure both on the business front and in the cost front in the business front you mentioned the 123 account we don t have a specific decision for this specific account at this stage but it is sure that we should look for a new sources of revenue and at the same time that we reduce the cost that this is the plan going forward in the uk the cost of risk in spain i will expect the cost of risk in spain to remain nothing new the quarter was a small spike but i will expect to be in the region of 30 basis points in the 30s yeah for the year nothing new here in this front sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks carlos next question please operator your next question comes from ignacio ulargui from deutsche bank please go ahead ignacio ulargui deutsche bank ag analyst hi good morning just have two questions one on the brazilian nii if you could update us on the trends that we should see you have been guiding for a high single digit supported by loan growth what are the recent downgrades that we have seen in gdp may affect a bit lending demand and how do you see that the second question on the competitive landscape in spain particularly on the mortgage market and the implication of the new mortgage loan how do you see that should impact margins going forward thanks jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer well nii in brazil in the quarter as you know came down this is more due to the non customer related activities last year interest rates of the previous year in 2017 interest rate came down sharply as a result of this in 2018 we ve got significant revenue on this on the customer front i remain we ve been guiding due for double digit kind of growth in the country and we ve been guiding you for a lower growth in nii so mid maybe to high mid to high or mid single digit in brazil so some margin compression we expecting in brazil when you refer to spain as you said rightly the market remains fairly competitive not only in mortgages i will say all across the board it s true that we managed this quarter to increase our net interest margin on customers you saw it through a reduction in the funding costs at the same time a slight increase in the deal we are getting from our assets so we are happy with this you specifically referred to mortgages mortgages remains fairly competitive i haven t seen a extra reduction in prices from the one we had one quarter or two quarters ago remains competitive but it is true that we managed to get a higher yield due to the fact that in the quarter we remained flat on the loan book but grew sme lending and grew in consumer lending that reflects into higher yield in the loan book at the same time we reduced the funding costs as i said mortgages i will say the market remains competitive i don t expect a big the figure to remain where it is at this stage sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks ignacio next question please operator the next question comes from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri mediobanca analyst yes good morning two questions one on capital and one on hedging on capital there have been changes to crd rules i m talking to crd v and specifically to the sme support factor and to the possibility to exclude from intangible deductions some software components could you give us your indicative impacts for next year and can you also clarify on the regulatory headwinds i was left at 50 basis points and then before maybe you said 50 basis points to 60 basis points and finally the trim impact when you guided the 50 basis points is it all in 2019 or there is still a part in 2020 regarding the low default portfolio on the hedging could you update us on your hedging strategy and how you re adjusting to a more dynamic use of this tool what was the p l cost and the capital impact in q1 thank you jose garcia cantera chief financial officer okay so hedging the strategy remains the same so we hedge the capital ratio so that is why despite the risk weighted assets due to currency depreciation went up eur8 billion in the quarter there was no impact on the capital ratio the cost of that strategy in the first quarter is more or less 4 basis points of capital we also hedge the p l let s say on an opportunistic basis based on the outlook that we have and the risks that we see in the different countries right now we have fully hedged the pound and the mexican peso and 75 hedged the expected results that we have in brazil the cost of that in the first quarter was eur60 million on the other hand obviously you have the positive of the translation of the results in local currencies into euros all throughout the p l jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer on the numbers you asked about capital depicted 50 basis points regulatory headwinds is for this year is for 2019 we already absorbed as i said before 29 basis points so we expect the rest to come along the year when you were referring to the crd v eventually impacting changing in sme support factor and intangibles as you know we have a significant exposure to smes mainly after this decision of popular although a significant portion of the smes around the world are in a standard model yes so we have the smes in the corporate business in uk us and latin america and still standard model we have our own internal rate based model for spain so but we have significant exposure there and changes in the support factor effects us accordingly in intangibles you mentioned this well intangibles there is a door open there to have a discussion of what the intangibles we ve been very vocal on this because we think that in this at this particular juncture where we are investing significantly in digitalization so what means basically investing in software there is an inaudible treatment when you invest yourself and inaudible when you buy from someone else when you invest yourself its intangibles and you did that 100 from capital when you buy from someone else the treatment is totally different we ve been as you know our software we control our software and we continue to invest significantly in our software this will be a significant deal for us it s very difficult to say at this stage because software there are different type of software for how long the software remains being useful for the bank is probably too early to call but we have intangibles if i remember well is eur2 8 billion or something like that in the balance sheet how much this may be affected i have no idea at this stage that is too early sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks andrea next question please operator the next question comes from mario ropero from fidentiis please go ahead mario ropero fidentiis analyst fee income trends in spain which has been very negative quarter after quarter for a while presumably due to corporate and investment banking so i was wondering if you can give us an indication on the weight of this business in the fee income line and when do you expect this line to bottom out and then on the npl ratio in spain i noticed that it has remained flat since mid 2018 so please if you could comment and clarify what s going on here thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer fee income in spain as you rightly mentioned went down by 3 is explained basically for cib activities if i look for the whole year i will expect some growth in this slightly positive some growth in fee income assuming that the cib business behaves in a normal way i will say having the same activity than last year the other question was about npls jose garcia cantera chief financial officer npls in spain jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer well npl well we re still in the credit quality in spain for it has good trends i don t remember exactly the npl number it is flat probably you re right but i don t have in my mind any significant probably in the reduction of both non performing assets i mean both loans and properties we are progressing a good pace in the reduction of this and also the provision of this we feel comfortable with the level of provisions we have already for all of these as provisions sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks mario next one please operator the next question comes from daragh quinn from kbw please go ahead daragh quinn kbw analyst hi good morning a question on spain just with a view on the new incoming government we saw the socialist party campaign on the idea of a minimum effect of corporate tax rates in spain and i m just wondering if you see any risk to the amount of taxes you pay out of the legal entity in spain and then a second question on asset quality and provisions in the uk and the european consumer finance business you ve indicated before that you expect to see a normalization of credit charges there i was wondering if you could just update us again on a the time that it ll take for those provisions to normalize and at what level do you expect them to normalize thanks jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer so in spain well it s too early to say yeah so the tax rate in the spain well it s too early to say naturally it was inaudible for the legal entity in the spain to the corporate tax in the spain and as you know our corporate tax is already higher than the other sector well i m not going to speculate on higher or lower tax rate at this stage in asset quality provisions you mentioned in uk consumer finance yes so we told you in the investor day that we are having a cost of risk lower than the expected loss across the cycle the distance in the consumer finance we have been having around 40 basis points 40 basis points or even lower and the expected loss is basically double than this we are not seeing any sign of deterioration in the credit quality and probably for this year if i need to bet probably will remain closer to the 40s than to any other number but well we have always in mind that if our models are right at some point it should normalize your question is when probably to seek when we need to look at the unemployment numbers yeah the unemployment number is the main factor that drives the cost of credit cost of risk in our consumer business not only in europe also in us inaudible and with the uk we gave you the figures our basic book in the uk it s mortgages is 80 of book yeah so the remaining 20 is a mix between corporate and some consumer lending a small fraction as do our loan to value is one of the lowest in the market and our front book will be much more conservative than some of our peers there and on our buy to let exposure is low well when you have a cost of risk that is south of 10 basis points well inaudible jose garcia cantera chief financial officer obviously the one way to go jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer yes it s only one way to go that is up when well again inaudible retail business our exposure is with households and the main driver as in consumer finance tend to be unemployment yeah so we have not seen any sign of deterioration of unemployment rates all across europe including uk sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks daragh next question please operator the next question comes from your next question comes from britta schimdt of autonomous research please go ahead britta schimdt autonomous research analyst yeah hi there i ve got two questions please in brazil one of the competitors on the credit card merchant acquiring business has changed pricing on selected credit card transactions and i was interested to get your opinion on whether you think that will have any impact on getnet or the merchant acquiring fees in brazil and secondly could you let us know what the ifrs 16 impact was on costs i might have missed that and can you confirm that this likely cost reduction was already part of the business as usual costs being flat that you ve given at the investor day jose garcia cantera chief financial officer so if you want i ll take the second and let me give you the throughout the p l ifrs 16 in the first quarter had as i said a negative impact on net interest income of eur81 million and costs were reduced by eur59 million so net bottom line net impact was negative eur22 million and when we look at cost trends obviously this is a one off so obviously this will affect the year on year comparison this year but obviously we consider this as a one off jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer in relation with brazil competition in acquiring business well new competitors came to the market this is a market that was a market basically where two competitors five six years ago we came along with our proposal in getnet we went from very low market share or almost no market share to close to 15 market share and the last two or three years with newcomers into the market newcomers with a strong proposition particularly for e commerce related and the small tickets and the market is becoming much more competitive but you know the fees in this market were significant there were three sources of revenues in the market the interchange fee the flow business that was significant because the payment date was like 20 plus b plus 20 so the business was significant in this front the income generation from the front and finally rent of the gadgets that the merchants use for this purpose the competition is coming in the i will say in the three fronts our business is i think is much resilient than others because our business is not just a acquiring business it is a business that we bundled the acquiring business with banking services some lending embedded there and a package mainly to the small merchants in the market so we were expecting somehow this competition to come sooner or later it s coming now and we expect to keep gaining market share and approaching us over time to a market share closer to 20 that was our original aspiration when we started this business six years ago seven years ago and we ve got from 1 2 to 13 14 close to 15 and we expect to keep going up in our market share in a more competitive market and with lower unitary fee income but higher volumes don t forget the volumes the volumes that we ve been gaining market share growing well in double digit close to 20 year after year in the previous year we were even growing at 30 we expect to keep growing significantly in this business sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations thanks britta next question please operator the next question comes from inaudible from barclays please go ahead unidentified speaker barclays analyst hello thank you for taking my question my question is regarding the us and the cost i see that the cost of santander bank is still up on a cost income ratio at 77 more or less i wonder what further actions you have in mind in order to come this figure down thank you jose antonio alvarez alvarez vice chairman chief executive officer so performance in cost is i ll do the performance in costs only in the last quarter the last couple of quarters has been good in the us still you re right our cost income compared with our peers sbna compared with our peers in the market is still very high and we re working on this in two different fronts yeah so one front is getting more internal synergies in the that means that as you remember we are managing the us as a separate business one side private bank and another side consumer finance and other side sbna and another side cib and in the new york branch and the broker dealer when the holding company came along on the regulatory pressure we build we are still in the process of building the holding operations in the us and we are in a project that is what they internally call one santander that means exactly one operation in the us where we can extract synergies from the operation having said that and you should expect a good cost control volume forward in the us this is just one part of the business on the revenue side when we compare ourselves with our peer our revenues are weaker in this regard we are progressing well and we are starting to show significant progress not only in consumer business but inaudible in sbna we are showing some progress in cib business where our revenues are growing starting from very low levels close to 20 our c i business is showing significant progress the multi family inaudible business that we have basically in new york is showing significant progress and still we have more things to do in the retail arena with the households and individual customers so on one side and we mentioned in the investor day that one of the key elements for improving our profitability in us was the operating leverage we have a high cost income as you rightly mentioned and we expect to keep this well under control or even in some cases going down and at the same time being able to improve with infrastructure we have the revenue lines in the segments i mentioned to you and with these two elements we expect to reduce significantly our cost income and improve our profitability in the us in sbna in particular sergio gamez global head of shareholder and investor relations ph fernando last question please operator the last question comes from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto caixabank bpi analyst hello good morning hey thank you for taking my call my question will be on the corporate center i was wondering if you could shed some light on the evolution of the funding costs at the corporate center which went up 14 quarter on quarter if i m not mistaken 27 year on year that would be well yeah that would be my only pending question thank you jose garcia cantera chief financial officer i think there s nothing there we ve had more issuance along the way compared with the first quarter of last year particularly to comply with mrel requirement as jose antonio said we already fully comply with the requirements of the srb there is nothing special there and also the cost of the hedging which are included as part of the cost of the corporate center which i mentioned were eur60 million in the quarter sergio gamez global

us q1 gaap net income of 42 million 0 45 per share adjusted ebitda of 104 million in the quarter repurchased 225 million of senior notes liquidity strong at 595 million net debt to adjusted ebitda at 0 6x montréal april 30 2019 prnewswire resolute forest products inc nyse rfp tsx rfp today reported net income for the quarter ended march 31 2019 of 42 million or 0 45 per diluted share compared to 10 million or 0 11 per diluted share in the same period in 2018 sales were 795 million in the quarter a decrease of 79 million from the year ago period the first quarter of 2018 included sales from the catawba south carolina and fairmont west virginia facilities sold in the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding special items the company reported net income of 30 million or 0 32 per diluted share compared to 17 million or 0 18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018 our diversified asset base continued to produce strong ebitda in the quarter despite building market pressure in some of our businesses said yves laflamme president and chief executive officer our quarterly results benefitted from improved productivity which allowed us to absorb the significant rise in wood fiber costs and offset the reduction in ebitda associated with the divestiture of the catawba mill accordingly we continued to generate consistent value from our paper portfolio and the results of our wood products business improved as prices rebounded modestly from multi year lows we re also pleased with the recent ratification of a four year collective agreement covering our nearly 800 unionized employees at three of our u s pulp paper and tissue mills non gaap financial measures such as adjustments for special items and adjusted ebitda are explained and reconciled below operating income variance against prior period consolidated the company reported operating income of 64 million in the quarter compared to 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the operating results reflect higher average transaction prices for wood products lower depreciation expense the favorable effect of the weaker canadian dollar and fewer production outages these elements were partly offset by lower volumes mainly attributable to the catawba mill divestiture at the end of the fourth quarter and softening newsprint market conditions as well as an increase in wood fiber costs and seasonally higher energy expenses the operating results in the fourth quarter of 2018 included a 141 million gain on disposition of assets and a non cash impairment charge of 120 million adjusted ebitda in the quarter was 104 million essentially unchanged from 105 million reported in the fourth quarter which included 15 million from the catawba facility market pulp operating income in the market pulp segment was 42 million relatively unchanged compared to the previous quarter the average transaction price remained at 808 per metric ton while shipments declined by 56 000 metric tons due to a reduction in pulp capacity following the divestiture of the catawba and fairmont facilities on a pro forma basis sales volume rose by 26 000 metric tons because of less scheduled downtime and production disruptions this quarter the operating cost per unit the delivered cost decreased by 24 to 664 per metric ton as higher fiber costs were more than offset by improved productivity increasing ebitda per metric ton to 162 accordingly despite the sale of the catawba mill ebitda was relatively unchanged at 47 million tissue the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of 8 million in the quarter an improvement of 1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 overall sales increased by 11 reflecting improved product mix price increases for away from home products and higher shipments delivered cost remained unchanged as lower freight expenses associated with our new distribution center were offset by higher pulp costs following the divestiture of the fairmont mill ebitda improved to negative 3 million from negative 5 million in the first quarter wood products the wood products segment reported an operating income of 6 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of 8 million in the fourth quarter the improvement reflects an increase in average transaction price up 27 per thousand board feet to 374 lower market based stumpage fees and maintenance costs more than offset seasonally higher fiber usage and freight costs leading to a 6 per thousand board feet decrease in delivered cost pricing gains and lower costs largely outweighed the 24 million board feet decrease in shipments volumes this quarter were unfavorably impacted by adverse weather conditions which affected rail car availability log supply and u s consumption ebitda for the segment increased to 14 million compared to 1 million in the prior quarter finished goods inventory remained elevated at 159 million board feet newsprint at 28 million in the first quarter newsprint s operating income was unchanged compared to the previous quarter sales declined by 14 driven by a 53 000 metric ton decrease in shipments while the average transaction price remained at 634 per metric ton the reduction in sales volume reflects seasonality the timing of export sales and softening market conditions as a result finished goods inventory rose to 135 000 metric tons at quarter end the delivered cost decreased by 12 per metric ton largely attributable to lower depreciation expense as certain assets are fully amortized higher contribution from the thunder bay ontario cogeneration assets following a turbine failure in the previous quarter and overall lower maintenance costs were largely offset by higher fiber and energy costs consequently ebitda decreased by 10 million to 35 million for the quarter equivalent to 106 per metric ton or 17 ebitda margin specialty papers the specialty papers segment generated operating income of 15 million in the quarter compared to 17 million in the previous quarter pricing rose by 12 per short ton to 768 while shipments fell by 88 000 short tons with the sale of the catawba mill at the end of 2018 despite the exit from higher cost coated mechanical grades delivered cost remained unchanged at 695 per short ton reflecting continued higher wood costs in the u s southeast due to abnormally wet weather unfavorable energy expenses and scheduled maintenance costs while segment ebitda decreased by 3 million to 25 million this quarter ebitda per short ton rose by 30 to 125 due to the sale of the catawba mill equivalent to a 16 margin consolidated quarterly operating income variance against year ago period the company s operating income was 16 million higher than the first quarter of 2018 overall pricing added 37 million to the results as the average transaction price increased by 14 for each of market pulp newsprint and specialty papers offsetting the 19 drop in lumber prices the improvement in operating income also reflects the 20 million favorable impact of the weaker canadian dollar and lower depreciation expense of 13 million due to divestitures and the full amortization of certain assets these favorable items were largely offset by an increase in manufacturing costs of 51 million mainly resulting from higher fiber costs and additional maintenance mostly planned results were also impacted by lower sales volume of 8 million reflecting weaker lumber and newsprint market conditions corporate and finance during the quarter the company generated 23 million of cash from operations despite the seasonal build up in log inventory and the increase in newsprint finished goods inventory cash decreased to 69 million reflecting 26 million in capital expenditures and the repurchase of 225 million of the senior notes due 2023 net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda remained low at 0 6x and liquidity at quarter end stood at 595 million by quarter end the company had recorded cumulative softwood lumber duty deposits of 117 million on the balance sheet including 14 million paid in the quarter uncoated groundwood papers duty deposits of 6 million were fully refunded during the quarter following the adoption of new lease accounting standards the company recognized total liabilities of 66 million associated with operating leases and corresponding assets on the balance sheet as of march 31 2019 outlook we maintain our view on market pulp fundamentals even as prices have recently started to trend down while we expect lower price realizations in the second quarter limited capacity additions and growing demand will continue to support favorable market dynamics over the medium term our tissue segment remains a key focus as we continue to build on the late year progress in terms of productivity and quality we expect our wood products cost performance to improve for the balance of the year but we re more conservative with our expectations around lumber markets even as some market participants are more enthusiastic following abnormally wet and wintry conditions and in light of production curtailments among canadian producers including downtime of our own while our near term outlook is more uncertain our medium to long term outlook remains positive with ongoing global demand declines and currently low operating rates we expect lower pricing for our paper grades in the second quarter but despite the softening market conditions our paper business generated strong first quarter ebitda margins and we are confident we can continue to produce attractive cash flows as we take steps to reduce inventory and maintain our competitive cost position added mr laflamme earnings conference call the company will hold a conference call to discuss the financial results at 9 00 a m et today the public is invited to

income loss net income loss and eps in each case as adjusted for special items as well as ebitda adjusted ebitda and ebitda margin are internal measures and therefore may not be comparable to those of

of power or greater were nearly 50 of all high power cw laser sales and high power cw lasers at 10 kilowatts or greater increased more than 40 year over year sales of other high power lasers declined

30 04 2019 listen it is unarguable that everyone at a particular time was duped politically but history has proven that in the final analysis the politically duped gets enlightened and throws him herself into struggle against individuals and institutions that inhibit the social advancement of humanity in percentage as in our society we were taught by our mwalimu mahdi wallace f muhammad every society is divided into 3 groups of people he explained the 10 percent the 85 percent and the 5 percent it is the first and the latter that duped the middle and it is the first in the latter that suffers the wrath of the middle in its quest fir emancipation the 10 the political class both the reign and oppositions camp is a handful of people that have had the advantage to acquire some level of education the political order in liberia is in such a way that this political class takes advantage of the people s ignorance to acquire and maintain its dominance elements in this class hide under the veneer of being patriots and compatriots to win the support of the people they re using their people instead of mobilizing and educating them for the social transformation of the society for it is the social transformation of the society that will take the people from the status of sub human to the height of dignity and decency but the irony here is those the people look up to for direction see them as tools with voice that must be used to satisfy the insatiable greed of this selfish and elitist clique this has been the fate of the people and their country for almost two centuries consequently what we have is an economy that distributes poverty disease and ignorance among the mass of people and a political order that gives a cliquish minority the opportunity to delude the people and gather wealth from the public treasury currently the rate of inflation is 28 percent and this is giving a blow to the income of workers peasants and the urban poor the budgetary deficit for fiscal year 2018 2019 is put at us 225 million thus government projects in education healthcare infrastructure etc are expected to see a nosedive a situation already being experienced by the people economic growth forecast for 2019 is now at 0 4 percent from 4 7percent the coming of the george weah led government has not been accompanied by the flow of foreign direct investments unemployment is high as 83 percent especially among the young people the liberian dollars is rapidly devaluing against the united states dollars as the exchange rate is now 177ld to 1us there has been a drop in personal inward remittances in 2018 inward remittances was just us 101 9 million from more than 200million in 2017 the public external debt stock us 987 8 million obviously the country is drifting back into being a heavily indebted poor country the country is food insecure and liberians living below poverty line are put at 83 percent of the population corruption is pervasive as the country scored 31points out of 100 on the latest transparency international s perception index score it is through the looting of the public treasury in every sector of the public bureaucracy that the political class acquire its wealth and deprived the people the just benefits from the taxes and resources of the country adherence to the rule of law is a taboo as the political class never hesitates to tear apart laws and statues in order to feather its nest we recently witnessed the unjust impeachment of former associate justice kabineh m ja neh the opportunists and minions of the regime claimed that the legislature followed the laws in keeping with the constitution this is far from the truth as the venerated patriot suffered such humiliation because he is disliked by president weah as his opinion in the supreme court ruling in the liberty party vs national election commission in 2017 went against the political interest of those in power one of the greatest nightmares of the weah led government is the establishment of the war crimes court in liberia those who were victimized by the 14year carnage in liberia will not be served justice as the regime has sealed a deal with warlords who parade the corridors of power this is the nature of politics in third world liberia there re only changes of the faces that egoistically serve in the three branches but throughout history the masses of our people have been subjected to poverty and servitude while public officials wallow in opulence the people i mean the 85percent suffer these backlashes they are deprived of self sufficiency and social decency they re stagnated in economics captivity disease and illiteracy they re the prestigious raw materials of moonlight in the mist sunlight albert einstein the theoretical physicist teaches us the world is not evil by those that do evil but those that sit without doing anything the 5 the wisdom minded and self sufficient and mahdi s guided ones find themselves within this realm or camp they re more dangerous than the others note they re great but their failure to reach out in the context of mobilization and education of the people makes them dangerous they re aware of the evil that is meted out against the mass of people yet they ve failed to mobilize and educate them for genuine change and transformation they think that the deluded people who out of ignorance and the quest to survive from handouts canonize those who oppress them and vilify men and women who put their lives on the line for noble causes so it is ok to sit idle as the country is devoured by a particular cliquish the fear of being victimized and bully keeps them in cowardice this is a contributing factor that has kept the country entrapped by the bankrupt political class now we must deal with certain elements in the society they are also contributors to the malady they are the consummate opportunist and sycophants who jockey for crumbs from the table of parasites who feeds on the taxes and resources of the people these are charlatans who increase their credentials by lavishing the president and other key officials of government with praises and making them believe that they are infallible saints sent from heaven they make these leaders feel that they are incorruptible they do no wrong and that the people will muster not the courage to rise up and that things must not change but continue to unfold the same old ways enlightened and honest patriots must seize the occasion to dispense with these forces and their masters these blind loyalists must be dealt a decisive blow so that our people can advance these political opportunists and fortune hunters must be a relic of the past through the consolidation of forces who will mobilize the people to change the diktats of politics and economics in liberia this is the task history has bequeathed to those who seek social transformation what is so disappointing is that the current corpse of opposition figures are presenting no genuine alternatives that reflect the hopes and aspirations of the people their only issue is the character of those who occupy public offices they have not told our people that the way we conduct politics and the way we organize our economy are flawed from beginning to end and that if the features of the system remain the way they are the country and people will remain stagnated and that no matter who occupies the presidency things will remain the same they escape these fundamentals and feed the people with sterile rhetoric these are indication that those who oppose weah and his people or those who opposed other governments in the past are not doing so or did not do so to usher in social transformation they do or did so to have the opportunity to benefit from the spoilt system this is an albatross that the people led by a popular and conscious vanguard must exorcise to advance every facet of the liberian society this vanguard must not limit itself to facebook live as the vast majority of the people who are peasants and living in the rural communities have no access to smart phones the vanguard must not draw conclusion based on facebook opinion census this is not to discredit the importance of social media in 21st century mass action but the concrete reality in liberia calls for more efforts beyond social media usage as a medium for the mobilization and education of the people the vanguard must do more concrete works with the peasant masses and urban poor it must distribute more revolutionary literature among the littered middle class to also win their support the vanguard must engage the mass of people to make them aware that they are not alone but rather there are men and women who empathize with them and seek to transform the country by not only introducing popular democracy that places the destiny of the people in their own hands but also creating a national economy that is placed at the service of the people the struggle for social transformation requires the involvement of revolutionary patriots and compatriots only they can ensure that the people s final march into history is concluded with the outcome of a higher level of development we must abhor the political staple food self seeking political ventures democracy cannot be put at the service of the people when those who lead think they are demagogues and the people are objects that must be remote controlled to meet selfish aims the people and only the people are the makers of history those who see to lead them must be aware that without the people a nation cannot exist so their quest for change must encapsulate the collective hopes and aspiration of the people they must dispense with that political culture of seeing politics as the shortest route to accumulate primitively from my honest reading of history the struggle of the movement for justice in africa moja was the only genuine and authentic pan african effort to mobilize and educate the people to change the liberian society by all and for all although this effort was aborted by external and internal forces who found happiness in keeping the country politically and economically inert a more than one century oligarchy was dislodged by the revolutionary agitation of moja and other progressives force like the progressive alliance of liberia there are those who condemn the struggle of the progressives but we know the camp from which they come these are remnants of the true wig party who have since april 12 1980 distorted history to place a dirt on the revolutionary role of men and women who threw themselves into struggle to change the fate of an impoverished people this is why the current generation of progressive political activist must never waver to appreciate the role of those who struggled against social injustices in the 70s 80s and 90s and use as a guide to actions the sacrifices of these struggle icons onward to victory as we march on to purify the perils of the rotten and corrupt politico class in liberia about the author sallia s komala a freshman student studying civil engineering at the jiangxi university of science and technology an activist emerging pan

fed opens meeting as trump calls for deep rate cut fed chairman jerome powell will announce the central bank s decision on wednesday the us central bank opened its third policy meeting of the year on tuesday under renewed attack from president donald trump who called on officials to reverse course and cut interest rates trump slammed the federal reserve for incessantly raising interest rates and said cutting rates by a full percentage point would make the economy surge the fed raised rates four times last year and has done so a total of nine times since december 2015 moving from zero in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to the current range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent but this year the fed has been on hold and signaled clearly that it has no intention of moving monetary policy anytime soon as it grapples with conflicting signs on the economy trump s call for a rate cut of a full point would reverse all of the fed moves last year and likely undermine any credibility the central bank has with financial markets and if trump continues to browbeat the fed in public comments central bankers may feel obliged to dig in just to prove their independence we have the potential to go up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point trump said in his twitter outburst he said china is boosting its economy by keeping rates low but our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low powell will announce the decision wednesday and economists and investors will look for any hint in the statement of how central bankers are feeling about the economy and what their next move might be a hike or a cut economic crosscurrents the rate setting federal open market committee now must evaluate crosscurrents in the economic data on one hand the us economy grew 3 2 percent in the first three months of the year a surprising result given the signs of slowdown in the final months of 2018 that caused financial markets to seem panicked for a time us federal reserve but on the other defying expected behavior in a growing economy with low unemployment the key measure of inflation continues to fall further below the fed s two percent target trump and his economic team have promised that tax cuts and deregulation will accelerate economic growth to three or even four percent but economists say that is unlikely especially as the us trade war with china and others has dampened business confidence and investment yes we are doing very well at 3 2 first quarter gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records at the same time make our national debt start to look small trump tweeted but many economists point out that the growth figures for the early part of the year were misleading inflated by factors that will have the opposite effect in coming months the growth rate vastly overstates the economy s strength bob schwartz of oxford economics said in a recent analysis without a rebound in spending and business investment there is little chance the us economy will accelerate and push wages and prices higher some economists now predict the fed s next move will be a rate cut probably next year diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton said much of the blame for the financial market turmoil and economic slowdown last year may be traced to the administration s own threats of a full blown trade war with china and us companies report the trade frictions are causing them to delay investments and hiring that doesn t mean the administration won t continue to openly blame the fed swonk said in a commentary urging the fed to tune out trump s comments the best that powell can do is to stay the course and keep his noise cancelling headphones charged to focus on where we are economically not politically stacking the fed meanwhile trump who named powell fed chair and has appointed three of the six other members of the fed board is working to stack the deck even further to push his views on policy us president donald trump has repeatedly broken with tradition to criticize the fed one of his controversial nominees dropped out of consideration but conservative commentator stephen moore known for highly criticized views on monetary policy also faces uncomfortable questions from lawmakers concerning income taxes in recent interviews moore also has tried to walk back his writings on women and women s rights even republican lawmakers have warned that moore is a dubious choice senator susan collins told politico that moore had troubling writings about women and also how he views the federal reserve advertisement staunch trump loyalist senator lindsey graham of south carolina told reporters moore s nomination would be very problematic

approach to each of the strategies in our different business units i want to take a minute this morning to talk about the quality of the senior management team we have at pac i ve been in this

years he ll walk you through our active first quarter in terms of our retail activity jeff sherman will report on our multifamily business which he leads as executive vice president he s been

to come jeff has over 20 years in the multifamily business covering acquisitions development and asset management next you ll hear from boone dupree chief executive officer of our class a office division boone has done an excellent job defining our strategy for this group implementing it and growing our asset base he came to us from cousins properties where he played a key role in nearly 2 billion in class a acquisitions paul cullen is the chief executive officer of the student housing business unit as well as chief marketing officer for preferred apartment communities as chief marketing officer he leads our marketing team which is a critical element of our branding efforts paul will speak about our successes in the operations and leasing of our various student housing projects i should also say a word about our entire preferred capital securities team these are the folks who provide us with much of the capital we need to grow our business through the end of q1 year to date they have raised 142 million from the sale of our preferred stocks not presenting today but equally important are kim hodge our chief property management officer mike cronin our chief accounting officer jeff sprain from whom you heard a moment ago our general counsel and randy forth who leads our excellent and very experienced asset management team when you invest in any company it is the associates involved in running that company that will ultimately determine how successful your investment will be from the day we went public in 2011 our common stockholders who invested with us that day and reinvested their dividends assuming no transaction costs would have achieved an 18 2 irr due to the efforts of this team so with that let s lead off with lenny leonard a silverstein president and chief operating officer thanks dan we had a solid first quarter in terms of ffo growth and again produced a strong dividend as you ll hear more about later our multifamily same store sales results were an impressive 3 1 on a quarter over quarter basis we also continued our acquisition asset acquisition strategy during the first quarter through the acquisition of an 887 bed student housing community located adjacent to the university of north carolina charlotte and a 158 000 square foot grocery anchored shopping center in richmond virginia to help fund our growth strategy we originated one real estate loan investment for a new multifamily development in destin florida and raised an aggregate of over 142 million of capital from sales of our preferred stock through the independent broker dealer and registered investment advisor channels during the first quarter of this year as of the end of the first quarter our real estate loan investment pipeline represents over 1 billion of prospective assets that we have the right to acquire all in all we are able to generate irrs in the low to mid teens through this program while getting off market access to new quality assets through the purchase options embedded in these loans as well as rights of first offer on a more granular level our revenues for the first quarter were over 111 million or over 23 greater than the revenues we earned for the first quarter last year our ffo for the first quarter 2019 was approximately 17 million or 0 39 per share representing a 5 4 increase in ffo per share compared to the first quarter of last year these outstanding operating results for the first quarter this year allowed us to pay a very solid common stock dividend equal to 0 26 per share or 4 greater than the dividend paid to our common stockholders for the first quarter in 2018 as we have previously discussed we continue to focus on increasing the float of our common stock during the first quarter this year for example we issued an aggregate of approximately 1 4 million shares of our common stock in connection with redemptions of our preferred stock and the exercise of warrants previously issued under our series a preferred stock and unit offerings overall we had approximately 43 2 million shares of common stock outstanding as of march 31 2019 representing an increase of over 4 million shares or 10 3 compared to the first quarter of last year switching to other financial statement metrics we continue to add quality assets to our portfolio in a meaningful way as of the end of the first quarter this year our total assets net of depreciation were approximately 4 8 billion or an increase of approximately 392 million or almost 9 compared to december 31st of last year as we ve said many times before our success is the result of our ability to function as a team so let me now call on john isakson our chief financial officer who will discuss our capital market strategy john john a isakson chief capital officer thanks lenny for 2019 we continue to expect that cap rates on multifamily acquisitions will remain low with grocery anchored shopping center and class a office acquisition cap rates higher in 2018 the low cap rate environment contributed to our decision to sell three assets one of these assets closed in the first quarter of 2018 and generated a substantial gain we did not sell any assets in the first quarter of this year so the variance in that line item will account for the notable variance in our net income number and while not one of our most important metrics the difference is worth explaining interest rates have been generally declining in the last three months and currently sit about 75 basis points off the recent peak in q4 last year we continue to believe that interest rates will be volatile in 2019 with domestic and global pressures presenting unpredictable conditions given the recent volatility and the uncertainty in the environment we have taken a cautious approach to our acquisition and portfolio financing strategy approximately 94 of our permanent property level mortgage debt has fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that have caps already this year we have refinanced two of our floating rate retail deals into fixed rate loans in both cases actually reducing the interest rates on the debt and extending the maturity as we referenced last quarter we recently closed on the extension of our 200 million corporate line of credit extending the maturity for three years and giving us flexibility for an additional year at the end of the term our borrowings under line of credit as of today are zero and we believe the current capacity of the line will serve us well for the foreseeable future in the event we need to increase the capacity of the line we have an accordion feature that allows us to expand up to a total of 300 million we recently filed an updated shelf registration statement of up to 400 million the shelf gives us the flexibility and optionality to issue common stock and otherwise access the public markets as we see fit when common stock prices are attractive on the acquisition front we ve been utilizing longer term fixed rate debt for all of our property types and have taken advantage of the recent drop in rates to refinance maturing loans with attractive terms we have approximately 100 million in maturing debt in 2019 remaining to refinance we have already begun the process of securing new debt for these assets and given the current rate environment we will look to lock in our interest rates as soon as practicable for our multifamily portfolio freddie mac and fannie mae remain our primary lenders we have enjoyed preferred borrower status and have excellent relationships with both agencies it is worth noting that the recent appointment and confirmation of mark calabria to head fhfa the regulatory body for freddie mac and fannie mae has raised the probability of gse reform in the near future in the current environment gse spreads have widened as inaudible for debt have remained strong and the ability for the agencies to do uncapped business has become more difficult we expect spreads to widen somewhat and life company debt for multifamily assets to become more attractive and competitive the lender pool for our retail product remains deep and the demand for our debt remains strong we have recently seen a contraction in spreads for these deals so the competition for grocery anchored debt has increased our other transactions are also financed through life companies with terms that are generally comparable to retail multifamily although the maturities may be longer these are typically larger deals and the lender pool is smaller than the one for retail deals which are a more manageable size nonetheless we have seen strong lending demand for our office acquisitions and our deep relationships in the lending community continue to serve us well jeff sherman will now discuss our first quarter 2019 multifamily results jeff jeffery d sherman executive vice president of multifamily investments thanks john i m pleased to announce strong operating results for the multifamily portfolio during the first quarter of 2019 our same store set achieved first quarter year over year rental revenue and total revenue growth of 3 1 and 2 8 respectively while total operating expenses were held to a modest 2 3 increase this resulted in same store net operating income for the first quarter increasing 3 1 with physical occupancy averaging 95 2 revenue was driven by a combination of rent rate growth and improved occupancy our operating and maintenance expense was down 2 7 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as we began strategically rolling out cost saving measures including a national contract for our maintenance supplies we did see an increase in payroll but the additional expense is generally due to timing of adjustment for employee healthcare costs over the course of the year we expect the annual payroll expense to moderate i also want to remind everyone that our 3 1 same store net operating income increase is now calculated from 21 properties as compared to 10 properties in 2018 this new composition covers eight states and 13 msas versus the 2018 same store set which included only four states and seven msas it is also worth noting that our complete multifamily portfolio now consists of 32 properties with an average age of 5 2 years old turning to acquisitions while we did not acquire any multifamily properties during the first quarter we continue to see a deep pipeline of quality product we remain steadfast in our approach to purchase properties that have both the strong market and property level fundamentals and which are accretive during our period of ownership we did close on real estate loan investment of up to 10 8 million to construction of a 282 unit class a multifamily community located in destin florida this community is located in the heart of destin and we believe will serve the premier rental community from the area with the addition of this investment pac s multifamily loan investment portfolio consists of 14 multifamily projects totaling over 4 300 units we continue to see strong interest in our real estate loan investment program and have been successful in expanding our developer relationships over the last few years as we ve said before this loan investment program has been an integral part of our business model since our ipo and provides us the pipeline of new properties and carries embedded value with each loan that can be recognized in a variety of ways let me now call on joel murphy the president and chief executive officer of new market our retail division joel joel t murphy president and chief executive officer of new market properties llc thanks jeff we are pleased to report another strong quarter of overall operating performance the continued solid results for our growing grocery anchored portfolio are a result of the collaborative efforts of each of our team members from acquisitions to asset management leasing accounting and property management all working very hard every day to create value for pac and our stockholders we continue to execute our focused strategy to acquire invest in and operate grocery anchored centers that fit our investment criteria in quality suburban submarkets within the top 100 metro areas from the mid atlantic southeast florida and now through texas we target centers that have market dominant grocery store anchors that maintain a number one and number two market share in that sub market and have high and growing sales per square foot stores leasing space renewing tenants and keeping tenants happy is our daily focus at the end of the first quarter our 4 9 million square foot portfolio was 49 1 leased and our portfolio excluding redevelopments was 95 6 leased 14 of our 46 centers are 100 leased in 2019 we have eight grocery store anchors that have leases rolling and six of them have already renewed their leases at their contractual rates in early q1 we closed on gayton crossing a kroger chateau ph anchored shopping center in richmond virginia this is our second asset in virginia and our first in richmond it is located in the highly desirable western submarket and kroger has a very high volume store in the center gayton crossing is an excellent example of the focused strategy i just described anchored by a market leading grocer that has a high sales per square foot store and located in a quality sun belt or mid atlantic submarket with solid demographics we continue to implement our capital improvement and major repair and maintenance plans we are mindful to create long term value for each of our assets while providing a best in class environment from which our tenants do thrive these projects include ph led lighting and landscaping upgrades signage shopping center painting facade upgrades and new parking lots and roof replacements we executed on all cylinders in the first quarter we leased vacant space we kept our centers leased we renewed at higher rates we managed our expenses and had very little bad debt expense and we grew our portfolio the combination of these positive trends allowed our new market subsidiary to upstream outstanding results to pac as of today we now own 46 grocery anchored centers in eight states and 19 markets totaling approximately 4 9 million square feet with nearly 800 independent operating leases 23 of these centers are anchored by publix and 13 are anchored by the kroger harris teeter inaudible both publix and kroger are market share leaders with publix reporting adjusted net earnings for 2018 of 2 5 billion and kroger reporting 2018 adjusted net earnings of 1 7 billion technical difficulty active in the acquisition marketplace and while we have a deep chateau pipeline and are very focused on new opportunities we remain diligent to stay inside our tight geographic and product type strategy while also being very disciplined about our due diligence and our pricing let me now turn the call over to boone dupree the head of our office division boone boone dupree chief executive officer of preferred office properties llc thanks joel the first quarter for our office division featured an emphasis on asset management as we digested more than 1 million square feet of class a office properties that we acquired in 2018 we brought on several key new associates including our head of development jason frost vice president of asset management mahesh mani and associate tim peterson who supports the team across our different endeavors with these additions our capacity grows exponentially and we are happy to have them join us moving to the portfolio today we own and operate approximately 2 6 million square feet of class a office property the portfolio is 93 leased with approximately eight years of weighted average term remaining under those leases our most recent two investments capitol towers in charlotte and 150 fayetteville raleigh reflect the geographic focus which extends beyond charlotte and raleigh to include atlanta austin dallas and nashville these six primary markets share two important qualities in common first each features long term high growth trends in population job creation and wage gains this is driven generally by advantages in quality of life cost of living and business friendly political policy recent relocation and expansion announcements from alliance bernstein honeywell blackrock google apple amazon facebook and the list goes on all serve to affirm our thesis the second shared quality is our team s individual and collective experience investing operating and developing in these six primary markets in these markets over the last 10 years our senior leadership has acquired approximately 6 million square feet of class a office operated a cumulative portfolio totaling more than 11 million square feet and delivered new construction office development totaling more than 1 million square feet our business is at its core a leasing business and leasing is conducted at the local level so this depth of experience specific to our primary markets is fundamental to our success moving to updates from the portfolio despite no new closed investments in the quarter we had a lot going on in q1 project construction for 8west real estate loan investment in midtown atlanta is well under way with good preliminary interest to lease space in the 187 000 square foot building scheduled to deliver the second half of 2020 like many of pac s other real estate loan investments we have an option to purchase the development upon it stabilization at three ravinia subsequent to quarter end we were able to execute on a strategic lease transaction to incrementally reduce exposure to state farm s 2021 move out by taking back some space early collecting a termination payment and partially backfilling that space with a high quality high growth new customer the new customer will initially occupy one of the three floors state farm will return to us although they have expansion options they may elect to exercise in raleigh we kicked off an expansive renovation of 150 fayetteville including the building s lobbies plaza and other common areas to elevate the 30 storey property to premier stature at the top of the downtown raleigh market this project is scheduled to be substantially completed in late summer we re excited about the prospects of our business and confident in the strategy office demand is strong across our six primary markets and the pipeline in front of us is very full we will continue to work hard to uncover and execute on good risk adjusted opportunities to make money for our stockholders with that let me now turn the call over to paul cullen the head of preferred campus communities our student housing division paul paul cullen chief executive officer of preferred campus communities llc thanks boone our student housing strategy continues to focus on acquiring best in class properties located within walking distance to the center of the respective university campuses that have strong enrollment as of the end of the quarter preferred campus communities owned eight properties in five states across eight different universities totaling 6 095 beds interestingly the average age of our student housing portfolio is only four years old with increased inaudible across the portfolio and strong operating results in line with budget expectations we continue to see the benefit from our student housing management team s leasing efforts to gain additional spring leases and maintain stabilized occupancy levels at the end of the first quarter this year physical occupancy at our six stabilized student properties was 95 6 we see improved future performance at several assets related to the strong pre leasing velocity for their 2019 2020 academic year and are working toward stabilizing all of our assets despite the expansion of third party inventory at some of our markets our student housing management team is continuing its pre leasing efforts and we expect the team to deliver another strong lease up across the portfolio for the 2019 2020 school year in fact we ve already passed 80 lease ups for the entire portfolio for the 2019 2020 school year i want to take a moment to thank and acknowledge this team for all their efforts in particular brian harrison our asset manager preferred campus communities most recent acquisition of haven49 an 887 bed property located adjacent to the campus at umc charlotte with an enrollment of 30 000 students was initially part of our real estate development investment program this property offers our student housing division the opportunity to enter the extremely well located new asset at a growing university preferred campus communities has already begun implementing a takeover plan including capital projects with a focused marketing campaign to win over current and future residents in the brief period since acquisition there has been a number of meaningful increase in the pre leasing activity and the excitement around the new ownership is resulting in higher occupancy and rent growth although there were no new loan originations for student housing in this quarter we continue to pursue both debt and equity investments in new highly monetized properties neighboring top tier campuses as part of our student housing acquisition strategy and we remain active participants in many geographic markets finally we look to grow our student housing portfolio through disciplined investments while sustaining revenue growth and monitoring expenses at existing communities i look forward to updating you on the portfolio s performance on our next earnings call i will now turn the call back to dan dupree dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer thanks paul we expect 2019 to be a transformative year for pac as we seek to build a sustainable program of excellence we do this in part by leaning into our core strategy of investing into four distinct product classes we believe this strategy has served us well we are unique in that we raise capital both through the sale of our common stock to the public market and also through the sale of our preferred stocks through the independent broker dealer and ria channels we have significant capital coming in through the sale of the preferred every two weeks imagine what would happen if over the past two years our only option was to invest in multifamily assets which have seen unprecedented cap rate compression through product diversification we are able to invest efficiently and accretively we are fortunate to have strong leaders at the helms of our various business units to execute on their well defined targeted strategies we ve had some friends tell us that our cost to capital is too high with our preferred dividend at 6 our response is that if we were giving our stockholders a 3 to 4 total return over a number of years as many people in the public space do then we would agree that a 6 dividend was too high but in our case where we have given our common stockholders in excess of an 18 return since day one the 6 preferred cost is pretty darn attractive we are running an irr business in a quarterly reporting structure and we re ok with this i hope we always take the long view on our investments even though that might create short term lumpiness last quarter we signaled ffo guidance for 2019 in a range of 1 44 to 1 50 per share this guidance remains unchanged we also indicated that the second half of the year would be the better half that too remains unchanged quarter one was a pleasant result but we do not expect a similar result in quarter two our real estate loan investment program continues to grow in terms of the number of quality development groups who have invited us to participate in the capital stacks of their development we currently have over 484 ph million in loan commitments to 13 developers with approximately 338 3 million of the committed amount funded to date finally several weeks ago we filed an 8 k in which we acknowledged that we were on a preliminary basis exploring the feasibility of internalization as you can imagine there is a process to this and we really can t say any more on that subject as always our overriding objective is to create value through our investments while we have grown considerably in total assets in spring 2011 we are not driven by size we ve sold seven multifamily assets in the last 18 months simply because it was the right thing to do for the portfolio we will continue to put our current stockholders first and we expect we will continue to deliver on our promise of excellence with that i d like to thank you for joining us on our earnings call this morning and i d like to turn the call back to our operator to open the floor for any questions you may have operator questions and answers operator thank you thank you sir we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions first question is from mr michael lewis of suntrust please go ahead sir michael lewis suntrust analyst thank you dan i wanted to go back to something you just said about the guidance the low end of that 2019 range now implies 0 35 ph a quarter the rest of the year the high end is still only 0 37 you just said 0 39 in 1q and said that the back half is going to be better i guess may be walk me through that that that seems a little it seems a little confusing to me daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer befuddling yeah michael the our guidance remains unchanged i said at the beginning of my final statement that we expected this to be a transformative year there are a number of things that we re looking at to try to smooth out lumpiness the lumpiness as you know is created by the mezz loans they pay off when they pay off so we our outstandings on the mezz loan can can vary fairly wildly from quarter to quarter we re moving away from the notion of the purchase option discount we re recognizing more consistent gain through increase in accrued interest these are things that are going to take time and there are other fairly significant initiatives that we re looking into that may impact that may impact earnings over the year i think it may be a mistake but i think it s avalon bay they basically has a policy where where they don t alter guidance after first quarter results and for us with all the things that we re looking at and we feel very good about 2019 but looking thinking of all the things that we re looking at we just felt like making any change to guidance at this point would be premature michael lewis suntrust analyst okay i understand you re right about avalon bay and i appreciate the uncertainty my second question it looks like the deferred interest rate on a few of the loan investments decreased including this one in san jose which is your biggest one could you maybe give a little color what s causing that that to happen to additional loans daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer yeah well the main thing that s happening is there is an awful lot of capital chasing a finite number of deals there is no question that the mezz loans that we re doing today are less attractive than the ones we were doing at the beginning of the cycle so so it s a question of competition that particular deal in california they there was a there was a toggle in their in their loan with us that allow them to put in more equity and materially reduce the interest rate and the amount outstanding we basically renegotiated that deal midstream and you re right it does show a reduction in the accrued interest part but that s that is 100 a factor of competition for the for the mezz loan dollar and or the mezz loan opportunity that having been said we ve got more more developers now more high quality developers now that are seeking us out i think we ve got 13 different development groups now and we ve got we ve got multiple others that we re working on loans for so we re encouraged that we re going to be able to maintain the outstandings on the on the real estate loan investment probably between 450 million and 550 million in commitments but it s going to be spread out over a larger number of people but the deals are are very competitive michael lewis suntrust analyst okay and then just lastly lastly for me dan you mentioned managing the taking the long term view within this construct of quarters that could that could be up or down i think you ve also said in the past that apartments still offer the most attractive long term risk adjusted opportunity and irr i m just wondering if you still think that s true and how you kind of balance that with being accretive in the short term daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer well that i mean that s that s the trick i mean we re talking about a real estate company that i think is somewhat opportunistic investing in real estate which is a long term investment and then trying to fit it into quarterly results and one of the challenges is to not to not go overboard trying to force quarterly results at the expense of the long term deal but yeah generally speaking the irrs on multifamily as we underwrite our deals i think are continue to be compelling relative to the alternatives we get different things from different of our product types and for the moment i d say student housing probably operates much like multifamily joel at new market we re getting we re getting much better short term accretion benefit from his deals we re buying them at cap rates the most i mean the retail at maybe 100 basis points or more better than what we can buy the multifamily at but you ve got the anchor tenant that s got a fixed rent so you re not going to get the bumps over the hold the multifamily you get technical difficulty which puts real pressure on short term accretion but the irrs are good but the irr is a calculation that s predicated on what your assumptions are for exit cap rates we generally add about 50 basis points over the purchase price cap rate in the calculation but cap rates for multifamily are so low right now that even if you had ph 50 basis points in your irr calculation that may or may not be realistic down the road the office portfolio right now particularly with gaap accounting on straight line rents we get we get a nice pop generally on an acquisition from an accretion standpoint in the early years that kind of levels out because of straight line but we ve still been able to achieve 2 plus growth in that portfolio so our irrs on the multifamily right now probably look as good or better than i mean on the office look as good or better than the other areas that having been said we can properly underwrite an office building and assume that a tenant is going to move out in year seven and we re going to have to put in ti ph and we re going to have downtime and it can be baked into our irr but it don t change the fact and year seven it kind of stinks so our challenge is to blend all of this together into a cohesive unit and when i refer to the transformative aspects of this year we re working to try and to smooth out some of that while not losing the our commitment to value creation we re very serious about and very proud of that 18 2 total return to our shareholders since day one i don t know that we ll be able to sustain that level but i think we re going to outperform the market i hope so going forward i don t know if i answered a question in there but talked a long time michael surely there was some question that i answered wasn t there michael lewis suntrust analyst no you re uniquely positioned to comment on all these properties ph let s say and it helps no offense operator okay the next question is from jim lykins of d a davidson please go ahead jim lykins d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys so first with the difficulty in acquiring multifamily right now when you talk about that are you also including student housing or are you seeing some opportunities there versus the traditional multifamily daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer well it s not difficult to acquire multifamily it s just it s difficult to pay what they want you to pay jim lykins d a davidson analyst sure daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer but cap rates have compressed i think equally on multifamily and student housing they really do operate completely differently we put them together as a class because there are people sleeping in beds and in units that we provide but but they operate they do operate entirely differently so to answer your question the difficulty that exists because the cap rates in multifamily extends to student housing jim lykins d a davidson analyst okay and and for the purchase options are there or is there any color you can give us on how we should be thinking about that or if your assumptions have changed versus where we were last quarter daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer well it was always a source of frustration for us that particularly early in the cycle there was there was significant value in the purchase options and it was never reflected in earnings anywhere other than maybe being sort of amortized over the hold of an asset we made a decision a while ago to start figuring out how we could recognize the the value of those purchase options and monetize them into ffo which we ve done we sort of morphed from that point to the point where we re opting to increase our our accrued interest in new deals that we re originating and eliminating the discount which was always difficult to calculate and coupling that with a right of first offer so that we continue to control the asset that we re basically recognizing recognizing the economic value of the deals on a quarterly basis and that goes again to my point that we want to smooth out some of the lumpiness in our in our earnings calls jim lykins d a davidson analyst okay and and one last one dan you mentioned internalization i know there s not a lot that you can talk about now but is there just any kind of rough timeline on when we might know something else or maybe what to expect daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer well jim there are there are two lawyers that we have on staff and three counting lenny and four counting joel if i if i say anything more than what we put out in the 8 k i m going to be beaten up but we ve always said that from time to time this was something that we needed to look at so that s what we re doing jim lykins d a davidson analyst okay thanks dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer thank you jim operator the next question is from merrill ross of boenning scattergood please go ahead merrill ross boenning scattergood analyst good morning i think over time i ve been following you for quite some time the key has been in the mezzanine loan program that allows you to buy assets at relative discount in multifamily and that s extended now to some development in upstream housing and on office as you grow your group of contractors is there any inclination to add another asset class and continue the path of diversification or is it more likely that you stay concentrated in the group before that you re currently focused on daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer merrill honestly i would tell you that when we started the when the company was started even though john and lenny left room for us to invest in something other than multifamily the expectation is that we would be we would be very much a multifamily focused company we diversified into retail when we realized cap rates were compressing our ability to raise capital was increasing and candidly that we had access to joel murphy with whom i had worked for a number of years in retail so so those things coming together led us to diversify into retail about that time one of our developers that we had worked with wanted to get into student housing we thought that that was a logical extension of our multifamily business which as i mentioned a minute ago has proven to be more more different than we had originally thought and then the office thing was more serendipitous so what i would tell you is is that we have no plans at all at this point to expand beyond the groups that we re in right now we re really lucky because we have we have i think excellent expertise leading the four units that we have but i can t i can t foresee an expansion beyond where we are but again we re an opportunistic company and if something were to come along that made a lot of sense then we would then we would certainly explore it and i want to i want to stress the point that i made an earlier comment what creates the need for this for us being a diversified reit is the fact that we have this money coming in every two weeks we have to be able to invest that capital accretively and efficiently and quickly and it s an absolute necessity that we have some level of diversification that gives us the opportunity to do that merrill ross boenning scattergood analyst yeah point taken thank you daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes the question and answer session i d like to hand the conference back over to mr dan dupree free for any closing remarks excuse me sir there is actually another question registered by rick murray of sorin capital rick murray sorin capital analyst hi good morning i was just curious if you could help us understand a little bit better what your definition of recurring capex is because it just seems that the 1 2 million per quarter that you recorded this quarter is really low for a portfolio your size daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer well rick i think the recurring capex is a function of the age of the portfolio as much as anything else we focus on high quality newer assets and those newer assets have lower capex requirements and i think that s been a historical trend as well yeah we make a real point of of the fact that our portfolio in multifamily is by our measure far and away the youngest in the industry paul cullen speaking on student housing mentioned four year old on average portfolio i think we re about 5 2 years old on our multifamily and that s not by accident it s because it gives us the opportunity to control capex we re not likely to have any roofs that need to be replaced in fact the seven assets that we ve sold over the last 18 months they were in each case sequentially the oldest asset we had at that time and it was and it was because we didn t want to get involved in capital expenditures for which we would not receive increased rent people expect you their roof to be to be good and sound and there s space to be dry they expect their parking lots to be paved and set up and these are all things that require significant capital if you hold assets long enough it is a material advantage to us when you compare us against our great other multifamily companies in the space you compare the ages of our portfolios and you ll see a marked advantage for us in this particular regard rick murray sorin capital analyst okay that s helpful thank you is there a way you could provide us any sense of the distribution of the capex by sort of the property types daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer no we don t we don t disclose that rick murray sorin capital analyst okay daniel m dupree chairman of the board chief executive officer right i think that ought to conclude the call we really appreciate your involvement your interest in the company and look forward to talking to you next quarter thank you operator ladies and

outlined in our related 8 k filing and with that i ll turn it over to craig craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks jin appreciate it yeah i ll begin with page 3 and the highlights of our q1 results and i begin by saying we had a good start to the year with another strong quarter of performance earnings per share were 1 23 on a gaap basis and 1 26 excluding the impact of the divestiture costs related to the announced spin off of our lighting business at 1 26 our results were 15 above last year and toward the higher end of our guidance range which as you ll recall was 1 18 to 1 28 our sales were 5 3 billion up 4 organically and in line with our guidance excluding the negative 3 impact from currency and we continue to be pleased with our strong margin performance segment margins were 16 above the high end of our guidance range and 80 basis points over prior year we also generated very strong operating cash flows of 551 million in the quarter and this is up 63 from q1 18 and a first quarter record and lastly we repurchased 150 million of shares in the quarter as part of our plan to buy back 400 million of shares in 2019 so a very good start to the year page 4 summarizes our income statement versus prior year and i ve covered most of these items in the summary comments and so i ll only point out once again the 3 currency impact was driven primarily by the important currencies for us which are the euro renminbi and real we re very pleased with our 32 incremental rate that we delivered on organic growth and so that number was once again very strong and above our expectations and we incurred as we mentioned the 0 03 per share from the after tax cost primarily related to the spin of our lighting business and as you can see adjusted earnings per share increased from 9 advertisement advertisement next we summarize the quarterly results of our electrical products segment revenue here increased 2 which includes 5 organic growth partially offset by 3 currency and we see particularly strength here in commercial and in residential construction with global growth rates in the mid to high single digits and even stronger in the us markets our orders increased 4 led by continued stroke strength and growth in the americas and our backlog grew double digits up 13 in the quarter segment operating profits grew 8 and operating margins were 120 basis points increase to 18 9 and this was a record for q1 and we re actually pleased with how well the segment is performing and the consistency of results that we continue to see in this part of the company moving to page 6 we cover our electrical systems and services results revenues here increased 6 with organic growth of 8 partially offset by 2 currency and we saw especially strong double digit revenue growth in commercial construction and in data centers we continued to have solid momentum in this business and the year had started on a high note for sure you ll recall that our original guidance is for sales to be up 5 to 6 organically for the year and so we re certainly running above that rate as we indicated at our investor conference in march we ve moved to a rolling 12 month basis for reporting our orders in this long cycle business as well as in our aerospace business that i ll cover soon on a rolling 12 month basis es s orders actually increased 8 with strength in all major end markets and regions advertisement advertisement and maybe i ll just pause for a moment on the orders here in the electrical systems and services because i know it s a particular point of question that many of you have and i will tell you that our es s activity level is absolutely performing in line and perhaps maybe even a little bit better than what we anticipated and we talked about this idea of moving to the rolling 12 months because we do in fact see a lot of let s say call it lumpiness in the orders that we get in electrical systems and services driven primarily by what we re seeing in hyperscale data centers and the other indicator that we have that gives us a lot of confidence in the strength of this business is is what we call negotiations and our negotiations in this business in q1 were an all time record and up some 56 from prior year and so despite what we re seeing actually in the orders and what some of you have reported to be a little bit of weakness versus what we saw in q4 the overall underlying activity in this business continues to be very very strong our backlog continued to grow it was up 11 in the quarter we generated strong operating leverage with operating profits increasing 15 only 8 volume growth and margins increasing a 100 basis points to 13 1 you ll also recall that we announced the acquisition of the ulusoy electric business in january we re pleased to have closed the purchase on april 15th and then this acquisition will certainly provide a strong platform for us as we serve our customers in emea and the asia pacific markets so once again a really strong performance in our electrical systems and services business and we continue to be quite bullish on the for the outlook for that business as we go forward on the next page we summarize our hydraulics results for q1 revenues were down 3 with 1 organic growth more than offset by a 4 currency i ll certainly note that we had some tough comps in this business at 6 organic growth in q1 18 but revenue did slow slightly more than we expected but i would probably note here only slightly more than what we had in our original plans for the year advertisement advertisement organic growth of 1 reflected continued growth in construction equipment but some declines in ag and in industrial equipment our orders stepped down 11 driven principally by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and we also had tough comps here as well from last year where orders were up some 14 backlog declined 6 in the quarter as well and as we detailed at our investor conference we continue to work through some inefficiencies in the business but do expect to see strong margin performance in this business in the second half of the year as we work off some of the efficiency issues that we experienced in the second half of last year and segment margins were 11 7 down 100 basis points versus last year and on page 8 we summarize our q1 results for the aerospace business and as you can see this business just continues to perform at a very high level delivering record performance across almost every single metric our revenues increased 10 a 11 organic growth and 1 negative currency like es s we moved to a rolling 12 month basis for reporting orders and on this basis orders increased 18 with particular strength in commercial transport military fighters military transport and both commercial and military aftermarket so really strength across the board in this segment our backlog also increased significantly up some 21 in the quarter and lastly we demonstrated very strong incremental margins with labor to add to a 30 increase and operating profits and a 300 basis point margin improvement in the quarter operating margins of 23 1 another all time high for the business so in addition to the volume growth we also experienced some favorable product mix in the quarter but really strong execution by the team overall next i ll move to a summary of our vehicle segment our revenues were down 9 which includes 6 reduction in organic growth and a negative 3 from currency the organic sales decline was driven by a combination of declines in like global vehicle markets which were down 45 and the ongoing impact of revenue transfers to the eaton cummins joint venture and i will note that the joint venture actually saw revenue increases of 27 in the quarter and continues to perform very well we also had tough comps in this business with organic growth which increased 13 last year but overall this business is really performing as we ve expected but with a little bit of weakness in global automotive markets advertisement advertisement for the year we continue to expect nafta class 8 production to be at 324 000 units flat with 2018 but we have lowered our outlook for low for light vehicle markets for the year and lastly despite the lower volumes operating margins increased 30 basis points to 15 1 and a decrement of margin on the organic of less than 20 so really strong execution by the team once again in our vehicle business and wrapping up our segment summaries we ll cover our emobility segment on page 10 revenues were up 8 which includes 9 organic growth partially offset by 1 currency and as planned we continue to accelerate our r d spending which increased by some 130 in the quarter so we continue to invest heavily in this segment to participate in what we think is really an exciting growth opportunity as we move forward we re certainly optimistic about the opportunities in this rapidly developing market and our pursuit pipeline for new programs has actually now grown to 1 1 billion at our investor conference in march we did announce a new program win of a 100 million mature year revenue for traction and inaudible with a major global oem customer and actually in mid april we announced that psa is the customer for this program this was our first significant event since creating the segment about one year ago and we re certainly ahead of our original schedule for growth in this segment and well on our way to accreting what we think is going to be a new 2 billion to 4 billion segment for the company overall advertisement advertisement at this point i ll turn to our outlook for 2019 which is on page 11 we now expect organic revenues for all of eaton to grow approximately 4 down slightly from our prior midpoint of 4 5 and this is largely the result of us increasing our guidance for our long cycle businesses by reducing guidance for our short cycle businesses specifically we increased organic growth rates by 1 for both es s and aerospace and for hydraulics we lowered organic growth by 2 at the midpoint to 3 to 4 based upon some slow growth expectations in global mobile equipment markets and for vehicle coming off what i d say really was a weak q1 in light vehicle markets we lowered our organic growth rate by 3 points at the midpoint and now we expect organic growth to be down some 4 to 5 and once again due to primarily the automotive side of the business itself and we ve not changed electrical products or emobility and our margin expectations are noted on page 12 we are modestly raising our guidance from 17 1 to 17 5 or 17 3 at the midpoint we re lowering the margin expectations for hydraulics by 60 basis points to 13 4 to 14 and for vehicle by 90 basis points to 16 5 to 17 1 due to lower organic growth primarily but this is more than offset by increases in electrical products and in aerospace margins our new expectation for electrical products is for margins to be between 19 and 19 6 a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint and the new expectation for aerospace is for margins to be 21 8 to 22 4 also a 40 basis point increase at the midpoint and the other two segments remain unchanged so at the midpoint 17 3 and this would naturally be another record level of performance for eaton overall and lastly on page 13 we summarize our guidance for q2 and for the year for q2 we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between 1 45 and 1 55 and at the midpoint this represents an 8 increase over last year other assumptions in our guidance include we re expecting 4 organic growth foreign exchange impact of roughly 100 million our margin expectation for the quarter is that have margins between 17 2 and 17 6 we d expect our corporate cost to be flat with q2 of 18 and we d expect the tax rate of between 13 5 and 14 5 for the full year 2019 we re raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to 5 72 to 6 02 for the midpoint of 5 87 which includes essentially a 0 02 impact from the full year impact of the acquisition of ulusoy overall at the midpoint this continues to represent a 9 increase over 2018 other full year guidance assumptions include organic revenue growth of 4 we d expect 100 million of revenue from the ulusoy acquisition we expect foreign exchange impact to be 300 million and this is a 50 million increase from prior guidance we d expect as i mentioned segment margin of 17 3 and really no change to the other items in our forecast advertisement advertisement so in summary i d say another strong start for the year in q1 we re well positioned to deliver another year of record results and we re absolutely thrilled with the way that the company is performing overall so with that i ll turn it back to yan for q a yan jin senior vice president investor relations okay thanks craig before we begin the q a session of our call today i do see we have members of individuals peers ph that in the queue is present so given our time constraint over to be an hour today and our desire to get to as many of these questions as possible please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow up so with that i will turn it over to our operator to give you guys the guidance questions and answers operator operator instructions yan jin senior vice president investor relations okay we ll take our first question from joe ritchie with goldman sachs joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst craig could you maybe expand on your comments on commercial and data centers being up double digits in ess this quarter we heard some conflicting news especially in the data center side out of the supply chain and so any other further color you can provide there would be helpful craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah now the only thing i d tell you that overall the data center market for us continues to perform very well we are still running as i mentioned our revenue is up double digit for data center sales activity levels continue to be quite strong i think the piece that i that we re trying to clarify for the sake of all of you who follow the company that data center orders especially when you when it comes to the hyperscale they tend to be quite lumpy so you ll get a big slug of orders in one quarter and they ll be lighter the next quarter and so that s why we made this decision to really move to a rolling 12 months because we think it more accurately reflects the underlying economic activity that we re seeing in that market but for us we still see very good strength and data center activity overall and we continue to think that s going to be one of our fastest growing segments i mentioned once again we take a look at negotiations which is the level which for us is a good proxy for the level of economic activity that s taking place in the market and as i mentioned we re really experiencing record levels of activity in our electrical systems and services business but negotiation is up 56 in the quarter to record levels and so by and large we ve really seen no let up in activity in electrical systems and services and data centers continues to be a bright spot for us joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst and craig within commercial what are the verticals that are really driving the strength there craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say we re really seeing pretty broad based strengths in the commercial businesses overall and certainly oil and gas is has come back and we mentioned this to strengthen data centers we richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer yeah for example if you look at straight up commercial like office and government both up just over 10 institutional just a little bit under that but we are seeing broad based strength in the commercial side of things and if you look at some of the governmental data c30 reports except for our the new dodge report europe has seen numbers that are high single digit even low double digits so it it s all pretty consistent craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer right it s all of it s broad too and we re seeing also strength really around the world as well and in commercial businesses in general so it s not just in the us market joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst now that s helpful maybe my follow on just on the hydraulics business you know it s interesting because it sounded like when we had met intra quarter that hydraulics had maybe gotten off to a better start in january february and you ve talked about this this business and all your businesses meeting to kind of earn the right to be part of the portfolio yet we ve taken guidance down already to start the year and so can you just kind of contextualize how the quarter went with hydraulics and then also in terms of like how it fits with the portfolio longer term craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer first of all i d say as we ve talked about and recovered during our investor day in general that we have some work to do to fix what i d call some self inflicted wounds associated with some short move transition site transition that we re managing internally as an organization and we always believed that was going to be more of a kind of a second half kind of resolution to some of the internal issues i think the new news for us in the hydraulics business in terms of what really drove the reduction guidance is largely some of the weakness that we re seeing in some of our end markets and so i d say operationally as we acknowledge we still have work to do to fix some of our own inefficiencies and our teams are working that and we certainly would expect that stuff to be flushed through the system by the time we hit the second half of the year but the new piece is really some of the weakness that we re seeing largely in some of the mobile equipment market and i d say that our orders were certainly weak in q1 if you take a look at some of our customers all the names that you know well i d say their sales are holding up better than our orders are and so there could be a better outlook as we look forward we re not sure to what extent there s some inventory repositioning taking place in this segment but right now it s really more a function of weaker volumes and at this point i d say as we think about hydraulics as a part of eaton overall today we have a plan and the plan is a plan that we believe in and our team is executing that plan and we fully expect the hydraulics team to fix their operational issues and turn that into a business that we can all be proud of and would anticipate keeping as a part of the company but for hydraulics no different to any other part of the company we have expectations that we call all of our businesses accountable to and we would expect them to meet the criteria that we set and if we can t meet the criteria for hydraulics or for any part of the company we are willing to act when necessary joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question is coming from jeff sprague with vertical research jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst good morning i was wondering if you could just come back to ess one more time anyhow and just give us some color on what negotiation is up 36 ph really means obviously it sounds good is that kind of a project value in dollars was there some kind of low ebb in q1 last year that results in that being such a big healthy number and what kind of typical conversion rate would you have on kind of a negotiation craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah no i mean i the first thing i ll just answer is kind of the question around noise there is absolutely nothing in q1 of last year that would suggest that we had a low bar to clear as i mentioned it not only was higher than q1 last year but it was a record all time level and was significantly higher than any other quarter during the course of 2018 and i think just as you articulate this is essentially the number of bid and quotations that we re making to our various customers on large projects that we bid on during the course of the period and so it really for us is probably the best proxy for the level of underlying economic activity that we have in that business so we think it s a really strong indicator of the fact that this business a long cycle business that we d expect to be performing very well at this point in the cycle is actually performing very much like we anticipate richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer and it will take time for some of these negotiation bids to become final bids typically 90 days to 180 days sometimes a little longer for big projects but yet it is quite notable just how strong the activity levels are jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst and just as a follow up separately on ulusoy is it 0 02 accretive for the year and therefore the sole reason for the guide or you d actually more than that and there s maybe a negative offset somewhere else in the equation richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer no it s 0 02 accretive and the way to think about it jeff is it s really 0 04 accretive but we have 0 02 of our estimate right now of amortization of intangible costs and so that s how it ends up at 0 02 jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst great thank you craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer but we are in fact holding all the other elements of the guide for the core business and so no change at all jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question is coming from scott davis from melius research scott davis melius research analyst right good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning scott richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer good morning scott davis melius research analyst just to be clear the reason why you re not raising margin guidance on ess is that because of mix and largely just because of the data center volumes is that correct craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer and i d say that first of all i d say early in the year i d say that our forecast for margins in es s is certainly today within the range that we set for the year and a lot of the growth to your point is coming from projects and so we ll have to wait and see how that plays out but right now i would not in any way take it as a sign of concern about margins in our es s business things are going quite well and we are very pleased with our margins in q1 and there s nothing today that i d say that would suggest that if there s anything to be concerned about scott davis melius research analyst okay and the inaudible just kind of get your take craig on some of the m a that s out there i mean you ve got a couple of competitors who have announced really big deals nothing seems cheap they all seem to be relatively fully priced but what s your take on the market out there and the likelihood that eaton participates i guess there s two ways to think about it you could be a seller of assets into this market of strength as easily as you could be a buyer of assets so how do you think about that at in the current craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer the first thing with respect to pricing and asset values in as you can see by some of the transactions that have been announced i mean these properties are going for extraordinary prices we have prided ourselves on the fact that we said we re going to be disciplined through this cycle and we think that our cost of capital continues to be 8 to 9 and we want to deliver 300 basis points over our cost of capital and so we will continue to be a disciplined buyer into a market that looks like assets being priced at extraordinary levels and so i d say that we today are looking at probably more deals than we have in a very long time and so we have a very active pipeline as well but we will make the commitment as we have in the past we re not going to chase deals with what i d say are unattractive returns when you look at their cash on cash set of financial metrics so that s kind of the way we look at it scott davis melius research analyst but the other side of that obviously craig as you could sell something i mean if people are willing to pay for a price and maybe now is the time to think about partnering with some of maybe a more cyclical stocks is that a possibility craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah what i d say is first of all i d say we took a look at our businesses strategically through the cycle and so as we think about the portfolio itself and how we hold to a seller we re really trying to look at them over the long term period and whether or not we think this is going to be a good strategic hole based upon the criteria that we established through the cycle now having said that to your point if you have come to a decision that you want to exit as asset now would be a great time to do it but we generally take a longer term let s say more strategic view of the portfolio in terms of things that we want to businesses that we want to be in versus businesses that we would choose to exit scott davis melius research analyst that s fair thank you and good luck to you guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer all right thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question from nicole deblase with deutsche bank nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yeah thanks good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer good morning nicole nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst so i just want to focus a little bit on hydraulics i know organic growth was 1 this quarter looks like in your full year guidance you ve brought it down a little bit but you re still basically implying some improvement organic growth throughout the year so i guess i m curious what s driving that conviction and maybe just frame that with how demand progressed throughout the quarter if there was any sign of improvement in march or into early april craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i d say that maybe to take your first question right out of the gate in terms of certainly we re implying a little bit stronger growth in the back half of the year than we delivered in q1 as i mentioned in my opening commentary that 1 organic growth was actually within 1 of our internal plan and so we are actually not off our internal plan by a measurable amount in q1 and the comps get easier quite frankly as we as the year moves on and we have very specific programs that we re working on as a company that will also help boost growth as we look into some of the out quarters very specific initiatives that we re working on that have been largely bedded down that are going to help improve our growth and the other thing i would tell you is that if you take a look at the major end markets that we serve construction equipment ag equipment two of our big important markets in hydraulics and you look at what our customers are saying in most cases they re still forecasting growth for the year they re forecasting low single digit kind of growth levels and so we do believe that there was a little bit of inventory correction that took place in q1 that probably also held down our relative growth rate nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst okay got it thanks craig and then just shifting to aerospace the margin performance was really impressive this quarter was there anything special going on there is it a mix impact that isn t sustainable throughout the rest of the year just because the full year guidance implies a little bit less margin expansion than we saw in the first quarter craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean it certainly was a record quarter for margins in aerospace an all time record not just a record for q1 and i would say that we did have a bit of favorable mix in q1 our aftermarket business on a relative basis was a bit stronger than our core oe business and that certainly was a help for the quarter but also the growth in the volume as well also helped push things up and so i would say principally it was more a function of the mix of customers and the mix of oe aftermarket that really led to a really strong q1 performance that is probably not sustainable at those levels but as you can see we are forecasting margins for aerospace that are once again at record levels and i d say even in many cases industry leading levels nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst got it thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question comes from ann duignan with jpmorgan ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst hi guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi ann richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer hi ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst just back to ess again i know you said bidding is up significantly but traditionally what kind of success rates would you have would do have been what percent win versus not win have you had craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer we have pretty strong market share ann in our businesses as you know i mean in our electrical systems and services business a lot of this activity is in the americas market and we have industry leading shares in this business and so our win rate is going to be very much consistent with our underlying market share so we do believe that this bidding activity will translate ultimately to growth in our business ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst okay that s helpful color appreciate it and then back to hydraulics also i have to ask the question about north american agriculture of course maybe you could talk about what your customers are saying there is that where the weakness was in the quarter in term of orders and given how bad farmer sentiment is in the us would you anticipate that maybe staying weaker than expected for the full year craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean you re absolutely right that sales were actually quite decent in ag in q1 but the order rates in ag was down and to your point it s farm incomes and underlying commodity prices being as weak as they are that we think are certainly dampening some of the enthusiasm for the outlook in ag markets and i think our call on ag for the year we felt like it s kind of a low single digit kind of grower for the year but we do think that there is at least a cautionary kind of sentiment that s in the market today in and around ag in general ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst yeah i would think we would have a similar view of the ag market for 19 and maybe even into 20 okay i ll leave it there just get back in line most of my other questions were answered thanks craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer okay yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question come from nigel coe with wolfe research nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning guys richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer hi craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi nigel nigel coe wolfe research analyst just come back to hydraulics and the backlog was down i think 11 and i understand the backup is coming off a very high level but i m just wondering to get to your sort of 4 to 5 growth for the remainder of the year in hydraulics do have to see orders come back positive or can we still achieve that targets with orders remaining flat to negative craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah yeah the backlog nigel was actually down 6 nigel coe wolfe research analyst sorry craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer versus last year but do not no problem at all but i think the spirit of your question is once again very much like the question asked earlier what gives us confidence that we can deliver the growth and the outlook for the year and i will say that while the backlog is down it s still running at very very high levels from a historical perspective and so we and obviously the comparisons in general the comps in general get easier as the year wears on and i think that s really the big message with respect to orders with respect to sales is that you have relatively easier comps as the year unwinds we have some very specific initiatives that we have put in place as a company that are going to give us some growth that have been very well identified and we think once again that while there is a little bit of caution in the market we do believe that the two big markets of ag and construction continue to grow down the year nigel coe wolfe research analyst okay great and then my follow on question is the three point delta on the vehicle outlook and obviously we re looking at the light vehicle markets significantly weaker so that s explainable because i m just wondering given the complexity in the segments how much of that revenue delta is caused by a shift between your legacy transmission business and the cummins jv was that a factor at all any help there would be great craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean think in terms of the you say the 3 point reduction in the growth for the quarter i d say that was really driven principally by the weakness in global light vehicle markets around the world and you see the same data that we see i mean china was down 10 europe was down for say 3 to 4 the americas was down a couple of points and so most of that weakness i d say is really in the global light vehicle market we do have by the way as i mentioned in my commentary as the world moves from mails to automated transmissions we continue to move more revenue into the joint venture with cummins and that is a piece of what s going on in that business and the other one by the way that i ll put it on the table because it becomes a much bigger impact in terms of the legacy business as we move forward as the world moves to electrification and the emobility segment that also become revenue that comes out of our legacy vehicle business and shows up in emobility and so there are a number of factors that are going on that perhaps make the underlying revenue growth and our vehicle business look worse than it really is nigel coe wolfe research analyst okay craig we will dig in offline thanks very much craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst just two on epg one can you just talk about what s driving the margin bump without a change in sales and then two just as the lighting spend has been announced have you gotten any indications of interest that maybe a sale is likely or more likely than it s been thanks craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yes i d say on the margins largely in epg i d say primarily we re getting better execution and better conversion in the business than we originally anticipated when we put the plan together and so it really complements to the team for really executing and delivering on some of the cost out initiatives that we put in the plan and so things are just going a little better than what we anticipated and that s kind of what drove the increase in guidance for the year as we mentioned in terms of lighting first of all i d say that the process is moving along as we anticipated and the prime path continues to be to spin the business and we still expect to be ready to make sure that we can get that done by the end of the year to your point specifically around outside interest yes as you can imagine there has been a number of companies who raised an interest in potentially acquiring the business and inaudible it s always good to have an option in of choice and so we will be obviously working through these two alternatives but once again the prime path that we re on is to spin the business jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just macro level on europe i mean there s been some talk about slowing there you mentioned the auto can you just talk about any areas of resilience or particular weakness in europe thanks craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think to your point around the macro environment in europe and we all see the economic data coming out of germany would suggest that we are in fact seeing some slowdown in growth in europe overall then we ve seen that as well across many of our businesses certainly seen it specifically in the short cycle businesses i d say very much like we are seeing in the us the long cycle businesses continue to perform well in europe so electrical systems and services and data centers specifically in europe aerospace obviously the global industry is doing well and so i think we ve seen i could perhaps on an accentuated basis more or less the continuation of the same trends that we re seeing globally but no question europe is a bit weaker it s a bit weaker when you think about industrial markets and industrial controls and the like but it s all incorporated in our guidance and we think that europe essentially is not going to be terribly different than what we assumed when we put our profit plan together jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks guys yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next questions comes from andrew obin with bank of america andrew obin baml analyst yes guys good morning thanks for taking my call craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer sure richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer hi andrew obin baml analyst just a question on china can you talk about sort of china progression during the quarter frankly i would have expected mobile china hydraulics to be a bigger positive so i was just surprised that they didn t move the needle as much and if you can give us any color as to how april is developing in china thank you craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i will say to your point i mean china started off the year quite weak in january and march was a much better month and we see that and certainly the gdp data and the ip data specifically coming out of china even automotive markets were relatively speaking stronger in the month of march than they were in the first two months of the year and so i d say a lot of the economic stimulus that the chinese government is putting into place are early indicators but it would suggest that it is having the desired impact and so we think china probably continues to strengthen from this point forward eaton overall revenues actually grew in q1 in china as a company so it was despite the fact that we had some weakness in automotive markets we actually saw strong mid single digit growth in china specifically and to your point yeah the hydraulics the excavator market was quite strong up some 24 i believe in q1 it s an important market for us but it s obviously not big enough to move the needle given some of the offsets in other regions and other segments that are part of that business but we do think china improves as we look forward richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer and andrew if you look at some of the construction metrics in china they were pretty positive in q1 and got more positive as the quarter went on so offer starts are up i think 18 and residential starts were up 12 so you are seeing a lot of the stimulus in china start flowing into somebody s construction related markets andrew obin baml analyst and just the second question you definitely highlighted strength in oil and gas can you give us more color sort of upstream midstream downstream and maybe some color what specifically you re seeing at inaudible thank you craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah no i d say we talked about we re definitely seeing strength in oil and gas and we think our business in the oil and gas that we had a good first quarter of revenue a good first quarter of orders and we think in the market in 2019 kind of grows mid to high single digits and then there as a company we play more downstream than we do upstream and so we are more exposed to that piece of the market but we do think you saw the rig count is up somewhat 9 or so in q1 and so we do think oil and gas continues to strengthen and that s what we re seeing in our business as well richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer and we re benefiting from some of these large downstream projects for example some of these lng facilities that are being configured now and petrochemical and so we re definitely more slanted toward downstream type applications andrew obin baml analyst and how fast does it hit your backlog that oil price moves do you see it immediately or is there a lag craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i d say there s generally a lag i mean we ve got i have not studied that question in a lot of detail andrew but there s clearly a lag from the move in oil price to them putting in place capacity to increase drilling or exploration and certainly given the fact that we re downstream and the libor probably will even be bigger for us than it would be for companies who are more exposed on the upstream side andrew obin baml analyst perfect thank you so much yan jin senior vice president investor relations next question is from deane dray with rbc deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer hi deane dray rbc capital markets analyst hi deane hey maybe just touch on some of the variables in the quarter broadly that the number of the other industrial companies have called out as either a factor or not a factor so i didn t hear anything particular about weather was did that come into play and you talked about the inventory adjustments did any that you see any of your business experience a pull in out of the first quarter into the fourth quarter last year and might that have been a factor this quarter craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer and i d say deane we try to stay away from those kind of tangential elements around weather and the light because it s really difficult to ascertain how that impacted your business and so at this point i d say that was weather an impact in q1 it could have been was it big enough to fundamentally change the outlook or kind of the thesis on the year i d say probably not and to the point around pull ins we really didn t see over any material pull ins as well at the end of let s say q4 that would have impacted our q1 business and so really none of these extraneous variables i d say would have had a material impact on the results in q1 deane dray rbc capital markets analyst that s fair and did you say how april started craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer no we didn t but i d say very much in line with the guidance that we just provided for q2 we d expect 4 growth and i d say that what you re going to likely continue to see is that our long cycle businesses electrical systems and services and aerospace and electrical products will continue to perform very well and as we mentioned part of the reason why we ve taken the guidance down in the short cycle business so once again i think the company s revenue story is really playing out very much like we anticipated perhaps with more extremes with more strength in the long cycle stuff offsetting perhaps a bit of weakness in the short cycle businesses deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer thank you richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer okay yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question comes from andy casey with wells fargo andy casey wells fargo analyst thanks craig good morning everybody craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning andy casey wells fargo analyst i apologize to beat a dead horse a little bit here but on the hydraulics margin decline and the reduced margin outlook is some of that specifically the q1 compression is some of that related to accelerated restructuring craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah no i d say that not really andy i mean we obviously are continuing to do restructuring in our business in hydraulics and so i d say the margin compression really is largely a function of volume as we articulated earlier and not because we re doing significantly more restructuring in the business now i won t say a lot of focus obviously in hydraulics and we certainly understand why at the end of the day hydraulics as a segment accounts for less than 10 of our profits and so i think we have a really strong story in a lot of our other businesses that are just performing extraordinarily well and more than making up quite frankly for the little bit of a shortfall that we re having in hydraulics business but no it s really not restructuring it s really more volume and decrementals on the change in volume andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thanks craig and then within electrical products we highlighted some strength in residential which a little bit surprising given some of the macro data that we ve been seeing is that share gains or what are you seeing there craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean resi for us it was really a standout performer quite frankly in q1 where we saw strong revenue growth and strong order growth and we think that largely we do think this is essentially this factor of as you move to higher valued electrical equipment with afcis and ground fault and the regulations and the codes that are driving standards are certainly helping that business but by and large just as you know housing prices are up we re seeing a lot of remodels that that don t show up necessarily in the housing start data but we continue to be quite bullish on resi and that s certainly played out in q1 richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer we based on the data we believe we have taken some care but the market overall for resi electrical equipment is pretty strong that s what the mean data would show and our belief is that that is likely to last throughout this year craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer we think resi construction is up our business taking up mid to high single digits for the year so it s really a source of strength we think for the company andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thank you very much yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question come from john walsh with credit suisse john walsh credit suisse analyst hi good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning john john walsh credit suisse analyst i guess maybe a question on the margin can you talk a little bit about how the price versus commodity inflation i guess tariff bucket performed in the quarter and how you re thinking about that cadence for the balance of the year craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you appreciate the question i mean certainly as we said in the past and q1 played out that way and we think the year as well is that we think price versus cost we think will be largely neutral for the company commodity prices as you ve probably all certainly noted have abated a little bit and the copper probably is the one holdout where copper prices are still running at relatively high levels but most of the other commodities that are important to the company we ve seen commodity costs reduce and so obviously that s a good thing for the company but also as we think about price and cost being kind of natural offsets for each other less inflation we see the less price we see though the less tariff driven cost increases that we see we obviously can t pass that price in the marketplace so we re very comfortable for 2019 that pricing cost will be largely neutral very much like our guidance has been john walsh credit suisse analyst great and then maybe one more way to attack the negotiations comment it doesn t sound like you want to give the absolute number but is there a way to give it as a multiple of revenue in the business just to kind of frame the size a little bit more craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer the size of negotiations as a percentage of revenue john walsh credit suisse analyst yeah or the absolute number i mean a couple of people have attacked it around what the 56 increase means year on year just craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say for us i mean we d really like not to give you a number but i would tell you that it is a big enough number to give confidence and to be indicative of what the future of the business looks like it is a very large very material number john walsh credit suisse analyst great thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays julian mitchell barclays analyst hi thanks for squeezing me and maybe just a question around the short cycle businesses particularly vehicle and hydraulics worsening revenue outlook in both versus your prior guide but you sound intensely relaxed about the cost outlook i just wondered why maybe there wasn t a bit more urgency around cost reduction in both businesses in the face of the worst top line outlook and then on vehicle it may just be something smaller or something in the mix but i think you had a sort of low double digit decremental margin in q1 the guide for the year implies maybe a 30 decremental for the year as a whole so is there something changing in terms of mix or what have you later in the year craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean maybe to address your first question first julian i mean i don t want to leave the wrong impression for a minute to the extent that we have revenue shortfalls in any of our businesses i can promise you that nobody is relaxed both our vehicle business and our hydraulics business is doing everything that they can and in many cases more to flex the variable side of our cost it s one of the key metrics that we track all of our businesses on in terms of to the extent that they re flexing their cost down with changes and volume but i d say for us that s table stakes that s something that we expect of every business that we do every day so it s not the kind of thing that say we spent a lot of time talking about we don t the changes that we re talking about and revenue are not big enough to drive material changes in our restructuring plans although in the event that the world changed dramatically we would have the ability to do that and so i can promise you nobody is in any way relaxed about ensuring that we re managing costs inside of our business and then with respect to the decrementals in vehicle yeah very strong decremental performance in q1 the decrementals in for the balance of the year perhaps a little bigger than that but still well below what we would call as a normal decremental for our vehicle business and so once again rest assured that our vehicle team is on their game they do a great job always have are managing costs in the face of a downturn and so you can count on them continuing to deliver julian mitchell barclays analyst that s very helpful and then my second question would just be around any interesting trends you d call out in terms of inventory levels at oems or channel partners across the businesses how do you feel about absolute inventory levels as they sit today and has there been any change in recent weeks or months craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah if you are maybe taking the channel first because that s kind of where you typically would see the big changes and i d say by and large not inventory today with our distributor partners are largely in line with where they ve been historically and in line with their own outlook for revenue growth and so we ve really not seen any material change there at all as i mentioned on the call perhaps where we have seen some adjustments is on the oem side and some of the short cycle businesses but other than that really inventories are very well managed julian mitchell barclays analyst very helpful thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations at this point of the time i will take the last question from mig dobre with baird mig dobre robert w baird analyst great thanks for squeezing me in and i want to go back to a question that s been asked before on vehicle so looking at this change in organic growth guidance i mean correct me if i m wrong but when you issued this guidance i think we pretty much everybody knew some of the challenges that existed in the light vehicle space in terms of builds for the year so trying to figure out what changed in your mind that prompted this guidance reduction is it really more driven by what s been happening with the jv is it shifts to emobility or how do we think about this move craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer no i d say it s what really what we said it s light vehicle markets around the world as i think is evidenced by q1 have come in weaker at least than what we anticipated and i think in general weaker than what most economic forecasters have anticipated it has absolutely nothing to do with what s going on today inside of the commercial vehicle market north america class 8 truck continues to do just fine the jv revenues as i mentioned are growing nicely and certainly we ve anticipated at the beginning of the year that there would be some transfer of revenue and that s largely on track and this change really is a function of what we re seeing today like global vehicle markets around the world now we ll have to see what the rest of the year brings but certainly the q1 weakness really in all three regions of the world is really what influenced largely our changing guidance for the year mig dobre robert w baird analyst i see given the adjustment that you had to make the margin and the fact that margins are now going to be slightly lower year over year as we look toward 2020 and we know the challenges that the commercial vehicle side of the business is going to have is it fair for all of us to be thinking that margins will once again take a step down in 2020 craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer no i d say not i mean as you know we ve done a lot of work over the last number of years to really build the business inside of our vehicle business that essentially delivers strong margins through the cycle and certainly as we as you know because we have the joint venture a lot of that volatility that used to sit inside of our business in our portfolio is no longer there we ve done a lot of restructuring and so i would say you should not expect this business to take a material change at all in profitability even with let s say north america class 8 market that s down significantly from where it is this year mig dobre robert w baird analyst all right thank you yan jin senior vice president investor relations okay good thank you we have reached the end of our call and we do appreciate donald ph for his presence as always craig and i will be available to address all your questions today and do something the following weeks thank you all for joining us today craig arnold chairman and chief

which will now be completed in 2019 on 2 august 2018 the board announced that it had placed the novaprep business under a strategic review subsequently on 11 december 2018 the board announced the decision to sell the novaprep business unit due the material investment required in this early stage business at odds with the other more mature businesses within the group the planned divestment for the novaprep business unit continues to make progress and a further update is expected later in the quarter or as soon as a binding position has been established with a buyer as part of the strategic review of novacyt it was also decided to sell the clinical lab business based in cambridge as it is now considered non core solid progress is being made in the sale of this business and management expect to update the market by the end of q2 2019 operational highlights primerdesign completed a substantial q16 molecular instrument order expanding the group s clinical diagnostic reach in the fast growing chinese market new molecular ce mark genesig bkv kit and genesig ebv kit assays were developed expanding the group s clinical diagnostic menu exclusive supply agreement signed by primerdesign with us based full service diagnostic laboratory genesis diagnostics worth a minimum 3 0m over five years recently completed the rapid development of an african swine flu assay to help address the current swine flu food supply chain limitations in china vietnam and certain european countries post balance sheet funding event on the 23 april 2019 the company entered into a convertible bond financing for up to 5 0 million net of expenses the agreement with park partners gp and negma group ltd together the investment managers under the terms of the agreement the company will be able to access capital in seven tranches which oblige the investment managers to immediately subscribe for an initial tranche of 2 0 million followed by six further tranches each of an aggregate nominal value of 500 000 drawable at the company s option subject to certain terms and conditions the company has immediately exercised its right to the initial tranche of funding giving rise to the subscription of 2 0 million of convertible bonds with warrants by the investment managers the remaining 3 0 million of convertible bonds can be issued by the company over the next 36 months following the signing of the agreement the 5 0m convertible bond financing facility with the immediate draw down of 2 0m was a factor in preparing the audited financial statements on a going concern basis while emphasising that certain conditions attached to the draw down of further tranches could place uncertainty on this principal as discussed later in this release current trading and outlook the first quarter of 2019 has started well operationally with sales meeting management expectations and continuing strong double digit growth from 2018 however sales are expected to temporarily slow during q2 due to the availability of stock which has been directly impacted by lack of working capital prior to execution of the agreement and associated capital draw down nonetheless the outlook for the full year continues to be very encouraging with the full impact of the acquisition of omega id and the visibility from the current sales pipeline also looking strong overall the company s financial performance is meeting management expectations following completion of the convertible bond financing the company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2 4 million as at 29 april 2019 being the latest practicable date ahead of this announcement graham mullis group ceo of novacyt commented the group made good operational progress over the course of 2018 continuing its growth trajectory and r d development during this period we took the difficult decision to exit the novaprep business unit as we believe greater long term value for our shareholders can be realised by focusing our resources on reagent development and manufacturing we remain committed to our three strategic growth pillars with the delivery of strong organic sales growth from primerdesign and lab21 and the recent launch of our ce mark approved molecular products the genesig bkv kit and genesig ebv kit we have begun to see the full benefit from the acquisition of the infectious disease business from omega diagnostics plc which has contributed to ebitda profitability in the first six months of ownership and further significant synergies in respect of sales channels overheads and direct costs are anticipated the group on a continued operations basis is now ebitda profitable and we aim to build on the operational progress made in 2018 to continue to deliver double digit revenue growth from this base further increase margins with the medium target to become self sustainable on a free cash flow basis and look at the potential for further acquisitions on 23 april 2019 we announced the completion of an up to 5 0m financing facility which will enable management to drive the business forward knowing there is sufficient working capital to support growth the business has started well operationally in 2019 and with the new financing now in place management can fully focus on the business which we expect to see the benefit of in the second half of the year the information included in this announcement is

regulations eu no 596 2014 upon the publication of this announcement this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain end about novacyt group the novacyt group is a rapidly growing international diagnostics business generating an increasing portfolio of in vitro and molecular diagnostic tests its core strengths lie in diagnostics product development commercialisation contract design and manufacturing the company s lead business units comprise of primerdesign and lab21 products supplying an extensive range of high quality assays and reagents worldwide the group directly serves oncology microbiology haematology and serology markets as do its global partners which include major corporates for more information please refer to the website www novacyt com chief executive officer s review overview novacyt has achieved the major milestone of adjusted ebitda profitability within its continuing operations for both fy2018 and the restated results of fy2017 following its announced intention to divest the non core novaprep business unit this reinforces the financial strength of its core continuing reagent manufacturing businesses primerdesign molecular diagnostics and lab21 products protein diagnostics in the current challenging financial markets we believe this places novacyt into a strong competitive position as an adjusted ebitda profitable technology focused high growth diagnostics company during 2018 novacyt commenced a strategic review to explore ways to maximise the future value of certain non core assets within the group a decision was reached to sell the novaprep and lab21 clinical lab businesses processes which remain ongoing the continuing businesses within the group are therefore focused on the development manufacture sales and distribution of diagnostic reagents used in infectious disease markets the decision to move away from large instrumentation means novacyt can capitalise on its core expertise in reagents and continue to drive stronger premium margins the group has been reorganised internally from a divisional to a centralised structure enabling us to align the organisation to create greater integration and synergies across each of the core business units during 2019 and beyond to further enhance financial performance i would like to extend my thanks and appreciation to colleagues involved in these changes who have shown continued commitment and support for the novacyt business with some outstanding leadership from the executive management team novacyt remains committed to its growth strategy based on the three strategic pillars of organic growth acquisitive growth and growth from new product development organic growth the core reagent products are based on molecular and protein diagnostic technologies and the group s extensive product menu generates sales from clinical testing food testing and animal testing diagnostics the group will continue to invest in commercial infrastructure for its clinical and food sales channels and will look for a strategic partner in the animal testing market the molecular products business provides the group s most significant growth opportunity which continues to develop following the successful acquisition of primerdesign in 2018 molecular sales increased to 6 2m 5 5m up 3 cer year on year with revenue growth in the core international business strong at over 0 5m 0 5m or 11 total molecular sales growth in 2017 was positively impacted by a large one off sale to china in excess of 1m 0 9m excluding this one off sale in 2017 would have resulted in a year on year growth of over 20 for the primerdesign business in 2018 in 2019 further investment is planned to expand the group s direct sales channel lab21 revenues in the year were 7 5m 6 6m an increase of 14 on 2017 at cer with growth being driven by the acquisition of omega id acquisitive growth the company has always been clear that significant opportunities exist in the diagnostics market to acquire new high growth products and accelerate financial performance with attractive and accretive m a the company has been able to demonstrate this during the past five years through the acquisitions of lab21 primerdesign and omega id as it has significantly increased sales from 1 2m to 13 7m and turned losses into ebitda profitability with attractive buying multiples and the group s demonstrated ability to integrate assets successfully acquisitions are expected to continue be significantly accretive to sales growth gross margins and earnings in may 2018 the company successfully raised 4 0 million through bonds to fund the acquisition of the profitable omega id business which helped the group accelerate its ebitda profitability during the second half of 2018 and give the group greater access to certain key markets to help create operational synergies during the first six months of integrating the business assets novacyt was able to generate an ebitda margin of 28 from this acquisition which has almost tripled its underlying ebitda margin due to manufacturing and overhead cost savings this level of performance is expected to continue into 2019 where the full year benefit of the acquisition will be seen while the financial markets remain uncertain novacyt has no current immediate plans for further acquisitions but will continue to monitor and assess opportunities that have the potential to benefit the group r d during 2018 a number of significant b2b opportunities were secured and new products and further ce ivd marked molecular diagnostic kits were launched this reflects the group s commitment to our core strengths of in vitro diagnostics product development commercialisation and contract manufacturing as we focus on our molecular and protein reagent manufacturing business units primerdesign and lab21 products a key target is to expand our clinical molecular menu following the launch in 2018 of two new molecular ce mark assays bkv and ebv with three additional complementary molecular assays for immunosuppressed patients set to be launched in 2019 during the year significant operational development of the qpcr instrument the q16 was made allowing novacyt to reduce test cycle times further from 120 minutes to for some assays down to 45 minutes which the company believes is class leading further developments are planned in 2019 with the launch of the next generation and larger qpcr instrument the q32 in addition primerdesign has just launched the newly developed african swine flu assay where significant demand is currently experienced in china vietnam and some eastern european countries again showing how responsive its development capabilities are to market demands graham mullis chief executive officer novacyt s a financial review overview during the year novacyt continued to grow revenue and gross margin and the steps we took to refocus the business helped us deliver ebitda profitability it has also been an important year in which the group has completed its first full year as a dual listed aim and euronext growth paris company we have set ourselves an objective of continuing to drive high sales growth improve the gross margin whilst balancing ongoing investment with sustained ebitda profitability goals and ultimately deliver free cash flow generation following the issuance of a bond to finance the acquisition of the infectious disease business of omega diagnostics which has increased group borrowings novacyt has continued to reduce the level of indebtedness of the company through debt repayments of 3 2m during the year including 0 6m of interest on 23 april 2019 novacyt entered into the convertible bond agreement with an immediate investment of 2 0 million the initial 2 0 million of funding will be used primarily for general working capital purposes and support the planned growth of the business in the short and medium term the full facility funding if drawn down would also be used to further service outstanding debt and earn out obligations ultimately the directors believe that the full facility funding would support novacyt in becoming cash flow self sufficient in the longer term financial performance revenue growth of 8 9 cer compared to 2017 was underpinned by improvements in the two continuing operating divisions primerdesign fy18 6 2m 5 5m fy17 6 1m 5 3m 3 at cer lab21 group fy18 7 5m 6 6m fy17 6 7m 5 8m 14 at cer primerdesign sales growth was driven by a strong core business delivering over 11 or 0 5m of growth offset by reduced b2b revenues as a result of a large one off sale in late 2017 for over 1m removing this one off sale in 2017 would have resulted in a year on year growth of over 20 for the primerdesign business during 2018 primerdesign signed a multi year exclusive b2b supply agreement worth a minimum in excess of 3m over five years with a us customer with material revenue streams expected to commence in 2019 as sales have increased the impact of high margin genesig testing reagent kits have ensured the divisional gross margin remains above 80 and have increased by three percentage points to 84 lab21 sales grew by 14 cer for the full year primarily due to the accretive effect of the omega id business which drove 13 of the 14 year on year growth revenue growth was achieved while maintaining the divisional gross margin which at 45 is good for a mature products business group operating costs have increased year on year to support the continued growth of the business following a profitable 2017 adjusted ebitda position for the continuing operations of the group a number of new staff have been hired across different functions in 2018 to ensure the business is structured to build on historical growth the group s underlying adjusted ebitda remains positive in 2018 at 0 6m 0 3m lower than the restated 2017 position due primarily to the 0 3m of additional costs associated with being dual listed on aim and euronext from november 2017 improvements to ebitda from the acquisition of omega id were broadly offset by increased investment in commercial and manufacturing capacity the decision to dispose of the novaprep business has a significant impact on the financial results of the group for 2018 and on an ongoing basis the recurring operating result has decreased to a loss of 0 4m during 2018 from a profit of 0 1m in 2017 the reduction is due to two main factors i the 0 3m reduction in ebitda as explained above and ii an annual increase in amortisation and depreciation of 0 2m following the omega id business and asset purchase primarily customer relationships and brands total depreciation charges of 317k 2017 248k and amortisation charges of 685k 2017 574k are higher than in 2017 due to the impact of the omega id acquisition and the full year effect of significant capital expenditure investment in the second half of 2017 the operating loss in 2018 was reduced to 1 4m from 2 1m in 2017 and is stated after non recurring charges amounting to 1 0m the 2018 charges comprise 0 5m of acquisition and business sale related expenses 0 2m of group restructuring costs and 0 3m of other non recurring charges including delayed ipo listing costs and french employee litigation costs significant listing costs in 2017 were not repeated in 2018 helping drive the improved ebit in 2018 the total net loss was 4 7m in 2018 reduced from 5 4m in 2017 and is stated after 0 7m of gross borrowing costs 2017 1 2m other financial expenses and tax of 0 05m 2017 0 2m and the loss from discontinued operations of 2 6m 2017 2 0m the discontinued operations loss represents the financials of the novaprep business that is available for sale and is accounted for under ifrs 5 non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations other financial expenses in 2017 comprised items such as exchange gains and losses change in fair value of the primerdesign warrants and the primerdesign contingent consideration the loss per share significantly improved during 2018 to 0 13 2017 0 24 due to increased revenue and reduced net loss financial position goodwill has reduced to 16 1m in 2018 from 16 5m in the previous year this reflects a 316k increase in the year as a result of the residual goodwill attributed to the omega id acquisition following the purchase price allocation process and fair valuing of the assets and a 648k reduction in goodwill as a result of allocating a portion of the overall lab21 goodwill to the cambridge clinical labs asset held for sale as part of the accounting requirements of ifrs 5 trade and other receivables have increased slightly in the year by 0 1m 3 to 3 9m in line with revenue growth inventory has increased by 0 4m 21 year on year predominantly following the acquisition of the omega id business resulting in an additional circa 0 5m of stock compared with 2017 additionally the underlying inventory holding for the group has increased by 0 4m to meet the greater sales demand of the growing business partially offsetting these increases 0 5m of inventory has been transferred to the assets of discontinued operations the assets of discontinued operations consist of clinical lab goodwill of 648k representing the portion of lab21 goodwill that has been allocated to the clinical lab approximately 7 825k of other intangibles in relation to novaprep patents 281k of tangible fixed assets in relation to novaprep comprising instrument development moulds and instrument equipment and 459k of inventories and wip in relation to novaprep instrument stock 256k and vials 154k borrowings have increased from 3 9m to 5 4m during the year due to issuing a new three year 4 0m bond offset by capital repayments of 2 6m against outstanding borrowings total borrowings in 2018 include two main items kreos bonds totalling 1 1m two bonds originally valued at 3 5m and 3 0m amortising monthly and vatel convertible bonds totalling 4 2m two bonds originally valued at 1 5m and 4 0m amortising monthly until march 2020 and may 2021 respectively the final primerdesign earn out milestone of 1 0m disclosed under contingent considerations in the financial statements will be paid over the next 12 months the increase of 0 4m in contingent consideration compared to 2017 is caused by the two earn out milestones associated with the omega id acquisition cash reduced by 3 2m to 1 1m during 2018 net cash used in operating activities decreased from 4 6m to 1 2m due to one off 2017 costs relating to the ipo of 1 8m not repeating in 2018 a large aged debtor receipt of 0 4 in 2018 received from a single customer and improved terms with suppliers net cash outflow from investing activities reduced slightly to 2 7m in 2018 from 2 8m in 2017 this movement was caused by a 1 7m earn out payment made in relation to the primerdesign acquisition offset by the 2m cash consideration paid for the omega id assets offset by a 0 4m reduction in capital expenditure due significant investment in 2017 on leasehold improvements as part of the move to new upgraded headquarters in camberley novacyt raised 4 0m in 2018 through the issuance of convertible bonds there were no equity capital increases in 2018 and as a result year on year cash inflows from financing activities have reduced between 2017 and 2018 by 8 2m as novacyt moves towards being cash self sustaining the significant reduction in 2018 is largely explained by the equity financing of 9 7m before expenses 7 9m net of expenses upon the group s successful listing on aim and the issuance of 2 7m in convertible bonds net of fees both of which took place in 2017 repayments of capital and interest for all borrowings have decreased in 2018 by 1 6m to 3 2m consisting of repayments on kreos bonds

and its principal activities are specialising in cancer and infectious disease diagnostics its registered office is located at 13 avenue morane saulnier 78140 vélizy villacoublay 2 basis of announcement 2 1 basis of preparation the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards and interpretations ias ifrs adopted by the european union and applicable on december 31 2018 they are prepared and presented in 000s of euros 2 2 key accounting policies ifrs 5 non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations discontinued operations and assets held for sale are restated in accordance with ifrs 5 a discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations is part of a plan to dispose of or is a subsidiary acquired solely with a view to resale as per ifrs 5 we have presented discontinued operations as follows in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income a single amount comprising the total of the post tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation the post tax gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell and the post tax gain or loss recognised on the disposal of assets or the disposal group making up the discontinued operation the analysis of the single amount is presented in the note this restatement which concerns only the novaprep activity is made for both years to ensure comparability in the statement of cash flows the net cash flow attributable to the operating investing and financing activities of discontinued operations have been disclosed separately in the statement of financial position the assets and liabilities of a disposal group have been presented separately from other assets the same applies for liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale this restatement is made in the accounts 2018 to reflect the intention to dispose of the novaprep activity held by novacyt s a and of the clinical lab business held by lab21 ltd standards interpretations and amendments to standards with mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 ifrs 15 revenues from contracts with customers this standard came into effect on 1 st january 2018 its application had no impact on the way revenues are recognized by the companies of the group 2 3 going concern the directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future thus they adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements the going concern model covers the period up to and including april 2020 in making this assessment the directors have considered the following elements the working capital requirements of the business a positive cash balance at 31 december 2018 of 1 132 000 the repayment of the current bond borrowings according to the agreed repayment schedules earn out payments in respect of previous acquisitions draw down of funds from time to time from the 5 000 000 convertible bond facility including the initial 2 000 000 received upon completion further bond issuances beyond the initial 2 000 000 upon signing are dependent on certain conditions such as a cool down period average daily volume and minimum share price prior to each draw down request the company anticipates being able to draw sufficient funds to support its working capital requirements but as they are outside of the company s direct control complete certainty cannot be given and waivers may be used where necessary additional capital receipts from the disposals of the clinical labs and novaprep businesses and the potential strategic partnering of the primerdesign animal health business have not been factored into the group s cash flow forecast any such funds received would help reduce the need and mitigate the risk of further bond issuances failure to meet the conditions within the convertible bond facility could place uncertainty on the going concern principle applied in preparing the financial statements insofar as the company may in this case not be able to repay its debts and dispose of its assets in the ordinary course of its business the going concern principle applied for the period ended 31 december 2018 could in that case prove inappropriate 2 4 critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimate uncertainty the preparation of the financial information in accordance with ifrs requires management to exercise judgement on the application of accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses the underlying estimates and assumptions made in accordance with the going concern principle are based on past experience and other factors deemed reasonable in the circumstances they serve as the basis for the exercise of judgement required in determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates the underlying estimates and assumptions are reviewed continuously the impact of changes in accounting estimates is recognised in the period of the change if it affects only that period or in the period of the change and subsequent periods if such periods are also affected measurement of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined mainly on the basis of forecasts of future cash flows the total amount of anticipated cash flows reflects management s best estimate of the future benefits and liabilities expected for the relevant cash generating unit cgu the assumptions used and the resulting estimates sometimes cover very long periods taking into account the technological commercial and contractual constraints associated with each cgu these estimates are mainly subject to assumptions in terms of volumes selling prices and related production costs and the exchange rates of the currencies in which sales and purchases are denominated they are also subject to the discount rate used for each cgu the value of the goodwill is tested whenever there are indications of impairment and reviewed at each annual closing date or more frequently should this be justified by internal or external events the carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet and related impairment loss over the periods are shown below amounts in 000 year ended 31 december 2018 year ended 31 december 2017 goodwill

growth again this quarter driven by better rents and lower expenses adjusted ffo was in line with our expectations but year over year was impacted by significant lease termination income received in

portfolio opportunities to acquire assets like this one of the very best in the country are extremely rare said mr taubman this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of owning superior assets in the strongest markets the 48 5 percent interest was acquired in an off market non cash transaction for 1 5 million taubman realty group limited partnership trg units and the assumption of its pro rata share of debt this transaction is expected to be neutral to slightly accretive to ffo and adjusted ffo in 2019 this represents taubman s third investment in partnership with the forbes company

indirect leasing costs which were capitalizable under the previous lease accounting standard as a result of the accounting change an additional 1 4 million of leasing costs were expensed during the three months ended march 31 2019 comparative periods presented were not adjusted to reflect the change in accounting taubman centers inc use of non gaap financial measures in this press release the terms we us and our refer to taubman centers inc tco the taubman realty group limited partnership trg and or trg s subsidiaries as the context may require we use certain non gaap operating measures including ebitda beneficial interest in ebitda net operating income and funds from operations these measures are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measures additional information as to the use of these measures are as follows ebitda represents earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses beneficial interest in ebitda represents our share of the earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses we believe ebitda and beneficial interest in ebitda provide useful indicators of operating performance as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure we use net operating income noi as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases and in formulating corporate goals and compensation we define noi as property level operating revenues includes rental income excluding straight line adjustments of minimum rent less maintenance property taxes utilities promotion ground rent including straight line adjustments and other property operating expenses beneficial interest in noi represents our share of noi as previously defined of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses since noi excludes general and administrative expenses pre development charges interest income and expense depreciation and amortization impairment charges restructuring charges and gains from peripheral land and property dispositions it provides a performance measure that when compared period over period reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales occupancy and rental rates and operating costs we also use noi excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period which can affect comparability and trend analysis we generally provide separate projections for expected comparable center noi growth and lease cancellation income comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and preceding period presented excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity in addition the mall of san juan has been excluded from comparable center statistics as a result of hurricane maria and the expectation that the center s performance will be materially impacted for the foreseeable future the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo as net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control and impairment write downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation we may also present adjusted versions of noi beneficial interest in ebitda and ffo when used by management to evaluate operating performance when certain significant items have impacted results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items we believe the disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors and others to understand management s view on comparability of such measures between periods for the three months ended march 31 2019 ffo and ebitda were adjusted to exclude a restructuring charge costs incurred associated with shareholder activism and the fluctuation in the fair value of equity securities for the three months ended march 31 2018 ffo and ebitda were adjusted to exclude a reduction of a previously expensed restructuring charge costs incurred associated with shareholder activism and the fluctuation in the fair value of equity securities for the three months ended march 31 2018 ffo was also adjusted for a charge recognized in connection with the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early payoff of our 475 million unsecured term loan these non gaap measures as presented by us are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or as an indicator of our operating performance additionally these measures do not represent cash flows from operating investing or financing activities as defined by gaap we also provide our beneficial interest in certain financial information of our unconsolidated joint ventures this beneficial information is derived as our ownership interest in the investee multiplied by the specific financial statement item being presented investors are cautioned that deriving our beneficial interest in this manner may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding a noncontrolling interest in the investee taubman centers inc table 2 reconciliation of net income attributable to

sought the result was the same rejection the 32 year old s self esteem plummeted three years ago the mother of two began selling vegetables from her home to make ends meet ms mbalati s experience is not unusual the average secondary school graduate does not get her first job until the age of 30 by that time most of them will be parents listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the struggle to get a job partly reflects how hard it is to search for one under apartheid non whites were forcibly moved to areas far from city centres the spatial inequality endures making transport time consuming and costly on average black south africans spend more than 100 minutes per day commuting almost four times as much as the average american commuter a study published in 2016 found that young unemployed people spent 560 rand 38 per month searching for work an amount more than the average per person income of their households the barriers are not just financial since more than 40 of 15 to 24 year olds grow up in houses without anyone in employment they lack role models and contacts in the workplace harambee a social enterprise founded in 2011 is making it easier for young people to find work and for companies to hire them as well as paying for transport and mobile data it acts as a finishing school assessing jobseekers skills boosting their confidence and helping them look for work because companies trust the harambee brand they are more likely to give its graduates a chance vodacom a telecoms firm has even set up a call centre in the harambee office in johannesburg and since october ms mbalati has been working there when i took my first call i was shaking i couldn t even hold my mouse she recalls but over time she has thrived i am a transformed person she says i am happy with this person that i have become organisations like harambee are impressive but the scale of the unemployment crisis is vast opinion polls suggest unemployment is the most important issue for south africans and with good reason only venezuela has a higher official unemployment rate south africa also has a large number of people who have given up looking the country has 38 1m people aged 15 64 just 16 5m are employed this ratio equating to just over two workers for every five people of working age is far lower than the global average which is nearly three in five the history of the south african economy partly explains these horrible numbers though precise data are hard to find the unemployment rate grew steadily during the last two decades of apartheid which can be thought of as a system of feudal capitalism for blacks and coloureds and cushy socialism for whites south africa s isolation from the global economy alongside structural changes to mining manufacturing and agriculture meant that growth slowed and there was less demand for unskilled labour since black south africans were deliberately undereducated and were hindered from moving to find work the unemployment rate probably grew to about 13 15 by the time of transition after the anc took power in 1994 unemployment rose further reaching 25 by the end of nelson mandela s time in office this was caused by a perfect storm of post apartheid problems says abhijit banerjee of mit because non whites could move more freely to look for work many previously idle people especially black women began looking again for jobs at the same time as this supply of unskilled labour was growing structural changes in the economy meant that demand for it was falling economic theory would suggest that the rational response would be to make it easier and cheaper to hire people better to have people in poorly paid jobs than no jobs at all but the anc through a mix of left wing ideology the need to keep its allies in trade unions happy and its experience of apartheid went in the other direction it legislated for a highly regulated labour market the anc empowered trade unions and wage bargaining councils while insisting that firms larger than 50 people had to hire a minimum share of non white workers this is why a disproportionate share of south african businesses have 49 employees it pursued this while rolling out cash grants for poor parents and pensioners insiders and outsiders these policy decisions set south africa on its path to chronically high joblessness they also helped crimp the export oriented labour intensive manufacturers that had ensured high growth and employment in other emerging markets the result was what mr gordhan the former finance minister now in charge of soe s calls an insider outsider economy where the minority with a steady formal job can live a rich world lifestyle and the rest suffer and the problem is getting worse over the past decade south africa s labour force has grown by almost 4m but the number of people in employment has increased by only 2m yet if economic growth had continued on its path before mr zuma unemployment would have been merely awful rather than horrific from 1994 to 2008 mandela and his successor thabo mbeki pursued prudent macroeconomic policies that sought to keep inflation interest rates and public debt low during that time gdp growth averaged 3 6 in the three years before 2008 it surpassed 5 the threshold many economists set for growth that could have a serious impact on the unemployment rate under mr zuma however growth averaged only 1 6 just higher than the rate of population growth last year the economy entered recession and in total grew only 0 8 certainly the former president had some unlucky timing the global financial crisis of 2008 followed by a collapse in commodity prices inevitably hit an open mineral rich economy but south africa has not recovered the policies of the zuma administration towards several of south africa s key industries bordered on the masochistic tourism was undermined by daft visa regulations mining investment dried up as a result of proposals encapsulated in the draft mining charter of 2017 that more equity in firms be handed over to black investors no gold will be produced in south africa in ten years time predicts a former chairman of a mining house manufacturing was hobbled by labour market regulations all these steps were done under the banner of radical economic transformation a hollow slogan that often served to distract from the wholesale looting by the ruling party while mr zuma was harming the private sector he was expanding the state the number of workers in community and social services a proxy for civil servants increased from 2 7m to 3 6m the civil service wage bill has risen by an average of more than 10 per year since 2009 on current trends spending on welfare and state workers will account for all government revenue by 2026 high public spending and low growth has left the country in a perilous fiscal position after running surpluses every year from 2005 6 to 2008 9 there has been a fiscal deficit every year since debt interest payments will make up 13 by 2021 22 more than is spent on health or education the ratio of public debt to gdp will reach 60 by 2023 24 the real figure is even higher once debts from soe s are added because of this two of the three major credit rating agencies assess south african debt as junk rather than add to the competence of the state the zuma splurge encouraged its evisceration in private the honest civil servants who have remained are aghast at the woeful administration others worry about the effects of corruption at the south african revenue service and the ever greater reliance on a small group of taxpayers just 1 of taxpayers pay 61 of personal income tax high unemployment low growth and an indebted corrupted state this is mr ramaphosa s inheritance since taking office in february 2018 he has tried to strike an upbeat tone insisting that growth and jobs are his priorities he has brought back wise old hands such as mr gordhan and tito mboweni the finance minister he has travelled abroad to drum up investment and hosted investment and jobs summits at home in private diplomats note that it is much easier to get a meeting to talk about investment with the president than it is to talk about foreign policy in february at the annual state of the nation address he proposed a number of sensible policies such as easing the visa regime to boost tourism he outlined the aim of raising south africa s ranking in the world bank s ease of doing business list from 82 to inside the top 50 yet it would be wrong to expect too much the capacity of the state has been denuded even if he could do what he wants to do many believe it would be insufficient it would take 25 years of 5 growth to bring unemployment down to internationally normal levels reckons mike schussler an economist but official growth forecasts for the next three years are about 2 and there is no sign that the president is willing to change the basic insider outsider structure of the economy a national minimum wage which came into effect in january will make it harder for the unskilled to find work says ann bernstein of the centre for development and enterprise a think tank we need policies for the labour force we have not the highly skilled one we wished we had she says

factory activity in china expanded for a second straight month in april but at a much slower pace than expected an official survey showed on tuesday suggesting the economy is still struggling for traction despite a flurry of support measures the unexpected loss of momentum at the start of the second quarter followed upbeat data in march which had raised hopes among global investors that the world s second largest economy was getting back on firmer footing story continues below advertisement remove ad a private business survey on tuesday also pointed to a loss of momentum confounding expectations for a pick up with factories starting to shed jobs again after adding staff in march for the first time in years the weak manufacturing readings along with softer construction growth could stoke debate over how much more stimulus china needs to generate a sustainable recovery without risking a rapid jump in debt the official purchasing managers index pmi for manufacturing fell to 50 1 in april from march s reading of 50 5 which was the first expansion in four months data from the statistics bureau showed story continues below advertisement remove ad it hovered just above the neutral 50 point mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis analysts surveyed by reuters had forecast the pmi to match march s 50 5 for now the official pmis suggest that q2 got off to a weaker start and reinforce our view that there are still some downside risks to near term activity julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics said in a research note shares in much of asia fell after the data while the chinese yuan and the australian dollar wilted china s slowdown has weighed heavily on exports of many of its trading partners and sales of multinational firms from apple to industrial conglomerate 3m story continues below advertisement remove ad while the official factory survey disappointed on the growth front it did not show a marked deterioration in business conditions either output expanded at a slower but still moderate pace while growth in new orders eased only slightly some analysts had expected a pullback in the pmis arguing that march s more upbeat readings were likely due in part to one off factors such as changes in production and purchasing patterns ahead of a cut in value added tax rates on april 1 a spokesperson for the statistics bureau said earlier this month that many firms had brought forward purchases of input materials ahead of the tax change in order to increase their tax deductions indeed a pmi sub index for inventories of raw materials retreated significantly from march s seven month high a gauge of construction activity fell to 60 1 from 61 7 in march still solid but possibly indicating that the government s infrastructure push may be losing steam despite a burst of bond issuance and new bank lending at the start of the year analysts said to counter the slowdown beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year unveiling tax and fee cuts amounting to 2 trillion yuan 297 billion to ease burdens on firms while allowing local governments to issue 2 15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects analysts have cautioned it will take time for those measures to fully kick in with most not expecting the economy to convincingly stabilise until around mid year another official survey on tuesday showed growth in china s services industry also cooled in april though it remained in solid expansionary territory eyes on trade deal while new factory orders remained sluggish there were some encouraging signs on the export front the official index for export orders continued to contract but hit its highest level in eight months as optimism grows that beijing and washington will reach a trade deal in coming weeks which could ease pressure on chinese exporters president donald trump said on thursday that he would soon host chinese leader xi jinping at the white house setting the stage for a possible agreement on trade between the world s two largest economies u s treasury secretary steve mnuchin told the new york times that negotiations are in the final laps as he and trade representative robert lighthizer prepared to fly to beijing for more talks this week encouraging signs despite the disappointing factory readings analysts say there are signs that earlier growth boosting measures are starting to percolate through the system the official pmi survey showed small and mid sized manufacturers continued to fare worse than larger companies many of which are state controlled but small manufacturers activity improved to a six month high suggesting that policymakers efforts to support the struggling private sector are starting to bear fruit big state run banks have been told to increase lending to smaller firms by 30 percent this year even if it risks more bad loans and the central bank has been guiding shorter term money market interest rates lower profits may already be turning the corner china s industrial firms reported higher earnings in march after four months of contraction better than expected march data had prompted a major shift in the market s expectations for more stimulus this year with analysts and investors scaling back forecasts for the timing and size of further support measures after the drop in april s pmis beijing can t afford to stop easing economists at nomura said china s economy grew at a steady 6 4 percent pace in the first quarter defying expectations for a further slowdown while analysts believe stimulus will put a floor under growth eventually they are not predicting a strong rebound as seen in china in the past noting beijing s support measures so far have been relatively more restrained economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year down from 6 6 percent in 2018 a recent reuters poll showed

surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after us president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 33 percent this year and is close to the highest in six months while higher prices due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at 100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above 100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at 100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 percent lower than currently projected by end 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 percentage points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach 100 3 how will iran and trump impact the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels a day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the u a e those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but u s claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they re affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the world s biggest economy while u s oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader u s economy won t necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as 100 a barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers that are the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the gas pump already have risen more than 7 percent this month to 2 89 a gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there s risk that political blame shifts back to the u s for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policy makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift their focus to slowing growth that s unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund this month lowered its global growth forecast and said the world is in a delicate moment bloomberg

major central banks are done tightening policy according to a majority of economists polled by reuters with the growth outlook wilting across developed and emerging economies along with scant prospects for a surge in inflation while that is largely reflected in bond markets with major sovereign bond yields falling this year global equities have rallied and the s p 500 index is near record highs after its best start this year in more than three decades one striking conclusion from the latest surveys of over 500 economists from around the world covering more than 40 economies was not just a toning down of the economic outlook but a clear shift away from long held optimistic views although economists who answered an additional question were split on whether a deeper global economic downturn was more likely than a synchronised rebound this year s growth outlook was downgraded or left unchanged for 38 of the countries polled the recent weakness of global growth will persist for much longer than is commonly assumed a dovish turn by central banks and stimulus in china will not be enough to boost world gdp growth from its current slow pace noted jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics disappointing economic performance will leave inflation very low and cause monetary policy to be loosened almost across the board but we do not see this prompting any meaningful recovery until 2021 global growth was forecast to average 3 4 percent this year the lowest since polling began for 2019 almost two years ago the most optimistic prediction was also more modest than at the start of the year the 2020 forecast held at 3 4 percent the joint lowest since reuters began polling on it however the 2019 consensus was a touch higher than the international monetary fund s latest view of 3 3 percent the risk of an escalation of the u s china trade war and prospects of britain exiting the european union without a deal two of the more prominent threats that initially drove the current slowdown have eased yet most major central banks have been hinting at a move away from hiking rates and nearly 60 percent of more than 200 economists who answered a separate question said they were confident the global tightening cycle was over on thursday the bank of japan dispelled any doubt about its commitment to ultra loose policies and sweden s central bank said a forecast interest rate hike would come slightly later than it had planned the u s federal reserve is done raising rates until at least the end of next year with about a third of economists polled predicting at least one rate cut by then with euro zone economic growth and inflation prospects dimming the european central bank may have missed its opportunity to raise rates before the next downturn the ecb blames the euro zone weakness on a slowdown in china and concerns about the trade war the fed meanwhile pointed the finger to europe and china as the main drags on u s growth but with everyone looking across the border for a scapegoat someone must inevitably be watching the wrong space noted elwin de groot head of macro strategy at rabobank one could speculate that the central banks are pointing the finger just because they have little confidence that their actions are effective growth forecasts for developed economies including germany france italy spain britain japan australia the united states and canada for this year and next weakened it was not very different for emerging market economies despite efforts from policymakers to boost sluggish growth economic growth in major economies from asia to africa to latin america was predicted to lose more momentum although india is still expected to be the fastest growing major economy growth predictions were lowered compared with the previous poll looser fiscal and monetary policy should help to cushion the impact of weaker export demand on growth in emerging asia nevertheless regional growth this year is still likely to slow to its weakest rate in a decade added capital economics mckeown source reuters analysis and additional reporting by indradip ghosh in bengaluru polling and reporting by the reuters polls team in bengaluru and bureaus in shanghai tokyo london milan paris oslo istanbul johannesburg toronto brasilia mexico city lima buenos aires bogota caracas and santiago editing by ross finley and hugh lawson

geneva sudan has had three military leaders in the last week however the political upheaval ends the backdrop to this crisis includes multiple conflicts displacement and an economic crunch affecting the living standards of millions humanitarian issues that won t be resolved soon needs have remained stubbornly high for years using up an average of over 600 million in donor funding in each of the last five years just to tackle immediate priorities including food aid health and education the country also hosts more than 800 000 refugees from south sudan a senior un official in khartoum said it was too early to predict the wider impact of political developments in the country of almost 44 million and that the short term priority is getting humanitarian operations back to full speed after days of slowdown we remain extremely concerned about deepening humanitarian needs among the current caseload the official said requesting anonymity due to the sensitive political situation macroeconomic conditions are extremely poor according to the famine early warning system network known as fews net a us funded food security monitor some 13 percent of the population 5 76 million people are in crisis or emergency levels of hunger in addition the national currency is rapidly depreciating against the dollar bread prices have jumped since the government lifted subsidies on imported wheat and fuel price hikes have almost doubled the cost of transport cereal prices are 250 percent above the five year average according to fews net there is already a fast deterioration in living conditions in urban areas due to the economic situation the un official said adding that the limited availability of banknotes is also slowing the wider economy and relief operations the bread price rise was the final straw for much of the urban based population in sudan explained world food programme country director matthew hollingworth the humanitarian and development needs of the people of sudan must be prioritised particularly right now to stabilise sections of the population through this transitionary period risk of further unrest the sudanese military faces continuing diplomatic pressure to allow civilian administration at the time of writing groups backing protests in khartoum had not accepted promises of a two year military transition to civilian rule along with the sacking of president omar al bashir and regional governors a senior african diplomat based in sudan urged caution saying the risks were high if the whole military run edifice was rapidly dismantled given weak institutions and civil society widespread disaffection and smaller conflicts across the country despite the euphoria of the peaceful protests the cracks could start to show and the whole thing start to crumble the diplomat warned they ve got to hold this entity called sudan together the possibility of a political turning point has been vivid in khartoum but sudan s multiple crises have political mismanagement at their root analysts say sudan is so much more than the capital if sudan s patterns of governance do not change the aspirations of millions of marginalised sudanese will still not be met while khartoum s protestors and the formation of an interim government had the limelight root and branch reform was desperately needed to address broader grievances said aly verjee a researcher on sudan and south sudan at the us institute for peace sudan is so much more than the capital verjee said if sudan s patterns of governance do not change the aspirations of millions of marginalised sudanese will still not be met some of the pressure on the poorest and most vulnerable is contained by international humanitarian aid but an opening up of financial assistance is limited by sanctions hollingworth of the wfp warned that sudan s economic problems now risk spreading to other areas causing wider civic and military instability and endangering the pillars of a cohesive society sanctions debt and aid khartoum may hope for help from the gulf in the short term sudan is aligned with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and sudanese troops and militia are fighting alongside them in yemen riyadh quickly promised fuel wheat and medicines in a welcome package to the interim military regime un states and donor nations currently pay over 1 5 billion a year to contain conflicts and humanitarian needs in sudan the un and ngos have prepared a humanitarian response plan for 2019 to support 4 4 million people the final draft with a price tag of about 1 billion was under review by the government before the political crisis erupted on 6 april the un official said the cost of the appeal was similar to recent years longer term development funding for sudan is limited and humanitarian financing is being used for things it shouldn t according to rachel scott of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd scott who has advised donors and the sudanese government on development financing said sanctions were a huge issue that largely stopped sudan from tapping more aid funding or negotiating relief on over 50 billion of debt sudan is listed by the united states as a state sponsor of terrorism and al bashir is wanted by the international criminal court to stand trial for crimes against humanity and genocide committed in darfur various other us un and eu sanctions apply to individuals accused of involvement in the arms trade or of committing rights violations in the darfur conflict these legal limitations add to a wider hesitance to engage with a near pariah state but scott argues that donors should start to get ready for if and when political obstacles are lifted sudan won a reprieve from some us sanctions in 2017 and could aim to open the first stages of a debt relief process with the international monetary fund according to an oecd report one of the largest donors is the european union which funds programmes to limit migration through sudan towards the mediterranean allegedly benefiting militia connected to rights abuses in the absence of loans and development finance from institutions like the world bank so called humanitarian budgets which have fewer political strings attached are plugging gaps that would normally be dealt with by development funds donors should be thinking about where any new development investments should go to win the maximum return on stability for a new day said scott if development doesn t come the fragile peace isn t going to hold darfur and other conflicts as well as darfur in the west a clutch of small scale rebellions and tensions are simmering on the periphery of sudan especially in the southern border areas of blue nile and south kordofan and in kassala in the east a un african union peacekeeping operation in darfur with a budgeted cost of 715 million in the current year is due to close at the end of 2020 handing over some responsibilities to the civilian arm of the un aid groups and the sudanese authorities the african diplomat said the rationale was that the blunt instrument of a uniformed mission may not be the right tool to address darfur today other actors in aid and development need to step in the diplomat said adding if development doesn t come the fragile peace isn t going to hold the armed rebellion in darfur that began in 2003 has been largely quelled but at a very high cost and without resolving many of the land disputes and other issues that caused it the counter insurgency campaign steered by al bashir and government allied militia left tens of thousands dead villages burned civilians bombed refugees fleeing to chad widespread rape and dispossession and the displacement of up to two million people the un african union hybrid mission in darfur unamid started in 2007 to protect civilians facilitate humanitarian aid and to mediate and foster community level peace talks has had only limited success hampered by sudanese intimidation and restrictions on supplies fuel flights personnel and movements years of talks have proved inconclusive while human rights abuses have persisted sudan has urged unamid s closure since at least 2014 arguing that it is no longer relevant human rights watch last year slammed the sudanese government s long practice of intransigence and obstruction in 2018 the un security council again objected to bureaucratic hindrances the peace process mediated initially by qatar in doha is at a standstill according to the un in february 2019 the mission once aimed to be a 25 000 strong force is already winding down troop and police levels are currently set at 6 000 7 000 personnel another peacekeeping operation attempts to stabilise the abyei region at a cost of 282 million in the last budgeted year a detailed process to decide the borders and future of abyei was part of the agreement on south sudan s independence but the agreement broke down and the area remains in an administrative hiatus claimed by both nations and patrolled by the un interim security force for abyei or unisfa two other north south border areas also face intermittent conflict with the nuba mountains of south kordofan predicted to suffer emergency levels of food insecurity later this year by fews net the third area blue nile bordering ethiopia is also the site of a long running and little noted conflict with related civilian vulnerability and displacement sudan also has a significant stake in its southern neighbour news reports point out that khartoum stands to benefit if stability returns to south sudan and oil exports via the north s pipeline resume al bashir had played a role in putting together the latest internal south sudan peace deal and stood as a guarantor of the agreement while hosting some of the key figures despite being at war with southern secessionists for most of his time in power the humanitarian aid commission so far no changes have been announced to the humanitarian aid commission through which the government tightly regulates humanitarian work a sudanese aid worker said the hac and the national intelligence and security service or niss were closely associated with the hac controlling travel permissions project approvals and visas for foreign workers niss offices have been attacked or set on fire in darfur as demonstrators look at them as first enemies the aid worker said i hope the realists can find a way of accommodating the idealists the un official called for the lifting of access restrictions such as travel permits and single entry visas to ease the humanitarian response verjee went further the hac is a combination of military intelligence niss and other mostly obstructionist bureaucrats he said its abolition would be welcome the head of niss salah abdallah known popularly as gosh stepped down last week nevertheless the future role of niss and of the hac are a large question mark for the humanitarian aid sector for the forces of change those restrictions should not be there in the first place the aid worker said adding we can write books about the breadth of manipulation of aid by the hac how such issues will be dealt with by whichever new administration emerges from the current tumult in khartoum is unclear faced with balancing the hopes of protestors and the need to hold the state together the african diplomat said political events were an opportunity and added i hope the realists can find a way of accommodating the idealists bp ag
workers assemble robots at the production line of chuangze intelligent robot in rizhao shandong province china april 29 2019 photo by reuters stringer factory activity in china expanded for a second straight month in april but at a much slower pace than expected an official survey showed on tuesday the evidences suggest the economy is still struggling for traction despite a flurry of support measures the unexpected loss of momentum at the start of the second quarter followed upbeat data in march which had raised hopes among global investors that the world s second largest economy was getting back on firmer footing a private business survey on tuesday also pointed to a loss of momentum confounding expectations for a pick up with factories starting to shed jobs again after adding staff in march for the first time in years the weak manufacturing readings along with softer construction growth could stoke debate over how much more stimulus china needs to generate a sustainable recovery without risking a rapid jump in debt the official purchasing managers index pmi for manufacturing fell to 50 1 in april from march s reading of 50 5 which was the first expansion in four months data from the statistics bureau showed it hovered just above the neutral 50 point mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis analysts surveyed by reuters had forecast the pmi to match march s 50 5 for now the official pmis suggest that q2 got off to a weaker start and reinforce our view that there are still some downside risks to near term activity julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics said in a research note shares in much of asia fell after the data while the chinese yuan and the australian dollar wilted china s slowdown has weighed heavily on exports of many of its trading partners and sales of multinational firms from apple to industrial conglomerate 3m while the official factory survey disappointed on the growth front it did not show a marked deterioration in business conditions either output expanded at a slower but still moderate pace while growth in new orders eased only slightly some analysts had expected a pullback in the pmis arguing that march s more upbeat readings were likely due in part to one off factors such as changes in production and purchasing patterns ahead of a cut in value added tax rates on april 1 a spokesperson for the statistics bureau said earlier this month that many firms had brought forward purchases of input materials ahead of the tax change in order to increase their tax deductions indeed a pmi sub index for inventories of raw materials retreated significantly from march s seven month high a gauge of construction activity fell to 60 1 from 61 7 in march still solid but possibly indicating that the government s infrastructure push may be losing steam despite a burst of bond issuance and new bank lending at the start of the year analysts said to counter the slowdown beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year unveiling tax and fee cuts amounting to 2 trillion yuan 297 billion to ease burdens on firms while allowing local governments to issue 2 15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects analysts have cautioned it will take time for those measures to fully kick in with most not expecting the economy to convincingly stabilize until around mid year another official survey on tuesday showed growth in china s services industry also cooled in april though it remained in solid expansionary territory eyes on trade deal while new factory orders remained sluggish there were some encouraging signs on the export front the official index for export orders continued to contract but hit its highest level in eight months as optimism grows that beijing and washington will reach a trade deal in coming weeks which could ease pressure on chinese exporters president donald trump said on thursday that he would soon host chinese leader xi jinping at the white house setting the stage for a possible agreement on trade between the world s two largest economies u s treasury secretary steve mnuchin told the new york times that negotiations are in the final laps as he and trade representative robert lighthizer prepared to fly to beijing for more talks this week encouraging signs despite the disappointing factory readings analysts say there are signs that earlier growth boosting measures are starting to percolate through the system the official pmi survey showed small and mid sized manufacturers continued to fare worse than larger companies many of which are state controlled but small manufacturers activity improved to a six month high suggesting that policymakers efforts to support the struggling private sector are starting to bear fruit big state run banks have been told to increase lending to smaller firms by 30 percent this year even if it risks more bad loans and the central bank has been guiding shorter term money market interest rates lower profits may already be turning the corner china s industrial firms reported higher earnings in march after four months of contraction better than expected march data had prompted a major shift in the market s expectations for more stimulus this year with analysts and investors scaling back forecasts for the timing and size of further support measures after the drop in april s pmis beijing can t afford to stop easing economists at nomura said china s economy grew at a steady 6 4 percent pace in the first quarter defying expectations for a further slowdown while analysts believe stimulus will put a floor under growth eventually they are not predicting a strong rebound as seen in china in the past noting beijing s support measures so far have been relatively more restrained economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year down from 6 6 percent in 2018 a recent reuters poll showed

useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance the company believes that net income loss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity a reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to ffo as adjusted is provided on

there are many on the left who are sceptical of the european union and rightly so the european union was designed primarily as a monetary union whose sole purpose was to encase the globalised financial system that operates from within europe and protect it from the intrusion of democratic sovereign states the architects of the system from the maastricht treaty of 1992 to the establishment of the economic and monetary union emu in 1999 and the introduction of the common currency in 2002 originated in neoliberal think tanks mainly based in the universities of financial entrepôts like luxembourg and london as otmar issing the first chief economist of the european central bank put it many strands in hayek s thinking may have influenced the course of events leading to monetary union in subtle ways as well as academics the architects of the system included prominent british treasury civil servants and politicians it is this inbuilt architecture of the european union embedded in present treaties that is being resisted today by both right and left wing populism across europe as it has been designed the system is undemocratic and unresponsive to the will of the people it is a system based on the theories and policies of out of touch neoclassical economists with strong past and present links to the london school of economics whose attachment to permanent fiscal austerity insecure employment low wages and poor productivity are fuelling the fires of populism and nationalism their economic policies have predictably led to political and economic divergence across europe and to the rise of ugly politics yet to the surprise and scorn of its very architects this anti popular architecture is now in crisis while europe s neoliberal policies were intended to encase the private banking system from regulatory democracy ironically their effect has been to threaten the european banking system s solvency as italy s economy continues to weaken under strains of the eurozone s deflationary austerity policies and its sovereign debt to gdp ratio rises it poses a grave threat to the french banks that hold about 385 billion of italian debt derivatives credit commitments and guarantees on their balance sheets german banks meanwhile hold another 126 billion of italian debt the financial nature of the european union is the biggest threat to europe s economic stability and continuation get our free daily email get one whole story direct to your inbox every weekday sign up now three good reasons to remain so should the left be backing parties that support remaining in the eu in the forthcoming european elections we believe strongly that it should for three reasons all of which are political we face three grave threats that we cannot tackle as a single isolated state the first is the collapse of the life support systems that make the earth liveable for humans not just climate breakdown but also earth systems breakdown we have been warned by the ipcc that our planet cannot stand much more warming and that we have about ten years to transform our energy systems and restore biodiversity tackling that very grave threat to our futures and the futures of our children and grandchildren cannot be done alone by a fortress britain or even a fortress europe the climate does not end at the cliffs of dover it requires international cooperation and coordination and the building of alliances especially neighbourly alliances it is precisely those much needed alliances that could change the direction and scope of fiscal policies both at national and eu levels second we face another grave and even more immediate security threat the rise of authoritarianism and fascism in both britain the united states and europe again this is not a threat we can tackle in isolation as we discovered in the 1930s facebook youtube and the internet provide global platforms for racists and fascists a never ending crisis with its corollaries of growing poverty and unemployment fuels their arguments to fight and defeat this threat to britain s security we need political allies especially those we count as neighbours and as authoritarianism and populism feed themselves off the economic and social distress caused by eu deflationist policies this antiauthoritarian alliance must push decisively towards the adoption of common expansionary policies the third threat we face is another globalised debt deflation after a post crisis period of rapid debt inflation the great financial crisis is far from over economists and regulators were bribed by wall street and the city of london and persuaded to stick with light touch regulation little has been done to transform or reform the globalised financial system to make it more robust and accountable indeed the crisis proved itself as a way to solidify the existing economic order as professor joseph vogl of humboldt university berlin has argued it remains safely encased and detached from the regulatory democracy of any state whether in europe or elsewhere but the existing economic order is far from stable another globally systemic financial crisis is inevitable it is only a question of timing already there are signs that are worrying central bankers and policymakers and this time the weaponry of monetary policy will no longer be effective either in an isolated uk or in an unreformed eu so for political ecological security and economic reasons it is imperative that britain s internationalist labour party and its supporters build alliances with like minded socialists and social democrats across europe to jointly and cooperatively tackle these grave threats the problems of remaining these advantages do not allow us to dismiss the problems of the eu however europe has been made politically and economically unstable first by the huge imbalances that have grown between and within countries and then by the way these imbalances have been reabsorbed through deflationary policies it is these dynamics that lie at the heart of the political divergences and the rise of populism imbalances fuel nationalistic movements in the surplus countries of northern europe while deflationary countermeasures fuel populistic reactions in the south moreover by shifting imbalances from inside the emu to outside it the eurozone following german style neomercantilism has become the largest surplus bloc on a global scale with growing dependence on foreign markets it also has an internal market which thanks in part to austerity is shrinking more and more germany bears the most responsibility thanks to its massive trade surplus and its dogged determination not to raise wages and stoke internal demand or to cooperate with her partners to reflate european markets and economies no wonder europeans and britons are angry but the problem is structural it has to do with the way the eu is built more than with the behaviour of individual countries the eu was built on the two pillars of monetary union and financial integration this has laid its foundations not on solid ground but on the liquid flows of capital mobility intended to lend strength to the edifice essentially the eu outsourced the enforcement of its rules to the market discipline that is allegedly imposed by financial flows this lies at the root of the eu s present instability it was capital mobility that first allowed the imbalances to build up and then refused to refinance them the eu architecture is threatening the break up of the post war project for the reunification of europe a project whose lofty purpose was the maintenance of long term peace across the continent there remains an overwhelming demand for peace and unity across europe and for cross border collaboration and cooperation but given the political and economic divergence and the rise of right wing authoritarian parties how can peace balance and stability be achieved a different europe we know that these imbalances can be resolved we know this because europe has done it before when the european payments union epu was established between 1950 and 1958 the epu made it possible for each country to finance its current account deficits without relying on the vagaries of capital liquidity provided by international financial markets by providing a clearing centre the country s position was recorded as a net position in relation to the clearing centre itself and thus as a multilateral position in relation to all the other countries a quota was set for each country corresponding to 15 of its trade with the other countries in the union credit and debit balances could not exceed the respective quotas the system therefore set a limit on the accumulation of debts or deficits with the clearing centre and provided debtors with an incentive to converge towards equilibrium with their trading partners the epu also exerted strong pressure on creditor countries which like germany and holland today failed to raise imports and cut their surpluses the result was an extraordinary export driven expansion in production in germany and italy in particular and the liberalisation of trade not only within the eu but also well beyond but what was most extraordinary was that this expansion of trade came along with rising employment and welfare in each partner country the epu was a part of a superstructure that provided countries with more autonomy to foster an economy led by domestic demand a new european clearing union a modern version of this system could be created today better still it could be introduced without changing the eu treaties it simply requires enforcing the existing rules and reinterpreting the existing monetary infrastructures in the eurozone there is already a clearing house for the precise purpose of optimizing the management of payments target 2 the trans european automated real time gross settlement express transfer is a system that is used today to settle cross border payments individually within this system germany together with other surplus countries like the netherlands has built up substantial credits and has the highest positive settlement balance correspondingly portugal spain greece ireland and italy have built up substantial debits and therefore have negative settlement balances these reflect the cumulative balance of payments imbalances between northern and southern europe that were formerly financed by capital flows from the centre to the periphery but which have since reverted in the wake of the great financial crisis this accounting gimmick has played a crucial role in saving the system of the single currency while not solving the problem of large interest rate spreads the accumulation of positive and negative balances within target2 has prevented the financial turmoil that resulted from the sudden stop of capital movements after the sovereign debt crisis from turning into a currency crisis our proposal is to open a section of target2 call it t2trade designed to function like the epu as a source of funding for temporary current account disequilibria without having to rely on short term capital movements the result would be a new european clearing union for this to work four measures would have to be adopted 1 credit would have to be restricted in t2trade solely to commercial transactions between european countries and to tourism the idea of restricting certain facilities of the european central bank ecb to specific kinds of economic transactions is not new it was introduced with the targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro 2 there would have to be a limit on the possibility of accumulating positive or negative balances commensurate with each country s volume of foreign trade this principle is perfectly consistent with european rules specifically under the macroeconomic imbalance procedure mip 3 imbalances could be subjected to symmetrical charges this option can and we believe must take on the form of a political proposal obliging all countries to face up to their responsibility in settling the imbalances insofar as they have enjoyed advantages in accumulating them it would serve as a reminder to the creditor countries that they too have benefited from the single currency thanks to the opportunity to export to the countries of southern europe at a competitive real exchange rate and it would serve to involve these countries in the adjustment process without having to appeal to their kind heartedness moreover it would be consistent with what the ecb announced in summer 2014 when after introducing negative interest rates on deposits it stated that this should apply also to target2 balances 4 there should be the possibility of adjusting real if not nominal exchange rates should imbalances prove persistent conclusion while there is scope to argue about the specific measures that would need to be adopted to make our proposed european clearing union work it is critical that any mechanism is based on the following political and economic principle solidarity between northern and southern european countries and solidarity between sovereign debtors and creditors in order to restore a common purpose to the european project solidarity not in a moral sense but in an economic one of shared responsibility for stability and symmetric distribution of the burden of readjustment if we are to restore stability within europe and if we are to defeat the authoritarian ambitions of extreme political forces then restoring policy autonomy to democratic governments by managing capital mobility is essential economic forces cannot be detached from their entanglement with democratic political institutions the attempt to do so is dystopian and has triggered the polanyian counter movements that are leading the people of european countries to search for protection from the predatory behaviour of self regulating markets indeed unless mobile capital is subordinated to democratic interests and note that our proposal would make capital movements unnecessary rather than illegal then such protection will most certainly be offered by strong and potentially authoritarian right wing leaders who will likely quickly reverse the extraordinary progress made across europe since the second world war there is a great deal at stake and there is very little time

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by stella qiu and ryan woo beijing reuters factory activity in china expanded for a second straight month in april but at a much slower pace than expected an official survey showed on tuesday suggesting the economy is still struggling for traction despite a flurry of support measures the unexpected loss of momentum at the start of the second quarter followed upbeat data in march which had raised hopes among global investors that the world s second largest economy was getting back on firmer footing related stories a private business survey on tuesday also pointed to a loss of momentum confounding expectations for a pick up with factories starting to shed jobs again after adding staff in march for the first time in years the weak manufacturing readings along with softer construction growth could stoke debate over how much more stimulus china needs to generate a sustainable recovery without risking a rapid jump in debt the official purchasing managers index pmi for manufacturing fell to 50 1 in april from march s reading of 50 5 which was the first expansion in four months data from the statistics bureau showed it hovered just above the neutral 50 point mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis analysts surveyed by reuters had forecast the pmi to match march s 50 5 for now the official pmis suggest that q2 got off to a weaker start and reinforce our view that there are still some downside risks to near term activity julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics said in a research note shares in much of asia fell after the data while the chinese yuan and the australian dollar wilted china s slowdown has weighed heavily on exports of many of its trading partners and sales of multinational firms from apple to industrial conglomerate 3m while the official factory survey disappointed on the growth front it did not show a marked deterioration in business conditions either output expanded at a slower but still moderate pace while growth in new orders eased only slightly some analysts had expected a pullback in the pmis arguing that march s more upbeat readings were likely due in part to one off factors such as changes in production and purchasing patterns ahead of a cut in value added tax rates on april 1 a spokesperson for the statistics bureau said earlier this month that many firms had brought forward purchases of input materials ahead of the tax change in order to increase their tax deductions indeed a pmi sub index for inventories of raw materials retreated significantly from march s seven month high a gauge of construction activity fell to 60 1 from 61 7 in march still solid but possibly indicating that the government s infrastructure push may be losing steam despite a burst of bond issuance and new bank lending at the start of the year analysts said to counter the slowdown beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year unveiling tax and fee cuts amounting to 2 trillion yuan 297 billion to ease burdens on firms while allowing local governments to issue 2 15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects analysts have cautioned it will take time for those measures to fully kick in with most not expecting the economy to convincingly stabilize until around mid year another official survey on tuesday showed growth in china s services industry also cooled in april though it remained in solid expansionary territory eyes on trade deal while new factory orders remained sluggish there were some encouraging signs on the export front the official index for export orders continued to contract but hit its highest level in eight months as optimism grows that beijing and washington will reach a trade deal in coming weeks which could ease pressure on chinese exporters president donald trump said on thursday that he would soon host chinese leader xi jinping at the white house setting the stage for a possible agreement on trade between the world s two largest economies u s treasury secretary steve mnuchin told the new york times that negotiations are in the final laps as he and trade representative robert lighthizer prepared to fly to beijing for more talks this week encouraging signs despite the disappointing factory readings analysts say there are signs that earlier growth boosting measures are starting to percolate through the system the official pmi survey showed small and mid sized manufacturers continued to fare worse than larger companies many of which are state controlled but small manufacturers activity improved to a six month high suggesting that policymakers efforts to support the struggling private sector are starting to bear fruit big state run banks have been told to increase lending to smaller firms by 30 percent this year even if it risks more bad loans and the central bank has been guiding shorter term money market interest rates lower profits may already be turning the corner china s industrial firms reported higher earnings in march after four months of contraction better than expected march data had prompted a major shift in the market s expectations for more stimulus this year with analysts and investors scaling back forecasts for the timing and size of further support measures after the drop in april s pmis beijing can t afford to stop easing economists at nomura said china s economy grew at a steady 6 4 percent pace in the first quarter defying expectations for a further slowdown while analysts believe stimulus will put a floor under growth eventually they are not predicting a strong rebound as seen in china in the past noting beijing s support measures so far have been relatively more restrained economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year down from 6 6 percent in 2018 a recent reuters poll showed reporting by stella qiu and ryan woo

available for 90 days supplemental reporting measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders nics as defined by u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap are the most appropriate earnings measurements however we consider funds from operations ffo net operating income noi in place noi ipnoi same store noi ssnoi ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance excluding ebitda and adjusted ebitda these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts we do not control unconsolidated investments while we consider pro rata disclosures useful they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u s gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo attributable to common stockholders as defined by nareit means net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with u s gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders represents ffo attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in exhibit 2 we believe that normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other reits or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and or incalculable items we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties these expenses include but are not limited to property related payroll and benefits property management fees paid to operators marketing housekeeping food service maintenance utilities property taxes and insurance general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs these expenses include but are not limited to payroll and benefits professional services office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets ipnoi represents noi excluding interest income other income and non ipnoi and adjusted for timing of current quarter portfolio changes such as acquisitions development conversions segment transitions dispositions and investments held for sale ssnoi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio as used herein same store is generally defined as those revenue generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year over year reporting periods land parcels loans and sub leases as well as any properties acquired developed redeveloped including major refurbishments where 20 or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts properties undergoing operator transitions and or segment transitions except seniors housing triple net to seniors housing operating with the same operator are also excluded from the same store amounts normalizers include adjustments that in management s opinion are appropriate in considering ssnoi a supplemental non gaap performance measure none of these adjustments which may increase or decrease ssnoi are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap significant normalizers defined as any that individually exceeds 0 50 of ssnoi growth per property type are separately disclosed and explained we believe noi ipnoi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi ipnoi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties no reconciliation of the forecasted range for ssnoi on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable efforts and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long term debt net of cash and internal revenue code irc section 1031 deposits we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile the coverage ratios are based on ebitda which stands for earnings net income per income statement before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization covenants in our senior unsecured notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to those agreements failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and or financial condition due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants we have defined adjusted ebitda to exclude unconsolidated entities and to include adjustments for stock based compensation expense provision for loan losses gains losses on extinguishment of debt gains losses impairments on properties gains losses on derivatives and financial instruments other expenses and additional other income we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations our leverage ratios include net debt to adjusted ebitda net debt is defined as total long term debt excluding operating lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and any irc section 1031 deposits our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally they are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management the supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u s gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies please see the exhibits for reconciliations of

worker s rights auto plant closures and the economy are common talking points for presidential hopefuls searching for cracks in michigan s support for president donald trump democrats seeking their party s nomination for president in 2020 alternated between jabbing at trump and outlining their own vision for the country during early campaign stops in michigan candidates are expected to keep the heat on trump for failing to deliver on his promises while centering their message on boosting the state s automotive industry addressing harmful trade policy and protecting union workers democrats are working to win back white working class voters and union members in swing states that backed trump in 2016 blue collar workers will targeted again by candidates in the next presidential election jobs labor and the economy will be big campaign issues in michigan said jason mollica strategic communication professional and lecturer at american university mollica said early campaign stops show democratic candidates are testing what messages resonate with michigan voters visits have been largely used as a way to get on people s radar he said candidates on the trail in michigan tried to cast doubt on whether the lives of middle class voters are improving trump s re election campaign is poised to focus on economic growth under his administration mollica said it s easy to lean into attacks on the president but democratic candidates need to pitch their own policies to contrast the incumbent republican president both political parties consider the great lakes state vital to taking control of the white house in 2020 kyle klondik managing editor of sabato s crystal ball a political newsletter run by the university of virginia center for politics said democrats path to victory relies on taking back michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania a republican win in michigan would likely ensure trump remains in the white house klondik said you re going to see both sides go all out in michigan klondik said dems test the water much of the democratic conversation nationally is focused on progressive ideas like medicare for all the green new deal and social justice in michigan democrats are also trying to show they understand the concerns of working families former texas rep beto o rourke visited michigan first this year meeting residents at a coffee shop in macomb county s center line before talking to skilled trades workers in ferndale in oakland county o rourke said trade agreements with other countries should hold them to labor standards that level the playing field with the u s he said improving access to education and technical training will address a state wide need to fill skilled trades jobs the former texas senate candidate hasn t been specific enough in his policy stances said bernie porn president of polling firm epic mra he s an interesting guy but michigan is a long way from texas porn said he will be competitive on the money end of things but it s yet to be determined whether he will have a competitive message u s sen kirsten gillibrand d n y discussed topics curated for a michigan audience at an msnbc town hall in auburn hills gillibrand said tax breaks in the green new deal a resolution proposing sweeping economic reforms to fight climate change and income inequality will inventivize energy efficient manufacturing jobs in the u s she supports a version of medicare for all that allows private insurers to exist unlike a plan proposed by u s sen bernie sanders i vt that would eliminate private health insurers during an april campaign tour through the midwest sanders focused on michigan s working families sanders met with union workers in ottawa county before holding a rally in macomb county like trump sanders highlighted the negative impact of trade deals and called for measures to strengthen protect american jobs however sanders painted trump as a pathological liar elected on false promises to stand with the working class sanders called on trump to go back to the drawing board on the united states mexico canada agreement a replacement to the north american free trade agreement that needs to be ratified by congress sanders said the deal lacks enforcement measures to prevent companies like general motors from sending american jobs to mexico the impact of nafta and trade policy holds more significance among michigan voters said political analyst and former republican state legislator bill ballenger sanders kept a strong focus on trade issues when he narrowly won the 2016 michigan democratic primary his experience gives him an advantage over other candidates who never stepped foot on michigan soil to campaign porn said those are issues where he scored a lot of points especially with working folks porn said macomb county was key to trump s election in 2016 porn said disaffected democrats there will look for a moderate candidate former vice president and presidential candidate joe biden is expected to attract labor groups moderate democrats and independent voters in michigan s blue collar communities before biden entered the race last week ballenger said biden would find an instant base of support in michigan the delaware democrat is expected to court organized labor groups in midwest battlegrounds starting in pennsylvania on april 29 biden could find a center lane while progressives split their support among other democrats who stand further to the left ballenger said it s too early to draw any meaningful conclusions about which democrats are connecting with michigan voters nobody has solidified anything at this point ballenger said nobody has a cohesive message candidates messages for michigan will be tested in a few months detroit will host the second democratic primary debate over two nights from july 30 31 trump doubles down the president is poised to double down on his successful message to michigan voters in 2020 trump summoned thousands of fired up supporters to fill an arena in downtown grand rapids on march 28 in front of a large banners reading jobs jobs jobs trump said his presidency is delivering the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth according to a report published by university of michigan economists on april 5 michigan added jobs in every year from 2011 to 2018 resulting in total growth of 555 400 jobs the pace of job growth has generally slowed over the recovery period but michigan still added 50 000 jobs last year michigan s unemployment rate is expected to stay around 4 for the next two years the trump administration is keeping a focus on the auto industry trump s top campaign promises to michigan in 2016 included re negotiating nafta vice president mike pence made several stops across southeast michigan last week fundraising for the president s re election campaign and drumming up support for the usmca michigan s big three automakers praised the deal at an event in taylor pence said the usmca absolutely essential to keep michigan automotive manufacturers competitive promising the trade deal would bring billions of dollars in new investment nationwide polls and dollars provide clues early polls and fundraising figures provide some clues on what messages are working in michigan ben tulchin a pollster for sanders 2016 and 2020 campaigns said recent polling shows michigan voters believe sanders has a better understanding of ordinary americans an april 22 poll conducted by tulchin research shows sanders with an 11 percentage point lead over trump an emerson college poll of michigan voters also showed trump well behind biden and sanders in head to head matchups statewide the poll showed president trump had a 52 disapproval rate and 40 approval rate more than half of michigan voters surveyed said they are unlikely to vote for trump support for trump in michigan remains strong if first quarter fundraising is any indication trump pulled in nearly 265 000 from michigan residents from january through march the most of any candidate sanders raised the most among democrats during the first quarter of 2019 by far his 18 2 million haul included nearly 70 000 in itemized contributions from michigan residents u s sen kamala harris d calif raised 12 million in the first quarter including 35 800 from michigan residents south bend mayor pete buttigeig raised nearly 30 000 from michigan residents and 7 million nationally outpacing other candidates who hold higher political offices porn said buttigeig could find popularity in southwest michigan considering south bend s proximity to the state border klondik said the democratic primary has yet to break down along ideological lines and demographics today s front runners could very well sit at the back of the pack in the months to come he said
get africafocus bulletin by e mail format for print or mobile africa global fighting tax evasion and tax avoidance africafocus bulletin april 30 2019 190430 reposted from sources cited below editor s note the un economic commission for africa eca in its annual economic report on africa focused on financing development in africa highlighted the urgency to curb what it termed revenue leaks through tax evasion and tax avoidance as well as through misguided government policies multinational corporations corrupt officials and financial intermediaries around the world siphon off african wealth leaving national budgets starved for resources to invest in health education and sustainable economic growth this report released on march 23 and available on the eca website direct link lays out specific ways in which african countries can curb these revenue leaks but it also stresses that these are limited by the fact that so much of the diverted wealth is hidden in financial capitals outside africa less than a month later from april 15 18 the un forum on financing for development met at the un headquarters in new york but references to illicit financial flows from tax evasion and tax avoidance were buried in short references deep within the report ironically examples of stolen wealth parked in high end real estate or passing through global banks could be found only blocks away from the un in mid manhattan this africafocus bulletin contains excerpts from the eca report as well as brief descriptions and links to two cases illustrating such illicit financial flows a 7 1 million condominium in trump tower owned by the daughter of an african president and a 2 2 billion set of bank loans to mozambique now under indictment in a new york court for previous africafocus bulletins on illicit financial flows and related issues visit end editor s note economic report on africa 2019 fiscal policy for financing sustainable development in africa executive summary background transitioning to the africa we want is within our reach africa is making steady progress in building the critical ingredients for sustainable and resilient societies but progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs is slow and uneven across the continent access to basic infrastructure such as energy water and sanitation services is improving but falls well below the global average the financing needs across the continent to meet the sdgs are huge and the financing gap is wide estimates of the financing needs range from 614 billion to 638 billion a year unctad 2014 africa s annual financing needs for infrastructure food security health education and climate change mitigation alone are estimated at 210 billion unctad 2014 to narrow the financing gap african countries need to enhance domestic resource mobilization and that requires sustained improvement in the efficiency and efficacy of fiscal policy key findings economic growth in africa which moderated from 3 4 per cent in 2017 to 3 2 per cent in 2018 was supported largely by solid global growth a moderate increase in commodity prices and favourable domestic conditions in some of africa s largest economies south africa angola and nigeria growth trended upwards but remains vulnerable to shifts in commodity prices at the subregional level east africa remains the fastest growing at 6 1 per cent in 2017 and 6 2 per cent in 2018 west africa s economy expanded by 3 2 per cent in 2018 up from 2 4 per cent in 2017 while central north and southern africa s economies grew at a slower pace in 2018 compared to 2017 africa has made notable progress in education health and other social outcomes progress in poverty reduction has been steady the poverty rate dropped from 54 3 per cent in 1990 to 36 per cent in 2016 however the pace of poverty reduction is also slow and inclusive growth leaving no one behind remains elusive the poverty gap which measures the depth of poverty remains high at 15 2 per cent against a global average of 8 8 per cent partly because of high income related inequities in access to public services corporate tax reductions offer little incentive for investments for african countries lowering taxes does not significantly influence investment the report finds that to achieve a 1 percent increase in total investment governments could lose up to 20 per cent in tax revenue african countries should thus avoid joining the race to the bottom and lowering taxes to attract foreign investment since the gains will be much smaller than the revenue loss base erosion and profit shifting are major sources of revenue leaks eliminating base erosion and profit shifting could boost tax revenue in africa by an estimated 2 7 per cent of gdp the main avenues of tax evasion and avoidance in the natural resources sector in africa highlighted in the report are the use of nonstrategic tax incentives loopholes in double taxation agreements difficulties in applying the arm s length principle effectively in regulating intra company transactions inclusion of fiscal stability clauses in contracts and a lack of coordination and information sharing among government agencies policy options for the natural resources sector african countries should strengthen their oversight of the natural resources sector they could consider a more equitable and less administratively challenging approach to assessing what share of multinational corporations profits to tax for example based on the share of sales or other variables or they could base taxes on variables that are harder to manipulate than corporate income at the same time governments need to close loopholes to thwart base erosion and profit shifting chapter 6 multinational corporations tax avoidance and evasion and natural resources management introduction natural resources production in africa has expanded in the past decade africa s production of 15 important metals was forecast to rise by 78 per cent over 2010 2017 more than double the 30 per cent forecast for the americas and asia us geological survey cited in afdb 2013 as africa s subsoil remains relatively underexplored increased investment can only enhance discovery rates knebelmann 2017 natural gas fields offshore of northern mozambique have attracted investments from multinational corporations but future government revenues are threatened by a 2 1 billion loan scam that was engineered by bankers in london and a shipping company in abu dhabi credit anadarko the natural resources sector is dominated by multinational corporations and state owned enterprises which are the only firms that have the ability to raise the necessary capital and manage the associated high risks imf 2014a mullins 2010 however multinational corporations also have the ability to undertake complex international tax avoidance strategies that shift profits from where the underlying economic activities take place to lowor no tax jurisdictions a behaviour referred to as base erosion and profit shifting this can significantly reduce fiscal revenue in countries that rely heavily on natural resources revenue undp 2017 oecd 2015 multinational corporations have engaged in tax avoidance running into the tens of millions of dollars for individual companies and billions of dollars a year for individual countries actionaid 2015 africa progress panel 2013 bloomberg 2012 oxfam 2015 in 2015 base erosion and profit shifting led to an estimated 240 billion annual revenue loss for countries around the world in all sectors solheim 2016 the impact of base erosion and profit shifting as a percentage of tax revenues is higher in developing countries than in developed countries oecd 2015 2014 in 2013 base erosion and profit shifting cost africa an estimated 2 7 per cent of gdp in lost revenues cobham and janský 2018 other estimates of losses through base erosion and profit shifting ranged from 1 to 6 per cent of gdp moore prichard and fjeldstad 2018 natural resources taxation will continue to present critical fiscal concerns for developing countries particularly in resource rich countries oecd 2014 multinational corporations and illicit financial flows tax avoidance and evasion tax avoidance is an elusive term the organisation for economic co operation and development notes that it is generally used to describe the arrangement of a taxpayer s affairs that is intended to reduce his tax liability and that although the arrangement could be strictly legal it is usually in contradiction with the intent of the law it purports to follow defining tax evasion is more straightforward it is generally used to mean illegal arrangements where liability to tax is hidden or ignored i e the taxpayer pays less tax than he is legally obligated to pay by hiding income or information from the tax authorities oecd n d a illicit financial flows the high level panel on illicit financial flows from africa defines illicit financial flows as international financial transfers that are illegally acquired transferred or used as well as aggressive tax avoidance illicit does not necessarily mean illegal but the harm that base erosion profit shifting aggressive tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning do to development justifies considering them illicit flows because they are morally wrong eca 2018b 2018c anyone who facilitates such flows including the jurisdictions that attract them has an obligation to act to prevent them channels for illicit financial flows multinational corporations and other economic actors in the natural resources sector may generate illicit flows in a number of ways as discussed below aggressive tax planning tax treaties may enable multinational corporations in the natural resources sector to structure their operations to minimize tax liabilities one way is to set up a complex network of offshore companies to facilitate intra company trade mullins 2010 this network of offshore companies can be used to circumvent public disclosure requirements and create an avenue for tax avoidance by enabling multinational corporations to report more of their profits in low tax jurisdictions abusing transfer pricing multinational corporations can also manipulate the prices of goods and services traded between different parts of the multinational group in order to shift profits to jurisdictions where corporate income taxes are low such abuses of transfer pricing by multinational corporations can result in major losses of public revenue readhead 2016 in addition to avoiding taxes abusive transfer pricing can also be used to enable multinational corporations to transfer funds to jurisdictions with a high degree of financial secrecy this can allow them to use these funds to engage in corrupt transactions such as paying bribes to government agents in exchange for favourable treatment while avoiding detection because of the financial secrecy surrounding the part of the company dealing with the relevant financial resources africa progress panel 2013 oecd n d a misclassifying the quantity or quality of extracted resources taxes are levied on the value of extracted natural resource so countries have an interest in ensuring that reported quantities and qualities are accurate royalty rates for mineral products generally depend on their composition or quality which may vary companies may take advantage of this process of royalty calculation by declaring that extracted minerals are of lower quality than they truly are where companies export unprocessed minerals such as ores it may be difficult for government authorities to assess the mineral content of the exports misinvoicing trade transactions natural resources and commodities are susceptible to the intentional manipulation of invoices of goods or services exports or imports to disguise their true value and evade taxes and customs duties misinvoicing and mispricing are also done to facilitate the shifting of profits to low tax jurisdictions african union and eca 2014 baker et al 2014 save the children uk 2015 unctad 2016 overvaluing deductible expenses another channel for illicit flows is inflating deductible expenses again through relationships of multinational corporations with affiliates for example firms may inflate costs on loans and technical services acquired from related parties and overstate deductible expenses for equipment and other supplies while under declaration of the quantity and quality of resources affects royalty payments to the government cost inflation usually affects income based taxes which are becoming more common in many countries treaty shopping has reduced corporate income tax revenue by above 15 per cent in african countries that have signed a treaty with an investment hub beer and loperick 2018 a particular blow to countries with a high dependence on corporate income taxes mauritius which has received attention recently for facilitating treaty shopping took steps to address this by revising its double taxation agreements with india and south africa in 2015 multinational corporations in the natural resources sector can also avoid taxation in resource rich countries by routing asset sales through low tax jurisdictions administrative corruption and illicit financial flows administrative corruption also contributes to the prevalence of illicit financial flows in the natural resources sector in africa table 6 4 weak governance systems and lack of transparency give government officials too much discretionary power making them susceptible to bribes or theft of natural resources or associated revenue african union and eca 2014 officials discretionary power can also be used to award contracts to multinational corporations that cede or limit some taxation rights in return for bribes thus undermining competition multinational corporations often encourage the corruption that facilitates illicit financial flows eca 2016 because illicit financial flows benefit both multinational corporations and corrupt officials it can be difficult to introduce more transparency to stop illicit financial flows in africa this may explain why organizations dealing with illicit financial flows are often underfunded and lack the power to prosecute cases related to illicit financial flows african union and eca 2014 and eca 2018c stolen wealth hiding in plain sight while un officials debate how to find funds for financing development stolen wealth that has already left africa is hiding only a few blocks away in mid town manhattan in high end realestate such as trump tower and in records at global banks such as credit suisse while some is still deeply hidden in mazes of shell companies or misleading corporate reports more and more is being exposed by investigative journalism and court investigations two prominent recent cases highlight a 7 1 million condominium in trump tower purchased with funds stolen for oil revenues in the republic of congo and the other funds channeled through the new york office of credit suisse as part of a fraudulent 2 2 billion set of loans to mozambique recovering the funds is far from easy but exposing the money trails is an essential first step whether for doing that or for preventing similar tax evasion and avoidance in the future the trump tower condominium it was revealed in a recent global witness report was purchased in 2014 by ecree a new york llc newly created by a leading new york law firm global witness traced the purchase across multiple countries direct link beginning with a payment by the government of the republic of congo of 765 million to the delaware subsidiary of a brazilian firm in late 2013 through a 31 million payment from delaware through a shell company in the british virgin islands to another shell company in cyprus set up by a lawyer in portugal to the final transfer of 7 1 million to the new york llc meanwhile the portuguese lawyer who represented both the brazilian company and the government of the republic of congo had transferred ownership of the company in cyprus to claudia sassou nguesso the daughter of the president of the republic of congo the wealth ending up parked at trump tower is only a fraction of that funneled out of congo s oil wealth by its president and his family most oil sales are managed through swiss trading companies and through the refinery managed by the president s son and invesitations in france have targeted the family s numerous holdings in that country in the mozambique case an indictment issued by a grand jury in the eastern district of new york in december 2018 featured a multinational cast of characters the five named individuals indicted include the former minister of finance of mozambique a lebanese businessman representing an international shipping conglomerate in abu dhabi and three london based bankers employed at the time of the loans by the giant swiss bank credit suisse mozambican civil society is challenging the legitimacy of the loans given that they were not legally approved and the mozambican government has filed a case in london but the future disposition of liability will depend on court proceedings in mozambique london and new york given the damages suffered by mozambique in recent months the outcome will have major impact on the country s capacity to recover actions that disrupt any part of this vicious cycle of illicit financial flows and poor governance can help to tackle illicit financial flows african countries may wish to strategically plan for which parts of the chain to address first focusing on those that are easier to achieve and that will make it easier to target others later for example if the customs authority is a pocket of efficiency in a national administration strengthening its capacities to prevent illicit financial flows through trade may cut off the resources used by corrupt officials to prevent improvements in public transparency this in turn can make it easier politically to pursue anti corruption measures challenges in ending illicit financial flows african countries face several challenges in fighting illicit financial flows from the natural resources sector first many countries lack the skills and resources including laboratories for testing the composition and quality of extracted resources needed to verify the submissions of multinational corporations countries need to build capacities in this area in some cases with international assistance efforts to build national administrators capacities in tax audit such as the tax inspectors without borders initiative have experienced challenges in some countries national administrations have been sidelined while the external auditors assigned to the project have had conflicts of interest eca 2018b second in light of the complex network of offshore companies used by multinational corporations weak public disclosure requirements and enforcement may jeopardize efforts to curb the abuse of tax provisions and illicit financial flows third the form that illicit financial flows take depends on individual country characteristics many government officials in africa are unfamiliar with how such flows operate in their national context and estimates of the extent of such flows and their sources are scarce learning more about them should be a priority eca 2018c fourth as with natural resources taxation there is little information sharing and coordination on illicit financial flows among relevant government agencies within or between countries coordination is a relatively inexpensive yet effective way to counter illicit financial flows eca 2018b 2018c institute for austrian and international tax law n d initiatives to combat tax avoidance and evasion oecd base erosion and profit shifting package the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting beps report set out a 15 point action plan to equip governments with the domestic and international tools they need to combat base erosion and profit shifting oecd 2014 the report recognised that greater transparency and improved data are needed to uncover and stop the divergence between where profits are made and where they are reported for tax purposes with multinational corporations dominating the natural resources sector cross border transactions between related parties abound and create multiple opportunities for abusing transfer pricing the oecd s beps in particular actions related to transfer pricing outcomes and value creation and country by country reporting can provide a starting point for countries in africa to deal with transfer mispricing country by country reporting is a risk profiling tool that can be used to flag discrepancies between where economic activity by multinational corporations takes place and where the corporations pay taxes oecd 2014 other priorities for tackling base erosion and profit shifting such as non strategic tax incentives governance of tax administration and tax competition are not included in the oecd package african countries will therefore need to consider additional policies that are outside of the oecd beps package for example the sixth method pioneered and used successfully in argentina calls for commodities traded within a multinational group to be priced according to publicly quoted prices to simplify transfer pricing administration and settle disputes grondona 2018 formulary apportionment and moves away from income based taxation while the oecd beps actions can be a useful starting point for african countries to reduce base erosion and profit shifting some of the proposed solutions may be difficult to apply taxing multinationals on the income of their local branches or subsidiaries is inherently vulnerable to the manipulation of profits even with the oecd beps package this suggests that there may be advantages to a shift away from income based taxation which may be easier to manipulate towards taxation based on variables that are more difficult to manipulate given the arguments about the role of income based taxation in balancing risk a good approach might be to use a variable that closely tracks corporate income but is less easy to manipulate this would seem to rule out any variable that is based on intracompany transfers including sales and imports particularly those for which comparable prices are not available as these may be more susceptible to manipulation other variables may be less susceptible to manipulation such as gross sales of minerals payments to factors of production capital labour and land that are located in country or domestic utility payments though gross sales of minerals for example can be manipulated by multinationals in many cases this may be more difficult than manipulating corporate income since the prices at which minerals are traded can be compared with global market prices the high level panel on illicit financial flows from africa and others recommend increasing tax transparency expanding networks for the exchange of information and participating in the automatic exchange of information between countries and ensuring the availability of ownership information to reduce illicit financial flows eca 2018b mullins 2010 12 there is now a burgeoning movement towards greater transparency in tax matters which may change the way that multinational corporations operate to facilitate the detection of aggressive tax planning a new global standard for the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes endorsed by the oecd in july 2014 calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions the standard is intended to strengthen international efforts to increase transparency cooperation and accountability among financial institutions and tax administrations and enable governments to recover tax revenue lost to non compliant taxpayers the new standard will generate secondary benefits by increasing voluntary disclosures of concealed assets and by encouraging taxpayers to report all relevant information oecd n d b noting the challenges that african countries face in the exchange of information for tax purposes the global forum and its partners launched the africa initiative in 2014 the initiative is intended to use technical assistance and political engagement to enable african countries to take advantage of improvements in international tax transparency that can increase domestic resource mobilization and fight illicit financial flows oecd n d c the original three year mandate was renewed for three more years 2018 2020 at the global forum plenary meeting in november 2017 oecd n d d there is also a move towards public and centralized registers of the ultimate owners of trusts foundations and other opaque vehicles used by multinational corporations advances in this effort will improve transparency in the natural resources sector and illuminate instances where apparently unrelated parties are engaged in base erosion africafocus bulletin is an independent

special items at this point i would like to turn the call over to tom amato trimas s president and ceo tom tom amato president and ceo good morning and thank you sherry if we turn to slide 3 i would like to start by taking a few minutes to remind our investors how we ve begun the process to unleash value through reshaping the trimas portfolio businesses overall trimas had last 12 month sales of 881 million and ebitda margins of about 19 and a market capitalization of about 1 5 billion we operate our businesses in three reporting segments packaging aerospace and specialty products a summary profile of each of these segments is shown on the right side of slide three which we will go into more detail later in the call it s worth noting that while we leverage the trimas business model to drive performance in continuous improvement in each of our facilities and operations the reorganized approach shown here has provided a platform for trimas leadership to prioritize investment and resources in fact based data driven way trimas and our shareholders have benefited from this approach in the form of meaningful financial improvement at the consolidated performance level and subsequent enterprise value appreciation in considering our prioritizing of investments and resources for example today we announced the acquisition of taplast a well recognized company and brand in the dispenser closure and container packaging end market i will cover more specifics on taplast in a few slides we have stated on past earnings calls that we will focus on bolt on acquisitions to support growth in our best performing businesses and the acquisition of taplast represents the second acquisition already this year in our packaging segment to bolster our rieke business the addition of taplast and the previously announced plastic srl transaction will allow us to continue to unleash value in our high performing rieke business in our trimas aerospace group we had a solid quarter we recently focused the product lines and brands in this segment on engineered and standard faster applications over the past two years our new trimas aerospace leadership team has refocused our commercial efforts to better capitalize on available market opportunities and has implemented significant operational changes to increase capacity and improve production efficiencies even though we are beginning to see performance trending in the right direction we remain focused on manufacturing process and productivity improvement initiatives to further advance the operational and financial performance of this business and last but certainly not least in our specialty products segment we have been focused on realignment financial improvement and capacity initiatives related to equipment upgrades and process improvements each business within specialty products has contributed nicely to trimas s overall performance and we will continue to utilize the trimas business model to drive growth and financial and operational improvements in specialty products with that said the journey which we began a few years ago is well under way and i remain excited about continuing to unleash shareholder value for investors for our more proactive and engaged model if we turn to slide 4 our strategy to manage our multi industry businesses and grow shareholder value is straightforward as noted first we rely on the trimas business model to seek to achieve optimal performance in each of our businesses and throughout every one of our locations in turn our businesses our committed to executing against their discrete strategies which include product and process innovation to generate long term growth we covered a few examples on prior earnings calls one of which was an e commerce product innovation to solve a customer challenge and another of which was a factory floor innovation product to improve delivery times we operate all of our businesses with a culture of relentless commitment to cash flow conversion while continuing to reinvest our businesses to improve performance and drive future growth finally a key component of our strategy is our disciplined approach to capital allocation which in addition to reinvestment in our businesses and strategic mna we have in the past year retired about 1 of our outstanding shares and have recently increased our authorization to repurchase shares up to 75 million so with this update let s turn our attention to the first quarter s performance on slide 5 we re off to a solid start for the year which was particularly positive given the first quarter of 2018 was strong both in sales and earnings net sales were still up 1 9 to 221 3 million with organic sales net of currency and acquisitions up 1 6 as compared to q1 18 operating profit was up 1 2 to 28 4 million as compared to first quarter of 2018 diluted earnings per share was up 12 2 to 0 46 per share driven by better operating performance and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter due to the timing of deductions for certain specific items related to stock compensation and state tax planning initiatives at the end of 2018 it was our objective to keep up the momentum into the new year and we are pleased to have started the year with this solid performance across all of our businesses turning to slide 6 as a reminder our first quarter is typically the lowest free cash flow quarter for the year we generated 2 6 million in free cash flow in the first quarter of 2019 which was on plan even though it was less than the 14 4 million generated in the same period a year ago on a comparative basis the main differences in year over year free cash flow generation were higher capital expenditures of 4 million higher investment in operating network and capital of about 3 million and a tax refund of 5 million that we enjoyed in the first quarter of 2018 but did not repeat overall we continue to expect our free cash flow conversion for the year to be greater than 100 of net income as in our guidance our quarter ending leverage ratio was 1 4x down from the prior year s first quarter leverage ratio of 1 8x despite share buyback and the acquisition of plastic srl in the year this ratio does not include the acquisition of taplast which on a pro forma basis would still be well below our target of less than 2x at approximately 1 6x turning to slide 7 we announced today the acquisition of taplast taplast is a designer and manufacturer of dispensers closures and injection blow molded containers for consumer markets with approximately 33 million in annual revenue taplast is a great fit and complement to our rieke business in our packaging group taplast adds to the breadth of our product offering and expands our geographic presence we are particularly excited to bring together the advanced technical and design global teams from taplast and rieke to enhance our overall focus on innovation and continue to solve customer challenges taplast sells its product lines predominantly throughout europe and in the americas with manufacturing facilities in italy and slovakia we identified taplast through the corporate development work we reignited last year to begin to build out our packaging group and we worked closely with taplast s owners and advisors through a private negotiated sale process again we are very excited to have closed in this transaction and we welcome taplast and its employees into our packaging group and the trimas family of businesses with that i will turn the call over to bob who will take use through the segment results bob bob zalupski chief financial officer thank you tom i will begin my comments on slide 9 beginning with the packaging segment overall first quarter performance was on plan with reported net sales of 88 8 million up slightly compared to q1 of a year ago organically we achieved solid sales growth in our health beauty and homecare products up approximately 12 versus q1 2018 which also reflected strong performance versus q1 2017 primarily due to the higher demand in north america and continued sales growth in asia these increases however were offset by lower sales of our food and beverage and industrial products due to softer end market demand in north america and in part due to a period of unusually cold weather in the us which affected certain of our customers production facilities plastic srl which we acquired in january is off to a solid start contributing 2 8 million in sales during the quarter lastly net sales reported in the quarter were negatively affected by approximately 2 million due to the impact of unfavorable currency exchange segment operating profit for the quarter was also on plan at 18 7 million or 21 percent of sales as we continue to reinvest in our products technologies and global capabilities compared to the prior year period operating profit margin was impacted by a less favorable product sales mix unfavorable currency exchange and competitive pricing pressures as discussed on our last earnings call we expected the first quarter to be packaging s lowest sales and operating profit quarter in 2019 as well as the lowest growth quarter compared with 2018 factors contributing to this expectation were an exceptionally strong first quarter a year ago the impact of tariff and trade related uncertainties entering the year and the timing of certain new customer program launches expected to occur in the latter half of 2019 we continue to see solid quoting activity and expect to maintain this momentum through our expanded commercial efforts our technical teams continue to work continue their work to commercialize product applications related to a solid pipeline of innovative product technologies under development for the full year we continue to expect our rieke business organic sales growth rate to approximate 3 5 with operating profit margin remaining in the range of 22 23 the acquisitions of plastic srl and taplast add approximately 45 million in annual revenue which will be prorated for that portion of the year under our ownership while we expect these acquisitions will be slightly dilutive to packaging s overall operating margin in 2019 we will leverage the trimas business model to integrate these businesses with rieke and improve operating profitability over time turning now to slide 10 sales in our aerospace segment increased 1 4 for the quarter to 38 3 million as compared to 37 8 million in the year ago period operating profit for the quarter increased 1 4 million to 6 2 million and operating profit margin improved 400 basis points to 16 1 of sales operating profit increased due to improved production efficiency and a more favorable product sales mix this despite the challenges we continue to address in our standard fastener product line and production facility we are encouraged by the signs of progress at this facility both in terms of order scheduling and production through put we are cautiously optimistic this will lead to improved financial performance of this product line later in the second half of 2019 and beyond as tom noted earlier the aerospace commercial and technical teams have refocused their efforts to better capitalize on available market opportunities and we continue to see increased order intake levels which has further strengthened the backlog in our highly engineered fastener product lines we remain focused on manufacturing process and productivity improvement initiatives at our primary specialty fastener plant to convert this order backlog and continue to advance the operational and financial performance of this business for the full year outlook we continue to expect year over year sales growth in the range of 3 4 and operating profit margin to range between 16 17 turning to slide 11 and our specialty product segment as a reminder we made a reportable segment change effective january 1 in which we now report the machine components business as part of the specialty product segment previously machine components was reported as part of the aerospace segment net sales for the quarter increased 3 million or 3 3 to 94 1 million sales of our industrial products increased approximately 2 million due to solid market demand for large high pressure and specialty steel cylinders net sales of our oil and gas products also increased approximately 1 8 million primarily due to higher sales of our gasket and fastener product lines used in refinery complexes and petrochemical facilities this increase was offset in part by lower sales of our machine components products and the effects of unfavorable currency exchange operating profit declined slightly for the quarter to 10 9 million or 11 5 as compared to 11 2 million or 12 3 in the prior year the benefits of increased sales levels and lower selling general administrative expenses were more than offset by higher conversion costs associated with a less favorable product sales mix related to industrial cylinders and engine applications for oil and gas well head extraction for the full year we continue to expect our specialty product segment to achieve sales growth of 4 6 and we expect to leverage higher sales levels as well as our continuous improvement initiative over the remainder of the year to achieve segment operating margin in the range of 11 13 i would now like to shift gears and briefly touch on our strong balance sheet and the available liquidity on slide 13 as of march 31 our net debt and leverage remain below our target levels even after considering the cash used to fund the acquisition of plastic srl and the share repurchases that we completed during the past few quarters we ended the quarter with 84 million of cash on book after funding the 22 million purchase price for plastic srl and the increased capital deployed toward the ongoing reinvestment in our businesses we ended the quarter with net debt of 209 5 million with a resulting leverage ratio of 1 4x our strong balance sheet we have approximately 370 million of cash and aggregate availability under our revolving credit facility and solid track record of free cash flow generation positions us well for the remainder of the year and provides both ample capacity and flexibility to fund our balanced capital allocation priorities at this point i will now turn the call back to tom for his wrap up tom tom amato president and ceo thank you bob if we turn to slide 14 and as noted in our earnings release this morning we are reaffirming our 2019 guidance which we first presented in february with organic sales in the 3 5 range eps in the 1 82 to 1 92 range and free cash flow greater than 100 of net income q1 is expected to be our lowest organic sales growth quarter for the year and our current bookings support higher year over year growth rates as we move through 2019 first quarter eps was a little higher than planned due to the fact that the discrete tax items occurred in q1 versus being budgeted natively throughout the year therefore our tax rate for the remainder of the year will be trending toward the higher end of our guidance range in addition our guidance does not include the results of taplast as we continue to work through purchase accounting impacts related to the transaction with that said we do anticipate that taplast will be accretive to eps and will add approximately 0 01 per quarter over the remainder of the year prior to opening the call up to q a i would like to remind our investors of the prospect we have to continue to drive shareholder value at trimas in slide 15 by utilizing the trimas business model we will always drive continuous improvement in all that we do and we will do this through championing a culture of kaizen and operational excellence we have not only been operationally improving trimas s businesses but we are also starting to see the benefits of our investment in innovation and growth through our solid in bookings and new program wins our capital allocation priorities remain to first reinvest in our businesses with a key focus on the highest return and factory floor improvement projects and secondarily ensure we operate with a net debt ratio below our overarching target of 2x a level which we are now comfortably below while seeking to grow our highest potential platforms through mna as well as continuing to take other treasury actions to benefit shareholders while we have been operating solidly against the first two pillars on this page we have started to take more meaningful steps with respect to capital allocation priorities as evidenced by the two bolt on acquisitions completed this year 12 million in share repurchases to date and an increase to our share repurchase authorization all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with that i remain excited about the prospects for trimas and the multiple levers we have available to us to drive shareholder value thank you sherry lauderback vice president of investor relations and communications thank you tom at this point we d like to open the call up to your questions questions and answers operator thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone keypad if you re using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press 1 to ask a question we ll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions again that is 1 to ask a question the next question will come from scot graham with bmo capital markets please go ahead scott graham bmo capital markets analyst hi this katya on for scott tom amato president and ceo hi katya scott graham bmo capital markets analyst quick question on the packaging i think you said there are competitive pricing pressures can you maybe talk a little bit more on what s going on there and what your expectations are for pricing for the rest of the year bob zalupski chief financial officer sure look i think as in any business we face competitive market dynamics not just in packaging but the other businesses as well that we have to be responsive to in terms of our pricing strategies and mindful of the impact that that can have on our volume activity and so we take actions as needed to ensure we maintain that volume with customers and it s very specific to both geographies product lines and customers so in the main we ve done a pretty good job of balancing those dynamics in terms of maintaining an overall operating margin in that business of 21 22 23 historically tom amato president and ceo and i would also add that to help mitigate this pressure in any one of our businesses the continuous improvement program which is a key tenet of the trimas business model is imperative for us to operate against successfully so we can protect from just general market forces but this is something that we as we review performance in all of our businesses we have a very robust process of looking at very specific continuous improvement programs in some cases by location and that allows us to remain competitive vis a vis our competitors scott graham bmo capital markets analyst okay now i know that first quarter organic sales are gonna be the slowest of the year and that orders are trending well but could you maybe talk a little bit about how orders are trending relative to your 3 5 organic sales growth tom amato president and ceo well we re seeing you know we re seeing in bookings across all of our businesses that suggest at least as we sit here today that we re comfortable with our outlook so that s the one thing that as we look at our in bookings and our quoting activity which for us are pretty key indicators that have us remaining optimistic about our outlook bob zalupski chief financial officer we had some very strong organic growth in our home beauty and healthcare product segment 12 compared to the prior year for q1 and as we enter qs 2 and 3 which typically are higher volume quarters based on just seasonality type of activity we anticipate our ability to maintain the guidance range of 3 5 organic growth scott graham bmo capital markets analyst okay i just have one more do you foresee any impact from boeing s max issues tom amato president and ceo so we do supply fasteners to the 737 max and as you re aware they re still in production of albeit at a slightly reduced level we are still supplying and customer is still taking through distribution and directly to our min max level programs which i think most suppliers are doing overall for a plane of this size and construction we would be in roughly about the 20 000 00 shipset range so given the amount of less production that s occurring versus the overall plan it s we don t see it as much of an impact for us at the current forward projection scott graham bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you for the question the next question will come from matt koranda with ross capital partners please go ahead with your question matt koranda ross capital partners analyst hey this is mike on for matt good morning tom amato president and ceo morning mike bob zalupski chief financial officer good morning mike matt koranda ross capital partners analyst so my first question on packaging and apologies if you already said this but is there a particular region where food and beverage and industrial products were a little weaker in the quarter tom amato president and ceo well we sell most of our food beverage into the us north america and industrial i don t know if we mentioned it or not but was a little weaker more in north america than rest of world so it s predominantly for both cases a us north america impact matt koranda ross capital partners analyst okay great and then regarding taplast what are the operating margins for taplast and what kind of synergies can we extract either on the commercial side or the cost side of things tom amato president and ceo so the margins for the business are below where rieke operates today and given some of the margins of rieke that s typically the case as we look for transaction opportunities acquisition opportunities in the market we see a number of opportunities for synergies both in terms of cost structure for example this is a smaller business that ran stand alone so when we plug it into the larger rieke organization the larger rieke global organization right away there will be benefits to that as we eliminate some of those stand alone costs in addition to that there s a number of product line opportunities that for example customers of taplast were seeking for taplast to supply them in other parts of the world that would have been very difficult for taplast of its size to supply those product lines or technologies in those parts of the world but for us we have locations everywhere where customers would like them to be with their specific products so we can quickly adapt and support that growth so synergies both in the areas of cost structure and procurement as well but also in the future revenues side matt koranda ross capital partners analyst okay great that s helpful and then last one on specialty products are there any brands that are seeing more of an impact from cost inflation and is this starting to abate in any specific brands as well tom amato president and ceo i don t think we re seeing any across the board cost inflation that are drivers that we can t offset through our normal continuous improvement activities i do think if we didn t have and i ve said this before if we didn t have tariffs or at one point toward the end of last year material we might be talking about freight more because freight definitely is up up over the past year year and a half but these are things that we have to seek to mitigate through continuous improvement and pricing where we can get that bob zalupski chief financial officer yeah i think we saw a lot of those impacts in terms of both input costs and freight costs a year ago they seem to be moderating as we enter into 2019 so it doesn t mean they re declining but the rate of increase has lessened and we d expect that absent any you know significant change to the macroeconomic trends to sort of continue through the remainder of the year matt koranda ross capital partners analyst okay great thanks a lot i ll slip back in the queue tom amato president and ceo thank you operator thank you for the question the next question will come from steve barger with keybanc capital markets please go ahead steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning everybody tom amato president and ceo hi steve bob zalupski chief financial officer hi steve steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst on your comment on industrial packaging organic growth being weak in north america what drove that and has that persisted in april tom amato president and ceo well we did see to start the year a little bit of a slowdown across the board in north america in industrial and then when we had that cold snap of weather that certainly didn t help so that was a bit of the more of the major driver to it as we look at our forecast for industrial you know we re seeing a little bit of softness but it is mainly related to what our end customers are seeing as they look at their overall end markets versus any other type of share matter or something like that steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst right and if you can try and step back from the weather which end markets are you seeing that in i m just curious is it machinery or is it a distribution issue or bob zalupski chief financial officer so when we look at our industrial segment for packaging we re talking about drum and tote closures and dispensers so typically that would go to the petrochemical markets for example and that s the ordering cadence for that sector is a little bit off and we have seen this from some of the larger customers in the spaces talk about that as well steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst got it thank you where is taplast on capacity utilization and will it require any step up in capex or has that business been invested inappropriately over the years bob zalupski chief financial officer very good question we likely will invest in capital but more to adapt some of the production techniques to some methods and opportunities for improvement that we re more familiar with for example in automation and assembly production lines as far as capacity goes there is available capacity on some of the equipment not all their equipment and also in terms of floor space so we have an opportunity in slovakia to grow we re looking at that facility as an opportunity as well as in their povolaro facility steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst and sorry if i missed this but did you say what multiple of ebitda you paid bob zalupski chief financial officer i did not we do disclose the price in the queue and it was sort of high single digits before synergies steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst okay as you ve transitioned back to being more active on mna are you looking across all segments or do you really wanna stay focused on packaging because of the return profile there just holistically how are you thinking about mna tom amato president and ceo great question and something that we talked about on previous occasions and it s more appropriate to revisit now perhaps having closed our second deal on packaging much of the work as you can imagine to bring deals to closure take a lot of time and the work on taplast and the work on plastic srl and others that we are looking at and preparing for in the pipeline started over a year ago as we worked and honed the strategy for our packaging business and we declared at that time that we want to invest mna dollars in our best performing businesses so we have identified packaging as an area where we wanna build out that platform with the better performance and turnaround operationally of our aerospace business where we can find select opportunities that would be bolt ons or nice additions to complement that business we would definitely consider as well but i wanna emphasize bolt ons we re not looking for anything transformational certainly in trimas aerospace and then with respect to specialty products as i talked about to open up the call we have strategically either relative to financial performance or just generally what we do with the strategic direction of some of those businesses we really wanna work on operating those businesses better ensuring they have long term sustainable high performance and in some cases we re not there yet so our emphasis for mna is gonna simply be the priority of our packaging group building that out and then in a very focused way in trimas aerospace steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst got it and can you just last question any what s your internal measure of hurdle rate as you think about mna or how are you kind of gauging what you will consider a successful business bob zalupski chief financial officer well we ll look at a successful we ll say a successful transaction i mean versus a successful business because that could be a broad characteristic depending on what they bring to us but in terms of our metric our internal metric we re looking at achieving our cost to capital of above 8 by the third year of ownership and so that translates to getting to a roa above 8 by third year of ownership and as we look at deals that s the minimum metric that they have to achieve either through purchase price on the deal or through synergies that we could gain after steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst understood thank you tom amato president and ceo you got it thank you operator thank you for your question again if you have a question at this time please dial 1 to enter the queue the next question will be from andy casey with wells fargo please go ahead andy casey wells fargo analyst morning this is actually patrick who is standing in for andy casey thanks for taking our questions tom amato president and ceo hi patrick andy casey wells fargo analyst just on your packaging segment i was wondering if you can bucket sort of the delta between you know this year s ebit margin versus last year s i think it was around 120 bps difference you called out effects obviously competitive pricing as well that mix can you bucket that firstly and then also just associated with your question on pricing earlier what regions are you seeing the pressure more from is it fair to say from your commentary that it s more from domestic industrial and food and bev bob zalupski chief financial officer i wouldn t characterize it as being focused in a particular segment or a particular geography i mean generally speaking it there s instances of competitive pricing and challenges really across all our markets and i don t view that as being any different than any other business or end market that you happen to be participating in so in that sense i think our team is very good at balancing the equation of pricing and retaining business as well as improving on a value added proposition that might allow us to obtain the business or retain the business without price reduction so i don t view this as being any different than what we ve experienced across packaging for many years in terms of the margin differential it s largely product mix and as we talked about our top line much higher sales growth in hbhc which operating margins are slightly lower than the overall packaging average and lesser sales volume in both food and beverage and industrial in the first quarter we expect as we look out over the remainder of the year as those levels of activity and those two end markets rebound consistent with our plan that the margin average will get back into the guidance range of 22 23 andy casey wells fargo analyst got it thanks for that and just a little bit more on taplast and i guess even sro for that matter you know just trying to reconcile your commentary on the deal being about a penny accretive sort of on a quarterly basis moving forward but the margins for that business a bit below your current packaging segment margin just wondering how should we think about where the accretion is from and also as you put these businesses through your business model your trimas business model what kind of levels can they ultimately get up to a little bit more color on that would be great tom amato president and ceo sure so let me take the question in the order questions in the order you presented so if we talk first about accretion we have to separate ros return on sale from absolute euros or dollars coming into incrementally coming into the business so we are adding you know a nice amount of ebitda from this company this small company it s roughly we ll call it in the plus or minus 4 5 5 million range of ebitda is anticipated to come in that ultimately by the time non cash costs hit that through depreciation and one of the things that we can t answer right now is intangible amortization and taxes is going to result in residual dollars that add to our eps so we ve estimated through our experience in anticipating what purchase accounting is likely to look like here that the net result will be an incremental penny per share for each of the subsequent quarters going forward until we drive further synergies which gets me to the second part of your question yeah i mean we expect that the performance of this business under our ownership not only as part of a larger company a larger global company i mean this was a small company in many ways providing customer support globally which is extremely expensive when we plug this into our organization we can get the global support that taplast would expect to provide its customers through our existing cost structure without adding anything so there s immediate savings that we can get at in short order then longer term as we look at using the best of the best manufacturing techniques not only within rieke not only within taplast but also with plastic srl we would expect that we ll learn from all of our best benchmarking practices to improve the businesses and then in addition to that there s procurement savings and procurement opportunities i mean we buy a lot of polypropylene taplast buys a fraction of that so we ll plug them into our purchasing and hopefully that will provide a benefit as well so it is going to provide absolute eps income to us and we would expect that the margin profile over time under our ownership under the tbm will be driven up as well andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thank you tom amato president and ceo thank you operator thank you for your question

surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 33 per cent this year and is close to the highest in six months while higher prices due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at us100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above us100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at us100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 per cent lower than currently projected by end 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 per cent age points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach us100 3 how will iran and trump impact the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels a day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the u a e those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but us claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they re affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the the world s biggest economy while us oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader us economy won t necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as us100 a barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers that are the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the gas pump already have risen more than 7 per cent this month to us2 89 a gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there s risk that political blame shifts back to the us for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policy makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift their focus to slowing growth that s unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund this month lowered its global growth forecast and said the world is in a delicate moment source bloomberg

available for 90 days supplemental reporting measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders nics as defined by u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap are the most appropriate earnings measurements however we consider funds from operations ffo net operating income noi in place noi ipnoi same store noi ssnoi ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance excluding ebitda and adjusted ebitda these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts we do not control unconsolidated investments while we consider pro rata disclosures useful they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u s gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo attributable to common stockholders as defined by nareit means net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with u s gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders represents ffo attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in exhibit 2 we believe that normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other reits or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and or incalculable items we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties these expenses include but are not limited to property related payroll and benefits property management fees paid to operators marketing housekeeping food service maintenance utilities property taxes and insurance general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs these expenses include but are not limited to payroll and benefits professional services office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets ipnoi represents noi excluding interest income other income and non ipnoi and adjusted for timing of current quarter portfolio changes such as acquisitions development conversions segment transitions dispositions and investments held for sale ssnoi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio as used herein same store is generally defined as those revenue generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year over year reporting periods land parcels loans and sub leases as well as any properties acquired developed redeveloped including major refurbishments where 20 or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts properties undergoing operator transitions and or segment transitions except seniors housing triple net to seniors housing operating with the same operator are also excluded from the same store amounts normalizers include adjustments that in management s opinion are appropriate in considering ssnoi a supplemental non gaap performance measure none of these adjustments which may increase or decrease ssnoi are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap significant normalizers defined as any that individually exceeds 0 50 of ssnoi growth per property type are separately disclosed and explained we believe noi ipnoi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi ipnoi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties no reconciliation of the forecasted range for ssnoi on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable efforts and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long term debt net of cash and internal revenue code irc section 1031 deposits we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile the coverage ratios are based on ebitda which stands for earnings net income per income statement before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization covenants in our senior unsecured notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to those agreements failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and or financial condition due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants we have defined adjusted ebitda to exclude unconsolidated entities and to include adjustments for stock based compensation expense provision for loan losses gains losses on extinguishment of debt gains losses impairments on properties gains losses on derivatives and financial instruments other expenses and additional other income we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations our leverage ratios include net debt to adjusted ebitda net debt is defined as total long term debt excluding operating lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and any irc section 1031 deposits our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally they are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management the supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u s gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies please see the exhibits for reconciliations of

improving was the reduction in water disposal costs due to increased reuse in well completions transportation gathering and compression costs were modestly impaired in the quarter due primarily to an

production costs given the unknown effect timing and potential significance of certain income statement items the decreases in 2019 adjusted ebitdax figures are primarily due to a decline in natural

ebit ebitdax stand alone ebitdax and adjusted ebitdax consolidated are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating cnx resources because they are widely used to evaluate a company s operating performance we exclude stock based compensation from adjusted ebitdax because we do not believe it accurately reflects the actual operating expense incurred during the relevant period and may vary widely from period to period irrespective of operating results investors should not view these metrics as a substitute for measures of performance that are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in addition because all companies do not calculate ebit

including oversupply relative to the demand for our products weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels an extended decline in the prices we receive for our natural gas and natural gas liquids affecting our operating results and cash flows our dependence on gathering processing and transportation facilities and other midstream facilities owned by cnxm and others disruption of capacity constraints in or proximity to pipeline systems that could limit sales of our natural gas and natural gas liquids and decreases in availability of third party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to cnxm s gathering systems uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas reserves and inaccuracies in our estimates the high risk nature of drilling natural gas wells our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over multiple years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling the impact of potential as well as any adopted environmental regulations including any relating to greenhouse gas emissions on our operating costs as well as on the market for natural gas and for our securities environmental regulations introduce uncertainty that could adversely impact the market for natural gas with potential short and long term liabilities the risks inherent in natural

divergence in the daily relative strength index since then the stock has been trending up click here to read the today s pick on hexaware technologies in full april 30 9 00 am weekly trading guide for week beginning april 30 2019 sbi 312 3 sbi oscillated between 303 5 and 315 5 all through last week the near term outlook is unclear a key support is at 302 and a significant resistance is at 315 the stock can remain range bound between 302 and 315 for some time a breakout on either side of 302 or 315 will decide the direction of the next move a strong break below 302 will bring renewed pressure on the stock such a break will drag the stock lower to 295 and 293 in the near term a further break below 293 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to 285 on the other hand if sbi manages to rise past 315 in the coming days the downside pressure will ease in such a scenario the stock can move up to 320 321 the next crucial resistance zone inability to breach 321 can trigger a pull back move to 315 again but a strong break and a decisive close above 321 will boost the bullish momentum and take sbi higher to 330 335 levels again traders can stay out of the market until a clear trend emerges itc 304 65 itc was volatile last week it fell to a low of 298 7 initially and reversed sharply higher from there to make a high of 309 7 before coming off from there again to close the week on a flat note the weekly candlestick reflects indecisiveness a key support is at 303 a break below it can take the stock lower to 299 the 21 day moving average support which halted the fall last week a bounce from there can take itc higher to 305 310 levels again in such a scenario the stock can trade sideways between 299 and 310 for some time but if itc declines below 299 there is a strong likelihood of it falling to 294 a further fall below 294 looks unlikely now on the other hand the level of 310 has been capping the upside over the last two weeks itc has to breach the key level of 313 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum such a break can take the stock higher to 322 a further break above 322 will then increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting 350 levels over the medium term infosys 737 1 infosys snapped its two week fall and reversed higher last week the stock was up about 3 per cent the 21 week moving average support at 719 has held well and triggered a reversal charts suggest a sideways move between 705 and 775 an intermediate resistance within this range is at 741 a strong break above it can take infosys higher to 770 and 775 the upper end of the range on the other hand inability to break above 741 can drag the stock lower to 715 and 710 a breakout on either side of 705 or 775 will decide the direction of the next move a break below 705 can drag the stock initially lower to 699 a bounce from 699 can trigger a corrective rally to 710 and 715 but a further break below 699 will increase the downside pressure such a break will see infosys tumbling to 680 or even lower levels thereafter however if infosys manages to break the range above 775 the uptrend will remain intact such a break can take the stock higher to 785 790 ril 1 391 45 ril inched higher for the second consecutive week but the stock seems to lack strength however the bias remains bullish on the charts key supports are at 1 359 and 1 355 which are likely to limit the downside a fall below 1 355 looks less probable now as long as the stock remains above these supports the outlook will be positive it will also keep the possibility high of the stock breaking above the psychological level of 1 400 a break above 1 400 will boost the momentum and trigger a fresh rally to 1 470 the bullish outlook will get negated if ril declines below 1 355 a break below 1 355 can take the stock lower to 1 330 and 1 320 in such a scenario ril can remain range bound between 1 320 and 1 400 traders with a medium term perspective can make use of dips to go long at 1 380 and accumulate at 1 370 and 1 360 stop loss can be placed at 1 340 for the target of 1 460 revise the stop loss higher to 1 395 as soon as the stock moves up to 1 405 tata steel 545 tata steel tumbled over 6 per cent intra week and made a low of 509 however the stock clawed back sharply on friday recovering the loss and closed marginally higher for the week the support around 510 has held well cluster of supports is poised in the 540 530 range which can limit the downside in the near term as long as the stock trades above this support zone a rise to 560 is possible inability to breach 560 can drag the stock to 540 and 530 but a decisive close above 560 will boost the bullish momentum and will increase the likelihood of the stock surging to 600 the indicator on the chart is positive the

the resumption of operations at our gibson north mine in the second quarter of 2018 and the addition of two production units at the river view mine in the second half of 2018 drove illinois basin coal sales volumes in the 2019 quarter higher by 9 5 to 7 7 million tons compared to the 2018 quarter sequentially coal sales tons in the illinois basin decreased 3 9 due to lower sales volumes from our gibson complex mines partially offset by increases at river view strong sales performance at our tunnel ridge longwall operation led coal sales volumes for the 2019 quarter higher in appalachia by 10 8 and 6 6 compared to the 2018 and sequential quarters respectively arlp ended the 2019 quarter with total coal inventory of 1 6 million tons a reduction of 0 2 million tons compared to the end of the 2018 quarter coal inventory increased 1 0 million tons compared to the end of the sequential quarter primarily due to increased in transit tons resulting from river transportation disruptions in the 2019 quarter illinois basin coal sales price per ton sold in the 2019 quarter increased 5 0 due to improved domestic market conditions and higher export sales prices compared to the 2018 quarter in appalachia coal sales price per ton decreased 7 1 compared to the sequential quarter due to decreased price realizations at our mc mining and tunnel ridge mines partially offset by an increased mix of higher priced metallurgical coal at our mettiki mine in the illinois basin segment adjusted ebitda expense per ton decreased 1 6 compared to the 2018 quarter primarily due to increased sales of lower cost production from our river view and gibson north mines and improved recoveries from our hamilton mine in the 2019 quarter increased production from our lower cost mines in the 2019 quarter also resulted in a 2 4 reduction of segment adjusted ebitda expense per ton in the illinois basin compared to the sequential quarter in appalachia segment adjusted ebitda expense per ton decreased 2 7 and

benefited from the acquisition in the 2019 quarter segment adjusted ebitda from our royalty segment increased by 5 5 million and 1 8 million compared to the 2018 and sequential quarters respectively market update and outlook focusing on the u s arlp s teams effectively managed around the disruptive weather conditions encountered during the 2019 quarter said mr craft unprecedented flooding and high water levels significantly disrupted barge deliveries throughout the river and port systems delaying the shipment of approximately 750 000 tons of arlp s expected deliveries during the 2019 quarter looking ahead once river and gulf port conditions return to normal we anticipate arlp s delayed shipments will be made up over the next several months we also expect lower customer inventory levels in the eastern u s should support utility coal purchases in the second half of 2019 allowing us to meet our domestic sales target of approximately 32 5 million tons for the year a 10 gain over 2018 results mr craft continued internationally transportation congestion falling natural gas prices in europe and aggressive discounting by foreign producers have created pressure in the seaborne thermal coal markets driving all international thermal indexes significantly lower although we continue to view long term fundamentals for international coal favorably and expect current market conditions to improve the timing of this improvement over the balance of 2019 is unclear in response we are lowering our 2019 target for export coal sales to approximately 11 0 million tons and delaying our planned growth ramp for illinois basin coal volumes by approximately 1 0 million tons this year arlp now anticipates full year 2019 results near the lower end of guidance ranges for total

prepared remarks on our investor relations website following the completion of the call with that i ll now turn the call over to valentin valentin gapontsev good morning everyone we were pleased to deliver first quarter results in line with our guidance during the challenging market and economic geopolitical and competitive environment during the quarter business trends improved in china driving sequential growth in order more importantly we have made competitive challenges head on potentially in manufacturing costs we have also introduced a made to order product that improve our process flexibility and quality for our customers ipg always seeks to gain advantage during times of market threat if properly executed this challenging times can be a catalyst for investment that result in a stronger competitive position on which excess returns can be earned we remain the clear market leader in fiber lasers with hundreds of megawatts of installed capacity in the first quarter we fitted more than 11 megawatts of total optical power up year 10 year over year high power megawatts increased even more with year over year 15 year over year also we have seen a greater pricing among china based competition of for many of us low cost cutting market we increase sales of our head mounted lasers sequentially with even stronger unit growth the pricing environment has affected the dollar value of units ever since march however our ability to actually reduce cost has limited the growth margin impact from such 200 basis points year over year last year we reduced the cost of diodes essentially and some other components by more than 15 and have started the mass production of new diodes in q1 this year we have visibility into further cost reduction and product enhancement that we believe extend our competitive lead in the last quarter we have developed and a couple of weeks ago have started to sell to customers new unique 2 to 4 kilowatts cw lasers with cables give power additional pulse capability that innovation essentially enhanced our competitive position in the catching margin the lasers increased piercing speed improved catch quality delivering cleaner more controlled control of future materials while reducing to compare two competitive ways of other big improvement in sales this year as far the high power sector our multiple ipg customers will fortunately be launching their first 20 kw catching system raising the bar for speed and flexibility in process in thick metals non laser technologies in addition we see continued customer interest in our new generation of high power laser with adjustable mode and beam capability that permit reliable adjustment of our beam to process a wider range of material fixes for catching applications while reducing its pattern and improving quality in welding application we also made solid progress in our newest product areas outside microprocessing sales of green power laser for example used for to improve solar efficiency more than double it year over year we also made the fast growth of sale of our red blue uv and other new products we increased sales of our ultrafast pulse lasers yielded 3x compared with prior year and actually we re actively working on more than 15 new projects for this laser across a wide range of application system sales increased more than 200 and the execution of genesis of outside digital approach within the transportation agriculture the space and industrial and mining sales of beam delivery accessories increased more than 70 year over year we increased sales of our laser based cinema projection system more than 150 year over year as our solution has been adopted at three of the major provider of cinema production technology we also have visibility into strong growth of imaging laser solutions at this year collectively sales for newer laser products and system into emerging application grew at double digit rate in the first quarter and provide 15 of total revenue we continue to demonstrate meaningful traction in ultra high power fiber lasers while investing in new products and application we believe this progress substantially expands our addressable market and opens up opportunities that will drive the company s growth for many years the mission is to make ipg s fiber laser technology the foremost choice in mass production for many years i am confident in our ability to execute on this mission and deliver a strategic returns with that i ll turn the call over to tim timothy mammen thank you valentin and good morning everyone revenue in the first quarter declined 12 year over year to 315 million revenue from materials processing applications decreased 11 year over year and revenue from other applications decreased 32 due to the timing of orders in our advanced applications and communications businesses by region first quarter revenue in china decreased 24 year over year and represented approximately 36 of the total macro driven softness in cutting and marking applications was partially offset by growth in macro welding within china sales of ultra high power cw lasers grew by a double digit percentage but were more than offset by declining sales of lasers for lower power applications in europe revenue decreased 24 year over year primarily due to softness in cutting and additive manufacturing partially offset by growth in welding in europe total sales of 88 million were consistent with the q3 18 level which supports our previous assertion that revenue in the region appears to have stabilized however continued macroeconomic softness in the region as evidenced by the decline in eurozone manufacturing pmi makes project predicting an eventual rebound in europe more challenging in north america revenue increased 65 year over year driven by the acquisition of genesis excluding genesis sales in north america increased 1 year over year with slight declines in cutting welding and marking offset by strength in other products and applications sales in japan decreased 20 year over year on softness in marking welding and cutting however strong bookings in the region adjust improved performance in japan during the second quarter sales in korea increased 4 and revenue in turkey decreased 36 year over year but improved sequentially turning to performance by product high power cw laser sales decreased 22 year over year and represented approximately 57 of total revenue reduced sales of high power cw lasers for cutting and additive manufacturing were partially offset by strength in welding applications sales of ultra high power fiber lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater accounted for nearly 50 of all high power laser sales driven by rapid adoption in cutting applications sales of lasers at 10 kilowatts or greater increased more than 40 year over year while sales of other high power lasers declined year over year due to the weaker demand environment in china and europe and more aggressive price reductions on select products pulsed laser sales decreased 18 year over year with rapid growth in green and ultrafast pulsed lasers offset by reduced sales of other pulsed products medium and low power laser sales decreased 39 on softness in additive manufacturing and the transition to kilowatt scale lasers in cutting qcw laser sales declined 13 year over year but increased 17 on a sequential basis as lower sales into consumer electronics applications was partially offset by increased sales of higher power qcw lasers into other applications system sales increased 245 year over year due to the acquisition of genesis excluding genesis system sales increased nearly 20 year over year driven by growth in macro systems for welding drilling and ablation applications along with the initial acceptance of our laser based cinema projection system with the leading providers in cinema projection technology other product sales increased 6 year over year driven by growth in beam delivery accessories and service revenue gross margin of 47 3 declined 920 basis points from the first quarter 2018 compared with the year ago period less favorable absorption of manufacturing expenses reduced gross margin by nearly 500 basis points lower than expected absorption of manufacturing expenses and a higher inventory provision resulted in gross margin coming in slightly below the low end of our expected q1 range in addition acquisitions reduced gross margin by more than 200 basis points and lower product pricing and foreign exchange headwinds reduced gross margin by a further 200 basis points approximately all the other factors constant we believe that recovery in our business to approximately 380 million in quarterly sales would enable us to get close to the midpoint of our long term gross margin guidance of 50 to 55 third quarter operating income was 68 million or 21 7 of sales down 1 750 basis points from the first quarter 2018 excluding a foreign exchange loss of 2 million operating margin was 22 2 excluding foreign exchange operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 630 basis points year over year due to lower revenue investments in engineer salespeople and it systems higher r d material costs and higher than normal legal expenses net income was 55 million and earnings per diluted share were 1 02 slightly lower than expected absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and higher inventory provision reduced eps by 0 04 relative to guidance in addition higher r d material expenses legal cost and foreign exchange losses reduced eps by 0 04 if exchange rates relative to the u s dollar had been the same as 1 year ago we would have expected revenue to be 15 million higher and gross profits to be 8 million higher in fact the effective tax rate in the quarter was 24 which included certain discrete tax items we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 1 03 billion and total debt of 44 million cash provided by operations was 46 million during the quarter operating cash flow was reduced by cash tax payments that totaled more than 50 million relative to a q1 tax provision of 17 million these payments were primarily related to the timing of cash taxes paid in germany with the filing of our 2017 tax return in q4 2018 capital expenditures were 33 million which included approximately 21 million for the purchase of a new facility in massachusetts as we continue to invest in new plants and equipment to meet demand for our product over the next several years turning to guidance we have seen further signs of improving business conditions in china our largest region with sequential growth in orders and good momentum through the first 3 weeks of the second quarter our first quarter book to bill ratio was above 1 in line with normal seasonality albeit off a lower base given the weaker macroeconomic environment if this momentum in china is maintained it should continue to drive better performance performance in europe is generally stable but down from peak levels reflecting reported economic trends in the region we expect pricing headwinds relative to competition in china to continue we believe our innovative new products accessories and complete solutions would provide customers with a superior value proposition that will cement and enhance our market leadership position based on these factors for the second quarter 2019 we expect revenue of 340 million to 370 million expect our second quarter tax rate to be approximately 25 we anticipate delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of 1 25 to 1 55 commentary from our largest machine tool oem customers continues to improve but we do not yet have clear visibility into their full year order plans as such we do not believe it is appropriate to provide full year revenue guidance at this time as a reminder we would expect year over year trends to improve in the back half of 2019 driven by market recovery and strength in new products and our installations as discussed in the safe harbor passage of today s earnings release actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors including but not limited to product demand order cancellation and delays competition tariffs trade policies and general economic conditions our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company s reports with the sec and with that valentin and i will be happy to take your questions question and answer session operator our first question comes from the line of jim ricchiuti from needham company james ricchiuti tim when you talked about the 200 basis points impact on gross margins from your acquisitions was that all genesis related timothy mammen yes james ricchiuti okay so genesis was about 21 million of revenues in the quarter timothy mammen we said 24 million in the press release so that line there then james ricchiuti okay just as it relates to what you re seeing in the market in china are you hearing anything from your customers that give you any view of a pickup or on the other hand weakness in consumer electronics related revenues timothy mammen we re not hearing anything that s going to drive a very significant pickup but there is some demand for consumer electronics applications we re seeing some order flow from some of the micro welding applications with our qcw lasers we ve been asked to deliver some products very short lead times for that continuing to work on some of the higher power applications for welding the frame around different phones but yes this week this year i don t think it s going to be a significant consumer electronics revenue driver some of the biannual cycles are and i think there s another company that reported last night that reflected that as well so there s some order flow but it s certainly not a bullish tone around consumer electronics in general james ricchiuti understood and then just a clarification and i ll jump back in the queue the book to bill of 1 0 were you are referencing china or were you talking about book to bill across the various regions timothy mammen in total china was also above 1 there as well operator our next question comes from the line of tom diffely from d a davidson thomas diffely i was curious you talked about how you ve been able to offset some of the pricing with some of the new features i m curious what type of features is the most successful is it speed reliability or specific tech specs what do you find the most successful in fighting off some of the pricing pressure timothy mammen so first of all i think really what has offset some of the pricing pressures is being this very significant reduction in components and subassembly costs with the new generation of diodes and they re relative to the pricing pressure we ve seen we re only seeing 200 basis points in margin degradation related specifically to pricing i think is really quite extraordinary in terms of some of the product features we ve introduced in for the cutting applications i think the qcw feature with the 2x peak power because of the improvement in piercing speed quality of piercing the fact that the cutting can then start closer to the edge of the metal and reduced scrap is going to be a very fundamentally important feature to have with the lasers and on the adjustable mode beam i think there s good work being done with customers i said there s a lot more excitement around the qcw feature which is actually good for us because that s very unique to ipg several other customers offer the variable beam capability but qcw is really unique to ipg thomas diffely and then maybe getting back to the cost reduction side i mean you guys have been very good over the last decades of reducing the costs is this a continuous opportunity for you or at some point do you run out of ways to reduce the costs timothy mammen i mean valentin keeps driving everybody every year to get to cost reductions and if you just looked at say the cost of an individual component you might be reaching a greater limit on being able to reduce that but if you can then take out and get more power out of individual components that is much as anything else can bring your cost for lockdown as you get more power out of components it can also simplify the product architecture reduce the number of splices for example that are required in the manufacturing process reduces the form factor of the lasers that in itself takes cost out so every year we take cost out and think it s going to become more difficult and then we succeed yet again to take a significant amount of cost out thomas diffely and then finally when you talked about the pricing timothy mammen valentin will add a comment around that just please go ahead valentin gapontsev i can say with diodes for example for the last six years we decreased cost of 1 worth of diode decreased more than 10x during six years 10x decrease cost of diode now nobody can compete with that quality it s a fantastic result which 10 years ago the biggest scientists could dream only about it we reached such a number and we ve produced now i would tell you about it s more than 70 megawatt of optical power 70 megawatts added together who produce diodes may be only few megawatts only we ve produced 70 megawatts we re able to compete in quantity will have many years we need to invest to reach such a number but without the diode nobody can practical compete with us but it plays out in the market nobody able and to close us in the margin such number only diodes but other components for that quantity of different kinds of lasers only poses now competition challenge and so on it s only for a cutter or for lasers 1 micron laser for more power up to 2 3 kilowatt quality no question but even quantity never able to reach now our number this price correction was then made artificially of course it s a damage the market very potential price but when you talk about quantity for them laser high power laser 1 kilowatt watts to increase each year we increase up to 20 up to now every year we increased 22 units price the decrease of price you take one time against one year two years and then three years and we then could not grow their price up to you and now they re making artificial with this without losing margin practical but they have to stop but quantity every year we increase quantity 15 20 up to now we did not lost market share well in fact we increased market share thomas diffely great and finally tim when you look at the pricing pressure that you ve seen is that you responding to market pricing or is it you getting aggressive on pricing to regain or retain share timothy mammen market pricing has been very aggressive as valentin has referenced we think that well we can see that it started to stabilize a bit to a degree we have to respond to it but we re still pricing at a premium to the market given our improved quality and performance of the lasers for example with electrical efficiencies the size the general reliability of the product and now with new feature sets we believe some of these features will enable us to add value around the product and enhance that pricing a little bit relative to where the competition is operator our next question comes from the line of patrick ho with stifel patrick ho tim maybe first off just following up on the performance you had in the ultra high powered segment on a year over year basis from i guess from a big picture basis where do you believe wherein in industry transition to these higher powered lasers particularly for the cutting market are we still at the very early stages say like first or second inning or are we kind of halfway through i guess this industry shift timothy mammen we re still at relatively early stage i think it depends on what power level you re talking about in the 6 to 10 kilowatt range the first use of those lasers started a couple of years ago in the 10 to 15 it s only really that transition happened it started to happen over the last year and in 20 kilowatts as you referenced people are only just starting to introduce cutting systems at that kind of power level so as the higher power you get the most recent the transitions are to utilizing higher power scale devices patrick ho great and as my follow up question in terms of the improved outlook that you re starting to see in china the is part of that related to a better inventory situation or therein where they worked off maybe some of the excess laser inventory they have or is it being driven by i guess a turn in demand timothy mammen so we don t think that there s at anytime a huge amount of inventory that sits with the oems in part that s because the way we manage the business right we have short lead times we don t force product on people when they see fluctuations in demand so what we re seeing here there maybe a little bit of an inventory adjustment but it s not i do not believe it s the primary driver the primary driver has been a shift in the demand cycle coming back and we referenced that even in q1 so we started to make a bit of a call on on our first quarter earnings announcement though the bookings forecast for china in q2 would it doesn t just reflect an inventory adjustment that reflects a very definitive pickup in demand and that reflects i think the effect of some of the stimulus and other actions that are being taken locally to get to i think is a softer landing than might otherwise have happened operator our next question comes from the line of david ryzhik from susquehanna david ryzhik so regarding the 6 kilowatt or above high powered lasers in your prepared remarks i guess the numbers which i think that is around flat year over year growth in q1 and china grew double digits in this segment so that would suggest the rest of the world declined year over year i just wanted to get your sense on what are the demand trends for a 6 kilowatt and above ex china and what you saw there in q1 and then i have a follow up timothy mammen yes no absolutely i mean it s clear that relative peak revenue in europe was actually in q1 a year ago and a lot of that was coming off the initial transition towards more than 6 kilowatt power lasers so europe as we ve said compared to that peak continues to be weak but it has stabilized at least right revenue is tracking along over the last three quarters at relatively the same level but it s still significantly off the peak demand that we saw at the beginning of the year that would be the main driver in q1 japan was also a little bit weak but order flow from some of the main oems started to pick up at the end of the quarter and we re going to see an improvement in high power laser demand in japan in q2 and their bookings forecast is also good so that trend should happen into q3 korea was okay with high power lasers but cutting applications not brilliant but they ve got a good forecast as well for the second quarter so ex china particularly the largest market where we service europe that certainly is off from continues to be off from peak demand a year ago david ryzhik okay and just regarding ultrafast you talked about sales of 3x you re working on more than 15 new products i would love to for perhaps you can expand upon your strategy there how you view the market opportunity perhaps what kind of revenue run rate you think you can get to over the next few years i would really appreciate that timothy mammen so it s actually we re working on about 50 5 0 projects with different customers and we believe we ve got a very an excellent device that is compact it has a very fast startup time from a cold it has a very good electrical efficiency we re working on continuing to improve the amount of energy and the average power that we can get out of the device so that we can address more and more applications at a very high level i think that s the main strategy and then really pushing the product out to customers for evaluation in processing of many different types of materials it s certainly a product that s got a lot of very positive feedback from customers without getting back into a specific run rate around ultrafast pulsed laser if you look at the microprocessing and look at ultrafast and uv and some of the visible product offerings the total revenue around that is actually starting to approach a just below a 10 million orderly run rate so getting up towards a 40 million annual run rate and that s really starting to get to be more meaningful therefore so 2 or 3 of revenue we ve said get to 5 and 10 of revenue first and then gain another 500 basis points a share you can quickly see yourself heading towards now 100 million to 150 million of total revenue quite quickly valentin gapontsev and i can tell you with ultrafast lasers we will introduce multi laser all fiber with a reasonable power source first laser all other customers have provided very expensive and not flexible solid state solution it is not fiber solution we provide now a 50 watt home fiber placed in the market with the two years we re qualifying and the customer also the test and so on so oem request for oem customers we ve started to only one month ago one month ago therefore its particular process qualification testing and so on but the returns from the market is excellent own people sell their wire much much better when they use now from other sources and so it s about only start to save so the reo overall the reo it would be we expect next year david ryzhik and tim a quick follow up do you feel like you need to invest in sg a and r d should we expect some pickup in investments related to this opportunity timothy mammen on the r d side i think we re continuing to invest in r d and devoting the resources that we need to get the product to market we haven t seen any decreases in r d through the downturn on sg a we ve added headcount around that area that s starting to execute we of course look for people who are more specialized in this area as we build the business but we tend not to go and chase like 100 people to build that market we look for the best people who are technically competent and have a deep knowledge based around the different users in the market and leverage them to get a return quickly on the sales cycle for that and we re not looking to add 100 salespeople to get into the ultrafast market operator our next question comes from the line of andrew degasperi from berenberg andrew degasperi first on the welding side i know that china s cut their subsidies in april for ev i m just wondering if there s any impact that you see yet on sales from that end timothy mammen we haven t seen anything specific related to change in ev demand we continue to work on different projects some of them are not even just related to china demand they re related to some of the international automotive companies installing battery capacity in china so i think it s too soon to make a call on whether there s removal of the subsidies or cutting them in april what the impact of them will be it s certainly not we would have liked to see the subsidy stay because it s going to be a bit of a negative andrew degasperi got it and then secondly just on the pricing side as a follow up is are you seeing anything in terms of competition moving in the mid power range i mean we ve been hearing that your chinese competitors are trying to improve the reliability of their lasers in the 5 to 6 kilowatt i m just wondering if you re seeing anything on that side timothy mammen nothing material i think of course they re all trying to get there but valentin gapontsev they don t have a good chance for this to improve you have to understand with increase of power you watch problem growing very fast but even all our tests could make personal test competition or for example throw minimum 2x to 3x batteries per year we need for three years minimum making one you have 2 or 3 even lower power 1 kilowatt 2 kilowatt 5 6 and so they re not so how would they improve or nearest time we don t see any opportunity so you know what we have a diode 10x all of them given their breadth or their creator of high powered diodes now going out of this business because it s not competitive i would say not chinese not chinese operator our next question comes from the line of joe wittine from edgewater research joseph wittine with respect to the full year we have started to hear some global integrators willing to quantify a 2019 outlook certainly more than we saw 90 days ago you obviously aren t hearing enough to publicly quantify a range which i get but maybe talk us through any notable forecast you have heard or any regional details you may be hearing and for those that are tightlipped maybe what are they telling you that they re waiting on before giving a more definitive look into the full year and it s specific down market verticals is it geopolitical et cetera timothy mammen so i think yes joe a couple of the oems have come up and given some generic information about what they expect for the year and then one example of those customers not a large but not even our largest customer and although very important and business is much more one dimensional than ours so focused on 2d cutting whereas we ve got a much more diversified set of applications and end markets i think we look at this and in our annual guidance even a less volatile environment is tricky and what we have been saying and continue to see is a nice recovery and even strength in overall bookings with a strong bookings forecast for q2 particularly in china as i referenced and that s being provided by the sales group we expect that to continue aside from that i don t want it gets a bit difficult to give anything specific but if you look at q3 for example consensus i think looks pretty reasonable i think rsus we just don t have visibility into q4 yet we re struggling a little bit look at how changeable the macro environment is one month ago europe looked like a basket case and yet only today the data in europe looks a lot stronger so we re certainly seeing some very positive trends on the business it s just a bit early to get out there and give an annual guidance on it and we hope to see this momentum continue if they achieve the bookings forecast they got for q2 we re going to see a really nice recovery in the business so we re waiting on seeing that happening joseph wittine okay makes sense and then just a follow up on china you kind of presented it as a tale of two worlds ultra high power cw is up but then low power applications are facing some headwinds on the ultra high power cw can you confirm whether that s 6 and up or 10 and up and then on the low power weakness is that competition related or is that more demand related the declines that you re seeing timothy mammen on the ultra high power we certainly see a lot of strength in 10 and up a little bit less on six the low end of the market has in total units has continued to perform okay but it s really sort of more of a pricing impact at lower end of the market that s affecting things so that market hasn t gone it s not 20 down it s more on a pricing issue there the competition is also a lot stronger at that level so we think together with some of these new features particularly the qcw feature on the lasers will be a substantial enhancement a smaller form factors of these lasers also would be a benefit to the end market relative to the chinese competition valentin gapontsev not only it s slower but also it s much more functionality for that much more and much more efficient but much more additional functionality property and so on for which you know this people only claim that they have the 5 or 10 kilowatt laser our quantity but if they compare we their way of we re going to see you in the exhibition we don t see your laser you have done it so on and so on where is this laser we have from customers who use these lasers it s only a why more than marketing tricks it s has not changed the feeling to talk about we have produced 10 kilowatt of laser now of about 1 000 1 000 lasers today how many they produce maybe less than 10 it s only for a while it s only a matter a marketing tricks more clearly when we re in and ask which true laser now sold what they sold it s not 10 kilowatts at all absolutely it wouldn t have this is not 10 we ve got you ve got heating they need water five times more water only to heat to cool them but they don t have any claim even pipes is all for this so it s five pipes maybe you can hold only 2 3 kilowatts but not 10 never 10 operator our next question comes from the line of mark miller with the benchmark company mark miller i don t want to overdue in this but in terms of the ultra high power some people have announced products recently and are you seeing any increased competition or is that still your own playing field timothy mammen well again i don t have a very definitive answer on his view of what their capabilities in that area just now so there is nothing else to add to it we just don t believe that they re any where close to us but yes they announced up but they just don t have competing product that is getting any meaningful traction in the market mark miller and you mentioned ultrafast and green lasers did well last quarter can you estimate what percent of sales are coming from new products last quarter timothy mammen yes in total when we say our products new products are driving about 15 of sales and grew at a double digit rate and that s the whole variety of new products in there including the ultrafast green the visible some of our higher power pulsed systems accessories which includes the beam delivery stuff so that 15 of total revenue valentin gapontsev take in mind only green lasers we have now more than 15 different kinds of lasers with different functionality most of them unique nobody able to reproduce and to provide the same quality the same performance at all it s unique version of lasers and more and more people started to take this and they found it fantastic laser now several folks have started to make these lasers because they thought big opportunities claim about we don t see any competition only some application operator our next question comes from the line of alex chang with citigroup alex chang i have one question regarding to china sales actually we have seen the major customer in china deliver around 26 y o y sales in the first quarter also your major competitors in china also deliver about 20 revenue growth but your revenue from china was 20 decline how can we know understand this i mean how much is from the changing impact how much is from aft or unit sales timothy mammen so alex this is a relatively easy question to answer i ve done my research into it we actually had a very strong quarter in q1 2018 in china with our main oems and if you looked at the main oem revenue most of them went from q1 to q2 with a doubling of revenue so their sales from ipg were in the prior quarter ahead of that growth so we had a really exceptional quarter so relative to that our q1 this year looks weaker but we re starting to see improving demand trends i mean the main oem out there the is our largest customer their reported revenue doubled from q1 to q2 and that was their peak they don t they re buying lasers ahead of that for us so of course there s some impact on it on pricing but we referenced that the unit total unit sales across the board performing quite nicely we re starting to get real traction at 10 kilowatts and more but it s really it s a timing difference that appears to create an anomaly between the way they re performing or not so they had a relatively weak q1 a year ago and they ll show some more solid performance relative to that so we ve got a very different timing difference to deal with alex chang understood my follow up question is about your new product with qcw feature as you mentioned the qcw is mainly for the consumer electronics applications so how much contribution from this new product you do expect for this year and apart from the consumer electronics what other applications would this new product that are in for timothy mammen i just want to be clear the older qcw generation of lasers was an exclusively qcw feature that was targeting the micro cutting and welding applications in consumer electronics the new qcw feature where we get 2x the energy out of a cw laser incorporates and combines that feature with a normal continuous wave laser the additional peak power is what really helps within the cutting applications so reducing piercing time improving the quality of the piercing as well as with the enabling the oem to start cutting nearer to the edge of the metal reducing scrap so it s an entirely different feature that s enabled by ipg s new generation of diodes which can run both in cw and qcw feature or mode rather we can explain that to you a little more detail afterwards if you aren t clear on it valentin gapontsev yes in terms of the new qcw laser it s not the same we had before it s much more powerful an area we ll provide ways to cost improvement and catching it all if you chinese not able to make something similar at all and not only now but year over year but one reason we used our diodes they work with 5x more peak power then able to work diode from any other source not only from chinese made but made by any other customer manufacturing worldwide our diodes provides so many unique properties only with such diodes can make a efficient such kind of fiber laser operator our next question comes from the line of tom hayes with northcoast research thomas hayes i mean i just wanted to follow up you have mentioned several times in your prepared remarks on the weakness in the additive manufacturing space i just wanted to get some thoughts on kind of that market and the outlook for the year timothy mammen it started to improve a little bit but it hasn t got the same traction it had in the end of 17 and into the first two or even the first quarter 2018 so the order is starting to pick up but certainly not at the level it was a year ago yet thomas hayes okay and then just maybe on north america i think you said when you factor genesis out the north american revenue is up about 1 anything strikingly as far as that outlook timothy mammen so some of the other business in north america the advanced applications and the telecommunications are just primarily here it was probably the weakest part of that the interesting there is on advanced applications we had very strong orders in q1 for a couple of the applications there so that revenue will start to pick the communications outlook has a bit more of an improvement coming into q2 but i d say we were actually really pleased with the advanced application order flow in q1 so it s really more of a timing issue there valentin gapontsev so you question about when 10th year development of laser devices for the practical use now they have started to ask so they will now invest some practical applications so volume and set few units start to grow by 10 by 100 for in revenue it would be a bigger loss and we many years started them for this development now so in a way i expect both the year both are for practical for field use operator our next question comes from the line of michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch michael feniger tim just a point of clarity the 380 million of quarterly sales against the midpoint of gross margin does that include genesis or exclude genesis timothy mammen yes including so you re kind of getting back about 350 million with the laser business michael feniger okay tim can you help frame the puts and takes for us in terms of this gross margin trajectory so i believe in the second half of last year you had some significant headwinds there s currency the price reset utilization rates were moving lower like how should we think about moving into the second half where are utilization rates kind of trending now can we see diode savings flow through the p l more so in the second half and maybe talk currency timothy mammen so even with the first generation of the new type of diode you saw some benefit in that last year as i referenced i think it s actually it s amazing that when you look at the model only 200 basis points of the margin degradation really specifically relates to pricing the cost of the bill of materials has come down already very significantly balance in reference there is the next generation of this higher power diode coming onstream that started to be used in the first quarter we started to use it not exclusively so that will continue to benefit the cost of product through the year so that s still got to fully flow through so that should help a little bit with gross margin the key thing outside of that is really to get back to an absorption a better absorption rates on fixed cost because that as i mentioned is 500 basis points of the difference relative to our year ago gross margins so recovering that puts you closer to the midpoint of the 50 to 55 range it would actually put the laser revenue if you exclude the acquisition in the upper half of that range because the acquisition is a bit of a dilutive impact to that so that would be very good right now exchange rates are still a bit of a headwind we referenced that they took 15 million out of revenue for the first quarter the chinese yuan is still at a lower level than it was in q1 and q2 when it kind of peaked at cny6 3 and it s cny6 cny6 5 the last couple of days but it s cny6 7 the euro is weaker than it was a year ago it s at 1 12 this morning so it s up from 1 17 to 1 20 that it was in the first half of last year so fx is still a bit of a headwind we re dealing with michael feniger fair enough and this is this question is not necessarily on q2 but if credit improves the trade tensions ease and the macro just stabilizes do you see some signs of a replacement cycle for laser systems in the second half or 2020 that can kind of provide us support of revenue i know growth has been weak the last three quarters but if we take a step back you ve grown revenue at a 25 cagr over the last decade is there signs that the installed base is aging and we could see some replacement timothy mammen i don t have enough data specifically to give you a definitive answer on that certainly some of the higher power devices are more than a decade old so we re probably seeing some replacement cycle the real increase in high powered volume though started five years ago so there s still a couple of we ve always had a couple of years off from a real ramp potentially in a replacement cycle for that i mean 2014 15 was when we started to see very significant growth in high power lasers so those lasers are not yet at the end of their life cycle certainly some of the stuff in 2010 or 11 i mean our electrical efficiency back then was significantly below what it is now our form factor was a lot bigger the quality of the device even though it was very good it doesn t match what we have today so there s some replacement probably going on that s not a huge amount we would be looking for a continued displacements of non laser applications as the investment cycle picked up right as people look to invest in new equipment they would consider a laser based system now where historically they may have been looking at a non laser based application valentin gapontsev yes before the this so we asked for them for and the plasma cutting and the laser cutting where the cutting was better but still for thick metal now we provide them with a significant metal cutting worth opportunity and cost per meter is now much cheaper than plasma so they start to request plasma also water cutting in many other they replace now only also only start to replace even when we for example now we the way we process for laser cutting of this many metals thick metals and also on titanium and so on it s got an often excellent fantastic new opportunities before instead of e beam but people are going where it s a low but it s real where do you watch the market could be near us 3 5 years revenue versus margin if only ipg developed now a new generation this year we introduced a new generation 10 to 20 kilowatt laser 2x cheaper than before and much more compact easy to use very simple at all for operator now and there before it was given one year ago we don t much more bulky and much more expensive maintenance now we produce very nice quality very compact efficient easy to use where you might where is that immediate where many people don t plasma and other stuff from laser but nobody able to provide the same at all nobody would be able not even chinese nor in all try to make fiber laser and it s high power nobody of them able to make the same timothy mammen michael the other point to take on that is that there is still tens of thousands of co2 lasers that require replacing in the market installed base of co2 laser is still at 60 000 or 70 000 lasers despite the penetration of fiber into the market and as they see the global economy and if it does stabilize or even improve and credit cycles improve that may be a source of demand that would be the benefit over the next 12 to 18 months michael feniger got you tim that s about yes that makes sense and just lastly i mean you mentioned like when someone asked before about consumer electronics it s you mentioned it s usually a biannual cycle so 2018 last year was a very difficult year and you even hinted this year and some of some peers this year is going to be challenged as well so that s kind of 2 years of a down cycle there so how far is your consumer electronics business kind of down from that 2017 level and then if you think of 2020 with some introductions of models a potential recovery in smartphones i m just trying to gauge do you think laser processing in that application could increase kind of cycle over cycle do you see room for that to kind of improve if we do see 2020 that type of recovery that some people expect in that market timothy mammen with consumer electronics you d expect this year because of the biannual product cycle to be stronger we just not we just don t have any visibility into that demand yes in the situation of different smartphones there is more and more laser processing done whether it be some of the welding applications around the frame or different materials being used thus increasing use of ultrafast pulsed lasers not just sort of focused on the metal processing side of things valentin gapontsev uv and so on timothy mammen yes the uv so yes the applications have broadened and that market does see a bit of a rebound with new product introductions we would certainly hope to be at the vanguard of benefiting from that we just don t have any visibility into it meaningful at the moment and so i mentioned the stuff we ve seen as orders coming through valentin gapontsev even imaging lasers now more practical than it was in some application and was recognized worldwide recognized for example for for phone a removal or phone or it s now practical all the best professors and doctors in the world in america europe and now in china we ll open also now say we re seeing qualification for qualification in some countries and after 1 2 years it would be practically with already in place now both in many other who before dominated the market now all replaced with our thulium lasers it s a new revolution now our sale is already by hundred but in the future we ll be by many thousands because this lasers is much more costly than material processing where they bought 1 thulium is the chinese lasers cost so it s still a very big business we expect and we now introduced many other applications also magical ways of new generation of fiber first time a fiber instead of this really old laser they use up to now but they vow not to use for not practical at all and those such now practical found what it s pipe area of the new innovation and the real medical application where it brings most big companies right now making hundreds of millions of dollars in this market operator that is all the time we have for questions i d like to hand the call back to management for closing comments james hillier so thank you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in ipg we look forward to speaking with you over the coming weeks and our next quarter s call have a great day everyone operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s teleconference thank you for your participation you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day
multi billionaire hugo salinas the price of gold is going to trade multiples higher than what is being quoted today multi billionaire hugo salinas price just said that the price of gold is going to trade multiples higher than what is being quoted today world s monetary reserves and the end of an era april 30 king world news multi billionaire hugo salinas price we had been observing the evolution of the total of central bank monetary reserves for several years and noted a peak on august 2 2014 when these reserves reached a maximum of the equivalent of 12 032 trillion dollars according to bloomberg as of april 2019 a review of central bank monetary reserves according to bloomberg yields some interesting information in august 2014 the dollar amount of cb monetary reserves was as we just said 12 032 trillion dollars and as of april 19 2019 cb monetary reserves had fallen by 479 billion dollars to 11 553 trillion dollars the prime cause of the increase in cb monetary reserves has been since 1971 the trade deficit of the usa in 1971 gold ceased to be calculated as the component of monetary reserves since 1971 dollars flow out of the us in payment of imports not covered by sufficient exports to balance the trade account oddly enough though the total dollar amount of us trade deficits from august 2014 to february 2019 amounted to an astonishing 3 603 trillion us dollars according to the us census bureau paid out by the us in payment of imports not covered by income from exports not only did the total of monetary reserves held by central banks not increase by one penny but they actually declined by 479 billion the explosive growth of cb monetary reserves that began in 1971 concluded in 2014 after which not even the weight of a 3 603 trillion us trade deficit caused any increase at all in cb monetary reserves which actually declined by 479 billion dollars as of april 19 2019 bonus interview mag silver co founder says this company may have just found the source of arizona mining s massive 1 3 billion taylor deposit click here or below sponsored i submit that a change of this enormous magnitude cannot possibly be the result of market forces i have to attribute this great change to deliberate decisions on the part of the great exporting powers of the world to stem the growth of their cb monetary reserves in 2014 the great exporting powers of the world must have come to the conclusion that the us as a purchaser was in very serious and permanent trouble that its trade deficits would have to grow year by year and that the exporting countries had to put an end to the increasing growth of their monetary reserves made up principally of dollars earned through exports because increases in their monetary reserves had the effect of increasing money in circulation in other words more cb dollar monetary reserves meant importing monetary inflation from the us the us did pay out the gigantic sum of 3 603 trillion dollars in the period from 2014 to 2019 if these dollars did not show up at least in part as monetary reserves of cbs where are they paper money can travel anywhere but all digital dollars which are bank deposits only live in the us the 3 603 trillion dollars paid out by the us to cover the costs of imports not covered by exports did not physically travel to their owners in foreign countries they are still in the us in the form of dollar balances in favor of foreigners both individuals and corporations so those 3 603 trillion dollars are in the us banking system in accounts belonging to foreigners but not including foreign central banks the decision on the part of the cb s of the exporting countries to put an end to the increase in their monetary reserves made up of irredeemable digits representing mainly us dollars as well as other digits representing less important irredeemable currencies valid for reserve purposes has in effect put an end to the us dominated system established upon the demise of bretton woods in 1971 trade goes on and dollars are paid to cover export deficits but the cbs of the exporting countries of the world are not holding on to dollars any longer the total of monetary reserves has been frozen since 2014 and has declined since then the cbs of the exporting countries as of april 2014 no longer regard the dollar as a desirable investment and this marks the end of an era the cbs of the exporting countries pass on their dollars to subsidiary government entities who purchase gold the existence of the subsidiaries is not reflected on the cb balance sheets in effect the cbs of the exporting countries regard the dollar as an iou of a business that produces an endless amount of ious the creditor countries are looking to cash in these ious while they still retain some value by buying up natural resources in developing countries therefore it would seem likely to see the value of the dollar enter into a secular decline as cbs increasingly dishoard dollars and go for gold as the desirable factor in their reserves the us government thought that by manipulating the price of gold to keep it low and driving it down when it has risen a bit it would dissuade the world from investing in gold it has not realized that it has been dealing not with simple and ignorant private investors but with intelligent individuals who can easily see through the charade mounted by us authorities the low price of gold has been an excellent incentive to investment on the part of the russians the chinese and other orientals important kwn receives so many emails from its global readers and listeners about which high quality mining companies they should invest in and as a result we have added another remarkable company to the list this is one of the greatest gold opportunities in u s history and you can take a look at this remarkable company and listen to the just released fantastic interview with the man who runs it by clicking here or below sponsored there is a constant flow of gold from west to east as china and probably other nations as well want to divest themselves of dollars and obtain gold which is a physical asset independent of any political entity the chinese cb has distributed its claims on dollar balances earned through export trade to various entities who will be doing whatever they can to obtain tangible assets around the world with their dollar balances perhaps the chinese are colonizing central africa and buying up its agricultural land and mineral deposits with us dollars that they earned on their exports to the us quite ironic that the us should advance the interests of china in this way the russian central bank has reduced its holdings of dollars which all consist as we have just said of dollar balances in us banks to a bare minimum and is constantly buying gold to be held in russia by russians in a significant move russia has recently eliminated the value added tax vat on gold purchases by the russian public no more london is the place to keep your gold for russia china is not only doing the same but encouraging its population to own physical gold in my opinion both russia and china are substantially under reporting their gold holdings just as any power under reports its military assets the growth of world cb monetary reserves ceased in 2014 and the trend since then is not growth but contraction the us dollar is losing its standing as a reserve currency cb gold reserves are growing in russia and china and quietly in other countries as well conclusions a the heyday of the dollar is over b the world is moving toward currencies redeemable for stated fixed amounts of gold which will be in the future the determining characteristic of the various breeds of money c human nature being what it is at

posted tuesday april 30 2019 1 00 am if only alabama s leaders had a magical medicaid choose your own adventure book so they could flip ahead and see the different outcomes we could expect by expanding the government insurance program that was originally designed for the poor and disabled would it end in a stronger economy more jobs and a vibrant system of rural hospitals medicaid expansion remains an economic development opportunity without equal said david becker an economics professor at uab in an al com article or would it bankrupt our already cash strapped state budget and further sink our country into unsustainable levels of national debt when you expand medicaid the administrative costs and the cost of expansion will eventually swamp the state warned u s rep gary palmer r hoover during an interview on the matt aunie show on talk 99 5 fm in birmingham it has in other states illinois is about to go bankrupt each side makes a strong case but the truth seems hidden behind a fog of experts statistics and forecasts that confuse more than clarify the economic impact a uab study conducted by becker and paid for by the alabama hospital association found that even when alabama starts paying 10 percent of the expansion s costs the move would create thousands of new jobs and generate 2 7 billion a year in economic activity becker wrote that the expense would be almost entirely offset by new tax revenue and state spending reductions on current medicaid enrollees and other health programs and another study funded by the same association concluded that state savings and other economic gains from expansion could be reinvested in the health care system in alabama including to support expansion and other state priorities but critics say those predictions are extremely unrealistic and point to how widely off the mark such estimates have been elsewhere states that expanded medicaid have signed up more than twice as many able bodied adults than expected and per person costs have exceeded original estimates by a whopping 76 percent according to a 2018 report by the foundation for government accountability this led to cost overruns of 157 percent the report showed with medicaid now accounting for one of every three state budget dollars many expect the same overruns in alabama which would exacerbate our already challenging budget we will have to find 250 million more in the state general fund every year even when revenues decline in recessions said daniel sutter an economics professor and director of the manuel h johnson center for political economy at troy university in an email alabama s perennial budget crisis is due largely to having to pay for medicaid every year medicaid expansion makes this pressure worse hospital closures supporters of medicaid expansion most often mention that 12 alabama hospitals have closed this decade with many being in rural areas possibly leaving residents without critical care nearby expanding the program they contend may have saved those hospitals and could still save many that are at risk those are critical dollars for us as our hospitals currently spend more than 500 million each year in care for which they receive no reimbursement said owen bailey chairman of the board of the alabama hospital association and ceo of usa health in a press release providing insurance through medicaid expansion is vital to maintain access to care for everyone while an influx of medicaid cash would help these hospitals in the short term it s unclear if it solves the underlying problems that created their instability in the first place hospitals are losing money and closing for a variety of reasons according to the new york times shrinking rural populations hospital mergers consolidated services regulatory burdens low reimbursement rates and a decrease in hospital care due to outpatient services and speedier care that requires less hospital time officials at one kansas hospital that closed in 2015 told the times that additional medicaid funds would have been significant but probably would not have helped them survive in the long run meanwhile help could come from elsewhere the federal agency that oversees medicare recently announced that its tweaking the formula used to reimburse hospitals in alabama a move that al com noted could increase payments to rural hospitals a way forward when economists are arguing vastly different forecasts and outcomes it s often helpful to fall back to a few simple yet immutable conservative principles chief among them is the principle of prudence which basically says we shouldn t rush big decisions decisions that have long term consequences and that cannot easily be reversed if at all medicaid expansion is clearly one of those decisions and even without that magical medicaid choose your own adventure book there have already been unexpected plot twists and clear deathtraps for other states who decided to expand the program alabama should wait and watch to see if the promises or the fears are realized we should also patiently observe states taking alternate storylines through medicaid waivers partial medicaid expansion requests and block grant plans otherwise if alabama takes the bait and expands medicaid we might turn the final page only to see that ominous yet sadly predictable word bankrupt j pepper bryars is a senior fellow

ideanomics management will answer questions during the live q a session a replay of the earning call will be available soon after the conclusion of the event ideanomics first quarter 2019 operating results revenue for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 was 26 9 million as compared to 185 9 million for the same period in 2018 a decrease of approximately 158 9 million or approximately 86 the decrease was mainly due to a change to our business focus from logistics management to digital business consulting services our business strategy and the primary goal for entering the crude oil and electronic trading businesses was to learn about the needs of buyers and sellers in these industries that rely heavily on the shipment of goods our activities in the crude oil trading and electronic trading business have been successful in various aspects in 2018 and for strategic reasons we have now phased out of our crude oil trading business and electronics trading business so that we can work towards enabling the application of our fintech ecosystem for other useful cases that we have identified we intend to continue to capitalize on our efforts and learnings from logistic management business so that we can leverage the applications of our technologies and fintech ecosystem across this business and as part of our industry ventures strategy cost of revenues was 0 257 million for the quarter ended march 31 2019 as compared to 185 5 million for the quarter ended march 31 2018 our cost of revenues decreased by 185 2 million from a comparability perspective the cost of revenue during 2018 is not necessarily indicative of the new fintech business in 2019 the cost of revenue during 2018 was primarily associated with the logistics management business oil trading and electronics trading which traditionally has a very high cost of revenue and low gross margin while the cost of revenue during the first 3 months of 2019 is primarily associated with our digital asset management services as part of our new fintech services business the majority of the cost associated with the development of the master plan services have already been incurred in 2018 in 2018 due to the uncertainty associated with the future economic benefits when such costs were incurred the company expensed those costs during 2018 gross profit for the quarter ended march 31 2019 was approximately 26 7 million as compared to a gross profit of 0 393 million during the same period in 2018 representing an increase of 6 689 the gross profit ratio for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 99 while in 2018 it was 0 the increase was mainly due to 1 the company recorded service revenue from digital asset management services in the first quarter of 2019 and 2 due to the low cost of revenue associated with our digital asset management services the gross profit margin of first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the low gross profit margin of the logistics management business the reasons of high gross margin of the digital asset management services are as follows we have invested in our technical development knowledge in digital asset management since early 2018 our uncapitalized assets such as knowhow and expertise in our management team to develop the appropriate strategy and provide the digital asset management service which has delivered a lot of value to our clients there are no significant incremental cost other than immaterial labor expense associated with delivering on these services selling general and administrative expense for the first quarter was 4 2 million as compared to 3 7 million for the same period in 2018 an increase of approximately 0 5 million or 14 the majority of the increase was due to our efforts in building out our management team in the u s and investing in establishing our fintech infrastructure as part of our transformation professional fees for the three months ended march 31 2019 were 1 4 million as compared to 0 7 million for the same period in 2018 an increase of approximately 0 7 million the increase was related to an increase in legal valuation audit and tax as well as fees associated with continuing to build out our technology ecosystem and establishing strategic partnerships and m a activity as part of this technology ecosystem net earnings per share for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 0 19 per share as compared to a loss per share for same period in 2018 of 0 05 per share as of march 31 2019 the company had cash of 2 0 million total assets of 146 2 million total liabilities of 72 3

no phil in truth i don t see that for you you re lacking the one thing that a musician absolutely has to have and that s meter you don t feel when one musical phrase ends and another begins i m sorry but i can t teach you that i don t know anybody who can those were the words heard by wannabe musician phil spector as a child his music teacher uttered them it turns out the legendary music producer had little musical talent of his own he could spot in others what he lacked but no amount of teaching was going to relieve spector of his lack of feel despite his mother s willingness to purchase for him all manner of musical instruction spector s struggles as a musician came to mind as i read legendary investor howard marks s oaktree capital very excellent 2018 book mastering the market cycle getting the odds on your side marks s insights into the investment process are compelling fascinating and most frustrating of all they re relentlessly logical the logic is frustrating mainly because as marks stresses throughout mastering the market cycle future title references will be mmc through the words of another investing legend john templeton to buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are greedily buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest reward what s relentlessly logical in theory is extraordinarily difficult to execute in practice marks s immense wealth reveals him as someone capable of intrepid buying when others are desperate marks has feel in spades and aims with mmc to help investors develop a reasonable understanding of how he thinks so that they can avoid being average or less than average the latter is important in consideration of marks s crucial observation that almost anyone can make money when the market rises and lose money when it falls his goal with the book is to get investors thinking about market cycles as he puts it the study of cycles is really about how to position your portfolio for the possible outcomes that lie ahead optimism perhaps the time to sell and pessimism perhaps the time to greedily buy drive these cycles so marks stresses the importance of developing a sense for where the market is in terms of despondency versus glee as he explains it on page 1 of mmc i can t say an understanding of cycles is everything in investing or the only thing but for me it s certainly right near the top of the list about the importance of cycles few including this reviewer would be in the position to question marks on it it all makes so much sense and that s why this same reviewer will be quoting mmc for many years to come it s that good marks has an intuitive sense of the human psyche and what happens to that psyche during boom and bust periods while the pundit class talks and writes obsessively about the when of recessions and how to avoid them marks thinks very differently he notes that success carries within itself the seeds of failure and failure the seeds of success this essential view will be referenced throughout this review but for now it s important to point out that per marks it s during the booms that we re developing bad habits relaxing our aversion to risk and in a broad sense developing a level of optimism that sets the stage for the correction in marks s own words the shakiest financings are completed in the most buoyant economies and financial markets all of the above matters a great deal in consideration of the desire among politicians pundits and economists to avert recession it s apparent that marks at least implicitly rejects such a strategy indeed as his failure unearthing the seeds of success line indicates rather prominently to fight recessions is to fight recovery as marks alludes it s during recessions that we fix what we re doing wrong more on this in a bit but marks s comment about what leads to hard times needs to be taped on the wall of every pundit politician and economist who strides the earth the recession is the cure for errors committed during periods defined by a lack of fear thinking about the previously discussed quote in terms of market cycles boom times lead to a relaxation of investment standards that are corrected during market corrections marks s genius and indeed that of oaktree is that more often than not he and his firm have revealed a preternatural ability to sell to the greedy during periods of optimism and buy during periods of desperation getting into specifics that would most interest readers marks writes about how he and his partners would look at certain financings leading up to 2008 with a great deal of incredulity though marks doesn t claim that they saw things with total clarity he stresses that you didn t have to fully understand what was wrong with sub prime mortgages or deconstruct mortgage backed securities to know that something was amiss and so oaktree raised its largest fund yet to profit from distressed opportunities that the firm expected to happen upon better yet they acted on the templetonian maxim to buy when others are despondently selling they did so in size fashion marks recalls that oaktree was buying 500 million a week over the fifteen weeks from september 15 through the end of year readers should think about that for a minute it s easy in retrospect to say one should be greedy when others are desperate but plainly very difficult when others are actually desperate there was so much pessimism back then which leads to questions that i found myself wanting to ask marks and while his views on economic matters will soon be discussed for now his comment that very few investors are known for having outperformed through macro forecasting rates discussion as it applies to markets up front it s not surprising what marks says to read macro analysis is to routinely read what s ridiculous and that s defined by endless fallacy at the same time it s not unreasonable to at least suggest that market forecasters must have a similarly bad track record relative to those who presume to divine the macro future in each instance the forecaster is seeking to make sense of what s driven by billions of people making infinite decisions every millisecond furthermore how does one define a market that his populated by amazon and apple on the theoretical high end but also sears and blockbuster on the low end marks regularly makes the point in mmc about trying to be ahead of the cycle but it would be interesting to ask him how he and his partners discern between what s got upside and what s not going to revert to any kind of mean there s something so macro about any discussion of the market along the lines of the above late in mmc marks writes things that perform poorly for a while eventually will become so cheap due to their relative depreciation and the lack of investor interest that they ll be primed to outperform no doubt that s true to a degree but isn t pessimism or a general lack of investor interest a flashing market signal itself one transmitting crucial information to investors blockbuster was mentioned in the previous paragraph and it s instructive mainly because there was no upside in it for investors who purchased its shares in 2010 and it seems investors who bought sears or payless in more recent times were similarly burned that s a long way of saying that while marks describes a successful investor as being unemotional by nature the success of oaktree can t just be about its employees possessing the nerve to buy when others are selling how did they and do they know what to buy better yet how much can being greedy when others are despondent exist as an investment strategy in consideration of its broad acceptance among investor greats as the most important ability for a successful investor for instance a third of the way through mmc marks calls into the question the accepted belief that riskier assets produce higher returns he rejects the conventional wisdom given his view that if riskier assets could be counted on to produce higher returns they by definition wouldn t be riskier but doesn t the previous truth apply just as much to the famous templeton line translated it would be interesting to know how much the profits that come from buying when there s blood in the streets have been eroded by investor knowledge that the time to buy is when there s blood in the streets marks reminds readers throughout mmc to be cautious amid excessive optimism and this time is different commentary but if each emotion is predictive of troubled times ahead wouldn t the trouble be somewhat priced apparently not judging by periodic corrections in markets but it would be interesting to know how marks s investing strategy evolves in consideration of how much smarter the market itself becomes with each stretch of pessimism and optimism moving to economics marks as previously mentioned doesn t think much of macro forecasting with good reason at the same time he devotes several chapters to macro concepts this is where most of the disagreements with the author were found regarding birthrates marks writes that the output of an economy is the product of hours worked and output per hour thus the long term growth of an economy is determined primarily by fundamental factors like birth rates and the rate of gain in productivity the problem there is that this time is truly different and better yet it s always been different that s the case because with each technological advance the productivity of humans soars figure that the discovery of something as prosaic as coal was said to have been the productivity equivalent of a worker gaining over twenty assistants coal s profound impact raises the question of how much more productive we re made modernly by computers wifi access the supercomputers that sit in our pockets what 5g will mean for individual productivity if it at least somewhat lives up to the hype not to mention what rapid automation will mean for growth with automation alone what we call the economy is set to benefit from the addition of millions and presumably billions of hands that don t need vacations don t call in sick and don t quit this is a long way of saying that birthrate declines are the natural product of economic progress as human productivity surges due to technology that more and more enables the world s inhabitants to produce alongside one another it s not unreasonable to suggest today that jeff bezos could start amazon in a retirement community so advanced is the technology that brings the world s workers together importantly the numbers support the contention that birthrates are highest in the poorest countries lowest in the richest countries fast rising south korea has the lowest birthrate of any developed country and also the highest suicide rate yet it prospers marks ultimately seems to come around to the previous truths somewhat several pages after his initial birthrate comment he writes that technological advances are permitting tasks to be accomplished that weren t dreamed of in the past several pages later he makes the most essential point that economies are made up of people exactly and that s why the birthrate scare is well overdone automation doesn t put people out of work as much as it enhances the work of people the more work is divided up the more people specialize continued automation promises soaring specialization on a level that s hard to fathom today but that will power productivity increases that will surely boggle the mind that s why marks s comment that the few million manufacturing jobs estimated to have been lost to china since 2000 certainly made u s economic growth lower than it otherwise would have been was surprising marks has to know that it s not true oaktree began in los angeles and his primary residence is now new york this is relevant mainly because new york 1 and los angeles 4 were two of the top u s manufacturing locales detroit and flint 2 and 3 respectively in the 1920s only for the jobs to vanish that la and new york are no longer manufacturing hubs speaks to why each city is so prosperous and also to why locales that cling to the past flint and detroit are so poor in a relative sense along the lines of the above marks writes of better times for american workers after wwii when they could remain the best paid safe from competition from goods produced more cheaply elsewhere the problem there is that rich or poor workers get up each morning in order to get things that so much of the world was on its back after the tragic war didn t redound to american workers as much as it slowed their specialization and the evolution of their living standards while at the same time limiting the amount of goods they could exchange their work for marks would surely agree that competition lifts the boat of oaktree that a lack of it carries within it the seeds of failure and it seems he underestimates the typical worker in presuming growth and happiness come from a lack of competition if true american workers would studiously avoid the richest american cities where competition is greatest due to the greatest concentrations of talent yet he surely wouldn t quibble with the truth that california and new york take in exponentially more michiganders than does michigan take in transplants from each where there s no competition there s often stagnation the unseen economic shame of wwii is just how much progress was lost for the rest of the world and by extension the american workers who suffered a lack of competition and workers competing to meet their needs after the war on page 69 marks writes that inflation results from economic strength this is an assertion that it would have been great if he d discussed more simply because marks has to know that the view expressed one that s accepted among economists who write forecasts that he feels don t contain information that s likely to add value and lead to investment success is belied by his investment genius that s a long or short way of saying that marks has to know that the true driver of economic growth is the investment that in his own words is permitting tasks to be accomplished that weren t dreamed of in the past investment drives individual productivity which drives growth crucial here is that what s previously been said is all about falling not rising prices as an investor marks knows better than anyone that the phillips curve is bogus that economic growth is all about enhanced production at costs that plummet yet he promotes the party line of economists whom he knows to be not very reliable as a reader i wanted him to address the accepted view about what causes inflation to see if it squares with his experiences as an investor much the same i wanted him to address the accepted view expressed in mmc that the fed can reduce the money supply raising interest rates and selling securities it says here that marks the investor and credit expert knows the latter to only be true in theory but not in practice marks knows better than anyone that no one borrows money as much as they borrow what money can be exchanged for in that case isn t credit abundant in the u s not because of the fed but because the u s is populated by individuals who produce copious amounts of resources and who by extension rate monetary loans that are exchangeable for copious resources what would be really interesting to learn from marks is whether he thinks the fed an instigator of credit abundance or more realistically a follower of economic trends that it can at best confirm the fed projects its presumed influence through banks that shrink daily as sources of credit which raises a question of how influential the fed s rate machinations actually are most of all does marks think the fed can truly shrink money supply or add to it where it s slight considering where he lives it seems unrealistic in a globalized world that the fed could ever truly limit the money that always finds its way to manhattan s talented assuming dollar shortages other money forms would replace the greenback as evidenced by how much global trade the swiss franc liquefies conversely it seems unrealistic that the fed could ever boost the supply of money in neighboring newark if he s planning a future book it would be very interesting to read how marks perceives the fed s true influence on the economy judging by the economy s dynamism it seems the fed s expressed desire to plan the cost of credit vivifies how little it actually plans in short if the fed were truly powerful then the u s economy would be very 2nd rate which leads to what marks describes as the gfc as in the global financial crisis it was surprising that marks described it as financial and that the carefree attitudes in the markets were inflamed by demand for high yielding investments that resulted from the fed s lowering of general interest rates first the fed can it really make borrowing cheap just by lowering an interest rate the question isn t flippant marks once again lives in manhattan and no doubt knows that any attempt by mayor de blasio to decree apartments cheap through rent controls would result in reduced supply of apartments ok so why would the fed s actions be any different how could it achieve credit abundance through artificially low rates and if the answer is that the fed can print the response to that answer is that markets are wise people once again borrow money for what it can be exchanged for and because they do it s hard to countenance the idea that the fed for being the fed could somehow create an easy lending environment through its rate mechanism more realistically investors wouldn t be fooled by easy money any more than world leaders would be fooled by kim jong un decreeing himself 10 tall based on his new definition of the inch the fed angle about 2008 also ignores that housing similarly boomed in the 1970s and did so despite the fed actively jacking up interest rates furthermore marks writes that there is no such thing as a market that is separate from and unaffected by the people who make it up so true but since it s true is it realistic to assume that the fed s actions with an interest rate lever could so profoundly change a market as for the crisis being financial this didn t ring true please read on marks obviously has an intimate sense of what happened since he witnessed it all so very closely he had billions worth of client funds on the line he s writing from his perch in the realest of real worlds while your reviewer is commenting from the sidelines still it s marks himself who as previously mentioned asserts that success carries within itself the seeds of failure and failure the seeds of success by his own accounting in mmc some really questionable loans were made in the lead up to 2008 as in the seeds of failure were being planted that they were calls into question how a correction of those errors could cause a crisis it seems more realistic to say that the crisis was one of intervention by the bush administration and the bernanke fed in what was healthy if bad things were happening how could a correction of what s bad result in a crisis that s why it was surprising to this reviewer that marks would write that one reason oaktree s 2008 focused fund at least somewhat succeeded was thanks to the bailouts marks writes i m convinced that if hank paulson tim geithner and ben bernanke hadn t acted when they did or they had acted different or if their actions hadn t been as successful as they were a financial meltdown and replay of the great depression absolutely could have occurred in that case our actions wouldn t have been cause for celebration the above passage proved the most disappointing in an excellent book full of amazing insights to be clear marks was in the proverbial arena but the statement about paulson geithner and bernanke doesn t read as true in consideration of his crucial reasoning about boom and bust periods the seeds of failure are planted during the booms and because they are it s necessary to allow markets to correct them so that economic growth can resume applied to 08 it seems oaktree would have enjoyed even greater post 08 returns had washington done nothing as for the great depression it was plainly an effect of intervention goodness the u s economy contracted much more in 1920 21 than it did in 1929 30 the difference was that the federal government did less than nothing in response to what was healthy in the early 20s such that the seeds of success planted during the contraction were allowed to grow marks regularly makes a case that this time is different thinking is the stuff of failure so it was so puzzling that he would assert a variation of the latter with his defense of the very interventions that limited the planting of the succeeds of success those seeds an effect of failure that was necessary still the critiques and quibbles are just that marks s book is much more than a triumph and he s someone i ll once again be quoting for a long time writing about investing early on in mmc marks notes that some people just tend to get it whatever it may be and some don t marks plainly gets it as few do investors will understand it much better for reading mastering the market cycle even if they can t ultimately mimic the author s coolheadedness at a time when others are losing theirs
this week argentine trade unions opposed to the government of mauricio macri will try to bring the country to a halt on april 30th they plan to shut down flights the metro in buenos aires banks and schools even hospitals will run reduced sunday services on the following day a holiday unions will lead a rally at the presidential palace joined by politicians from the peronist opposition party this strike is a demonstration of repudiation by our society of a government which has produced hunger misery unemployment and indebtedness declared hugo moyano the boss of the truckers union in a radio interview over the weekend union leaders called for a complete rejection of the government s economic policy the strike will sharpen a confrontation that will last through national elections scheduled for october mr macri is trying desperately to create economic conditions favourable to his re election the economy is not co operating inflation in the year to march was 54 7 gdp shrank last year and is expected to do so again in 2019 about one in three argentinians is now living in poverty these numbers reflect the macri government s tactical mistakes in correcting the populist policies of its predecessors led by cristina fernández de kirchner and her husband néstor kirchner a rise in american interest rates plus a lack of confidence in mr macri s reforms led to a run on argentina s peso last year which led in turn to a record 57bn loan from the imf it has so far failed to steady the economy fear is mounting that failure will bring ms fernández back to power last week the peso lost 8 of its value against the dollar the gap between yields on american treasury bonds and those on argentina s dollar denominated bonds which reflects the market s perception of argentina s creditworthiness widened to more than ten percentage points for the first time since mr macri took office the market s doubt has no foundation mr macri insists we argentines are not going back to ensure the truth of this claim his government has adopted unorthodox economic policies that could test the terms of its deal with the imf on april 17th it announced an anti inflation package which includes controls on the prices of 60 odd staple foods plus delays in planned price increases for public services such as transport so far the new measures have had little effect some items with frozen prices such as milk have disappeared from many supermarket shelves and the government says that supplies of other items including the national drink of mate will not be available until the second week of may till now the imf has tolerated mr macri s unorthodoxy perhaps fearing that policy would become even less orthodox were he to lose the election on april 29th the imf agreed to allow the central bank to intervene earlier and harder to support the peso it can step in even before the currency weakens beyond 51 5 to the dollar the previous trigger point and if the currency nonetheless reaches that limit it can now spend more to push it up 250m a day rather than 150m the falling peso has raised import prices and undermined the public s faith in price stability propping it up therefore should help to pull inflation down but it will also harm the competitiveness of argentina s exporters a bumper harvest this year may have reassured the imf government revenues from a tax on exports of such commodities as soya and biodiesel will be 230bn pesos 5bn this year about 1 of gdp according to a new report by the board of trade in rosario an export hub that is a near doubling in nominal terms from the level of 2018 that revenue increase will help reduce the government s primary deficit ie before interest payments under the agreement with the imf this year the government is supposed to eliminate the primary deficit which was 2 6 of gdp in 2018 including infrastructure investment the extra money will ease pressure on the government as it waits for inflation to come down the strikers and the peronist opposition will seek to keep the pressure on ms fernández is taking full advantage of mr macri s plight although she has been indicted on several charges of corruption she leads the president in the polls her newly published book a memoir cum campaign manifesto called sincerely is a best seller her political comeback is fuelling speculation that mr macri s cambiemos let s change coalition will find someone more popular than he is to be its presidential nominee the likeliest replacement may be maría eugenia vidal the governor of the province of buenos aires which has 40 of the country s population the chaos planned by argentina s trade unions this week may boost her political career as well as that of ms fernández

a session a replay of the earning call will be available soon after the conclusion of the event ideanomics first quarter 2019 operating results revenue for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 was 26 9 million as compared to 185 9 million for the same period in 2018 a decrease of approximately 158 9 million or approximately 86 the decrease was mainly due to a change to our business focus from logistics management to digital business consulting services our business strategy and the primary goal for entering the crude oil and electronic trading businesses was to learn about the needs of buyers and sellers in these industries that rely heavily on the shipment of goods our activities in the crude oil trading and electronic trading business have been successful in various aspects in 2018 and for strategic reasons we have now phased out of our crude oil trading business and electronics trading business so that we can work towards enabling the application of our fintech ecosystem for other useful cases that we have identified we intend to continue to capitalize on our efforts and learnings from logistic management business so that we can leverage the applications of our technologies and fintech ecosystem across this business and as part of our industry ventures strategy cost of revenues was 0 257 million for the quarter ended march 31 2019 as compared to 185 5 million for the quarter ended march 31 2018 our cost of revenues decreased by 185 2 million from a comparability perspective the cost of revenue during 2018 is not necessarily indicative of the new fintech business in 2019 the cost of revenue during 2018 was primarily associated with the logistics management business oil trading and electronics trading which traditionally has a very high cost of revenue and low gross margin while the cost of revenue during the first 3 months of 2019 is primarily associated with our digital asset management services as part of our new fintech services business the majority of the cost associated with the development of the master plan services have already been incurred in 2018 in 2018 due to the uncertainty associated with the future economic benefits when such costs were incurred the company expensed those costs during 2018 gross profit for the quarter ended march 31 2019 was approximately 26 7 million as compared to a gross profit of 0 393 million during the same period in 2018 representing an increase of 6 689 the gross profit ratio for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 99 while in 2018 it was 0 the increase was mainly due to 1 the company recorded service revenue from digital asset management services in the first quarter of 2019 and 2 due to the low cost of revenue associated with our digital asset management services the gross profit margin of first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the low gross profit margin of the logistics management business the reasons of high gross margin of the digital asset management services are as follows we have invested in our technical development knowledge in digital asset management since early 2018 our uncapitalized assets such as knowhow and expertise in our management team to develop the appropriate strategy and provide the digital asset management service which has delivered a lot of value to our clients there are no significant incremental cost other than immaterial labor expense associated with delivering on these services selling general and administrative expense for the first quarter was 4 2 million as compared to 3 7 million for the same period in 2018 an increase of approximately 0 5 million or 14 the majority of the increase was due to our efforts in building out our management team in the u s and investing in establishing our fintech infrastructure as part of our transformation professional fees for the three months ended march 31 2019 were 1 4 million as compared to 0 7 million for the same period in 2018 an increase of approximately 0 7 million the increase was related to an increase in legal valuation audit and tax as well as fees associated with continuing to build out our technology ecosystem and establishing strategic partnerships and m a activity as part of this technology ecosystem net earnings per share for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 0 19 per share as compared to a loss per share for same

technologically advanced polycrystalline diamond cutters and diamond bearings apergy s revenue outside of north america increased 25 year over year primarily driven by strong artificial lift activity in the middle east and international diamond bearings shipments our cash from operating activities more than doubled to 20 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 8 million in the year ago period

the year well as we look into the second quarter of 2019 we expect modest sequential growth in revenue and adjusted ebitda driven by growth in our artificial lift and digital products partially offset by lower adjusted segment ebitda and margin percent in drilling technologies due to the seasonally lower rig count in canada which is expected to recover in the third quarter from an industry

everyone has the opportunity to participate in the q a session the ir team will be available after the call for any follow up questions it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to cn s president and chief executive officer jj ruest jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer well thank you paul and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our earnings conference call after a very very cold bitter winter we delivered good results and have a positive outlook to report in the first quarter we produced adjusted eps growth of 17 revenue growth of cad350 million and the adjusted operating ratio was 67 2 our volume and cost was impacted by extreme and prolonged cold weather down to minus 35 minus 40 degrees celsius which impacted train costs and restricted revenue ton mile volume growth of 3 our capex and winter operating plan which include our air railcars produce good results at temperature as low as minus 25 degrees celsius which we call the tier 1 train restriction but when temperature dropped to tier 3 and tier 4 which is at minus 35 celsius minus 40 fahrenheit for about seven weeks we were losing significant train capacity and in some instance we could not operate during part of the tier 4 nights in order to protect customer service and to manage regulatory risk as we know them we had decided to operate this winter with some additional resource in term of locomotive railcars and train crews given the extreme weather condition that we experienced that was the right decision as we do after every winter we are now taking the opportunity to right size our asset base including the return of leased locomotive and putting railcars into storage in addition we also take into account the current softness of crude by rail following government imposed crude production cutback now a quick review of the topline for the first quarter we have a best ever first quarter of over cad3 5 billion of revenue or cad350 million of topline growth during q1 cn s carload were up 1 5 the best class i performer intermodal revenue was up 4 automotive revenue was up 7 coal revenue grew by 15 canadian grain revenue was up 8 cn canadian grain export tonnage is now up 1 9 million metric ton ahead of the last year to date crop our cn railroaders are really getting the job done for the grain industry us grain revenue was also up 14 in the quarter on crude we move on average 250 000 barrel per day back in december but demand took a nosedive in february to less than 100 000 barrel per day after a reduction in production was imposed by the province of alberta but cn has the capacity to move more crude it is a national priority to get our natural resource to market so as to protect the country economy gdp and create jobs our cn railroads are ensuring that we have the infrastructure to move any and all natural resource to world markets looking to the balance of the year we have a diverse pipeline of growth opportunities ahead of us for example short term during q2 this dial up of the coalspur vista project a coal mine a coal export mine in alberta is to start up soon we also have the start up of the altagas propane export terminal in rupert and the introduction of the new container service by zim line in rupert we also have immediate capacity to move more crude in april we are running at 145 000 barrel per day but we do have the capacity to quickly ramp up to 300 000 barrel per day mid term we have some other coal business alberta chemical business and automotive business coming our way at the upcoming june investor day we will give you an update on our growth opportunities for the next three years in the meantime we are reaffirming our guidance for the year with that i will turn it over to my team for them to give you an update on the winter operations and the financial detail over to you mike mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you thank you very much jj and first as always and especially after the challenging weather conditions they tackled day in and day out i want to sincerely thank all the railroaders of cn for their efforts from my perspective the operating challenges that they face were nothing short of some of the toughest that i ve seen over my career but their overall efforts allowed us to fight through and continue to provide service to our supply chain so with the tough weather conditions gtms were up 3 versus volumes in q1 2018 and looking specifically at q1 operating highlights our network train speed was down 8 versus q4 but essentially flat versus q1 of 2018 our car velocity was down 15 versus q4 but up 8 versus q1 2018 and our through to all was up 15 versus q4 but down 12 versus q1 2018 the extreme weather started to really affect our operation initially in our winnipeg to toronto corridor when i say inclement i m referring to consecutive nights at minus 40 to minus 50 degrees celsius which as you know at 40 degrees below zero celsius it s the same as fahrenheit this type of weather then started to set hold in our winnipeg to wisconsin corridor and by the last week of january our western canadian franchise began to feel the same effects right through to the beginning of march under tier 1 restriction at around 25 degrees celsius or minus 13 degrees fahrenheit our operating performance was much like in q4 as evidenced by our velocity train speed and productivity under those harsh conditions the capacity improvements we made in our network and in our equipment such as increasing our fleet of ac locomotives and air cars really paid off when temperatures dropped below minus 30 to minus 35 and even colder minus 40 we deployed more air cars and deep locomotives per train however we could not keep up with the demand as the freezing temperatures did not subside and the customer demand remained strong as well when temperatures dropped to minus 40 and colder we ceased operations some nights until the temperatures warmed in the morning something closer to minus 25 to minus 30 so to give you an example of the effect of the most severe weather at minus 25 we effectively ran our trains at our normal run rate with one air car and our dp configuration with the air sources between 4 000 to 5 000 feet apart at minus 35 and colder our train length was almost cut in half this results in the need for an additional air source in order to maintain train length as the between length was reduced down to as low as 1 500 to 2 000 feet even with this inclement weather our overall service to our customers was less impactful than the year before while inaudible at times overall we were able to work with our partners to ensure fluidity was maintained and our grain movement has been has seen record volume year to date with the addition of center beams and boxcar fleet we we re able to stay relatively current with our forest product customers through the worst periods of cold as well our alberta petrochemical customers stayed fluid and now this was purely a result of our overall investment strategy specifically more resiliency in key areas in western canada sourcing of cruise mainline capacity and the investment in equipment i spoke to before to effectively shut down over some of the nights in very dense volume corridors as we did and recover each day as quick as we did could only have come through come about through these investments by mid march the recovery started and right now all of our supply chains are very current our operating metrics for q2 have come back into line and our volume is at a record pace with good weather we re seeing the payoff of our track capacity projects and we re very very active in right sizing our asset base as we re looking to drive velocity productivity through the short term reduction of cars locomotive and people with record volumes in april and normalized weather we see a significant opportunity to gear up for the demand for the year ahead and improve our overall productivity as jj spoke to our growth opportunities we re commencing another round of capacity improvements in all our engineering team will be delivering another big program in 2019 22 projects are planned including segments of double track new sidings and siding extensions and yard investments two projects were already have already been completed and put in service in q1 and for 2019 to be specific we re looking at nine projects between winnipeg and edmonton five projects between edmonton and vancouver four projects between toronto which you would know as jasper and prince rupert two projects between winnipeg and chicago one project south of chicago a project east of winnipeg the rest of the remaining 140 locomotives will come on line and we re building new air cars and also installing equipment inspection portals what s also going to help us is a further rollout of our scheduled locomotive maintenance program where we start to already experienced more availability and reliability of our locomotive fleet as these projects are completed we ll continue to move on more of our customers business at low incremental cost finally we struggled with our safety performance in the last quarter specifically in the latter part of january as temperatures started to decrease dramatically however while our fra actions and injury ratios decreased in the quarter our significant injuries and accidents were well within our five year average we continue to focus on the value we place on safety is being instrumental to our success as we move forward in our journey of being the best in class transportation provider with that over to you houle ghislain houle executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mike starting on page 9 of the presentation i will summarize the key financial highlights of our first quarter performance as jj previously pointed out revenues for the quarter were up 11 versus last year at over cad3 5 billion fuel lag on a year over year basis represented a tailwind of cad27 million or cad0 03 of eps driven by a favorable lag this quarter of cad17 million versus an unfavorable lag of cad10 million for the same period last year operating income came in close to cad1 1 billion up cad50 million or 5 versus last year our operating ratio came in at 69 5 or 170 basis point higher than last year during the quarter we booked a charge of cad84 million in depreciation and amortization related to the replacement of our positive train control ptc back office system excluding this item our operating income was cad1 164 billion with an adjusted operating ratio of 67 2 60 basis point lower than last year net income stood at cad786 million or cad45 million higher than last year with reported diluted earnings per share of a cad1 08 versus a cad1 00 in 2018 up by 8 excluding the expense related to the replacement of the ptc back office system our adjusted diluted eps was up a solid 17 versus last year the impact of foreign currency was favorable by cad30 million on net income or cad0 04 of eps in the quarter turning to expenses on page 10 our operating expenses were up 14 versus last year at cad2 464 billion expressed on a constant currency basis this represented an 11 increase at this point i will refer to the variances in constant currency labor and fringe benefit expenses were cad798 million 10 higher than last year this was mostly the result of higher wages driven by increased headcount and higher stock based compensation expense i would also highlight that the sequential increase in headcount is mainly attributable to the on boarding of slightly over 1 300 transx employees in march purchased services and material expenses were cad558 million 14 higher than last year this was mostly the result of higher outsourced services and repair and maintenance expenses including higher snow clearing costs mostly due to the difficult winter conditions fuel expense came in at cad398 million or 4 lower than last year lower fuel prices accounted for cad30 million of the reduction while higher volumes were a cad9 million unfavorable variance versus 2018 fuel productivity was unfavorable by 1 6 or cad6 million in the quarter versus last year depreciation stood at cad440 million 33 higher than last year this increase was mostly driven by a charge of cad84 million for the replacement of our ptc back office system and net asset additions equipment rents were 3 lower than last year casualty and other costs were cad156 million which was 8 higher than last year mostly due to higher incident costs which was driven by a crude oil train derailment partly offset by lower legal provisions now moving to cash on page 11 free cash flow was cad286 million excluding net cash from the acquisition of transx this is cad36 million lower than in 2018 and mostly the result of higher capital expenditures driven by the upfront deliveries of new locomotives partly offset by higher net cash from operating activities finally let me turn to our 2019 financial outlook on page 12 although there are signs of slower growth in certain markets and volatility in crude by rail we continue to see a broadly positive economic backdrop in north america and consumer spending remains healthy we have seen specific opportunities that will drive further growth such as the new coal mine from coalspur and the new propane terminal in prince rupert that will start shipping in the second quarter this environment should continue to translate into high single digit volume growth in terms of rtms for the full year versus 2018 in a favorable pricing environment as jj mentioned we are taking the opportunity to right size our resource base and we remain confident in achieving our eps guidance of low double digit growth versus 2018 adjusted double digit eps of cad5 50 on the capital front as winter subsides we are focused on delivering on our large capacity track expansion programs we have received so far 63 new locomotives that helped us during the winter and we expect another 52 to be delivered before the end of q2 furthermore we continue to reward our shareholders with consistent dividend returns and we are on track with our current share buyback program of cad1 7 billion having repurchased 2 4 million shares for an amount of around cad280 million since the end of january in closing we remain committed to our agenda of operational and service excellence with our supply chain focus as we continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value for today and for the long term on this note back to you jj jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer well thank you ghislain we are positioned to deliver solid results going forward we re investing for the long term for growth for efficiencies and resiliency when there is harsh railroading condition we are actively working to feed our network with growth example our transx efforts on canadian ports efforts on export of natural resource we have a proven ability to address short term costs for short term demand fluctuation for the crews locomotive or cars and we are committed to protect our core natural resource customers like the prairie grain the alberta oil b c and quebec lumber and canadian and us coal exporter our approach to operating ratio and return on invested capital which stood at 15 7 in 2018 is also balanced and long term focused on this note olivier operator i would like to turn it over to question which both james cairns and keith reardon will also join us questions and answers operator thank you we will now take questions from the telephone lines operator instructions the first question is from chris wetherbee of citigroup please go ahead chris wetherbee citi investment research analyst hey thanks thanks for taking the question i guess i wanted to talk a little bit about the network and the or potential of the business and compare this year maybe to last year so last year this time you re coming out of some challenges you had some congestion in the fall leading into a very challenging winter i guess another challenging winter again this year you ve added a significant amount of capital can you give us a sense of sort of what the or potential of the business can be as you get out of the weather start to get some of that volume and is it as recoverable or is it more recoverable today than it was i guess a year ago jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer okay so chris it s jj thanks for the question just give you a few element of colors without getting into guidance for quarterly operating ratio last year this year the winter has been actually been tougher than last year because of the deep cold for about seven weeks and also last year when we ended the first quarter we had backlog of business you would remember that there was quite a few customers especially in the world of natural resource who were waiting for us to get caught up this year we actually because the resource that we had we actually did better we actually were able to grow versus last year and we did not finish the first quarter with a backlog of grain or potash or lumber we are fluid and we are coming at least at the cn side this is how we ended the winter so therefore right now the focus is on putting down resource stocking locomotive cars and crews fill demand pickup in line the capacity that we have and one of the factors that we re awaiting to see where things will go is crude by rail so crude by rail this month ran at 145 000 barrel which is better than what it was in march but we do have capacity to ramp it up within a few weeks only to 300 000 barrel so i think that will also be an element as to how good operating ratio would be in the second quarter it would be on how much we can use the resource that we actually now have available for our natural resource customer chris wetherbee citi investment research analyst okay i ll leave it at one thanks jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from steve hansen of raymond james please go ahead steve hansen raymond james analyst yeah good afternoon guys look on the growth opportunity side i m sure you ll hear a bunch more about it at the upcoming investor day but i was hoping that you could perhaps give us a little bit of a color here on how the transx acquisition is going thus far and as a sort of a secondary part of that question is just how do you view the internal opportunities for capital versus the external opportunities for capital and how you re weighing those going forward thanks jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer keith will do the transx part keith reardon senior vice president consumer product supply chain growth so on the transx piece we have been integrating for the since the close we see a lot of opportunities on the commercial side we see a lot of opportunities on the synergies with regard to cost takeout on both sides but we also one of the main reasons and we ve talked about this is the talent and the entrepreneurialship that transx brings we ve already had several examples where we needed to find a solution to something and within hours of talking to them and sitting down we were able to come up with those solutions so we re very very pleased with how it s going we ve actually seen some growth come back to the railroad through transx as mike and his team are improving the service that s also going to happen in the traditional domestic part of our business as well as bringing it back to transx so we re very pleased ghislain houle executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah maybe quickly steve just lay on the capital side i think i mean we re just following our plan i mean we told the market this year our plan was for cad3 9 billion so we are following this we re receiving locomotives we ll receive 140 as i said in my remarks we received 63 in the first quarter will receive another 52 in the second quarter mike talked a little bit about the capacity projects that are out there so we re well geared i think we ve learnt a little bit of how to deploy and how to execute on this capacity investments this year from last year so i think we re very optimistic and we re just following our plan of what we told everybody jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer and we continue to look for inorganic growth opportunity as well as they may come up steve hansen raymond james analyst very good thanks jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from ravi shanker of morgan stanley please go ahead ravi shanker morgan stanley co analyst thank you good evening everyone so pretty impressive that you were able to maintain your high single digit rtm guidance despite a tough 1q can you help isolate maybe one or two drivers of kind of what drives the ramp to get there in the back half i m certain you guys aren t counting on significant rail volumes until that actually shows up so what exactly driving that and maybe on a related note can you give us an update on the port of halifax and kind of how that process going and are you guys counting on additional volumes since some of the new projects to be able to hit that guidance thanks jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer this is jj ravi thanks for the question so definitely as usual it will be a combination of a number of factors we always want to be working every aspect of our portfolio so crude by rail is an opportunity that we expect at this point will produce growth in the second half we also expect that our focus on that model whether it s domestic overseas will also produce some volume growth for the second quarter automotive even though the north american market is all soft should be a growth area for cn because the oem that works with us still has some product on the ground that is left over from the slow north american network on the tpx fleet frac sand will see what kind of drilling activities we have on the potash product you may have noticed that even though they ve announced some shutdown of sawmill in dc the price of lumber went up which means that there s still good demand out there so there s a number of factor and also what s happening here in the second quarter so this coalspur will start up they re actually shipping i think next week inaudible the train we hope that at least at the beginning they ll be able to run hit the 3 million ton a year run rate and that s from the zero what it was and then also the first few cars of propane to the altagas export terminal in rupert also were started to flow in so there s been a bit of slow delay versus an expectation on these propane exports as well as the vista project but now they re finally gearing up in the case of the second half hopefully they should be in good position i think that s more or less more or less of kind of what we expect on the port of halifax so the port of halifax looked like it will be changing into a new owner a company we can t share exactly who that is but it s a company that we know very well and assuming it s those folks that eventually take over the terminal they are excellent world class operator and more to come on that but we are actually optimistic on how we over the next few years and hopefully if the transaction will proceed how we can work with these people to make much better use of our east coast port to serve the central part of the continent so more to come on that ravi shanker morgan stanley co analyst so just to confirm that you are so confident in the opportunity there with the whoever is winning this bid jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer yes so the it doesn t necessarily mean that we have to be a financial partners i mean there s different scenarios but what s important here is they have now selected who they want to sell the terminal to we know these people we re actually going to be having discussion with them and at this point i would leave it at that as to what our financial role will be but one thing for sure is we see opportunity to grow the rail business out of halifax into the hinterland which is really the point of what we call feeding the beast using rupert port of these ravi shanker morgan stanley co analyst very good thank you jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from cherilyn radbourne of td securities please go ahead cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst thanks very much good afternoon i thought i d use my one to ask jj about the recent management restructuring you undertook which was then followed up with some pretty broad changes to the management team particularly in the operating department i m just wondering if you could elaborate a bit in your thinking there jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer okay thank you cherilyn and if you go on the deck that we have for this call the last page in the appendix page 22 is where we highlight the most important fact of this management change that took place in the last two months so some involved in our operating department we did promote we have very solid scheduled railroading operator people have been doing this all their life even though they may be only in their 40s and 50s namely james thompson is now heading the west derek taylor heading the south we ve asked doug ryhorchuk to become the godfather if you wish of the operation by leading the network center and we ve also asked doug macdonald doug macdonald has a very strong career on the commercial side and i ve asked doug to myself and the board have asked doug to lead the east and learn operation by the same time doug has always been very close to the operating team so we are really giving a chance to those who are the next generation of scheduled railroaders to take these very senior job by doing that then also we were giving the chance to promote some people on the commercial side people who are very good topline hunters with strong track record like james cairns allen foster and our friend buck rogers and we ve also beefed up the department of technology so we re increasing the number of people who are either coming from outside to help us redefine the possible in the rail industry and we re giving the chance to our people who been worked very hard producing very solid results the last 15 20 years to be given opportunities of raising new level or an area which are new to them for them to kind of finish their overall learning as to how to become some of the best of the best cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst thank you for the time jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you we do have a strong bench and we re developing it operator thank you the next question is from turan quettawala of scotiabank please go ahead turan quettawala scotia capital analyst yes hi good afternoon and thank you for taking my question i guess i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about capex this year obviously another big year with regard to capex going into the summer and with the winter being so tough just maybe talk a little bit about the level of preparedness here with regard to the capex program going into the summer mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer hey turan it s mike turning to the preparedness and first i d just like to go back if you look at the results we produced in december and through the first couple of weeks of january that was a direct result of the capacity especially through western canada and especially the yards in edmonton and winnipeg and so we are as ghislain mentioned earlier we ve learned how to better than logisticate i would say between our materials procurement and materials delivery in fact our engineering department has become one of our big customers for transportation and whether straight communication with the developed tools so that we can refine the process get more done with less and with that capacity we ve added it allows us to get a better unit cost you remember in if you go back to 16 and 17 when volumes were lighter we had the capacity we produced a lot more in terms of what we got done in the hours we had it was very difficult the last year and a half doing not just the special capital but the basic capital under such stress of traffic while we re able now we ve already got some good results from the first month or so it s a big gang that we have out there on all three regions we re starting to get unit costs back in line so we are prepared we learned from last year we ve developed better communication better tools but really we re going to stretch that dollar as far as we can turan quettawala scotia capital analyst great thank you very much thanks mike mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer okay turan jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from allison landry of credit suisse please go ahead allison landry credit suisse securities analyst thanks so i just wanted to gauge our confidence in hitting the high single digit rtm growth this year and whether it has changed at all given the combination of the slow start to the year and softer crude volume and if it hasn t changed if you could maybe speak to whether the q2 rtm growth will accelerate from what you re seeing now or if you think the full year hinges more on a step up to maybe 9 or 10 growth in the back half of the year thank you jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you allison maybe i can start so i mean we would rather had an easier winter with just the kind of demand that we had back in december and early january when the railroad was running really well there was some business out there but it is what it is so we re starting with a bit of a slow start but yes at 3 revenue ton mile growth i think we re one of the leaders in the industry from a volume growth i think we are the leader in the industry in volume growth and at this point we re very current but we re also very fluid and we will have some assets that we re parking which is our good assets and good qualified people that we can easily bring back into as things pick up so it will partly be what s happening to natural resource what s happening with consumer product what s happening with intermodal and i think we re only in the fourth quarter fourth month of a 12 month season and there s still lot of time left to go in their clock just like last year the same situation so i think we are we re looking at the future at this point in very good position and if we have little help from the demand side we will do it i know if you want to add something james on what you see in the natural resource or in the manufacturing side james cairns senior vice president rail centric supply chain yeah i think certainly jj we re coming off a kind of a tough first quarter weather wise in february but even if you draw back the crude by rail you look at how we came out of december we handled 250 000 barrels a day of crude by rail clearly line of sight leaving december to move about 300 000 barrels a day the only thing that stopped us was government curtailment and if you look at some of the positive things going on moving forward here in the province of alberta whether it s crude by rail and what might happen with curtailment in the future or some of these new plants coming on board we really are very optimistic about how we are going to finish up this year jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you next question is from benoit poirier of desjardins capital please go ahead benoit poirier desjardins capital analyst yeah thank you very much could you please comment about the what you see in terms of pricing environment i know that you don t disclose any precise number but if you could comment overall in light of the current market environment thank you james cairns senior vice president rail centric supply chain yeah we continue to see opportunities ahead of railway cost inflation our customers have come to expect that from us we need to be able to price ahead of railway cost inflation so we can invest back in our networks so we can invest in hiring people buying locomotive invest in rail infrastructure so we can handle our customers goods to market in a very expeditious manner our goal is to be there to grow in lockstep with our customers and pricing is a key component of that benoit poirier desjardins capital analyst that s my one thank you very much thank you jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you benoit operator thank you the next question is from ken hoexter of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ken hoexter bofa merrill lynch analyst great thank you good afternoon jj pretty solid job and i ve been in western canada from one of those minus 42 degrees so i hear you there mike but just some thoughts on the projects maybe dig into this a little bit are we talking about capacity expansion on the network or is it equipment i guess i want to understand are you at full network capacity so you could see squeezing if volumes start popping up in certain areas and maybe talk about how you target those projects after the 22 last year how do you figure where you re going to need that growth target mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer okay ken essentially ken it s in the same i would say almost the same locations as last year we still when you look at our at our i always call it the breadbasket between and i ll go as far as jasper alberta to chicago or just take edmonton to winnipeg for that matter that 800 miles we started a couple of years ago we had 15 of it only double track now first tranche we did brought us up to maybe 25 we don t have the luxury of having 800 miles of straight double track like others do so a lot of the infrastructure is going to go in that corridor at the same time we know we have growth to the west coast especially the vancouver and especially with coalspur starting up so from west of edmonton toward vancouver we see pinch points that will take place as the volumes grow grain will continue to be strong keeps intermodal as very strong going to both rupert and vancouver around going to rupert we have more capacity in there and then we still have that area that from winnipeg to chicago that accrued i get more and more commodities that are going in that direction but really it s not a lot different than last year the locomotive it s a big year for us this year as mentioned 140 of another 80 to come we spoke about that last year and really other than that we re talking technology and that s where the rest of our capital is going but really similar to last year same areas we re still we still got work to do in that winnipeg to edmonton corridor ken hoexter bofa merrill lynch analyst great appreciate the thoughts thanks mike mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer okay jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you ken operator thank you the next question is from jason seidl of cowen and company please go ahead adam kramer cowen securities analyst yeah hi guys this is adam on for jason i want to follow up on the transx acquisition and potential future m a and just ask if there are other types of non traditional rail or non rail companies that you guys could potentially look at what types of companies and how could you see these types of companies maybe fitting into your network or fitting into your business or in a broader sense jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer hi adam it s jj so it s basically businesses that would bring about more carloads on our network so you look at our rail line our mainline rail line and you look at businesses who would contribute to increase the amount of carload of container on that rail line so it s something that would feed the beast so in the case of transx it s a national ph company they move containers they also move also freight over the road we re looking for them to help us grow the container business at a high pace and also looking for them to help us convert more customers from the road through to the railroad we talked about the port business the example earlier of halifax it s the same thing when we use a port very very well like in rupert i think it s a proven recipe that it does create a lot of volume in the railroad when port and railroad work together in a very connected way so these are two example of things which are good long term for rail franchise adam kramer cowen securities analyst got it thank you guys for the time jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from fadi chamoun of bmo please go ahead fadi chamoun bmo capital markets analyst yes good afternoon and thanks for taking my question so you are i wanted to ask you when you look at your network is this at this point resourced fully for the ramp up in volume that you re expecting in the second half of the year and really i m trying to understand that you know you re guiding for strong volume i guess as we go into the second half but the operating leverage implied in the guidance is a little bit more muted how should we think about that it kind of h2 outlook jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer yeah so maybe i ll start it and anybody else who wants to complete my answer but in the western network our network in the last few years have been under stress on the capacity resiliency point of view especially when we hit harsh condition and we want to invest for the long term just not for the quarter or the year we want to be sure that we can handle growth when growth come in the west we want to be sure that we can run efficiently so we can produce good kpi from a schedule railroading point of view we also want to network that when tough times come in that we can show resiliency to our customers and that for the country into a hard time and then with 3 revenue ton mile growth in the first quarter which most of it was in the west would proven that we were there for the national resource customers so in the east we ve got lots of capacity on the network which is underutilized that s why we re interested as to what we can do in domestic capital in the east when i say the east i mean chicago to halifax and also what we could do with any of the eastern port so looking forward we just need to be mindful of keeping a balance between capacity as in railcars and locomotives and crews and demand which is fluctuating and right now the biggest aspect of fluctuation was crude which went up 250 000 barrels we were basically ready to do 300 000 at the time we went down to over 9 000 barrels per day and now slowly coming back it went from 90 to 125 ph and we hope that we can help alberta remove the curtailment of production and getting back up to what it was expected to be a few months back fadi chamoun bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you operator thank you jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks afternoon guys so can you give us maybe just some revenue and operating reshare numbers to think about for transx and then just bigger picture with the guidance so if rtms end up mid single digits instead of high single are we still confident we can do double digit earnings growth i know we did in the first quarter or do you think given the amount that we re spending here that we sort of need the volume growth to come in where we want it to be to get to double digit earnings growth for the year ghislain houle executive vice president and chief financial officer yes scott this is ghislain obviously we re not going to start splitting the or of transx versus the or of cn i mean we re not offering segmented information and the financial data of now and results of the transx it will be embedded into cn and that s what it is i think on the guidance side i think we re comfortable very comfortable and we looked and as we do every quarter we look we do a detailed bottom up top down with the team and we did reaffirm the guidance today and as jj mentioned there s it was a tough quarter and frankly it was a tough february and march because january was pretty solid actually and i think we have another nine months to go and stay tuned but we re comfortable with our high single digit volume growth and our double digit our low double digit eps growth and that s our guidance and we re comfortable with it jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer yes we re going to work the lever of the cost lever of volume and lever of price as we always do we adapt scott group wolfe research analyst i understood you don t want to give a or on transx that s fine can you at least give us a revenue sense because so we know how to model the other revenue line going forward ghislain houle executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean this was before we bought transx if you go onto their website it was 400 give or take revenue company so that s what it was and i know now keith is working he is working with mike jones who was their coo there closely and those revenue was going to be embedded into the intermodal revenue numbers on our financial statement so and stay tuned but i think keith as you mentioned you are pretty optimistic about some of the opportunities and some of the learnings that on both sides that we will get from transx keith reardon senior vice president consumer product supply chain growth yes we are i mean we were going to work as a team to help them be able to drive more revenue more profitable revenue at transx and they in turn are teaching us to be a little bit more entrepreneurial and be able to get things done a little bit quicker a little bit more nimble scott group wolfe research analyst all right thank you guys jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from justin long of stephens please go ahead david vernon bernstein research analyst thanks and good afternoon so maybe to follow up on transx as well just curious if you have any thoughts around the revenue growth for that business going forward even if it s kind of longer term over the next three to five years and then for the model also wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts around headcount i guess excluding the transx adds and then the tax rate as well any of your assumption or range on that front has changed at all thanks jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer maybe i can start with your last one because that s what we ll remember that s what i remember because there were three questions in one but on the tax side again if you look in the quarter the effective tax rate came in about 24 and some of this is due to some of the higher excess tax benefit that is resulting from the settlement of equity settled awards in this quarter but when you look at the tax if you remember justin we at the beginning of the year gave a guidance of 26 to 27 and as we look forward we think we re going to be more in the range of 26 going forward on our tax rate this year so that s on the tax side keith you want to touch upon the revenue for transx keith reardon senior vice president consumer product supply chain growth well we re going to be looking at all opportunities they have quite a large book of business already a lot of customers that we don t have in our book of business and then we have some customers that we deal with that they don t so there is a lot of opportunity to help each other out there as well as they are in the cold supply chain and they do a very good job there and as you know we ve been working on investment in the coal supply chain whether it s exports overseas or domestically so we will be working together with them and our other wholesalers in the business to be aggressive and grow that business there is a lot of opportunity in the coal supply chain as food safety becomes more of an emphasis in north america we want to be right there because it is a differentiator for us in the marketplace ghislain houle executive vice president and chief financial officer and then justin i think the last piece on headcount i think as jj mentioned we are right sizing our resources and the volatility of crude right now is such that we are reducing somewhat our headcount on a short term basis we re hopeful that the crude as james mentioned will come back and then we ll get these people back but the catch up on headcount and on hiring has been done we re normalizing and we re now right sizing our resources in light of the business that s coming at us and so again if you look at headcount at the end of the year first quarter versus the fourth quarter of last year if you exclude transx then we were flat essentially justin long stephens inc analyst okay great all very helpful thanks for the time jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from walter spracklin of rbc capital markets please go ahead walter spracklin rbc capital markets analyst thanks very much good afternoon everyone so jj just on some of your growth aspects coal is coming on pretty fast here and as you pointed out in alberta but i know that the terminal in prince rupert there ridley is having some trouble having gone through a couple unexpected shutdowns or pretty significant i think there s certainly more to come does that interrupt your opportunity in coal is there other avenues for that coal to find its way into the market and how sustainable is that fix if there is one there jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer yeah thank you for the question walter there is other avenue for that coal to get to market if rupert ridley can t get it done we re not getting into confidential information of how these different contracts work between a terminal operator and its customers if they can t perform some of that indefinitely go a little more south to the other coal terminal and still go to market so i think from that point of view we as a railroad have the capacity and the corridor and the crews in the two different corridor to get the new mines to be able to serviced and shipped to ship overseas and just talking about the vancouver i know you wrote a piece back in the days on the cta it was almost head hooping walter you d asked me a question of that we want to be sure that people understand that we disagree to this this is run by the cta regarding vancouver we will be appealing the decision in our view we did a great job of moving 10 volume growth during the month that they were talking about we moved 1 9 million more metric ton of grain this year versus last year this is solid performance and as i said we will appeal the decision however looking at long term vancouver is a very busy place there s not that much industrial land left in the city and as you could from our page 17 in the appendix we have significant capital plan to serve both the south shore and the north shore vancouver for the next three years and we want to be part of the solution and we will be part of solution for the export terminal in vancouver walter spracklin rbc capital markets analyst okay i guess thanks for the two questions thank you jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from of david vernon of bernstein please go ahead david vernon bernstein research analyst hey guys thanks for the question i would like to know if you can tell us kind of what impact weather had on the cost lines obviously the constant currency variance on labor and purchased services i m surely weather had a big impact on that but is there any way you can dimension how the first quarter sort of margins if the margins were negatively impacted by weather mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah david definitely the weather had an impact on cost definitely had an impact on revenue as well it had an impact on volumes i mean if you have to shorten your trains or in some cases can t even move because it s minus 40 and it s not safe to move then obviously there is impact on revenue and there is impact on cost you ll have more recrews you ll have more deadheads your trains are shorter therefore you need more locomotives you need more cars and then there s snow clearance i mean if you look at my remarks i said there were more expenses related to snow clearing related to repairs and maintenance and the likes we re not going to give a specific estimate of the winter per se because at the end of the day it is what it is and obviously when it s very cold and you consume more fuel and therefore from a fuel standpoint it s more expensive so but i mean you can have the bits and pieces of our costs that are higher due to winter and i ll let you do the but these are the big pieces david vernon bernstein research analyst and then maybe just as a quick follow up if we think for the full year ex ptc depreciation add back depreciation is up about 10 is that a good run rate for the full year mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah all right david vernon bernstein research analyst thank you mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from seldon clarke of deutsche bank please go ahead seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst hey thanks for the question just getting back to the margins for a second with everything going on across the industry in regards to psr so if you like the floor for or has been lowered at all from the high 50 level high 50s level you guys have previously talked about and if so do you think cn can return to sort of being the industry leader there ghislain houle executive vice president and chief financial officer well where s the floor it all depends how much risk you want to take the business so one can have a lower floor and then take the risk of not being able to meet demand or not being able to respond the pressure when demand and harsh conditions come in so we have a blend and we want to be a cost leader but a cost leader that also takes things in balance from how we serve our customers and move the economy but also be a leader that s also looking at the return on invested capital as much as eps growth as much as operating ratio so now the one trick pony of operating ratio only does not necessarily give you the best eps growth and when we have investment that can generate a good return on investment capital taking to our cost of capital we are inclined to do these things as opposed to sit on the sideline and shave off one more point of or so this is where we saw it evolving from what we were doing the last 15 years and we re looking at cost efficiencies organic growth some acquisition strong focus on returning invested capital but also strong focus on operating ratio so what you ll see what you re seeing from cn is a more balanced scorecard than strictly pure psr seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst so that s still at the high 50s level is it the right way to think about it longer term jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer we don t guide on the we re not going to get drawn in into the psr discussion and how low can you go on the limbo contest we ll leave that for others david scott vernon sanford c bernstein co llc analyst i appreciate it jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from brian ossenbeck of j p morgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst hey guys good afternoon jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer good afternoon brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst jj just want to go back to the vancouver investments you called out in the slide deck would you characterize these more improving fluidity and resiliency or are you actually expecting to get some capacity expansion and growth off of that and to the point that you mentioned on the cta when do you expect a resolution of that appeal and is this a signal that you might expect a more aggressive and more involved regulator as a result of what just happened early this year jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer as it relates to the appeal these things takes time and they ll take whatever time it takes it does not really that s not a concern for us what s concern for us is that the process is fair and reasonable to all including the railroad regarding the capital investment we re making in vancouver and also i want to recognize that we re doing this transaction with others and we have in one case it s about cad80 million it s between cn the port of vancouver and the federal government and it is to serve the expansion on the south shore center or dp world is expanding the content of terminal so when they re ready sometime in 2020 we will be ready with them as well and the gct who owns that is also planning some expansion so these things are really in sync with other people and investment on the south shore and same thing on the north shore on the north shore it s even more capital money it s about cad200 million over three years again here with the funding from the port of vancouver cn and the federal government of the 200 or roughly cad85 million and that s really is to serve the export of natural resources in the bulk so you re talking more coal going to the north shore vancouver the g3 grain terminal and a number of other items so the investment on the north shore and the south shore eventually are part of the cn long term or mid term growth plan and we re investing in transaction with others but again as i said earlier we move 1 9 more million ton of grain this year this crop year than last year and we re not getting a whole lot of noise from the grain industry about performance on last winter even though we had some super cold condition and back in november and december which was a period when cn was criticized we didn t move 10 more volume than the prior year so from our point of view these are very reasonable performance and this whole investigation was maybe on call from our own point of view brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst thanks jj jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from brandon oglenski of barclays please go ahead brandon oglenski barclays capital analyst hey good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question jj or maybe mike you guys have historically spent more than maybe some of your north american peers but you ve also gotten more growth out of it so i mean i know there has been a lot of questions on capital this call but and i don t want to steal a thunder from your investor day either but can you just talk through where you still see the pinch points in the network and if the outlook for 2020 was to be high single digit rtm growth would we have to be spending at a similar level or is it really some upfront tech investments that have made the past couple years so much higher and that should come down looking forward mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer it s mike here brandon let s just go back to i think ken asked the question and i didn t mention it if you look at the corridor that we re the capacity into western canada handles 50 of our volume if you stretch that out through wisconsin through the route to chicago you re not talking 65 to 70 and those are big growth lanes for us so we re in cad0 01 we re picking up volume but we re catching up to just different capacity we need to be efficient and reliable there is a technology jump over the last few years at ptc we ve spent a good amount and that s starting to come down and then the other technology that we re really looking for effective capacity with that so whether it s the train inspection portals some of the things we re doing from equipping our crews with handheld devices whether they re car mechanics or conductors and then autonomous track inspection those are things that to really take advantage of the capacity the hard capacity we re building in the ground i see that s catching up this year with this next round again it s all dependent on future volume growth but we ve really hit hard the area that s the toughest and jj said whether it s the winter conditions across the prairie i would just remind you that we re still only at 35 double track capacity there and that s not resilient as we need it to be jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer and maybe brandon to go to your question on capex for 2020 as we said previously i mean the big capacity big capex program we said was for two years 2018 2019 we are now in our second year of our capex to catch up 2020 we said we were going to go back hit the range of historical levels but obviously we will look at the growth that comes at us and again i want to remind everybody that our use of cash policy has never changed the first use of cash is toward the business and that s what we ve done and when you look at our roic that has delivered in space in the range of 15 to 16 so we re continuing to do what we said we re going to do and next year we ve said that we will go back to historical levels but obviously we ll look at the growth that comes at us and we ll assess as that growth and as we have a better visibility to go back to growth brandon oglenski barclays capital analyst thanks mike cory executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you brandon jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from tom wadewitz of ubs please go ahead tom wadewitz ubs analyst good afternoon i know you touched on this topic quite a bit so maybe i am just not understanding what s implied within the comments but you clearly identified the capacity on crude and you ve reiterated the high single digit rtm guidance for the year are you assuming in that rtm guidance that you see the ramp up toward that 300 000 barrels a day capacity in crude or are you assuming that you stay at the current level and you can get there other ways or how do we think about linking those two together jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer james you want to talk about the maybe how some of the middle ground we have on crude james cairns senior vice president rail centric supply chain yeah so if you kind of think about how we re thinking about crude is we built the capacity for our customers we are very hopeful and they re going to be using it from the second half of the year we have some solid contracts that kick in starting in july but that s not built in that the core guidance that we have if you look at our core run rate i think that s kind of the bottom end of what we re going to achieve i think when we talk about having capacity of 300 000 barrels a day that kind of gets us to that next level i would say and quite frankly if you would step back and you just look at the supply demand for crude whether it comes in july of this year or january of next year it will be there tom wadewitz ubs analyst right okay so but you get to the high single digits without a ramp in crude james cairns senior vice president rail centric supply chain that s correct tom tom wadewitz ubs analyst okay thanks for the clarification thanks for the time jean jacques ruest president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you we have no further questions registered at this time i would now like to turn the meeting back over to jean jacques ruest jean jacques ruest president and chief executive

president donald trump slammed the federal reserve on tuesday for incessantly raising interest rates and said cutting rates by a full point would make the economy surge in a twitter outburst on the first day of a two day central bank meeting to decide the course of monetary policy trump said we have the potential to go up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point he said china is boosting its economy by keeping rates low but our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low the fed has not raised the key rate this year and in fact signaled clearly that it will hold off on any further moves while it evaluates the us economy and is widely expected to stand firm in its decision wednesday the central bank has tightened policy nine times since december 2015 moving from zero in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to the current range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent trump has repeatedly ignored norms designed to protect the fed s independence from political influence which could undermine its credibility although other white house officials have been more cautious yes we are doing very well at 3 2 first quarter gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records at the same time make our national debt start to look small trump tweeted trump and his economic team have promised that tax cuts and deregulation will accelerate economic growth to three or even four percent but economists say that is unlikely especially as the us trade war with china and others has dampened business confidence and investment

included 326 7 million of short term deposits that exited the bank on january 2 2019 resulting in beginning year 2019 deposits of 3 8 billion on an adjusted basis excluding these short term deposits we had deposit growth of 328 5 million or 34 8 annualized compared to 3 8 billion on january 2 2019 loan growth of 56 4 million or 7 0 annualized compared to a balance of 3 2 billion on december 31 2018 cost of deposits was 0 31 compared to 0 27 for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 0 26 for the first quarter of 2018 net interest margin was 3 65 compared to 3 57 for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 3

president and chief executive officer of amalgamated bank commented i am quite pleased with our first quarter results as they clearly demonstrate the attractive position that amalgamated bank holds as we work to service the needs of values based institutions and further our reputation as america s socially responsible bank signs of our continued success can be seen in our deposit franchise which experienced 34 8 adjusted annualized organic growth in the first quarter this included an 89 0 million increase in political deposits as well as vibrant deposit growth across our customer categories of unions and their funds non profits and philanthropies importantly our cost of funds remained relatively stable at 31 basis points and contributed to our strong profitability as our net interest margin increased to 3 65 in the first quarter of 2019 from 3 43 in the first quarter of 2018 lastly while our loan growth was modestly below our expectations our acquisition of new resource bank nrb allowed us to continue to make very good progress expanding our loan origination capabilities into sustainable industries we have seen a recovery in the purchased commercial and industrial c i credit market and decided to sell a significant amount of that portfolio and have commitments to reduce that portfolio by approximately 127 million in the second quarter of 2019 results of operations quarter ended march 31 2019 net income for the first quarter of 2019 was 10 8 million or 0 33 per diluted share compared to 16 0 million or 0 49 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net income of 7 7 million or 0 27 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 the 3 2 million increase in net income for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an 8 0 million increase in net interest income partially offset by a 2 7 million increase in non interest expense a 1 3 million increase in our provision for loan losses and a 1 2 million increase in our provision for income taxes core earnings non gaap for the first quarter of 2019 were 10 7 million or 0 33 per diluted share compared to 9 7 million or 0 30 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 7 9 million or 0 28 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 core earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 excluded 1 6 million of expense related to the nrb acquisition a deferred tax asset realization of approximately 7 6 million and other adjustments including the tax effect of such adjustments net interest income was 40 8 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 40 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 32 8 million for the first quarter of 2018 the year over year increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average net loans of 375 3 million an increase in the yield on average loans of 29 basis points an increase in average securities of 275 6 million and an increase in the yield on average securities and fhlb stock of 54 basis points these increases were partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing deposits of 441 8 million an increase in the rate paid on interest bearing deposits of seven basis points and an increase in the rate paid on fhlb borrowings of 101 basis points net interest margin was 3 65 for the first quarter of 2019 an increase of eight basis points from 3 57 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 22 basis points from 3 43 in the first quarter of 2018 the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2018 was also impacted by a one time adjustment to write off 0 8 million of accrued interest receivable from the fourth quarter of 2017 without this adjustment our net interest margin increased by one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2018 provisions for loan losses totaled an expense of 2 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 0 9 million for the first quarter of 2018 the provision expense in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses on two leveraged loans and increasing historical loss factors related to the charge off activity this increase in provision was partially offset by a release of an off balance sheet provision of 0 6 million which is reported through non interest expense non interest income was 7 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 7 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 7 0 million in the first quarter of 2018 the 0 4 million or 5 7 increase in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the like period in 2018 was primarily due to higher gains on the sale of investment securities of 0 3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a loss of 0 1 million in the first quarter of 2018 and modest increases in trust department fees service charges on deposit accounts and other income these increases were partially offset by higher losses on other real estate owned resulting from the liquidation of residential real estate acquired as the result of foreclosure on delinquent residential mortgages non interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 was 31 4 million a decrease of 3 6 million from 35 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 2 7 million from 28 8 million in the first quarter of 2018 the increase compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to a 2 1 million increase in compensation and employee benefits a 0 4 million increase in data processing a 0 4 million expense from the addition of amortization of the core deposit intangible from the nrb acquisition partially offset by a 0 2 million reduction in other expenses driven primarily by the release of 0 6 million in off balance sheet provision in the first quarter of 2019 we had a provision for income tax expense of 3 7 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to a credit of 4 1 million for fourth quarter of 2018 and provision of 2 5 million for the first quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 25 7 compared to 24 7 for the first quarter of 2018 financial condition total assets were 4 9 billion at march 31 2019 compared to 4 7 billion at december 31 2018 the increase of 229 0 million was driven primarily by a 72 7 million increase in investment securities a 51 3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents a 56 4 million increase in loans receivable net and the addition of a 53 3 million right of use asset as the result of adopting asc 842 leases in the first quarter of 2019 total loans at march 31 2019 were 3 3 billion an increase of 56 4 million or 7 0 annualized compared to december 31 2018 and an increase of 385 1 million or 13 4 as compared to 2 9 billion as of march 31 2018 loan growth in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by a 93 3 million increase in residential first liens and property assessed clean energy pace loans and offset by a strategic reduction in indirect c i loans of 29 3 million and a 12 2 million reduction in commercial real estate loans deposits at march 31 2019 were 4 1 billion an increase of 1 8 million or 0 2 annualized as compared to 4 1 billion as of december

million or 1 15 of period end total assets at march 31 2019 a decrease of 2 7 million compared with 59 3 million or 1 27 of period end total assets at december 31 2018 the decrease in nonperforming assets at march 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily driven by an 8 4 million charge off related to one c i loan partially offset by an increase of 7 2 million in loans 90 days past due and accruing related to delays in renewing loans from one borrower the allowance for loan losses decreased 5 8 million to 31 4 million at march 31 2019 from 37 2 million at december 31 2018 primarily due to the charge off of one c i loan that had a specific reserve of 8 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by increases on the allowance for classified and criticized c i loans at march 31 2019 we had 48 1 million of impaired loans for which a specific allowance of 1 5 million was made compared to 58 3 million of impaired loans at december 31 2018 for

will now turn the call over to our president sorry to our chairman and ceo jack hellmann john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer thank you matt and welcome to g w s earnings call for the first quarter of 2019 as always we ll start our call this morning with safety on slide number 3 you ll see that the winter was difficult from a safety perspective as our safety index was 1 2 injuries per 200 000 man hours in the first quarter while better than the class i and short line averages our safety results are short of our industry leading standards and we are focused on significant improvements for the remainder of 2019 turning to slide number 4 and highlights from the first quarter 2019 we reported diluted eps of 0 68 in q1 2019 compared with 1 19 last year our adjusted diluted eps were 0 78 which was an 11 increase over the first quarter of 2018 our first quarter results were impacted by severe winter weather and flooding in north america that impeded shipments from connecting class i railroads and resulted in a 0 09 or 10 reduction in eps compared with our guidance the shortfall was concentrated primarily in our midwest and canada regions while the remainder of north america was modestly ahead of plan we expect to recover a portion of the winter affected traffic in the coming months and our outlook for north american rail shipments remains positive in 2019 meanwhile the combined first quarter financial results in australia and the uk europe were consistent with our expectations australia was slightly weaker than expected due to lower export coal and drought affected agricultural products while our uk europe region was slightly better than expected due to stronger performance in our uk intermodal business now turning to slide number 5 in the first quarter of 2019 we implemented cost reduction initiatives in each of our three geographic segments in north america we consolidated our central region into our midwest and southern regions and we also completed the consolidation of certain dispatch functions we recorded a 600 000 restructuring charge in the first quarter and are expecting annualized savings of approximately 5 million in australia we also engaged an operational restructuring associated with the termination of grain services on the eyre peninsula of south australia and made a redundancy provision of 1 5 million in q1 this narrow gauge business has been marginal for several years and with its conclusion our australian grain shipments should decline by roughly 18 000 carloads per year and revenue should decline roughly 5 million meanwhile our australian free cash flow should be unchanged as the margin on the grain business was more than offset by track maintenance capex finally in the uk europe we continued our restructuring initiatives and recorded a 5 5 million charge in q1 as you will see what tj discusses the detail of our uk performance the benefits of the restructuring are becoming increasingly visible as our adjusted same railroad operating income increased 5 8 million over q1 2018 excluding currency now turning to slide number 6 in the first quarter we had new business developments in north america that are worth highlighting first we announced the long term lease of two short lines in indiana that connect with existing g w railroads in the midwest with the transaction we ve created a 400 mile contiguous footprint that spans from eastern indiana to western illinois with connections to six class i railroads the transaction adds 5 000 annual carloads of which we interchanged 3 000 today and opens up a number of new business development opportunities particularly in the agricultural products sector second we recently announced the location of a new 172 million plastics distribution facility on our georgia central railway a packager of plastic pellets is developing a bulk to container transloading center in savannah that will be taking advantage of excess container capacity and increasing vessel calls to the port of savannah we expect initial shipments of approximately 5 000 annual carloads when business commences in late 2019 and see significant growth thereafter in partnership with two connecting class i carriers finally we also landed three other business development projects in the first quarter projects include a new contract to operate the port of caddo bossier on the red river near shreveport louisiana we opened a new transload facility on the san joaquin valley railroad in california serving clay customers and we also added a new third party transload facility on the chicago fort wayne and eastern railroad to handle roofing granules so overall the industrial pipeline that we outlined in february is bearing fruit and our commercial development outlook is positive now let s turn to slide number 7 and our outlook for 2019 the bottom line is that our guidance for 2019 adjusted diluted eps is unchanged we expect to recover over half of the income shortfall in north america from the winter weather as well as to benefit from our cost initiatives in the new business pipeline in australia we expect a slightly weaker outlook due to lower coal shipments stemming from tension in the china australia diplomatic relationship partially offset by higher expected shipments of metallic ores in south australia finally our outlook for the uk is unchanged as we continue to execute on multiple business improvement measures now i d like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer tj gallagher to discuss the details of the first quarter tj timothy j gallagher chief financial officer thanks jack and good morning everyone starting with slide 8 our adjusted diluted eps were 0 06 below our guidance with variance entirely due to the north american winter and flooding which had a 0 09 impact in the quarter but was partially offset by strong results from our other north american regions not impacted by the weather our international operations were net flat and slight variances from australia and uk europe offset now let s go to the details of the quarter starting with north america on slide 9 same railroad traffic for the first quarter decreased 1 2 year over year primarily due to the impact of the winter weather and flooding on certain commodity groups focusing on the big changes first agricultural products were up around 1 800 carloads or 3 primarily due to higher soybean meal exports to asia and higher ddgs partially offset by lower grain coal volumes decreased 7 900 carloads or 13 primarily due to the class i service issues that jack mentioned lumber forest products declined 3 100 carloads or 9 from a combination of weather customer plant outages and weaker export markets our metals traffic increased roughly 3 200 carloads or 9 with higher shipments of scrap and finished steel finally petroleum products increased approximately 2 300 carloads or 9 primarily due to higher lpg volumes now before i move on to the north american pricing i ll mention that we have included a comparison of our u s carloads to u s class i traffic on slide 20 excluding intermodal traffic our u s carload change was 2 2 percentage points higher than the class i primarily due to relative performance in agricultural products coal metals and minerals and stone now let s turn to slide 10 our north american same railroad average revenues per carload increased 5 1 in the first quarter or around 4 excluding higher fuel surcharges adjusting for a favorable commodity mix which in this case reflected a decrease in certain lower rated coal traffic our coal price increase was approximately 3 now turning to slide 11 north american same railroad revenues increased 12 3 million or 3 8 with broad growth across many commodity groups in addition to petroleum products metals minerals and stone as well as pulp and paper which all had carload growth chemicals and plastics revenues increased for the favorable customer mix and higher average revenues per carload now moving to slide 12 in north american operating income north american same railroad adjusted operating income decreased 3 2 million or 4 4 and our adjusted operating ratio worsened by 190 basis points incremental margins on the higher revenues were offset by higher expenses from the impact of winter weather and flooding higher derailment expense and higher deferred comp expense please note that the increase in deferred comp expense is offset by lower line by gains on deferred comp related assets and is therefore eps neutral now turning to slide 13 in australia australia revenues were down 9 7 million or 13 primarily due to weaker australian dollar excluding fx revenues were down 4 largely from lower agricultural products traffic resulting from drought in south australia and new south wales and our coal revenues were roughly flat now slide 14 excluding currency australia adjusted operating income was down 0 4 million with the impact of the drought partially offset by lower coal or by coal and lower expenses now let s turn to uk european operations on slide 15 uk europe same railroad revenues increased 1 1 million or 0 7 excluding the currency impact however same railroad revenues increased 12 1 million or 8 1 primarily due to higher revenues across most of our uk franchise including intermodal road bulk commodities and terminals with only infrastructure services being weaker the new network rail five year control period started in the middle of the second quarter and we expect the full impact will be felt in the second half of the year for infrastructure services now on slide 16 excluding currency uk europe same railroad adjusted operating income increased 5 8 million due to stronger uk rail and road performance as well as 1 5 million in cost savings from restructuring initiatives now let s turn to slide 17 and second quarter guidance let me refer you to our earlier safe harbor statement that noted that these statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations these statements represent management s expectations regarding future results as of today april 30 2019 and we do not undertake any obligation to update this information we expect second quarter revenues in the range of 570 million to 590 million and operating income in the range of 110 million to 120 million diluted eps are expected in the range of 1 to 1 10 with 57 3 million shares outstanding same railroad growth in north america is expected to be 1 to 2 excluding the impact of a decrease in class i empty car traffic resulting from more fluid eastern class i operations same railroad growth in australia and uk europe is each expected to be around 3 note that this guidance does not reflect an australian employee bargaining agreement negotiation settlement that we expect to result in a one time 3 million expense in q2 let s finish up with the balance sheet on slide 19 we ended the quarter with net debt to capitalization of 39 net adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda of 2 8 times and over 510 million of revolver capacity and now i ll turn the call over to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of allison landry from credit suisse please go ahead allison landry credit suisse analyst thanks good morning john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer good morning allison landry credit suisse analyst in terms of the north american volume growth so first in terms of the delayed coal shipments is that included in the 1 to 2 guidance that you gave and or should we expect that to roll in q2 and q3 and then for the full year i think your previous expectation was for around 2 growth so i just wanted to see how you re thinking about that now just given the tough start to the year timothy j gallagher chief financial officer sure the coal the recover in coal is included in our in q2 but the timing of the inventory replenishment in recovery is really difficult to say if it s going to come in q2 q3 or q4 inventories are at critical levels in a number of the plants we serve and michael can give you some more color on that but it s going to flow as inventories replenished which is difficult to judge the timing with respect to full year expectations it was around 2 was our guidance in february with the down we were down about 20 000 carloads versus our guidance we will recover some of that but we re going to have a slow start in q2 given april where we had lingering effects from the flooding so we expect to be up around 1 for the full year that s really for the net change really q2 and then we ll go from there allison landry credit suisse analyst okay and then john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer michael do you want to comment on the inventories and the cycling of the train sets out of the west and how that plays out michael o miller president north america yes jack real quickly i can just kind of give you the back of the envelope based upon our coal franchise the plants we serve are averaging about 20 to 25 below the target inventory levels so we know there s going to be a replenishment there but as tj noted the cycling of the coal sets have been somewhat slow coming out just the lingering effects of the flooding and then we had snow this past weekend in upper midwest so it just kind of slowed the recovery down but we certainly see the replenishment coming it s just a matter of when it gets here and then what the winter what the summer weather looks like to drive additional demand for the products allison landry credit suisse analyst okay that s really helpful and then in terms of the 400 mile contiguous rail footprints that you mentioned how does that compare to other contiguous lines that you ve formed in the past in terms of the sort of length and then are there other opportunities for short line leases or acquisitions where you could create something of this size and anything you re seeing from like a class i spin opportunity from up or ns as they roll out psr thank you john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure i ll start with that one i mean we ve got several we re constantly looking at these kinds of things there just happened to be one that happened in this quarter and so the opportunity is to either bolt on or make contiguous line acquisitions is something we spend a great deal of time on so this is just illustrative of that we ve got if you look on a map if you look in the southeast united states and parts of georgia for example we ve got 400 plus mile contiguous rail systems that we ve built out over time in our northeast the northeast united states the same as seven contiguous acquisitions and there we re starting with the original g w and then consecutive acquisition thereafter so it s kind of the it s the basic playbook for what we seek to do because of synergies of putting small assets together getting the density on the rail lines increasing asset utilization and in this case it will open up some it will open up some routes for connecting class i carriers based on this acquisition all makes it look pretty good michael you have anything else you would add michael o miller president north america yes i think the only thing i would add jack is there is a value here by creating these what we consider clusters of railroads where we can actually do more blocking for class i so i do think there is some benefits operating benefits for the class i as we look and feel more density we could do more blocking and take some of the the first mile last mile work that doesn t necessarily fit psr model could fit better into this model as we the cluster railroads pulled together allison landry credit suisse analyst okay excellent and just anything else that you re seeing as potential opportunities emerging from u p or ns on this front john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer yes we comment on things like that when they happen but our focus is on our bread and butter short there s plenty of short lines that are out there that are independent of the class is so our attention as always broadly focused allison landry credit suisse analyst okay thank you john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of bascome majors from susquehanna please go ahead bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst thanks good morning you own your australian business in partnership with the global infrastructure investor you ve taken capital from private equity to fund acquisitions before and i m sure you bid against both pe and infrastructure funds on deals dozens of times in the past how does an infrastructure fund in your experience approach the short line business differently than a strategic acquirer or even differently than traditional private equity fund and is there anything that you think public equity investors don t get about how these longer term capital allocators value your business thanks john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure how do they approach things differently typically the focus the differential between infrastructure and private equity relates to cost of capital which in infrastructure fund typically and have a lower cost of capital the private equity fund that is because they re focused on assets that they deemed to have to be in effect less risky with less downside to them and therefore they can it s having that lower return on the equity because there is a cap on the downside that s viewed favorably and a pure and simple look at valuations of free cash flow so it s not conversations about book earnings wouldn t happen there it s a focus on free cash flow pure and simple i think that covers tj do you want to say something timothy j gallagher chief financial officer yes i mean i think the other thing is infrastructure funds tend to have a longer investment horizon given the nature of their funding could be longer term or permanent and so their investment horizons could be much larger than private equity bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst are you still seeing them active in deals in the space as you have over the last few years timothy j gallagher chief financial officer yes so again there has been significant inflows to those funds we as you said i mean we had numerous relationships over the years and in 2006 we sold our one western australia business two an infrastructure fund in 2016 we sold 45 49 of australia to macquarie and over the years we bid in partnership with infrastructure funds for major acquisitions so we have plenty of experience there i mean the asset class sort of probably came into existence in 2005 2006 or something like that and it s been both a source of potential partnership as well as a source of competition when you re bidding on assets of a certain size we typically have an appetite for larger assets so smaller tuck in acquisitions probably doesn t have the scale and the risk profile to be interesting to most of such funds and bigger bigger assets will that s where we ll find that competition in that cost of capital competing bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst thank you john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of jason seidl from cowen please go ahead jason seidl your line is open check your mute button jason seidl cowen company analyst hey guys sorry about that along those lines your australian business now versus when you sold the western assets do you think it on a multiple basis how you would look at it if you are acquirer is it more valuable less valuable or about the same john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer the business today versus what we sold in the west in terms of the valuation of the business jason seidl cowen company analyst yes john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer i would say that s an interesting question that requires me i ll launch back deep into my memory our business today is more valuable than what we had in western australia for a couple of reasons one is that there was a very high long term capex need associated with that business that we sold we sold it i think for about 12 times ebitda because the iron ore markets were starting to boom the track infrastructure that handle tonnages going from 2 million tonnes to 10 million tonnes were such that the earnings trajectory would look good but the free cash flow generation would have been limited by those track capital needs over time secondly the other reason that business would have been less value would be in relating to the grain it was wherever there s no irrigation in western australia so you re either getting the cold front of the indian ocean or you re not and so that means there s a lot of variability in that harvest you don t have the diversification of the irrigation like we have in north america there so it s either on or it s off and so by definition that type of a business has more volatility to it that has more risk to it and therefore can its capital structure requires less debt implicitly therefore it wouldn t be worth as much if you contrast that with the business that we have today it s a much more stable business contractually protected for a huge proportion of it and then the free cash flow attributes of it are very very high for two reasons one is the fact that the north south line 50 of that is brand new because it was just built and then in new south wales there is no track capex need there s long term contracts and there s only equipment investment needs and therefore its free cash flow attributes are extremely strong as well so for both a mixture of the commodity mix as well as the contractual protections and the lower capex requirement you know objectively you say that the current business is a more valuable one jason seidl cowen company analyst that s what i thought jack that s a great response thank you i want to turn the second question back to sort of the macro i mean obviously you had a lot of puts and takes in 1q for north america but it seems if you exclude the weather you guys were slightly ahead of expectations how are you viewing the macro picture in the backdrop jack john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer yes no it was interesting because you do you look under and there was some other weather stuff in some other places like the southeast there was some wet and it delayed some harvest of wood going into paper mills and stuff like that in the winter but that s kind of normal winter stuff most of north america felt pretty good and so it was what was unique about this period versus we ve had some other severe winters over the years what was unique about this one was that it was concentrated very very specifically in canada which you know how canadian railroad you ve probably heard what they dealt with in q1 and then in the midwest because the transcontinental michael the transcontinental line was out for how long a couple of weeks michael o miller president north america yes i think up in their earnings call had 13 days i believe john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer yes so it was unique in that regard that it was so concentrated in terms of the broader outlook the business is growing it feels pretty good what s unusual about today versus the past few years is the commercial development pipeline is as adaptive as we ve seen for a long time and you re starting i spoke to a few projects this quarter but we ve got a whole bunch of them that are going on right now and so i d expect we feel like we re comfortably ahead of plan for what we think we can land in 2019 in terms of new business development and it s on a broad based it s not in any single commodity group it seems to be pretty broad based across the economy and that s pretty unusual as well normally there will be that there will be the year where the new development opportunities are in energy or there ll be a single commodity focus this one if you look at kind of the wheel of opportunity it s very broad based across the economy and a lot of attaching right now so obviously people are investing in across our industrial customer base right now because we re merely a reflection of that deployment of capital that s going on in the broader economy jason seidl cowen company analyst that s great color jack guys i appreciate the time as always john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer absolutely thanks jason operator your next question comes from the line of chris wetherbee from citigroup please go ahead christian wetherbee citigroup analyst thanks guys wanted to maybe ask a little bit about conceptually about sort of north america what you re doing from a streamlining or a cost cutting perspective when you think about your business now in the context of what the class is are doing with psr is this the type of work that you need to be able to sort of keep pace and sort of maintain what was always known about a decent sort of maybe 50 incremental margins on the growth of business or can it be accretive as you sort of come through this process and maybe out the other end post psr implementation from those class is would maybe be a bit more profitable business i just want to get a sense of sort of how that really structurally can change the north american business john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure michael do you want to get started and then i ll chip in michael o miller president north america sure i mean we think long term it certainly can be accretive obviously as class is are implementing psr there s changes to the service product there s changes to the blocking changes to the train side things that impact us at interchange that we have to adjust to and one of the initiatives that we talked about is roots reset which is really a railroad by railroad analysis of our service plan our asset allocation what we are doing to serve our customers and as we go through the psr changes with class is we revisit our railroads and really try to make them as optimal as possible based upon the class i service or interchange plan so i think in the short term there s obviously a little bit of friction that those changes have with our business and it may take our costs up a bit but longer term we optimize based upon the service product that we ll interchange with our class is and that actually creates more a more optimal operation and certainly consistency from a class i allows us to plan our assets and our people better which makes it more a lower cost operation for us so short term there is some friction there is some additional cost but as they implement and we optimize around their implementation we see long term benefits and we re seeing some of that today with csx who s kind of pretty much do most of their psr initiatives and when you look at how our business is with them it s certainly been positive in q1 and we look to see it being little more positive throughout the year john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer yes the way i to add to michael s thoughts the way i think about what michael just said is in kind of three buckets one is when you see us consolidating regions like we did that s something we re always thinking about doing is how do we more efficiently run the business and that reduction in g a is just an outcome of that ongoing process it s the third time you ve seen us consolidate a region over time and that s just doing more with less from an oversight standpoint then there s at the railroad level all of our roots reset initiatives which are we re either doing for purposes of continuous improvement regardless and or we re seeking to implement in conjunction with any psr changes that are happening at the class is in order to match their new service plans with our existing operation so that s kind of point two and then the third element of it is the long term fluidity of the systems to the extent that we get to that new status quo where there s more network capacity the focus then turns to growth and where that growth comes from is going to be one of the logical places with the merchandise traffic which is where short lines are strong and that is what we do it s not going to be coming from coal long term intermodal is what it is but that long term growth will come from a more fluid psr network through that merchandise traffic and that s our bread and butter and so those are the i just group them in my head in those three buckets christian wetherbee citigroup analyst yes got it that s extremely helpful i appreciate that that s good color and then there s been some discussion over the course of the quarter on the m a front i just want to get maybe jack a big picture sort of sense from you what your thoughts are in terms of whether you think this is a buyer or a seller s market when it comes to sort of whether it be short line assets or just sort of core infrastructure assets what does this market really feel like john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer as always it s an asset by asset analysis there certainly is competition out there from infrastructure buyers there s no question that s the case equally it s also the case that where there are contiguous opportunities to our lines we will always be the logical acquirer assuming a rational economic world because the magnitude of the synergies that we can typically bring to those situations and so there may be things where to your point so the answer is both there certainly have been situations where we have not been competitive bidding recently based on more aggressive views of businesses perhaps more aggressive cost of capital there remain other situations that we re looking at where you could see us being in a very good position to be an acquirer if the price was right christian wetherbee citigroup analyst okay that makes sense thanks very much for your time and i appreciate it john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure thanks chris operator your next question comes from the line of ken hoexter from bank of america please go ahead ken hoexter bank of america analyst great good morning jack if i could just follow up on that one for a second so obviously just given all the articles about potential investment did you comment on if you were seeking infrastructure funds or a desire for capital and then if there were sizable projects or more tuck ins that you were looking at john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer no what you re talking to ken there was an article in bloomberg that came out in march and no we didn t comment the simple answer is we don t comment on market speculation or rumors and so as i said before we had various relationships with infrastructure funds that we ve bid on we bid with them we bid against them we obviously have various dialogues that are that have been active over time but with respect to that specific article we don t comment on speculation ken hoexter bank of america analyst yes okay i didn t know if that was something you were following up and putting out there which i doubted just on the growth tj when you look at the i guess the cadence of your earnings just to get to that 4 30 4 50 it seemed like you had you kind of gave details for second quarter and then it sounded like you were maybe expecting a slower growth in the third quarter and a pickup in the fourth quarter is that timings contract maybe you can delve into that full year outlook a little bit more on the 4 30 4 50 timothy j gallagher chief financial officer sure in terms of the we included a slide it s the very last slide sort of an updated seasonality of our earnings slide if you compare this to what we showed in february you ll see that q1 is a little lower and then q3 and q4 are a little higher and so what that reflects is recovery of the coal for example benefit of the costs initiatives that we ve talked about and also the new business so yes and so we ve sort of shifted some of the earnings back a little bit but it s in terms of the distribution of revenues and operating income it s not that different ken hoexter bank of america analyst okay in terms of the so there is still i guess a deceleration in that third quarter then before the acceleration timothy j gallagher chief financial officer no it s really ken it s really if you look at the slide it s really low mid single digits 5 to 10 growth in q3 little stronger in q4 john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer yes that perceived deceleration because q3 was really strong last year and so that s mostly timing related rather than any structural factor and so that s why it appears that way the growth doesn t appear to be as great ken hoexter bank of america analyst so against the 15 growth in john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer multiple speakers the proportional contribution of each of those quarters it s basically the same as it was in february ken hoexter bank of america analyst okay yes no again against the 15 earnings growth in our third quarter but it s not like that 20 diluted eps growth in the fourth quarter is expecting an acceleration because of new contracts or anything else john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer yes it s more relative of what we did last year ken hoexter bank of america analyst okay all right thanks for the insight john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of justin long from stephens please go ahead justin long stephens analyst thanks and good morning john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer good morning justin long stephens analyst so to start truckload rates spot rates have moderated capacity is becoming a little bit more fluid on that front just curious if you re seeing that translate into any rail to truck conversions in your network year to date and is that something that you re baking into the volume guidance in north america that you talked about earlier john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer michael you want to talk a little bit about trucking market right now michael o miller president north america yes justin we certainly have seen spot rates drop a little bit contract rates not as much with the weather in q1 we certainly saw some of our paper shipments move to truck but those have moved back to rail in q2 so from our standpoint we don t see any big structural shifts we think contract rates won t move down any material amount and quite honestly when we look out to 2020 with imo 2020 coming on diesel price is likely going up i think everybody is just trying to build as much capacity in their supply chains and rail is a big component of that for most of our industrial shippers so we don t really see a big impact on it if there was a substantial drop or the economy really really slowed down it would be a bigger concern but right now our view is as steady as she goes we see kind of pretty much volumes and rates staying as we projected the end of last year and what we ve got in our slides justin long stephens analyst okay that s helpful so i think you talked about 3 core pricing in north america last quarter that assumption has not changed michael o miller president north america no justin long stephens analyst okay and then secondly maybe to follow up on some of the commentary around acquisition and investment opportunities jack could you just talk from a high level about the activity level in the pipeline i m just curious if you ve seen an acceleration year to date and any color on the geography where you re seeing the most potential for something to materialize when you just look at the opportunities out there and look at the bidding activity and kind of valuations john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure i mean i wouldn t say there s an acceleration i would just say there s a steady there s always a steady flow and if you look at us historically you will years in which we ve done nothing doesn t mean we weren t looking at a whole bunch of stuff it s just there was nothing that was at the right value and risk profile and so right now in north america there s probably a skew toward north america in terms of our opportunity set right now in terms of what s out there and having said that we are looking at some continued equipment investments in australia which we view as akin to m a it s a deployment of capital under a long term contract so it s not dissimilar so but i would say there s a skew toward north america in terms of europe we re not looking at the biggest value creation and best use our time is continuing to extract value from the rapidly improving u k business so the idea that we d be looking at it would have to be a slam dunk piece of m a tuck in for us to be active there there s just too much value creation from management doesn t need the distraction of m a on a business that s rapidly improving now justin long stephens analyst makes sense i ll leave it at that thanks for the time john c hellmann chairman president chief executive officer sure thanks justin operator and at this time there are no further questions matthew o walsh executive vice president global

brendan to comment on our first quarter results brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark good evening we had a very solid start to the year with strong operating and financial results in both our leasing and services businesses total gaap site leasing revenues for the first quarter were 452 1 million and cash site leasing revenues were 449 5 million foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our estimates for the first quarter which we previously provided with our fourth quarter earnings release only modestly impacting our results they were however still a headwind on a year ago comparisons same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 5 9 over the first quarter of 2018 including the impact of 2 1 of churn on a gross basis same tower growth was 8 domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 7 5 on a gross basis and 5 1 on a net basis including 2 4 of churn a large portion of which continues to be related to metro leap clearwire and iden terminations domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth on a gross basis continues to increase climbing to its highest point in 2 5 years reflecting our strong operational domestic leasing activity over the last year domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenues signed up during the quarter was again very solid in the first quarter this quarter we saw a bit of a shift back in favor of amendments with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming about 68 from amendments and 32 from new leases we continue to see contributions from each of the big four carriers the big four carriers represented 82 of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter we also again had a nice contribution to our domestic operational leasing activity from dish who continues to be active executing new lease agreements while we executed a lot of new business in the quarter our domestic backlog continues to restock itself as our customers remain active giving us confidence for the remainder of the year internationally on a constant currency basis same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 9 8 including 0 5 of churn or 10 3 on a gross basis gross same tower organic growth in brazil was 12 2 on a constant currency basis we had another solid leasing quarter internationally with brazil again being one of the largest contributors in brazil we continue to have solid contributions from claro vivo oi and tim during the first quarter 86 1 of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in u s dollars the majority of non u s dollar denominated revenue was from brazil with brazil representing 12 3 of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8 9 of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass through expenses with regard to first quarter churn we continue to see churn from leases with metro leap and clearwire consistent with our expectations as of quarter end we have approximately 9 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with metro leap and clearwire that we ultimately expect to turn off over the next two years also as mentioned on our last earnings call in the fourth quarter we incurred approximately 6 million of annualized churn from certain legacy iden related leases the impact of which will affect our reported same tower churn results for the first three quarters of 2019 domestic churn in the first quarter from all other tenants on an annual same tower basis was 1 3 tower cash flow for the first quarter was 362 9 million our industry leading domestic tower cash flow margin increased to 83 5 in the quarter international tower cash flow margin increased to 69 2 and was 90 excluding the impact of pass through reimbursable expenses adjusted ebitda in the first quarter was 345 6 million our adjusted ebitda results in the quarter were again driven by strong performances in both our leasing and services businesses services revenues in the first quarter were 41 1 million up 48 1 over the first quarter of 2018 driving almost twice as much services gross profit as a year ago period our adjusted ebitda margin was 70 4 in the quarter the same as the year earlier period notwithstanding the larger contribution from our services business excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses adjusted ebitda margin was 74 9 approximately 97 of our total adjusted ebitda was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter affo in the first quarter was 236 1 million affo per share was 2 07 an increase of 11 9 over the first quarter of 2018 or 14 6 on a constant currency basis during the first quarter in accordance with the oi reorganization plan approved by the brazilian courts we received a payment of brl11 2 million which represents a partial recovery of pre petition obligations owed to sba from oi net of costs we incurred in connection with this bankruptcy process the u s dollar recovery during the quarter was 2 3 million which resulted in a partial recovery of our allowance for doubtful accounts we recorded this amount as an offset to bad debt expense within selling general and administrative expenses as a result this recovery positively impacted adjusted ebitda and affo by 2 3 million and affo per share by 0 03 the reorganization plan calls for additional payments of pre petition receivables to be made by oi over the next three years we will record these payments in a similar manner as they are received no additional payments are due under this plan during 2019 during the first quarter we continue to invest in expanding our tower portfolio acquiring 54 communication sites for 36 1 million and building 72 sites most of the added sites were located internationally as of today we have under contract for acquisition and anticipate closing by the end of the third quarter on 256 additional sites at an aggregate price of 123 9 million we also continue to invest in the land under our sites which provides both strategic and financial benefits during the quarter we spent an aggregate of 15 4 million to buy land and easements and to extend groundlease terms at the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71 of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is approximately 36 years in today s earnings press release we included our updated outlook for full year 2019 we have increased our outlook across the board we anticipate increases in site leasing due to both organic and inorganic growth increases in organic growth are primarily due to earlier average timing of rental commencements in large part as a result of a higher concentration of leasing activity coming from amendments versus new leases the increase in our anticipated leasing results is being partially offset by incremental negative changes in our foreign currency rate assumptions for the remainder of the year primarily in brazil the changes in these currency assumptions negatively impacted our outlook for site leasing revenue by 4 5 million tower cash flow by 3 million and adjusted ebitda and affo by 2 7 million we also anticipate incremental contributions to our results from our services business due to our strong q1 performance and our healthy backlogs however our full year 2019 services guidance still contemplates a slowdown in the second half of the year due to the sprint t mobile transaction the balance of our outlook for affo has also been improved for anticipated better results in net cash interest expense and non discretionary capex offset by slightly higher tax expectations finally our outlook for affo per share has also been negatively impacted by about 0 04 due to a change in our assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares for the year of 114 9 million which assumption is influenced in part by increases in our current and estimated future share prices we re very pleased with how the year has started and are optimistic about the rest of 2019 i ll now turn things over to mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet mark derussy vice president of finance thank you brendan sba entered the first quarter with 9 7 billion of net debt and our net debt to annualized adjusted ebitda leverage ratio was seven times at the low end of our targeted range of 7 to 7 5 times our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda the net cash interest expense was 3 6 times the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3 9 and our weighted average maturity is approximately four years as of today we have 50 million outstanding under our 1 25 billion committed revolver as mentioned on our last earnings call during the first quarter we entered into a four year 1 2 billion interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest expense at 4 49 on approximately half our outstanding 2018 term loan b as a result of this transaction approximately 88 of our non revolver debt outstanding is fixed the company did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the two months since our last earnings call stock repurchases however are still an integral part of our strategy as of today we have 204 5 million of authorization remaining under our 1 billion stock repurchase plan the company s shares outstanding at march 31 2019 are 113 2 million which is down 2 8 on 116 5 million at march 31 2018 with that i ll now turn the call over to jeff jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer thanks mark and good evening everyone our first quarter was about a simple straightforward and solid as we could have hoped for we exceeded our expectations across all financial metrics we continued to see healthy operational leasing activity and our services business again had another very strong quarter while it has only been two months since our last earnings call we feel like a lot has happened particularly around improved clarity to the remainder of 2019 as a result we are able to increase our full year outlook domestically the strong operational leasing activity we saw in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter of 2019 all four major u s wireless carriers were active during the quarter to varying degrees with particular increases in new technology and capacity related upgrades pushing our amendment business to the highest quarterly contribution in over a year we also saw continued contributions from dish who remains busy with their phase 1 network buildout our leasing application backlogs remain very strong giving us confidence and continued steady lease up results in q2 and beyond internationally we also had another solid leasing quarter with steady contributions across all of our markets led once again by brazil the contractual revenues signed up during this quarter and our international markets came about 48 from new leases and 52 from amendments though continues to be very balanced between coverage builds and technology upgrades similar to last quarter we had solid contributions from all four major wireless carriers in brazil although the currency has continued to weaken a little bit operationally we remain on target for strong growth in brazil once again this year or as brendan mentioned earlier but for the weakening of the currency our 2019 outlook would have been increased even more we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that exist throughout all of our international markets during the first quarter we spent limited amounts of discretionary capital on new asset additions and no capital on share repurchases in the two months since our last earnings call as a result we saw our leverage quickly drop to the low end of our target leverage range at 7 0 times this drop in leverage in one quarter demonstrates how quickly we can organically deliver and the flexibility that exists within our capital structure we do expect investment to increase through the remainder of 2019 we are still committed to growing our portfolio 5 to 10 this year through disciplined acquisitions and new builds we of course focus on growing our portfolio throughout our existing markets but we also regularly explore opportunities in other markets our focus has always been and continues to be on finding accretive tower opportunities to create shareholder value and frankly avoiding those that do not we believe we are very good at this and we will continue to maintain it as a key component of our strategy in addition stock repurchases will also remain an important part for value proposition we have always been opportunistic around repurchases and did not have any of the market dislocations we typically look for in stock repurchases so we did not repurchase any shares in the last two months but our desire to repurchase shares under the right circumstances hasn t changed i m confident that we will have a nice mix of both quality portfolio additions and share repurchases throughout 2019 our capital structure continues to be one of our greatest assets we have significant liquidity and tremendous access to sizable incremental capital across a diverse set of financing markets our capital structure and industry leading affo per share affords us great flexibility to use our resources to drive shareholder value in a variety of ways in addition to tower investments and share repurchases we continue to explore and pursue new business initiatives related to our existing businesses these initiatives are not material today but we are excited about the potential for the opportunities we are currently exploring we re off to a good start in 2019 and are operationally performing at a very high level this year we celebrate two anniversaries 30 years in business and 20 years as a public company we are within striking distance of two important milestones 30 000 sites and 2 billion in revenue i m very excited about what the future holds for sba i d like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success and with that laurie we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question from the line of simon flannery with morgan stanley please go ahead simon flannery morgan stanley analyst great thanks very much thanks for the commentary on the balance sheet and the buybacks where do you draw the line on your leverage if you didn t have an opportunity to do buybacks or a lot more m a would you be prepared to let the leverage drop down into the high sixes or would you want to keep it in that 7 to 7 5 range i mean if you could just provide a little bit more color on the services strength very strong you re talking about it potentially slowing down there but what was behind that strength this quarter thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well ideally we do want to keep it in the 7 to 7 5 times range simon but we don t want to spend money just for the sake of spending money either and what we have not yet implemented is kind of a mechanical stock repurchase program that would be implemented just for the sake of maintaining leverage we re hesitant to do that because we haven t had to do that frankly we ve always had the opportunity to be opportunistic around stock repurchases and we d like to continue to believe that will be afforded to us by the market in terms of the services business we do work for all the carriers but one of the including a fair amount of work for sprint and as we noted in the press release as brendan said in his comments we had to take a position on sprint t mobile transaction so while we expect to continue to do a lot of work right up through the end of the second quarter at least with respect to sprint on the services side we re taking the position that the deal ends or the deal gets approved rather and that there is no more sprint as of june 30th now whether that happens or not we of course don t really know but we had to take a position for purposes of guidance but the services business is very very busy right now and that has rolled into the second quarter and that of course the combination of what we did in the first quarter and where we see things today in the second quarter was the reason we were able to move the full year outlook up simon flannery morgan stanley analyst i mean is this related to 5g rollout or talk about kind of brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer well it s i mean not all the customers that we re doing business for really on the 5g trail so it s really a mix of everything it s just a high level of activity which is really what s also behind our leasing business simon flannery morgan stanley analyst great thank you operator and we ll go to john atkin with rbc please go ahead jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst yes so a couple of questions one i was wondering as you look at the international business how do you think about kind of the longer term growth rate and are there any potential needle movers to call out ex brazil and then secondly was interested in kind of any update on edge computing any opportunity that you see there perhaps that s tied in with small cells or not but what are your current thoughts on that thank you jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah some of the international markets jon are ahead of brazil slightly now some are lagging but the issue really is that brazil is so much bigger than frankly any of our other markets the thing that gives us confidence around all of the markets is they are well behind the u s in terms of their technology upgrades there is still a lot of 3g work being done in some of these markets let alone 4g and in some cases no 5g whatsoever so we do think that there will be a lot of work in the future coming out of these markets obviously there has to be an economy and an ecosystem to pay for all that and just by carrier expenditures but we do think that just as in the u s that will will be the case in terms of the mobile edge computing we continue to take the steps to prepare ourselves for the day when there will be material revenue opportunities that come from that we continue to believe that that they will come i can t tell you when that they will be we ve had some good traction with the one deployment that we working on with packet ph about site of gillette stadium the number of folks who have come through packet to deploy in that facility a lot of discussions going on but in terms of actual material revenue production i think we re still we re still a bit a ways away it s certainly not going to come in 2019 jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst okay and then you mentioned the phase 1 build out and the leasing that you continue to see there is equipment actually going up jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer absolutely jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst and then lastly the ground buyback activity is there any weight i don t think there is but i just thought i checked is there any way to kind of ramp that if you wanted to around the ground lease repurchases jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer no we have plenty of capital to spend in that that business has always really been governed more by the particular situation of the seller these are these are all individuals who might say no three different times and then say yes on the fourth time so it s we tried to do that it s really not it s not an operational issue as much as it is a seller desire issue jon that may sound a little crazy but after 15 years of pulling all the different levers that s kind of how it goes jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst great thank you very much operator we ll go to phil cusick with j p morgan please go ahead phil cusick j p morgan analyst hey guys a couple of follow ups and a new one first on the dish contribution should we think of that as a bigger part of the services business today and is that ramping through the year jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer it s a part of the services business i don t know if it s a bigger part of the services but yeah it s been a small part of our services business it may increase as the year goes on as a percentage of services but i don t think it s so big that it makes a huge difference brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s not the reason it went from the fourth quarter number to the first quarter number jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer right phil cusick j p morgan analyst okay and then on the deleverage side nobody has mentioned a dividend yet but you ve talked about doing that within the next couple of years if the share stay at this level or somewhere around here does it make sense to pull that forward as a way to maintain leverage rather than buying back stock brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean it could be something to add to the list of things to look at phil cusick j p morgan analyst right if buybacks aren t as accretive as they used to be maybe the dividend instead or is that does the dividend timing is it driven more by the size of nol you want to maintain over time or could that be jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer we ve always only talked about the dividend in terms of when we first had to start paying it phil cusick j p morgan analyst right which is 21 you ve talked about brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer correct phil cusick j p morgan analyst so pulling that forward especially if the share price isn t accretive jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer that s a must ph that is a possibility that is available to us phil cusick j p morgan analyst got it and then last one you ve talked in the past about a little bit of competitive churn at t and t mobile both have guys who are working on some new builds for them to overbuild you and your peers any shift in the pace of that positive or negative jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer no changes really there phil cusick j p morgan analyst okay thanks guys operator we ll go to michael rollins with citi please go ahead michael rollins citigroup analyst hi thanks for taking the questions first one if i could on one of the slides you provided an update on return on invested capital which is about 10 3 at the end of the first quarter how does that compare between the domestic business and the international business and how do you think about current valuations for assets relative to your return objectives thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah it s higher domestically mostly due to just obviously the maturity of that we ve had those assets for so long and we haven t decided to give those numbers out because it s a little bit immature from an international standpoint but that s something we ll consider breaking down in the future but higher domestically just because the international stuff is less mature brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer although some countries it s higher there are individual countries where it has the highest return on invested capital jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah michael rollins citigroup analyst and is the jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah you got to clearly think about those things mike in terms of current pricing versus price matters absolutely michael rollins citigroup analyst and in terms of what you re seeing out there is just getting tougher or is it getting easier in terms of the opportunities for asset purchases jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well i wouldn t say it s getting easier i mean it s there is a lot of capital and it is price competitive you have to be very patient and you have to look hard and you have to be knowledgeable about the wheat and the chaff michael rollins citigroup analyst thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer laurie i think we re ready for another question operator very good thank you we ll go to rick prentiss raymond james please go ahead richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst thanks good afternoon guys jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer hi rick richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst hey follow up on a couple of previous questions simon was asking on the leverage side and you talked about the portfolio it looks like the portfolio growth in the first quarter was probably less than 1 and even if we add in the sites under contract through end of third quarter still kind of in the 1 plus percent range so are you seeing some bigger transactions out there that could get into the target zone of 5 to 10 portfolios given that the answer to mike there was that prices are getting tougher jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer we think that there will be some opportunities along those lines yes richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst and you kind of alluded to that maybe some new markets might be popping onto the screen jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer no i don t think i said that i think we say we d like to stay in our existing markets but we ll look we ll look everywhere that it makes sense to look richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst that s good and then with phil s question on the leverage and the dividend have you thought about kind of what that payout ratio of affo might look like crown when they convert and start paying dividend kind of with the full payment american tower has kind of been in that we re going to grow it for a long time which way should we think about you guys looking at the when the dividend day does come what the path might look like brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer little latter richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst the more like american towers kind of keep it growing jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yes richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst okay and then last one for me on the leverage as we think about 19 and 20 and 21 where does leverage need to go as you start looking to pay a dividend jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer doesn t have to go much lower than it is right now we ve talked about something with a six handle on it richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst all right i did have one other i apologize amendment versus colo you talked about how amendments had gone to about 68 of new revenue and colors with 32 if you get a customer who comes in who s already a customer on your tower and they want to put more equipment on the tower but a different rad center is that a new co location or is that an amendment jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer depends on whether they bring it under their existing contract in which event it would be an amendment or a brand new contract in which event it would be a lease richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst and just hypothetically say a first net type project with at t is that going to be seen more as an amendment activity i m just trying to think of how we re gauging what s the base of business coming in if it s under the existing contract it s an amendment if it s a new contract it s a lease yeah that helps okay thanks jeff operator and we ll go to walter piecyk with btig please go ahead walter piecyk btig analyst thanks domestically your amendment to colo growth is accelerated for the last five quarters i guess or so yes looks like five jeff is that going to happen throughout 2019 just sequential accelerations in that annual growth rate for the amendments of colos and escalations i guess just your gross growth the 7 5 number you reported this quarter i don t know what you call it jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer are you talking about the growth rate or the rate of amendments to colos walter piecyk btig analyst i m talking about the 7 5 which i call a growth rate every company calls it i think something different so jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah the answer is yes well because if you look at the if you look at the revenue bridge for the domestic it implies obviously a higher full year number and given where we are it has to increase throughout the year so we would expect it to increase each quarter walter piecyk btig analyst and then jeff you had mentioned that your guidance or assumes that the sprint t mobile deal is approved so if it s not approved does that mean those numbers are higher or lower jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well we don t no i mean we ll have to see what comes i mean it s hard to we don t really know what the what the plan b is if there is one walter piecyk btig analyst got you so it s possible it could be lower than if plan b is jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well i don t know no i don t think so because right now our guidance assumes that basically there is nothing else from sprint walter piecyk btig analyst got it jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it s really two if you look at the two pieces it services where there is an impact we assume that that s slower in the second half of the year because there is really nothing from sprint i don t think that could be lower question is whether it really would be higher if the deal didn t happen and we re not sure about that and on the leasing side there is probably very little impact because any slowdown that might occur or increase that might occur if the deal doesn t happen in either case it s not going to impact this year s numbers too much walter piecyk btig analyst got it last question i mean i don t know if you re planning on putting up like an 8 dividend yield but i guess just generally speaking if you re not willing to buy stock why should investors be buying your stock right now brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer walt it s only been two months since our last call i didn t say they re not willing to buy our stock i said as we move through the year i m confident we re going to invest our capital in towers and stock walter piecyk btig analyst got you i just see my i think the response to phil s question was like you think the stock you re not getting accretion i mean those are phil s words not yours but whatever that the stock is at a level that your dividends are preferential but i mean i m just not sure jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer those were do you want walter piecyk btig analyst okay jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer you have phil s phone number give him a call walter piecyk btig analyst absolutely all right thanks operator we ll go to nick del deo with moffettnathanson please go ahead nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst hey thanks for taking my question would you consider a one time dividend rejigger a leverage in between now and when your nols run out or would you only pay a dividend if it was the start of a recurring one jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer i don t see the wisdom of a one timer nick but if i m missing something help us figure it out but i don t see any benefit in that nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst no that s certainly fair you re going back to the issue of land how much higher do you think you can push it from the current 71 where does that top out and what s the split between land that you own or control under perpetual easement versus the long term lease brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer we own roughly 30 35 of the land either in the form of a long term or perpetual easement or have outright ownership in terms of it going higher the interesting thing about that it can certainly continue to move higher and we have moved it higher over the years but as you bring in some of the international stuff sometimes it comes in with lower numbers so it kind of resets it and that s statistic is controlling for at least 20 years the funny thing is you always have those that are on the border of that every year that goes by it s a year less for some of those some of them fall below it so you re constantly having to kind of extend your way out of it so that s a long way of saying it can go a little bit higher but you know it s hard to move that number materially when you got 30 000 sites nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst you find you find their repurchase overseas to be interesting brazil you typically have the inaudible around that makes it less appealing jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer we do whether it s a purchase or an extension or an easement or some other type of longer term entitlement the concept still applies and we do find it interesting and beneficial it s little more difficult because the real estate laws are not in every case as clear as they are in the us nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst okay got it thanks guys operator and we ll go next to david barden with bank of america please go ahead david barden bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thanks for your squeezing me in the two questions one was the kind of core domestic churn non iden non metro leap and clear is about 1 3 it s almost double over the last year i know you talked about this a little bit brendan i think last quarter but it s up another 20 bps i wanted if you could kind of speak to like where is this going the shape of it the drivers of it and does it kind of normalize it at some point in time and then the second question was if i m reading it right it looks like the and i m sorry to ask such a detailed question but the guide appears to have like a 10 million improvement in other costs which is helping kind of drive the income line of the margins i was wondering if you can kind of just speak to that please thanks brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer okay on the first one which is the churn it has increased a little bit some of that is non big 4 related we have certain customers that we ve had churn off it s also a trailing 12 month number my expectation is that it probably will be slightly higher later in the year but i think it ll probably come down then slightly thereafter but our range as we ve talked about historically is 1 to 1 5 for that kind of base churn and i think longer term that s the right range for that number we re sort of right in the middle of it right now on a second question david frame a little bit i m not 100 sure which 10 million you re referring to david barden bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i m sorry it s in the brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer you want me we re happy to get on the phone with you afterwards so we can get if there is a specific number we can david barden bank of america merrill lynch analyst no it just went from 10 to 15 to 1 to 6 million and that was the question but we can take it offline appreciate it thank you brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer okay we ll go to spencer kurn with new street research your line is open spencer kurn new street research analyst hey guys thanks so i just wanted to follow up on the question around organic growth and domestically accelerating for the rest of the year as implied in your guidance you just provide a little bit more color on the cadence i know you ve got you posted really high growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 but it also sounds like you expected growth to increase every quarter throughout the year so any color you can provide on that would be really helpful brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i can t say exactly what the number will be each quarter obviously because there is certain uncertainties as you move through the year but based on the backlog what we ve signed up to date and what we expect to sign up we make certain assumptions around timing and most of the stuff that s been signed up we already know the timing so we re pretty confident when we look out at what s scheduled to commence that will have an increase in those numbers as we move through the year and as you as you noted the full year number that s on the bridge sort of suggests that the number at the end of the year or for the full year i should say is 7 9 so if we re 7 5 in the first quarter we get to close to 7 9 as an average obviously it s got to step up 20 30 basis points each quarter roughly jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer on average brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on average jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer not necessarily each once spencer kurn new street research analyst well that s sort of my question are you will we like thinking like the end of the year you actually got a higher rate than the average or some sort of a bell curve overall like trend that we should expect brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would expect it will be above the average by the end of the year spencer kurn new street research analyst awesome and then just one quick follow up i may your first net is over 50 done and the company is expecting to be they expecting to be around 60 by the third quarter are you seeing a similar progress of work being done on your sides or is there sort of a lag or any difference from your perspective of what you re seeing thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer you know that s hard to answer spencer because not every amendment that comes out of at t is firstnet they re doing a variety of all kinds of different work involving all kinds of different pieces of their spectrum and in some cases doing first work and then coming back and do another work so i mean that sounds about right it could be a little bit less i would doubt it s any more than that spencer kurn new street research analyst got it thanks so much operator we ll go to brett feldman with goldman sachs please go ahead brett feldman goldman sachs analyst yeah two questions the first one is pretty quick the oi recovery you received in the quarter was that factored into your original outlook or is that among the reasons why you increased your outlook for the year and then more interesting and maybe i didn t hear it right but i think you said 82 of your domestic leasing activity was big four so i guess that would mean 18 was non big four which seems like a big number and i m curious of that if i heard it correctly was that predominantly dish driven or is there more interesting story in there jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah on the first one the oi recovery was not in our original outlook so that was part of the increase specifically to ebitda and affo it didn t affect the lines above that and the 82 yeah a big the biggest component of the non big four piece was dish brett feldman goldman sachs analyst is there anything else in there of the non dish part that s ramping and you ve got nash ph in the past about non traditional inaudible eclectic mix you ve normally had jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer same eclectic mix and that story was the set was the same as last quarter brett feldman goldman sachs analyst got it thank you i appreciate it operator we have a question from colby synesael with cowen and company please go ahead colby synesael cowen and company analyst great thanks two if i may when you think of the big four u s carriers i think the view has then that the predominant amount of growth has been coming not just for sba but for the sector from the t mobile as part of the 600 build out and then also at t with firstnet and then verizon has slowed its pacing although still material in terms of contributing to growth net sprint really has for the most part gone away i m just curious if you agree with how i just characterized it and then secondly i guess more of a modeling question for brandon you raised your affo guidance by what is it 0 7 on the low end and 0 3 on the high end i guess just what is it on the high end that didn t allow you to take it up by the same amount i thought i heard on the call you mentioned something about the price of the stock being higher and that having an impact and i m just curious how how we might try to think about that thanks brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on a second one it s really more about taxes it s just about where we range the taxes the share count piece affects both ends of the range the same because we re using the same number of shares as our assumption it just negatively impacted the overall number because we assumed a higher diluted share count but it s really we kind of moved our own thoughts about where our taxes will be more on the low end so that s the only difference jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah and on the on the activity levels i mean there is activity from all big four colby so i don t think we agree with that description particularly as it relates to sprint not doing anything right now i mean that s just not true as it relates to us on both the leasing and the services side colby synesael cowen and company analyst yeah thank you operator and next we go to matthew niknam with deutsche bank please go ahead matthew niknam with deutsche bank analyst hey guys thank you for taking the question brendan i think there was a mention of the guidance increase for this year being tied to more amendments relative to colo or maybe an earlier sort of commencement was that the entirety of the guidance increase or is there sort of a broader core increase underlying that beyond just sort of timing and then just on the amendments any color you can provide in terms of the pricing on these amendments thanks brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on the guidance that the leasing revenue increase the organic piece of it and the best way to kind of look at it matt is to look at the bridge that s in the supplemental package and you can look at the changes relative to last time that we provided you ll see that the lease up number went up about 3 million most of that was due to faster timing which is due to a little bit heavier concentration of amendments there were other reasons that our revenue guidance went up though those included some non organic contributions as we put some additional sites under contract that will help contribute in a couple of other minor changes but those are the two biggest pieces matthew niknam with deutsche bank analyst i m sorry what was the second one jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer just in terms of pricing on amendment yeah brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer amendment pricing continues to hold in very firmly we re certainly not seeing any weakening there matthew niknam with deutsche bank analyst thank you operator we ll go next to batya levi with ubs please go ahead batya levi ubs analyst great thank you was the increase in discretionary capex all related to the acquisitions you have announced or are you finding more opportunities to build incremental sites and also as a carrier start to gradually build some of their sites on their own what do you think is driving that and can you allude some of that activity back to your portfolio brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on the capex it s basically all m a related there is a couple of minor little things but it s not there is really been no change in the overall expectations around new builds for the year jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah on the carrier building sites on their own we have seen that in some very limited circumstances i think some of that is for sites that the carriers view is very strategic as opposed to capital driven because there is plenty of capital chase in that and i don t know about it will ever be able to move that back given what we see is some very uneconomic new build terms which actually is the explanation why we just don t build as many towers in the us as we used to batya levi ubs analyst okay thanks operator and a question from amy yong with macquarie please go ahead amy yong macquarie analyst thanks i was wondering if you can update us on the customer activity in brazil and with the spectrum auction happening i think in the back half of this year or 2020 should we anticipate an increased activity on acceleration in the region thank you jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well the customers are be similar story to the u s they re all active but to varying degrees and certainly with new spectrum there will come new opportunities for us in the form certainly of amendments and hopefully new co locations as well so we always welcome new spectrum it s not millimeter wave spectrum which of course has a much different use this will be macro tower oriented spectrum so we hope it goes through as planned and we would expect certainly to benefit from that amy yong macquarie analyst thank you operator operator instructions we ll go to robert gutman with guggenheim please go ahead robert gutman guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question looking at it sort of a bigger picture view the drivers that are underlying the current acceleration in leasing activity how far out do you think these carry in terms of now looking for next year s guidance but does the current strong pace of activity sort of dry it out looking next year is the reason we believe that it s still early in terms of where the carriers are in terms of what they re doing jeffrey a stoops director president and

board recommends that navient shareholders support the company s strategy and board which has delivered strong returns recommends shareholders vote for all of navient s highly qualified directors on the white proxy card canyon is attempting to gain effective control over the board of directors with hand picked nominees without paying shareholders premium if successful canyon would be positioned to continue pursuing inadequate acquisition attempt or force company to pursue a risky strategy that destroys value navient has significant business momentum as current board is overseeing successful execution of the right strategy to create long term sustainable shareholder value wilmington del april 30 2019 globe newswire navient nasdaq navi today announced that it has filed definitive proxy materials with the u s securities and exchange commission in connection with its upcoming annual meeting of shareholders to be held on june 6 2019 at 8 00 a m eastern time at the company s headquarters in wilmington delaware shareholders of record as of april 8 2019 will be entitled to vote at such meeting in connection with the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders navient sent a letter to navient shareholders urging them to vote for the re election of navient s current board using the white proxy card the letter highlights the board s efforts to drive enhanced performance and outlines serious concerns about the motivations of canyon capital advisors llc to nominate a slate of underqualified director candidates the full text of the letter is below vote the white proxy card today to support the navient board s recommendations april 29 2019 dear fellow navient shareholder we are writing to let you know that you have a critical decision to make concerning the future of navient at our upcoming annual meeting of shareholders on june 6 2019 at this meeting navient shareholder canyon capital advisors llc together with certain of its affiliates canyon a hedge fund which recently made an unsuccessful inadequate attempt to acquire navient for 12 50 per share is trying to gain effective control of the board of directors of navient without paying you and our other shareholders fair value canyon owns approximately 10 5 of the company s stock yet it has nominated a slate of four directors for election to the navient board if their slate is elected when combined with the addition last august of canyon recommended director candidate frederick arnold canyon would have hand picked 50 of your ten member board effectively canyon would be taking control of the company without paying you our shareholders for that right we therefore strongly urge you to support navient s slate of director nominees simply stated our nominees are better qualified to oversee the execution of the company s strategy and are far better placed to represent the best interest of every navient shareholder than canyon s hand picked underqualified nominees your board of directors recommends that you vote for the re election of the current board we believe voting for the current navient directors nominated for re election is the best way to protect the future of the company and the value of your investment in navient we are very concerned that canyon s attempt to take effective control of the board would put them in a position to either continue to pursue their inadequate acquisition attempt or to push navient to pursue a strategy that creates a significant risk to the value of your stock we strongly urge you to vote to re elect navient s entire slate of 10 highly qualified and experienced nominees for the following reasons if canyon s nominees are elected canyon would be able to reintroduce their inadequate proposal to acquire the company to a board that would be 50 comprised of canyon s hand picked directors if canyon can t acquire navient at the inadequate price they proposed they may force the company to pursue a risky strategy that destroys value canyon s hand picked nominees are underqualified navient has significant business momentum and the right strategy to create long term sustainable shareholder value that is delivering strong results your board engaged with canyon in good faith regarding their attempt to acquire navient and acted in the best interests of all shareholders shareholders navient s highly qualified independent and refreshed board is committed and best qualified to execute the strategy to drive value creation for all navient shareholders if canyon s nominees are elected canyon would be able to reintroduce their inadequate proposal to acquire the company to a board that would be 50 comprised of canyon s hand picked directors canyon announced their intent to nominate a slate of directors merely two days after the navient board s unanimous rejection on february 18 2019 of a highly conditional low premium unsolicited expression of interest or in layman s terms proposal from canyon and their partner platinum equity advisors llc platinum to acquire navient for 12 50 per share this price valued your company at a premium of only 6 6 over the closing stock price on february 15 2019 a discount of 2 8 to the one year volume weighted average price vwap of 12 86 per share and a discount of 5 2 to our closing price of 13 18 as of the date of this letter after consulting with the company s financial and legal advisors the full navient board even mr arnold the canyon recommended director unanimously determined that canyon s proposal substantially undervalued the company the board also determined that the proposal was neither credible nor actionable particularly given canyon s repeated failure to address key financing litigation and regulatory issues continuously raised by the board it is clear that canyon is looking to exert a grossly outsized influence on your board relative to their 10 5 ownership position your board believes that canyon s subsequent nomination of four directors along with their misleading and inaccurate comments about navient is an attempt to achieve control of your company through the nomination process after their failed attempt to acquire navient at an inadequate price we believe that one of canyon s motives is to stack the board with their hand picked candidates to enable canyon to pursue their inadequate proposal at some point in the future canyon s self interests are further evidenced by canyon s demand during the settlement discussions that we reimburse them for their fees and expenses related to both this proxy contest and their failed acquisition attempt including reimbursement of all expenses related to canyon s extensive four month due diligence review up to a 5 million cap the demand to reimburse them for expenses incurred during due diligence is highly unusual and in effect asks you to pay their lawyers and bankers for canyon s failed attempt to buy the company which has delivered no value to you if canyon can t acquire navient at the inadequate price they proposed they may force the company to pursue a risky strategy that destroys value in the event that canyon is unable to force through their inadequate acquisition attempt we believe they intend to propose that navient pursue a risky ill defined alternative strategy that would create significant risks to your investment and deliver less value than our current strategy navient s management is laser focused on reducing costs and has done so successfully but canyon is proposing slashing costs in a way that we believe would undermine our successful strategy of maximizing cash flow and returning significant capital to shareholders in its report on navient dated march 22 2019 fitch ratings raised concerns about the potential negative impact canyon could have on navient s strategy operations and balance sheet if it were to gain additional representation on navient s board fitch indicated that its negative outlook designation reflects among other things fitch s concern that canyon publicly expressed a view that runs counter to management s strategic direction with respect to its growth businesses in addition to being a potential distraction for management fitch is concerned that were canyon to gain board seats it may also seek to accelerate shareholder distributions in our view there is a significant difference between running a highly regulated customer focused service business and canyon s strategy of managing the student loan portfolio strictly as a runoff portfolio we believe canyon s approach is likely to lead to reduced servicing quality higher delinquencies and defaults lower cash flow and more intense regulatory scrutiny on the company canyon s hand picked nominees are underqualified promptly following canyon s director nomination notice the nominations and governance committee of the board and certain other board members interviewed canyon s nominees after careful consideration the committee unanimously concluded that all of canyon s nominees lacked the requisite experience or qualifications to contribute positively to the board given their limited experience if any in public company governance financial services operations structured finance and in many other relevant areas of expertise necessary to effectively serve navient s shareholders the company had previously provided canyon with a list of experience and qualifications desired for director nominees your board also believes that canyon s hand picked nominees are being put forward in a self interested attempt to advance canyon s goal to enrich themselves at the expense of you and our other shareholders accordingly the board determined to recommend against voting for any of canyon s nominees in an effort to avoid the costs of running an expensive proxy contest and instead reach an amicable resolution members of the company s board and management engaged in multiple in person and telephonic conversations with representatives of canyon and offered to enter into an appropriate standstill and add one of canyon s candidates to the board and to work with canyon to identify and appoint an additional mutually agreed upon candidate which would have given canyon input in selecting 3 of our 10 directors including mr arnold however canyon rejected this highly reasonable offer at all times your board has acted in the best interest of all navient shareholders and we believe we are far better placed to represent your interests than canyon s hand picked underqualified nominees navient has significant business momentum and the right strategy to create long term sustainable shareholder value that is delivering strong results while your board understands that it needs to continue to focus on improving total shareholder returns we are overseeing a very effective execution of the company s strategy and we are confident that this strategy will generate significant value for all navient shareholders navient has a clear path to creating further significant value navient has the expertise systems and data driven strategies to create value by maximizing cash flows originating high quality loans and growing our fee revenue while continuing to improve operating efficiency the cash flows we have generated from our education loan portfolio meaningfully exceed initial projections driven by enhanced financing activity and acquisitions of additional high performing education loan portfolios since the separation from sallie mae in 2014 we have continuously optimized our capital structure and adopted a conservative funding approach that has generated 21 billion in cash flow 6 billion above original forecasts and has driven attractive returns on equity we project that our portfolio will generate an additional 23 billion in cash flow over the next 20 years navient s strategy of maximizing portfolio cash flows has driven significant returns we have successfully balanced the need to de risk the company s capital structure to optimize credit ratings with the need to provide shareholders with a market leading pay out ratio for example we have used over 88 of the excess cash flows generated by operations since june 30 2014 which was shortly following our separation from sallie mae to reduce unsecured debt from 17 7 billion to 11 5 billion and to return 3 7 billion in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this return of capital to shareholders equates to a 121 total payout ratio which ranks 2nd among the top 24 kbw bank index bkx constituents and 7th among the top 68 s p 500 financials constituents our team continues to be laser focused on maximizing the cash flows from our education loan portfolios and with a strong capital position we are targeting a return of nearly 600 million to shareholders in 2019 and a further decrease in unsecured debt we have used a smaller portion of our cash flow since separation to acquire over 32 billion of education loans including 23 6 billion in federal family education loan program acquisitions and 8 7 billion of private education loans these acquisitions leveraged our scale data and experience to drive attractive returns and have been overwhelmingly supported by investors our acquisitions including those of duncan solutions and earnest have leveraged navient s core competencies and fixed cost base while providing additional earnings and strong cash flow generation with minimal capital investment required post acquisition the company has a consistent track record of improving operating efficiency and aggressively managing expenses while maintaining a superior customer experience since the separation from sallie mae in 2014 navient s management has reduced operating expense through a reduction in ftes and by creating a more variable expense structure in 2018 operating expenses declined by 11 and we delivered a best in class efficiency ratio of 47 for the year compared to an average of 59 for the bkx index we also launched a new website for our student loan customers and a digital process for income driven repayment application these initiatives simplified complex processes and benefitted all stakeholders with an optimized capital structure strong credit quality and best in class efficiency ratio navient generated a core earnings return on equity of 15 in 2018 substantially above the kbw bank index average of 12 our company has generated significant momentum as the management team is successfully executing the right strategy to deliver increasing and sustainable value to all shareholders the changes we have implemented over the past few years have begun to bear fruit despite a year to date total shareholder return of over 51 ranking 1st among the bkx index and 2nd among the s p 500 financials all of us at navient understand that we still have much more work to do to achieve our objectives and continue creating value for shareholders our stock s performance has been affected in significant part by the consumer financial protection bureau and state attorney general lawsuits which we believe are without merit while we have worked tirelessly to keep these lawsuits and inquiries from impacting the operation of the company we do recognize that for you our shareholders our stock performance has been impacted we are constantly examining ways to put these lawsuits behind us your board and management team understand that your decision to vote for board nominees will be determined by who you believe can deliver greater value to shareholders given the collective operational expertise of your current board and management team our focus on executing our strategy of maximizing portfolio cash flows delivering value with new loan originations and business processing solutions and our unwavering commitment to improving operating efficiency and optimizing capital allocation we believe the board s nominees are best positioned to grow navient and its valuable assets and will drive greater value for all shareholders than canyon s nominees your board engaged with canyon in good faith regarding their attempt to acquire navient and acted in the best interests of all shareholders your board has listened carefully to canyon as we do to all shareholders last summer the board carefully evaluated canyon s recommended director candidates and added mr arnold to our board subsequently when canyon and platinum approached us regarding a potential acquisition of the company the board and management team engaged with them in good faith indeed the company provided canyon and platinum with substantial information and data over a four month period including nearly a terabyte of data containing anonymized loan level information regarding the portfolio of education loans owned by the company and the entire general ledger of the company the company also provided canyon and platinum with meaningful access to the board and management and invested over 2 000 hours of management time in support of canyon s and platinum s due diligence review of the company during that process canyon s financial advisor communicated an informal price range of 14 15 per share the board informed canyon s financial advisor that this price range was low however we continued to support canyon s and platinum s due diligence review under the assumption that they would value the company above that range and provide details on the key financing litigation and regulatory issues items that your board determined were crucial to any evaluation canyon s highly conditional 12 50 per share proposal substantially undervalued navient surprisingly canyon and platinum subsequently sent a highly opportunistic low premium proposal with a price of 12 50 per share this dramatically undervalued navient and was an attempt to take advantage of the overall decline in the stock market at the end of 2018 indeed the price represented a premium of only 6 6 over the closing stock price on february 15 2019 and a discount of 2 8 to the one year vwap of 12 86 per share the initial proposal did not include any explanation of why the price was significantly lower than the 14 15 per share range that had been previously communicated to the company at no time have canyon and platinum provided any substantive information on what additional due diligence or other conditions would enable them to get to a price above this range as such after careful review and consideration in consultation with our financial and legal advisors the members of the board one of whom was recommended by canyon unanimously rejected canyon s proposal canyon s proposal had substantial deficiencies with no commitments to resolution in addition to having an unacceptably low price canyon s proposal did not meet the criteria of a bona fide proposal that was fully financed and appropriately addressed the outstanding issues that were continuously raised by the board and management since the start of the engagement in fact canyon repeatedly evaded direct questions relating to their due diligence review and how their proposal would be de risked including how canyon and platinum would address the change of control provisions in the company s outstanding unsecured debt how they would address the liquidity needs associated with our warehouse financing facilities or whether their proposal would be contingent on addressing the litigation and regulatory matters the company is facing these deficiencies raised serious questions about both the credibility of the bidders and their true understanding of navient and our business however the full navient board met with canyon and their advisors regarding the proposal opting to remain committed to shareholder engagement at this meeting canyon abruptly notified the company that they were withdrawing their proposal and indicated their intention to nominate a slate of directors for election at the annual meeting navient s highly qualified independent and refreshed board is committed and best qualified to execute the strategy to drive value creation for all navient shareholders navient s world class independent and continuously refreshed board has been instrumental in the development and execution of navient s strategy and has extensive experience in financial services and higher education the board is comprised of business leaders with expertise in operations m a investments information security and regulatory matters along with track records of transforming companies and creating substantial value since 2014 we have added seven new board members with two new directors added since 2017 and have implemented a mandatory retirement age and tenure limits for directors which have given you as shareholders

policies in 2018 our board was recognized by the forum of executive women as a champion of board diversity among philadelphia area companies and in 2015 received the award for best board diversity initiative at the nyse s governance risk and compliance leadership awards our highly qualified and diverse board is well positioned to oversee the continued successful execution of navient s strategy vote the enclosed white proxy card today and discard the gold proxy card in order to block canyon s substantially undervalued proposal we strongly urge you to vote to re elect navient s entire slate

revenue growth on a gross basis continues to increase climbing to its highest point in 2 5 years reflecting our strong operational domestic leasing activity over the last year domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenues signed up during the quarter was again very solid in the first quarter this quarter we saw a bit of a shift back in favor of amendments with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming about 68 from amendments and 32 from new leases we continue to see contributions from each of the big four carriers the big four carriers represented 82 of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter we also again had a nice contribution to our domestic operational leasing activity from dish who continues to be active executing new lease agreements while we executed a lot of new business in the quarter our domestic backlog continues to restock itself as our customers remain active giving us confidence for the remainder of the year internationally on a constant currency basis same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 9 8 including 0 5 of churn or 10 3 on a gross basis gross same tower organic growth in

from brazil with brazil representing 12 3 of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8 9 of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass through expenses with regard to first quarter churn we continue to see churn from leases with metro leap and clearwire consistent with our expectations as of quarter end we have approximately 9 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with metro leap and clearwire that we ultimately expect to turn off over the next two years also as mentioned on our last earnings call in the fourth quarter we incurred approximately 6 million of annualized churn from certain legacy iden related leases the impact of which will affect our reported same tower churn results for the first three quarters of 2019 domestic churn in the first quarter from all other tenants on an annual same tower basis was 1 3 tower cash flow for the first quarter was 362 9 million our industry leading domestic tower cash flow margin increased to 83 5 in the quarter international tower cash flow margin increased to 69 2 and was 90 excluding the impact of pass through reimbursable expenses adjusted ebitda in the first quarter was 345 6 million our

first quarter of 2018 driving almost twice as much services gross profit as a year ago period our adjusted ebitda margin was 70 4 in the quarter the same as the year earlier period notwithstanding the larger contribution from our services business excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses adjusted ebitda margin was 74 9 approximately 97 of our total adjusted ebitda was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter affo in the first quarter was 236 1 million affo per share was 2 07 an increase of 11 9 over the first quarter of 2018 or 14 6 on a constant currency basis during the first quarter in accordance with the oi reorganization plan approved by the brazilian courts we received a payment of brl11 2 million which represents a partial recovery of pre petition obligations owed to sba from oi net of costs we incurred in connection with this bankruptcy process the u s dollar recovery during the quarter was 2 3 million which resulted in a partial recovery of our allowance for doubtful accounts we recorded this amount as an offset to bad debt expense within selling general and administrative expenses as a result this recovery positively impacted adjusted ebitda and affo by 2 3 million and affo per share by 0 03 the reorganization plan calls for additional payments of pre petition receivables to be made by oi over the next three years we will record these payments in a similar manner as they are received no additional payments are due under this plan during 2019 during the first quarter we continue to invest in expanding our tower portfolio acquiring 54 communication sites for 36 1 million and building 72 sites most of the added sites were located internationally as of today we have under contract for acquisition and anticipate closing by the end of the third quarter on 256 additional sites at an aggregate price of 123 9 million we also continue to invest in the land under our sites which provides both strategic and financial benefits during the quarter we spent an aggregate of 15 4 million to buy land and easements and to extend groundlease terms at the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71 of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is approximately 36 years in today s earnings press release we included our updated outlook for full year 2019 we have increased our outlook across the board we anticipate increases in site leasing due to both organic and inorganic growth increases in organic growth are primarily due to earlier average timing of rental commencements in large part as a result of a higher concentration of leasing activity coming from amendments versus new leases the increase in our anticipated leasing results is being partially offset by incremental negative changes in our foreign currency rate assumptions for the remainder of the year primarily in brazil the changes in these currency assumptions negatively impacted our outlook for site leasing revenue by 4 5 million tower cash flow by 3 million and adjusted ebitda and affo by 2 7 million we also anticipate incremental contributions to our results from our services business due to our strong q1 performance and our healthy backlogs however our full year 2019 services guidance still contemplates a slowdown in the second half of the year due to the sprint t mobile transaction the balance of our outlook for affo has also been improved for anticipated better results in net cash interest expense and non discretionary capex offset by slightly higher tax expectations finally our outlook for affo per share has also been negatively impacted by about 0 04 due to a change in our assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares for the year of 114 9 million which assumption is influenced in part by increases in our current and estimated future share prices we re very pleased with how the year has started and are optimistic about the rest of 2019 i ll now turn things over to mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet mark derussy vice president of finance thank you brendan sba entered the first quarter with 9 7 billion of net debt and our net debt to annualized adjusted ebitda leverage ratio was seven times at the low end of our targeted range of 7 to 7 5 times our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda the net cash interest expense was 3 6 times the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3 9 and our weighted average maturity is approximately four years as of today we have 50 million outstanding under our 1 25 billion committed revolver as mentioned on our last earnings call during the first quarter we entered into a four year 1 2 billion interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest expense at 4 49 on approximately half our outstanding 2018 term loan b as a result of this transaction approximately 88 of our non revolver debt outstanding is fixed the company did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the two months since our last earnings call stock repurchases however are still an integral part of our strategy as of today we have 204 5 million of authorization remaining under our 1 billion stock repurchase plan the company s shares outstanding at march 31 2019 are 113 2 million which is down 2 8 on 116 5 million at march 31 2018 with that i ll now turn the call over to jeff jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer thanks mark and good evening everyone our first quarter was about a simple straightforward and solid as we could have hoped for we exceeded our expectations across all financial metrics we continued to see healthy operational leasing activity and our services business again had another very strong quarter while it has only been two months since our last earnings call we feel like a lot has happened particularly around improved clarity to the remainder of 2019 as a result we are able to increase our full year outlook domestically the strong operational leasing activity we saw in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter of 2019 all four major u s wireless carriers were active during the quarter to varying degrees with particular increases in new technology and capacity related upgrades pushing our amendment business to the highest quarterly contribution in over a year we also saw continued contributions from dish who remains busy with their phase 1 network buildout our leasing application backlogs remain very strong giving us confidence and continued steady lease up results in q2 and beyond internationally we also had another solid leasing quarter with steady contributions across all of our markets led once again by brazil the contractual revenues signed up during this quarter and our international markets came about 48 from new leases and 52 from amendments though continues to be very balanced between coverage builds and technology upgrades similar to last quarter we had solid contributions from all four major wireless carriers in brazil although the currency has continued to weaken a little bit operationally we remain on target for strong growth in brazil once again this year or as brendan mentioned earlier but for the weakening of the currency our 2019 outlook would have been increased even more we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that exist throughout all of our international markets during the first quarter we spent limited amounts of discretionary capital on new asset additions and no capital on share repurchases in the two months since our last earnings call as a result we saw our leverage quickly drop to the low end of our target leverage range at 7 0 times this drop in leverage in one quarter demonstrates how quickly we can organically deliver and the flexibility that exists within our capital structure we do expect investment to increase through the remainder of 2019 we are still committed to growing our portfolio 5 to 10 this year through disciplined acquisitions and new builds we of course focus on growing our portfolio throughout our existing markets but we also regularly explore opportunities in other markets our focus has always been and continues to be on finding accretive tower opportunities to create shareholder value and frankly avoiding those that do not we believe we are very good at this and we will continue to maintain it as a key component of our strategy in addition stock repurchases will also remain an important part for value proposition we have always been opportunistic around repurchases and did not have any of the market dislocations we typically look for in stock repurchases so we did not repurchase any shares in the last two months but our desire to repurchase shares under the right circumstances hasn t changed i m confident that we will have a nice mix of both quality portfolio additions and share repurchases throughout 2019 our capital structure continues to be one of our greatest assets we have significant liquidity and tremendous access to sizable incremental capital across a diverse set of financing markets our capital structure and industry leading affo per share affords us great flexibility to use our resources to drive shareholder value in a variety of ways in addition to tower investments and share repurchases we continue to explore and pursue new business initiatives related to our existing businesses these initiatives are not material today but we are excited about the potential for the opportunities we are currently exploring we re off to a good start in 2019 and are operationally performing at a very high level this year we celebrate two anniversaries 30 years in business and 20 years as a public company we are within striking distance of two important milestones 30 000 sites and 2 billion in revenue i m very excited about what the future holds for sba i d like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success and with that laurie we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question from the line of simon flannery with morgan stanley please go ahead simon flannery morgan stanley analyst great thanks very much thanks for the commentary on the balance sheet and the buybacks where do you draw the line on your leverage if you didn t have an opportunity to do buybacks or a lot more m a would you be prepared to let the leverage drop down into the high sixes or would you want to keep it in that 7 to 7 5 range i mean if you could just provide a little bit more color on the services strength very strong you re talking about it potentially slowing down there but what was behind that strength this quarter thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well ideally we do want to keep it in the 7 to 7 5 times range simon but we don t want to spend money just for the sake of spending money either and what we have not yet implemented is kind of a mechanical stock repurchase program that would be implemented just for the sake of maintaining leverage we re hesitant to do that because we haven t had to do that frankly we ve always had the opportunity to be opportunistic around stock repurchases and we d like to continue to believe that will be afforded to us by the market in terms of the services business we do work for all the carriers but one of the including a fair amount of work for sprint and as we noted in the press release as brendan said in his comments we had to take a position on sprint t mobile transaction so while we expect to continue to do a lot of work right up through the end of the second quarter at least with respect to sprint on the services side we re taking the position that the deal ends or the deal gets approved rather and that there is no more sprint as of june 30th now whether that happens or not we of course don t really know but we had to take a position for purposes of guidance but the services business is very very busy right now and that has rolled into the second quarter and that of course the combination of what we did in the first quarter and where we see things today in the second quarter was the reason we were able to move the full year outlook up simon flannery morgan stanley analyst i mean is this related to 5g rollout or talk about kind of brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer well it s i mean not all the customers that we re doing business for really on the 5g trail so it s really a mix of everything it s just a high level of activity which is really what s also behind our leasing business simon flannery morgan stanley analyst great thank you operator and we ll go to john atkin with rbc please go ahead jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst yes so a couple of questions one i was wondering as you look at the international business how do you think about kind of the longer term growth rate and are there any potential needle movers to call out ex brazil and then secondly was interested in kind of any update on edge computing any opportunity that you see there perhaps that s tied in with small cells or not but what are your current thoughts on that thank you jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah some of the international markets jon are ahead of brazil slightly now some are lagging but the issue really is that brazil is so much bigger than frankly any of our other markets the thing that gives us confidence around all of the markets is they are well behind the u s in terms of their technology upgrades there is still a lot of 3g work being done in some of these markets let alone 4g and in some cases no 5g whatsoever so we do think that there will be a lot of work in the future coming out of these markets obviously there has to be an economy and an ecosystem to pay for all that and just by carrier expenditures but we do think that just as in the u s that will will be the case in terms of the mobile edge computing we continue to take the steps to prepare ourselves for the day when there will be material revenue opportunities that come from that we continue to believe that that they will come i can t tell you when that they will be we ve had some good traction with the one deployment that we working on with packet ph about site of gillette stadium the number of folks who have come through packet to deploy in that facility a lot of discussions going on but in terms of actual material revenue production i think we re still we re still a bit a ways away it s certainly not going to come in 2019 jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst okay and then you mentioned the phase 1 build out and the leasing that you continue to see there is equipment actually going up jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer absolutely jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst and then lastly the ground buyback activity is there any weight i don t think there is but i just thought i checked is there any way to kind of ramp that if you wanted to around the ground lease repurchases jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer no we have plenty of capital to spend in that that business has always really been governed more by the particular situation of the seller these are these are all individuals who might say no three different times and then say yes on the fourth time so it s we tried to do that it s really not it s not an operational issue as much as it is a seller desire issue jon that may sound a little crazy but after 15 years of pulling all the different levers that s kind of how it goes jonathan atkin rbc capital markets analyst great thank you very much operator we ll go to phil cusick with j p morgan please go ahead phil cusick j p morgan analyst hey guys a couple of follow ups and a new one first on the dish contribution should we think of that as a bigger part of the services business today and is that ramping through the year jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer it s a part of the services business i don t know if it s a bigger part of the services but yeah it s been a small part of our services business it may increase as the year goes on as a percentage of services but i don t think it s so big that it makes a huge difference brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s not the reason it went from the fourth quarter number to the first quarter number jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer right phil cusick j p morgan analyst okay and then on the deleverage side nobody has mentioned a dividend yet but you ve talked about doing that within the next couple of years if the share stay at this level or somewhere around here does it make sense to pull that forward as a way to maintain leverage rather than buying back stock brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean it could be something to add to the list of things to look at phil cusick j p morgan analyst right if buybacks aren t as accretive as they used to be maybe the dividend instead or is that does the dividend timing is it driven more by the size of nol you want to maintain over time or could that be jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer we ve always only talked about the dividend in terms of when we first had to start paying it phil cusick j p morgan analyst right which is 21 you ve talked about brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer correct phil cusick j p morgan analyst so pulling that forward especially if the share price isn t accretive jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer that s a must ph that is a possibility that is available to us phil cusick j p morgan analyst got it and then last one you ve talked in the past about a little bit of competitive churn at t and t mobile both have guys who are working on some new builds for them to overbuild you and your peers any shift in the pace of that positive or negative jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer no changes really there phil cusick j p morgan analyst okay thanks guys operator we ll go to michael rollins with citi please go ahead michael rollins citigroup analyst hi thanks for taking the questions first one if i could on one of the slides you provided an update on return on invested capital which is about 10 3 at the end of the first quarter how does that compare between the domestic business and the international business and how do you think about current valuations for assets relative to your return objectives thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah it s higher domestically mostly due to just obviously the maturity of that we ve had those assets for so long and we haven t decided to give those numbers out because it s a little bit immature from an international standpoint but that s something we ll consider breaking down in the future but higher domestically just because the international stuff is less mature brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer although some countries it s higher there are individual countries where it has the highest return on invested capital jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah michael rollins citigroup analyst and is the jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah you got to clearly think about those things mike in terms of current pricing versus price matters absolutely michael rollins citigroup analyst and in terms of what you re seeing out there is just getting tougher or is it getting easier in terms of the opportunities for asset purchases jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well i wouldn t say it s getting easier i mean it s there is a lot of capital and it is price competitive you have to be very patient and you have to look hard and you have to be knowledgeable about the wheat and the chaff michael rollins citigroup analyst thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer laurie i think we re ready for another question operator very good thank you we ll go to rick prentiss raymond james please go ahead richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst thanks good afternoon guys jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer hi rick richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst hey follow up on a couple of previous questions simon was asking on the leverage side and you talked about the portfolio it looks like the portfolio growth in the first quarter was probably less than 1 and even if we add in the sites under contract through end of third quarter still kind of in the 1 plus percent range so are you seeing some bigger transactions out there that could get into the target zone of 5 to 10 portfolios given that the answer to mike there was that prices are getting tougher jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer we think that there will be some opportunities along those lines yes richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst and you kind of alluded to that maybe some new markets might be popping onto the screen jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer no i don t think i said that i think we say we d like to stay in our existing markets but we ll look we ll look everywhere that it makes sense to look richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst that s good and then with phil s question on the leverage and the dividend have you thought about kind of what that payout ratio of affo might look like crown when they convert and start paying dividend kind of with the full payment american tower has kind of been in that we re going to grow it for a long time which way should we think about you guys looking at the when the dividend day does come what the path might look like brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer little latter richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst the more like american towers kind of keep it growing jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yes richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst okay and then last one for me on the leverage as we think about 19 and 20 and 21 where does leverage need to go as you start looking to pay a dividend jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer doesn t have to go much lower than it is right now we ve talked about something with a six handle on it richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst all right i did have one other i apologize amendment versus colo you talked about how amendments had gone to about 68 of new revenue and colors with 32 if you get a customer who comes in who s already a customer on your tower and they want to put more equipment on the tower but a different rad center is that a new co location or is that an amendment jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer depends on whether they bring it under their existing contract in which event it would be an amendment or a brand new contract in which event it would be a lease richard h prentiss raymond james associates analyst and just hypothetically say a first net type project with at t is that going to be seen more as an amendment activity i m just trying to think of how we re gauging what s the base of business coming in if it s under the existing contract it s an amendment if it s a new contract it s a lease yeah that helps okay thanks jeff operator and we ll go to walter piecyk with btig please go ahead walter piecyk btig analyst thanks domestically your amendment to colo growth is accelerated for the last five quarters i guess or so yes looks like five jeff is that going to happen throughout 2019 just sequential accelerations in that annual growth rate for the amendments of colos and escalations i guess just your gross growth the 7 5 number you reported this quarter i don t know what you call it jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer are you talking about the growth rate or the rate of amendments to colos walter piecyk btig analyst i m talking about the 7 5 which i call a growth rate every company calls it i think something different so jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah the answer is yes well because if you look at the if you look at the revenue bridge for the domestic it implies obviously a higher full year number and given where we are it has to increase throughout the year so we would expect it to increase each quarter walter piecyk btig analyst and then jeff you had mentioned that your guidance or assumes that the sprint t mobile deal is approved so if it s not approved does that mean those numbers are higher or lower jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well we don t no i mean we ll have to see what comes i mean it s hard to we don t really know what the what the plan b is if there is one walter piecyk btig analyst got you so it s possible it could be lower than if plan b is jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well i don t know no i don t think so because right now our guidance assumes that basically there is nothing else from sprint walter piecyk btig analyst got it jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it s really two if you look at the two pieces it services where there is an impact we assume that that s slower in the second half of the year because there is really nothing from sprint i don t think that could be lower question is whether it really would be higher if the deal didn t happen and we re not sure about that and on the leasing side there is probably very little impact because any slowdown that might occur or increase that might occur if the deal doesn t happen in either case it s not going to impact this year s numbers too much walter piecyk btig analyst got it last question i mean i don t know if you re planning on putting up like an 8 dividend yield but i guess just generally speaking if you re not willing to buy stock why should investors be buying your stock right now brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer walt it s only been two months since our last call i didn t say they re not willing to buy our stock i said as we move through the year i m confident we re going to invest our capital in towers and stock walter piecyk btig analyst got you i just see my i think the response to phil s question was like you think the stock you re not getting accretion i mean those are phil s words not yours but whatever that the stock is at a level that your dividends are preferential but i mean i m just not sure jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer those were do you want walter piecyk btig analyst okay jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer you have phil s phone number give him a call walter piecyk btig analyst absolutely all right thanks operator we ll go to nick del deo with moffettnathanson please go ahead nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst hey thanks for taking my question would you consider a one time dividend rejigger a leverage in between now and when your nols run out or would you only pay a dividend if it was the start of a recurring one jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer i don t see the wisdom of a one timer nick but if i m missing something help us figure it out but i don t see any benefit in that nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst no that s certainly fair you re going back to the issue of land how much higher do you think you can push it from the current 71 where does that top out and what s the split between land that you own or control under perpetual easement versus the long term lease brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer we own roughly 30 35 of the land either in the form of a long term or perpetual easement or have outright ownership in terms of it going higher the interesting thing about that it can certainly continue to move higher and we have moved it higher over the years but as you bring in some of the international stuff sometimes it comes in with lower numbers so it kind of resets it and that s statistic is controlling for at least 20 years the funny thing is you always have those that are on the border of that every year that goes by it s a year less for some of those some of them fall below it so you re constantly having to kind of extend your way out of it so that s a long way of saying it can go a little bit higher but you know it s hard to move that number materially when you got 30 000 sites nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst you find you find their repurchase overseas to be interesting brazil you typically have the inaudible around that makes it less appealing jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer we do whether it s a purchase or an extension or an easement or some other type of longer term entitlement the concept still applies and we do find it interesting and beneficial it s little more difficult because the real estate laws are not in every case as clear as they are in the us nicholas del deo moffettnathanson analyst okay got it thanks guys operator and we ll go next to david barden with bank of america please go ahead david barden bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thanks for your squeezing me in the two questions one was the kind of core domestic churn non iden non metro leap and clear is about 1 3 it s almost double over the last year i know you talked about this a little bit brendan i think last quarter but it s up another 20 bps i wanted if you could kind of speak to like where is this going the shape of it the drivers of it and does it kind of normalize it at some point in time and then the second question was if i m reading it right it looks like the and i m sorry to ask such a detailed question but the guide appears to have like a 10 million improvement in other costs which is helping kind of drive the income line of the margins i was wondering if you can kind of just speak to that please thanks brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer okay on the first one which is the churn it has increased a little bit some of that is non big 4 related we have certain customers that we ve had churn off it s also a trailing 12 month number my expectation is that it probably will be slightly higher later in the year but i think it ll probably come down then slightly thereafter but our range as we ve talked about historically is 1 to 1 5 for that kind of base churn and i think longer term that s the right range for that number we re sort of right in the middle of it right now on a second question david frame a little bit i m not 100 sure which 10 million you re referring to david barden bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i m sorry it s in the brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer you want me we re happy to get on the phone with you afterwards so we can get if there is a specific number we can david barden bank of america merrill lynch analyst no it just went from 10 to 15 to 1 to 6 million and that was the question but we can take it offline appreciate it thank you brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer okay we ll go to spencer kurn with new street research your line is open spencer kurn new street research analyst hey guys thanks so i just wanted to follow up on the question around organic growth and domestically accelerating for the rest of the year as implied in your guidance you just provide a little bit more color on the cadence i know you ve got you posted really high growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 but it also sounds like you expected growth to increase every quarter throughout the year so any color you can provide on that would be really helpful brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i can t say exactly what the number will be each quarter obviously because there is certain uncertainties as you move through the year but based on the backlog what we ve signed up to date and what we expect to sign up we make certain assumptions around timing and most of the stuff that s been signed up we already know the timing so we re pretty confident when we look out at what s scheduled to commence that will have an increase in those numbers as we move through the year and as you as you noted the full year number that s on the bridge sort of suggests that the number at the end of the year or for the full year i should say is 7 9 so if we re 7 5 in the first quarter we get to close to 7 9 as an average obviously it s got to step up 20 30 basis points each quarter roughly jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer on average brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on average jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer not necessarily each once spencer kurn new street research analyst well that s sort of my question are you will we like thinking like the end of the year you actually got a higher rate than the average or some sort of a bell curve overall like trend that we should expect brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would expect it will be above the average by the end of the year spencer kurn new street research analyst awesome and then just one quick follow up i may your first net is over 50 done and the company is expecting to be they expecting to be around 60 by the third quarter are you seeing a similar progress of work being done on your sides or is there sort of a lag or any difference from your perspective of what you re seeing thanks jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer you know that s hard to answer spencer because not every amendment that comes out of at t is firstnet they re doing a variety of all kinds of different work involving all kinds of different pieces of their spectrum and in some cases doing first work and then coming back and do another work so i mean that sounds about right it could be a little bit less i would doubt it s any more than that spencer kurn new street research analyst got it thanks so much operator we ll go to brett feldman with goldman sachs please go ahead brett feldman goldman sachs analyst yeah two questions the first one is pretty quick the oi recovery you received in the quarter was that factored into your original outlook or is that among the reasons why you increased your outlook for the year and then more interesting and maybe i didn t hear it right but i think you said 82 of your domestic leasing activity was big four so i guess that would mean 18 was non big four which seems like a big number and i m curious of that if i heard it correctly was that predominantly dish driven or is there more interesting story in there jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah on the first one the oi recovery was not in our original outlook so that was part of the increase specifically to ebitda and affo it didn t affect the lines above that and the 82 yeah a big the biggest component of the non big four piece was dish brett feldman goldman sachs analyst is there anything else in there of the non dish part that s ramping and you ve got nash ph in the past about non traditional inaudible eclectic mix you ve normally had jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer same eclectic mix and that story was the set was the same as last quarter brett feldman goldman sachs analyst got it thank you i appreciate it operator we have a question from colby synesael with cowen and company please go ahead colby synesael cowen and company analyst great thanks two if i may when you think of the big four u s carriers i think the view has then that the predominant amount of growth has been coming not just for sba but for the sector from the t mobile as part of the 600 build out and then also at t with firstnet and then verizon has slowed its pacing although still material in terms of contributing to growth net sprint really has for the most part gone away i m just curious if you agree with how i just characterized it and then secondly i guess more of a modeling question for brandon you raised your affo guidance by what is it 0 7 on the low end and 0 3 on the high end i guess just what is it on the high end that didn t allow you to take it up by the same amount i thought i heard on the call you mentioned something about the price of the stock being higher and that having an impact and i m just curious how how we might try to think about that thanks brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on a second one it s really more about taxes it s just about where we range the taxes the share count piece affects both ends of the range the same because we re using the same number of shares as our assumption it just negatively impacted the overall number because we assumed a higher diluted share count but it s really we kind of moved our own thoughts about where our taxes will be more on the low end so that s the only difference jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah and on the on the activity levels i mean there is activity from all big four colby so i don t think we agree with that description particularly as it relates to sprint not doing anything right now i mean that s just not true as it relates to us on both the leasing and the services side colby synesael cowen and company analyst yeah thank you operator and next we go to matthew niknam with deutsche bank please go ahead matthew niknam with deutsche bank analyst hey guys thank you for taking the question brendan i think there was a mention of the guidance increase for this year being tied to more amendments relative to colo or maybe an earlier sort of commencement was that the entirety of the guidance increase or is there sort of a broader core increase underlying that beyond just sort of timing and then just on the amendments any color you can provide in terms of the pricing on these amendments thanks brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on the guidance that the leasing revenue increase the organic piece of it and the best way to kind of look at it matt is to look at the bridge that s in the supplemental package and you can look at the changes relative to last time that we provided you ll see that the lease up number went up about 3 million most of that was due to faster timing which is due to a little bit heavier concentration of amendments there were other reasons that our revenue guidance went up though those included some non organic contributions as we put some additional sites under contract that will help contribute in a couple of other minor changes but those are the two biggest pieces matthew niknam with deutsche bank analyst i m sorry what was the second one jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer just in terms of pricing on amendment yeah brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer amendment pricing continues to hold in very firmly we re certainly not seeing any weakening there matthew niknam with deutsche bank analyst thank you operator we ll go next to batya levi with ubs please go ahead batya levi ubs analyst great thank you was the increase in discretionary capex all related to the acquisitions you have announced or are you finding more opportunities to build incremental sites and also as a carrier start to gradually build some of their sites on their own what do you think is driving that and can you allude some of that activity back to your portfolio brendan t cavanagh executive vice president and chief financial officer on the capex it s basically all m a related there is a couple of minor little things but it s not there is really been no change in the overall expectations around new builds for the year jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer yeah on the carrier building sites on their own we have seen that in some very limited circumstances i think some of that is for sites that the carriers view is very strategic as opposed to capital driven because there is plenty of capital chase in that and i don t know about it will ever be able to move that back given what we see is some very uneconomic new build terms which actually is the explanation why we just don t build as many towers in the us as we used to batya levi ubs analyst okay thanks operator and a question from amy yong with macquarie please go ahead amy yong macquarie analyst thanks i was wondering if you can update us on the customer activity in brazil and with the spectrum auction happening i think in the back half of this year or 2020 should we anticipate an increased activity on acceleration in the region thank you jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well the customers are be similar story to the u s they re all active but to varying degrees and certainly with new spectrum there will come new opportunities for us in the form certainly of amendments and hopefully new co locations as well so we always welcome new spectrum it s not millimeter wave spectrum which of course has a much different use this will be macro tower oriented spectrum so we hope it goes through as planned and we would expect certainly to benefit from that amy yong macquarie analyst thank you operator operator instructions we ll go to robert gutman with guggenheim please go ahead robert gutman guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question looking at it sort of a bigger picture view the drivers that are underlying the current acceleration in leasing activity how far out do you think these carry in terms of now looking for next year s guidance but does the current strong pace of activity sort of dry it out looking next year is the reason we believe that it s still early in terms of where the carriers are in terms of what they re doing jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer well it seems early in the sense that there is still a lot to do in terms of building out the 4g and then if you believe the inaudible and the technicians for everyone to have a truly vibrant 5g product they re all going to need to deploy some kind of massive mimo architecture and that hasn t even really started yet so they ve got a long way to go robert gutman guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you operator we have no additional questions at this time so please continue jeffrey a stoops director president and chief executive officer i want to thank everyone for

highlights financial statements and selected operating data a both financial and statistical results include the operating results of divested hospitals through the effective closing date of each respective divestiture same store operating results and statistical information exclude the results of the hospitals divested or closed in 2018 and during the three months ended march 31 2019 there were no discontinued operations reported for 2018 and the three months ended march 31 2019 b the following table provides information needed to calculate loss per share which is adjusted for income attributable to noncontrolling interests in millions three months ended march 31 2019 2018 net loss attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders net loss 101 6 less income attributable to noncontrolling interests net of taxes 17 19 net loss attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders basic and diluted 118 25 c ebitda is a non gaap financial measure which consists of net loss attributable to community health systems inc before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda also a non gaap financial measure is ebitda adjusted to add back net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude the effect of discontinued operations loss gain from early extinguishment of debt impairment and gain loss on sale of businesses expense incurred related to the sale of a majority ownership interest in the company s home care division expense income related to government and other legal settlements and related costs expense related to employee termination benefits and other restructuring charges expense income from settlement and fair value adjustments on the cvr agreement liability related to the hma legal proceedings and related legal expenses and the overall impact of the change in estimate related to net patient revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the increase in contractual allowances and the provision for bad debts the company has from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of its subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions the company believes that it is useful to present adjusted ebitda because it adds back the portion of ebitda attributable to these third party interests and clarifies for investors the company s portion of ebitda generated by continuing operations the company reports adjusted ebitda as a measure of financial performance adjusted ebitda is a key measure used by management to assess the operating performance of the company s hospital operations and to make decisions on the allocation of resources adjusted ebitda is also used to evaluate the performance of the company s executive management team and is one of the primary targets used to determine short term cash incentive compensation in addition management utilizes adjusted ebitda in assessing the company s consolidated results of operations and operational performance and in comparing the company s results of operations between periods the company believes it is useful to provide investors and other users of the company s financial statements this performance measure to align with how management assesses the company s results of operations adjusted ebitda also is comparable to a similar metric called consolidated ebitda as defined in the company s senior secured credit facility which is a key component in the determination of the company s compliance with some of the covenants under the company s senior secured credit facility including the company s ability to service debt and incur capital expenditures and is used to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the senior secured credit facility although adjusted ebitda does not include all of the adjustments described in the senior secured credit facility adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under u s gaap it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income operating income or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with u s gaap the items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance the company believes such adjustments are appropriate as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance additionally this calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies footnotes to financial highlights financial statements and selected operating data continued the following table reflects the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda as defined to net loss attributable to community health systems inc stockholders as derived directly from the condensed consolidated financial statements in millions three months ended march 31 2019 2018 net loss attributable to community health systems inc stockholders 118 25 adjustments provision for benefit from income taxes 7 7 depreciation and amortization

diluted weighted average number of shares in millions three months ended march 31 2019 2018 weighted average number of shares outstanding basic 113 112 add effect of dilutive securities stock awards and options weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted 113 112 the company generated a net loss attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders for the three months ended march 31 2019 and 2018 so the effect of dilutive securities is not considered because their effect would be antidilutive if the company had generated net income the effect of restricted stock awards on the diluted shares calculation would have been an increase of 59 261 shares and 73 361 shares during the three months ended march 31 2019 and 2018 respectively footnotes to financial highlights financial statements and selected operating data continued e the following supplemental table reconciles net loss attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders as reported on a per share diluted basis to net loss income attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders per share diluted with the adjustments described herein total per share amounts may not add due to rounding the company believes that the presentation of non gaap adjusted net loss income attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders per share diluted presents useful information to investors by highlighting the impact on net loss income attributable to community health systems inc common stockholders per share diluted of selected items used in calculating adjusted ebitda which may not reflect the company s underlying operating performance and assisting in comparing the company s results of operations between periods three months ended march 31 2019 2018 net

ratio of first lien net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined to less than or equal to 5 25 to 1 00 we were in compliance with all such covenants at march 31 2019 with a first lien net debt to consolidated ebitda leverage ratio of approximately 4 98 to 1 00 i on january 1 2019 the company adopted the new lease accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and codified in the fasb accounting standards codification asc as topic 842 asc 842 the lease standard in asc 842 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet with a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability and classified as either finance or operating leases which will impact the manner and timing of expense recognition of such leases over the lease term immaterial leases and leases with an initial lease term 12 months or less are excluded from recognition on the balance sheet upon adoption the company recorded operating lease liabilities and the related right of use assets of approximately 673 million the operating lease right of use assets are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as a component of other assets net the company elected to adopt the modified transition method allowed by the fasb by electing not to recast prior comparative periods upon adoption as a result no changes were made to the condensed consolidated statement of loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 or the condensed consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018 regulation fd disclosure set forth below is selected information concerning the company s
