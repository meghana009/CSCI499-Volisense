i don t even know where to start the coronavirus has spread outside of china more and more companies are lowering guidance for q1 economists are forecasting central bank rate cuts as the global economy grinds to a halt global stock markets are melting down 10 15 from all time highs many of the highs hit less than 2 weeks ago this past week dax 12 3 ftse 10 8 s p 500 12 this has caused the vix to spike 139 190 at one point us 10 year yields and us 30 year yields put in all time new lows at 1 114 and 1 653 respectively on friday the world health organization who raised the global risk for the coronavirus from high to very high whatever that means as stock markets came off the carry trade has been unwinding the idea behind a carry trade is that when a currency has a low yield traders borrow money from the lower yielding currency such as euros and buy stronger riskier yielding assets such as stocks or the mexican peso however when the stock market falls these traders must sell stocks and buy back or pay back the currency it borrowed such as the euro this is most likely why eur mxn is up 6 5 the ecb has rates set at 0 5 while the bank of mexico has recently cut rates to 7 because of the unwinding of the carry trade eur usd is up 1 6 from near 1 0800 to near 1 1050 this week for a currency pair that has traditionally moved with stocks this is a large move relatively speaking the australian dollar and new zealand dollar have been hit this week as their economies are closely aligned with chinas new zealand also reported its first case of the coronavirus on friday aud usd and nzd usd are both down 1 5 this week in an unrelated note eur gbp is up over 3 this week but this has more to do with uk eu trade negotiations than it does with the coronavirus the flight to safety was in full effect this week as japanese officials halted their buying of euros and us dollars and let the yen gain usd jpy was down 3 3 this week this could have been a much larger loss had it not been for the gpif japan s largest pension fund on the bid earlier in the week allegedly but what happened to precious metals someone forgot to give gold and silver the memo that this was a risk off week spot gold is down 3 6 on the week and silver is down 10 26 both assets put in bearish engulfing weekly candles because of a lack of demand for oil crude oil has fallen over 16 this week and

murphy group finance director good morning ladies and gentlemen you re all very welcome to the 2019 results presentation for crh and that welcome includes all of you who are here in the room with us

thee division presidents randy lake americas materials onne van der weijde europe materials keith haas building products we re also joined by david dillon president strategy and development for the group as you can see albert manifold our chief executive is not here on stage this morning albert had plan to be here as usual but he had an orthopedic procedure earlier in the week and as you would expect his doctors have advised him not to fly this week albert will be listening in this morning and we will all see him back in the office next week i d like to just turn to the agenda in terms of the agenda set out for today what we d like to do is spend the next 35 to 40 minutes sharing with you a brief presentation of our results announcement this morning we d like to cover the trading performance we ve had over the last 12 months we d also like to share with you some key trends from our core markets in addition we d like to share with you some of the early indications we have in terms of our expectations for the year ahead we want to spend a little bit of time updating you on some of the strategic initiatives that we ve got going on across the group and as well we want to spend a bit of time talking to you about our sustainability ambitions and the how we can continue to further improve our sustainability credentials going forward and the role we can play in reducing the impact of construction on our environment at the end of the presentation there will be time for questions taking all of that into account it should take about an hour to run the entire presentation moving on to slide 2 and the key highlights from our announcement this morning 2019 has been another year of strong financial delivery across crh our quarter s earnings our ebitda are eur4 2 billion that s a 25 increase over last year or 7 ahead on a like for like basis we ve also had very strong cash performance our cash conversion of earnings is over 80 that strong cash conversion in addition to the proceeds that we have generated from our divestment activity has further strengthened our balance sheet and we end the year with a very strong balance sheet also included in our performance is that continued focus on business improvement it s now a well embedded practice across the group and we are focused on making our businesses better year on year driving incremental improvements that s best articulated through our margin performance in the last year our ebitda margin is 230 basis points ahead of last year or on a like for like basis were up 50 basis points in terms of progress we ve also increased the cash that we returned to shareholders during 2019 our ongoing share buyback program has delivered eur800 million back to shareholders we ve obviously launched the next tranche of that and we re well under way early in 2020 but we re also pleased to announce this morning that we are increasing our full year dividend by 15 that s a significant step up from prior years and that significant step up in the level of dividend is a reflection of the underlying sustainable strength of our profit and cash generation going forward active portfolio management is also a key part of our value creation 2019 has been a very busy year for us we generated over eur2 billion of proceeds from our divestment activity including the disposal of our europe distribution business and we reinvested over eur700 million of that back into small and medium size bolt on deals that would be value accretive for us into the future we also completed the disposal of our joint venture in india in december and that s a further reflection of our continued strategy to focus and simplify and narrow our focus going forward you ll also see this morning that we have announced new targets in terms of our carbon emission reductions out to 2030 the most demanding targets in this sector and those targets are based on the progress we ve made to date but also our ambition to continue to drive improvements across the sustainability agenda for our business but also for the environment that we all live in finally what you see announced this morning is we are changing our reporting currency to us dollars effective january of this year and we will talk about that later on moving on to slide 3 and looking at the key financial highlights in our announcement this morning 2019 was a good year of delivery and that s reflected in our financials sales earnings margin all well ahead of last year driven by strong organic growth good contribution from acquisitions accounting changes and also some currency tailwinds when you look at it on a like for like basis you can see that our sales and our ebitda are 3 and 7 ahead respectively and our margin is 50 basis points ahead on a like for like basis that margin improvement is a good indication of the progress we re making on our performance improvement journey across the business that performance improvement journey is also reflected in the strong like for like growth in our earnings per share up 25 over last year now for me as the finance director the number on this slide that i am most proud of is cash generation i know you ve heard that from me before but in 2019 we generated over eur3 5 billion of cash from our operations across the globe and that reflects over 80 of our earnings being converted into cash and that really strong cash performance has further strengthened our balance sheet and that stronger balance sheet gives us options as we go forward in terms of further value creation for our shareholders at this point i d like to turn into our divisional trading performance and we ll start with americas materials so i m going to ask randy to update you on the backdrop the market backdrop but also how his business has performed against that backdrop randy lake president americas materials thanks senan turning to slide 5 we continue to experience real favorable economic conditions in 2019 in the united states we saw 2 growth in gdp the labor markets continue to be strong with the addition of over 2 million jobs in 2019 i think what the encouraging thing is those macroeconomic trends really that momentum we re seeing make its way into construction activity where we have seen good underlying demand in all the markets that we serve turning to canada you would be familiar with our business there primarily in the eastern part of canada in ontario and quebec i d say those markets resemble very much like our northeastern u s markets characterized by good underlying demand and a nice pipeline of infrastructure projects i think it s important to remember that 50 of the materials business in north america is exposed to the infrastructure segment and that segment has been growing significantly year over year in fact in 2019 we saw a good step up in highway and street spend in the united states and if you look at those dollars spentm about 12 ahead of 2017 levels now that kind of underlying investment really couldn t take place without the engagements of states who ve really taken ownership of their infrastructure spend and again in 2019 we saw 46 states pass some sort of state and or local legislation to improve their underlying infrastructure and when you look at that we re combined what s happened over the last two to five years we re really beginning to see that transpire in terms of increased contract data and awards so it gives you a little bit of visibility as we go into 2020 turning to our trading performance on slide 6 i d have to say i m really proud of the team in 2019 we saw 4 like for like increase in sales driven by good underlying demand but really strong pricing discipline we saw improvements in our aggregate readymix and cement volumes year over year our asphalt volumes were broadly flat primarily due to the extensive flooding that took place in the central part of the united states during the first half of the year our commercial teams continue to be hard at work we delivered a 5 improvement in pricing in both our aggregate and asphalt line of business and the cement platform delivered a 4 pricing improvement year over year and just speaking of cement the ash grove business continues to perform very very well it has been fully integrated into our existing network still benefits from a lot of the global activities that we have taken place across the group our global procurement strategy and around category management and really the sharing of best practices from our european colleagues really boots on the ground from onne and his team have really allowed us to deliver ahead of expectations in regards to our synergies in 2019 puts us on a really nice path for 2020 and certainly in like with all crh companies the real intense focus on performance improvement driving operational efficiencies strong discipline in regards to cost management and despite some headwinds in 2019 in some areas of input costs the teams delivered a 10 improvement in underlying ebitda and i think as impressively or more impressively really an expansion of our margins on a like for like basis of 100 basis points so as we look to 2020 as you would be familiar with we have a rather large contracting business in north america one of the tenets or the features of that business is our backlogs gives us a little bit a view of the next six to 12 months of activity in regards to construction and good to see that those levels of backlog is very similar to what we were experiencing at the beginning of 19 so it gives us a lot of confidence as we go into 2020 in terms of underlying demand as well as some of our commercial opportunities so with that i ll turn the presentation over to onne to take you through european materials onne van der weijde president europe materials thank you randy and similar to you in the u s and europe we saw positive construction demand along all our key markets with one exception and that was the u k the political uncertainties in the u k for the last couple of years actually led to a decline in the infrastructure market and that is a more than 50 of our market segment so with the exception of that good construction amount in europe in 2019 the good news is that the new government in the u k has a strong commitment to infrastructure we have a new budget upcoming but there is already commitment to high speed two and tarmac our u k subsidiary is actually ideally situated to serve that demand because we have about 20 production sites be it quarries be it s a readymix plants be it precast plants all along the track and as a matter of fact we have been awarded preferred provider status for the readymix so good results there so i hope to see very progress there and i expect that the u k market will stabilize in 2020 and start to grow from there on also progress in western europe again in this time in infrastructure both france and ireland did well for example and we had good growth in eastern europe so all the way from poland to romania we saw very good demand in our eastern markets and i expect that to continue in 2020 and the early signs are that if i look at the first month and a few weeks continued good demand in our markets turning to trading performance good performance in 2019 as you can see on the slide we had a 5 like for like sales topline growth 2 ebitda growth and if you look at the margin there is actually two stories in that because mainland europe actually achieved a 50 basis points improvement and it is due to the challenging conditions in the u k that actually did make a swing from plus 50 to the 30 you see here on the page so that s an 80 basis point swing but it is actually a tale of two stories in europe pricing was ahead in all our markets on our cement categories we achieved a 5 increase and i remember a question last year there how many of the markets can you achieve of price increases well our long term goal is to get to 15 markets out of 15 and we achieved that in 2019 and all indications are good that we will continue the trend in 2020 as well and with that i would like to hand over to you keith keith haas president building products thank you onne if you look at our building products business in crh we are really geared and driven by the residential and non residential construction markets primarily in north america and in europe but we have a small and growing position in australia as well and if you look at the market backdrop similar to what you ve heard already in europe our major markets or the countries that drive most of our demand are germany the netherlands poland and the united kingdom and you take them together along with the other markets we compete in in europe there was a positive backdrop that continued to support the performance and the growth of our businesses in europe when we look at north america our biggest single market is the united states and there we are about evenly spread between residential and non residential construction looking at residential construction in the united states in 2019 it got off to a bit of a slow start but as the year went on and the economy remained strong and mortgage rates actually declined during the year in 2019 we saw a pickup in growth in activity in residential in the u s strongest in the south and the west but broadly speaking strong overall and that supported the growth of our business so overall 2019 was a year of growth for res in the u s and looks like another year of growth in 2020 the non residential segment which is broad has many different many different verticals in it and they kind of tend to move at different pace at different times and we saw that again in 2019 there has been a high level of activity in non res over the last number of years in the prior year we saw some segments had slight declines which were a little bit of headwinds on some of our businesses but more importantly parts of the non res segment continue to grow which was which were tailwinds for parts of our business as well taken together overall the positives outweighed the challenges in non res and it was another year of growth in non res which benefited our businesses and as we look forward to 2020 in non res the forward indicators have turned positive in the last number of months so like for the last five months they ve been in positive territory which gives us confidence that that segment of our business will remain positive as we look forward so kind of in totality we have a large geographic spread and taken all together it was a positive environment for our businesses in 2019 and we have momentum that we look forward to continuing in 2020 so as you take that backdrop and look at our trading performance it was another year of strong delivery for building products in 2019 we had modest top line growth of 2 which was generally in line with across the different markets in which we compete but our continued focus on operational efficiency in strong commercial management and cost control across the division we were able to take that 2 growth and turn it into 8 like for like growth in our ebitda and that strong operating leverage again translated into about 70 basis points of operating margin improvement for the division last year which continues a trend we ve been on for the last several years but in addition to performance this was the first year of our global building products division it was quite busy in terms of portfolio senan already mentioned the disposal of our european distribution operations which was a very sizable change for us and the portfolio of our businesses but also around mid year we announced the disposal of our shutters and awnings platform which was european based and then in september the disposal of our fencing business again another european based products platform for us but just as importantly as divestments we continue to invest in our core businesses and building products we did 16 bolt on acquisition spending about eur450 million again strengthening our core businesses and these acquisitions have already integrated well are delivering synergies and will help fuel the growth of this division as we move forward and before i close i just want to highlight a few key features of our building products division kind of how it fits within the strategy of crh and how it s positioned for growth going forward and first i d just like to reiterate the performance of the division so if you look over the last five years as we ve worked to really do what we have talked a lot about in crh which is about getting more focused and getting simpler in our portfolio we ve been able to drive significant profit improvement in the business so if you look our ebitda is up 13 on average over the last five years and our margin is up about 400 basis points in that time so the division is contributing significantly to the growth and performance of crh and second its close relationship to our materials businesses about two thirds of what we do are concrete products engineered concrete products or products that are related to concrete construction and as you know concrete is made with cement and made with aggregates products that are produced by randy and nu onne and what we do is we take those basic raw materials and we translate them into value added engineered solutions for our customers but what really excites me is the fact that we are the number one concrete products producer in the developed markets of north america and europe again adding value to what we do upstream and if you think about how materials and products work together in crh to help us adapt to the changing nature of construction it s true we make materials and we make products but our customers want solutions our customers want solutions that help them in their procurement process help them execute their projects and help them mitigate risk and at crh we have the ability the unique ability to combine materials and products and value added services into a single offer a single solution for our customers and that adds value to their business and when we add value to their business it adds value to our shareholders so in summary when i look to the future of building products i see a business with a strong foundation strong core businesses in good markets an excellent track record of performance for the group and tremendous opportunities for continued growth whether that s reinvestment in our business for organic growth or indeed further bolt on acquisitions that will fuel growth going forward like we did in 2019 senan senan murphy group finance director thank you keith so what i d like to do now is give you a little bit more color on our financial performance during 2019 starting with earnings moving to slide 13 we reported eur4 2 billion of earnings this year eur4 2 billion of ebitda that s a 25 increase over last year the margins are up as well as we talked about earlier on and that s a reflection of very strong operating leverage across our group as you can see there s a number of items behind that growth but the one that stands out most is the organic growth on that slide 7 like for like improvement year over year that s nearly eur240 million of incremental ebitda over last year over 2018 and that again is taken against the backdrop of what onne talked about in the u k being a difficult market and some of the input cost headwinds that randy mentions across some parts of our business over the last year acquisitions have contributed another eur170 million of ebitda to us in 2019 and that mostly reflects the acquisition of ash grove which closed in june of 2018 divestments are an impact on our performance over the year and that reflects the sale of europe distribution which happened in october and also some of the smaller product deals that keith mentioned that were disposed of during 2019 we ve had the benefit of currency translation which reflects the strength of u s dollar when you compare it to our reporting currency and there s also some accounting impacts which obviously get us to our reported ebitda number moving on to our net debt position and performance slide 14 we started the year with eur7 billion of net debt that was 2 1 times net debt to ebitda during the year there s been a number of items that have helped us reduce that debt position we ve had strong inflow from our development activity we talked about over eur2 billion of ebitda from divestments we reinvested over eur700 million of that into value accretive deals still had a net inflow of eur1 4 billion we talked about the strong cash generation even taking that cash cash generation and investing well in capex in our existing business we ended up still with eur1 9 billion of net cash inflow from our operations that strong cash flow then has allowed us to return eur1 4 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends and when you add all of that together you see a sizable reduction in our net debt position down to eur5 1 billion by the end of 2019 before the impact of the accounting changes and when you take ifrs 16 transition into account we finished the year at eur6 7 billion of net debt and when you look at that net debt and compare it to our earnings from the continued operations we have going forward you see that our net debt to ebitda on a continuing basis is down below 1 7 times that balance sheet strength then gives us options significant options in terms of how we can deploy that capital to create further value for our shareholders going forward we have a lot of options we can invest in acquisitions we can work on our portfolio management we can invest in capex or we can return some of that cash back to shareholders and as we look at our capital deployment our focus is on value creation for our shareholders so every single capital deployment decision we make is all about creating value for our shareholders and it s against that backdrop that we ve increased the cash that we ve returned to our shareholders in the last year the ongoing share buyback program as i mentioned has delivered eur800 million back to shareholders during 2019 the next tranche would be another eur200 million completed by the end of march on the dividend front a 15 increase in our full year dividends when you compare that to previous years that is a significant step up in the level of dividends and as i said earlier that is based on the confidence that we have that the sustainability of our profits and our cash generation going forward will serve us well also in terms of dividends when we look forward i would continue to guide for progressive dividends so as our earnings per share grows our dividend per share will follow and at the same time we ll keep an eye on cover and make sure that we build back toward a three dividend cover and moving to slide 16 and talking about our announcement this morning to change our reporting currency to u s dollar effective january this year the rationale behind this when you look at our business over the last decade we ve been actively managing our portfolio and as a result as we see the mix change in our business you can look at it today and see the euro denominated earnings represent 10 of our portfolio today compared to 25 where it was in the past it no longer makes sense for us to translate 90 of our earnings back into euro so as we move to u s dollar we see a few benefits first of all it creates a closer alignment between our reporting currency and the majority currency that we make our earnings in second of all it reduces the volatility in our reported earnings and then it also allows us to have much closer alignment between our reported performance and the underlying performance across our group we ll publish updated financials within u s dollars looking back over the last three years we ll make that available to you before the april trading update and then our ir team will be available to help you through the transition to answer any questions you may have at this point i d like david to take you through some of the strategic updates that we talked about earlier and give you an update on that going forward david dillon president global strategy business development thanks senan yeah i d like to cover a number of key strategic topics at crh portfolio management capital allocation our continuous business improvement and also sustainability and that we at crh are positioned for further value creation going forward active portfolio management is a core focus at crh it s the continuous process of reshaping our business constantly refining our portfolio and it s not new this is a strong mostly that we ve built up over the last five years where we ve divested 40 of our asset base which generates superior margins returns and cash as senan said this year 2019 was a busy year for us we generated over eur2 billion of proceeds from divestments and we redeployed eur700 million of that capital into value accretive acquisitions in december we also completed the sale of our indian cement joint venture for eur300 million and all of this was delivered with the same level of financial discipline you come to expect from crh the average exit multiple for our divestments was 11 times ebitda and the average acquisition multiple was 8 times ebitda and that s before any synergies or improvements we deliver ourselves and we will continue to take that disciplined approach to capital allocation at crh our focus is on developed markets with attractive long term fundamentals these are markets with growing populations good economic activity and significant construction needs and we will also continue to focus on our core strengths and capabilities at crh operating and integrating value added businesses building better businesses and the markets in which we operate are highly fragmented both materials and products allowing a significant opportunity to deliver further growth through acquisition and further value creation for the shareholder turning to the whole area of continuous business improvement and this is a deeply embedded practice at crh of making our businesses better through continuous improvement initiatives we have detailed plans in place right across the business at all of our locations to continuously improve and deliver structurally higher margins returns and cash and in 2019 despite some headwinds in the uk and also some input cost pressures we ve delivered i think we delivered a good start to the program 50 basis points this year we ve also generated good cash senan said over 80 of our ebitda got converted to cash so very good progress there and a good start and i m confident that the initiatives we have in place across all of our businesses will continue to deliver in 2020 2021 and indeed beyond sustainability is a core part of our strategy at crh and our business model and i m going to use this opportunity to update you on the areas we re focused on to achieve our objective of reducing the impact of construction and construction materials on our environment and other communities in which we operate at crh we manufacture a wide range of building materials these are the materials necessary to build our world without our products there are no homes to live in no cities to work in and no roads to drive on simply put our materials are essential for modern life and modern living but we also live in this world and we want to make it do everything on our part to make it a more sustainable place to live in it s important to me it s important to my children it s important to you especially it s important to all of us at crh and we take it very seriously and sustainability has been deeply embedded within our business for many many years where we ve been collaborating innovating and engaging with the industry to reduce the impact of construction and construction materials on our world and it s about never standing still always evolving always improving part of our continuous improvement at crh one example of this is on carbon and carbon emissions and primarily here we re talking about cement and the co2 that s generated as part of the production process here we re leading the industry we re a founding member of the global cement concrete association the gcca which is leading coordinated industry response to what is a global issue at crh ourselves we ve also made significant steps and significant improvements in our carbon emissions over the last 15 years we set ambitious targets to 2020 and i m pleased to say we ve delivered those one year early in 2019 and today we are setting our targets to 2030 the most demanding in the industry with a further reduction to 520 kgs of co2 per tonne of cement produced and all this is about the improvement and reduction of impact of construction and construction materials on the environment but it is only one aspect of our business we manufacture a wide range of building materials in crh in fact cement only represents about 15 of our sales in crh but in sustainability it s a core of everything we do it s fundamental to our business across all of our range of building materials we re constantly striving to improve the manufacturing process make it more efficient more sustainable reduce the impact on our environment and our natural resources and we are recognized as an industry leader by the major rating agencies we ve also been focused on sustainable innovation across our businesses over many decades and some examples of this in our cement business one third of the fuels we use are now non fossil fuels that s a leader in the industry and we have built more roads than anyone else in the world randy will say that 100 of the asphalt mix is recyclable and by volume 20 of our total asphalt is actually recycled material and in fact we are the largest recycler of building materials in all of north america keith said something we re really unique and crh are unique we re the only business of scale that integrates we integrate materials products and services to provide solutions to our customers to address the changing needs of construction crh is a global leader in concrete which is the world s most sustainable building material it s got a 100 year life it s strong and durable it s 100 recyclable and amazingly it reabsorbs and recarbonizes co2 over the lifetime of the building but crh is more we don t just dig materials out of the ground and set up by the tonne we convert those materials into value added products and those value added products form part of solutions for our customers to address the changing needs of construction of tomorrow and those sustainable solutions use less resources they improve safety they reduce the impact on the environment and overall part of our aim and objective to reduce the impact of construction and construction materials on our world senan murphy group finance director thanks david just before i turn to the outlook what i d like to do maybe is give you a little bit of flavor of where we see crh positioned in 2020 and beyond as we look out so as we remember we talked about a lot of change in the organization over the last decade and what that change has done is it s changed the mix of our business but as we look at how we are positioned going forward for future growth opportunities we feel good and we feel confident about the position we re starting from we have got good quality assets in key geographies we built leading positions across north america and europe those markets have good fundamentals and have good growth prospects be as construction needs gdp growth population growth in addition to that we ve talked a lot this morning about continuous business improvement it s a well embedded practice across the group we ve made a lot of progress on it we continue to focus on it going forward and it is an area where we re focused on driving structurally higher margins returns and cash we have a very healthy balance sheet and that gives us a lot of options at the same time we have a healthy pipeline of acquisition opportunities but we need to stay financially disciplined and that has been a strong hallmark of crh in the past so when it comes to looking at allocating capital we have options whether it s acquisitions whether it s portfolio divestments whether it s investing in our existing business or whether it s returning that cash back to our shareholders moving ahead to talk about what we see and expect as we look into 2020 in americas materials we ve had a good 2019 good strong underlying fundamentals around infrastructure residential nonresidential and at this stage we would see that that positive demand would continue into 2020 in europe materials we ve got good market positions we stand to benefit from further construction growth across our key markets in eastern europe and western europe u k has been challenging for us but at this point as we look ahead in terms of the u k we see and expect some stabilization in that market as we look out to latter part of 2020 and beyond building products has been a year of good delivery some positive momentum built up over the last couple of years and we expect to see that positive momentum carry forward into 2020 so when you put all that back together we expect that 2020 will be a further year of progress for us across crh moving to slide 29 and what i want to leave you with here before i turn to any questions and answers is the key takeaways from our results presentation here this morning there was one thing we d leave you with it s this slide 2019 has been another strong year of financial delivery across the group eur4 2 billion of ebitda eur3 5 billion of cash a stronger balance sheet and that strong balance sheet leaves us really well positioned as we look forward in terms of how we can create further value creation there s been a lot of continuous business improvement across the business we talked about the well exercised muscle now of being able to continuously improve our businesses we ve made good progress in 2019 50 basis points of margin improvement and yes as we look ahead we see and we expect to make further progress in 2020 and beyond portfolio management is another part of our key value creation had a busy year in 2019 we remain absolutely focused on simplifying our business and looking for opportunities to redeploy capital if that s required and then moving on to how we deploy some of that capital how we think about allocating capital we ve increased our cash returned to shareholders over the last year buyback program continues we ve had a 15 step up in dividends a onetime step up in dividend reflecting the sustainably higher profit and cash generation capability of our business going forward at this point i d like to move on to questions and i think let s follow the usual protocol here which is we take questions in the room to start with we ll move on to the web then at that point if you could raise your hands we ll get the microphones to you and then identify yourself name of institution and we ll take your questions thank you start here number one questions and answers gregor kuglitsch ubs analyst thank you gregor kuglitsch from ubs obviously if albert is listening i hope he recovers swiftly three questions if i may so firstly on energy please if you could just sort of summarize what happened last year and what you re seeing in the early parts of 2020 i think there s some rule changes on imo that potentially have some impact on bitumen so if you could just sort of give us a sense of what you re actually seeing on the ground that would be helpful the second question i guess is on u s infrastructure so i think the fast act is expiring later this year we ve seen highway awards actually trend negative if i m not mistaken so i want to understand your conviction around the infrastructure market holding up considering those two factors and then finally on sustainability and i appreciate the details you ve given today but if you could just give us a broader sense how much these could cost and then i suppose how do you kind of see a path toward a more material reduction i think the reduction is like 9 it s quite similar to what we ve been hearing from others in the industry that have reported earlier this week but what s the sort of next leg how do you say get this down 50 60 70 what s the kind of longer term vision to really get i think you talked about carbon neutrality by 2050 in the statement somewhere if you could just give us a sense of what you can do to really make a step change please thank you senan murphy group finance director all right gregor three questions there i might just take them in the order that came in terms of energy for 2019 and 2020 i ll take that and randy you might add on in terms of the imo question just in the second part of that u s infrastructure randy and fast act you might update us on that and then david maybe you might update us on sustainability and the questions that were raised there so just in terms of energy position across the group 2019 and outlook for 2020 i d just to remind you energy bill across the group in 2019 runs at about 10 5 of our group sales and we have seen an increase the modest increase in energy costs when you put it all together about 3 increase in energy costs during 2019 as we look out to 2020 we re obviously predicting that we would have a flat to maybe slightly positive outlook on energy across the group and i guess one thing i would say before i hand over to randy to talk about imo is the fact that remember as a group we are really focused on expanding our margins so when we re looking at our input costs we re taking that into account when we re thinking about our pricing dynamics at the start of any year and how we can recover that and how we can continue to expand our margins randy on imo randy lake president americas materials yes well i guess maybe just to back up a second in terms of our winter fill strategy primarily the reason we re in that aspect of the business is just to ensure supply because there s not enough supply in terms of liquid asphalt to meet the overall demand in the full year so primarily it s focused to ensure we have that material i would say our the way the winter fill looks at this point in time very similar to last year and really have seen no impact of imo 2020 so in terms of kind of quantum and pricing very similar we ebb and flow in terms of quantity in the tanks based upon our backlogs what we see in terms of margin opportunity and so it s hard to say that it ll be equal from year over year just based upon market dynamics but in terms of imo 2020 no impact at this point in regards to the fast act kind of underlying infrastructure spend i think as i indicated in some of the opening comments we ve been very fortunate to see the activity at the state level because if you go back in terms of the underlying funding mechanism for federal spend it s the gas tax it s eur0 184 it s been eur0 184 to since the early 1990s not indexed to inflation the fast act as you say does run up in september of this year fortunately it s it always is a bipartisan issue the president talks about it the legislators talk about it the key issue is how do you actually fund the program going forward so i would say in kind of a worst case scenario there s a continuing resolution which really doesn t disrupt kind of the current level of funding and were complemented by the activities that have been taken on by the states and the local municipalities david dillon president global strategy business development sustainability i think the first thing is that our track record i think gregor over the last 15 years we had targets that were set to 2020 and we ve delivered those one year early and we deliver what we said we would do we ve got targets in 2030 i think those targets are founded in strong roadmaps across the business clinker factor increased to alternative fuels and we ve proven our ability to deal with that i think in terms of the capex that would go with that it s ongoing capex we don t see a step up in terms of costs to deliver those targets to 2030 i think beyond then we are leading the industry where i mentioned the global cement concrete association we re a founding member and that association has lots of research lots of innovation that s coming through that there s an innovation network within that so we re all working together as an industry to progress the issues over the longer term beyond 2030 but in 2030 we are very confident in our roadmap to deliver that senan murphy group finance director might come here next in terms of number two robert gardiner davy analyst good morning robert gardiner from davy so i ll ask two please so one on capital allocation just in the context of the strong performance in terms of cash debt the dividend increase how we should think about the split between dividends buyback bolt ons capex in 2020 how we should think about that and then two you talked a lot about product solutions the integration between materials and products and i m just wondering if you could maybe elaborate give us some practical examples of how that s working between the materials and the products divisions and the opportunity that you see there going forward thanks senan murphy group finance director okay robert thanks two questions there first one on capital allocation which i ll take and then the second one which relates to your products and solutions conversation keith you might start but actually randy you will have some perspectives you can add as well if that would be good capital allocation just in terms of understanding the priorities we talked about when we look at our capital allocation strong balance sheet as we said which is a good problem to have how do we allocate that capital well and there s a number of factors and we talked about options a lot today and the significant options we have i think first place i d start is looking at our dividend we ve had a progressive dividend policy now for many years and there s been no cut to dividend we continue to push it ahead with a sizable onetime step up in dividend this year and as i said i d expect to see a continued progressive approach to dividend we also have a healthy cover which gives us confidence we can sustain that into the future i think in addition to that then we look at capex within our existing business and again that s something that we ve invested well in we continue to improve our businesses and that s up there on the agenda which we will be continuing to do and particularly some of the conversations that david touched on there in terms of driving forward on the sustainability agenda and making sure that we re investing enough in our business to be able to take advantage of that opportunity we ve continued to do buybacks and i mean they flow through you see them we did 62 deals in the last 12 months eur730 million eur750 million of spend on that and that continues to be a feature of our business and we see that that is value creating because these smaller deals give us significant opportunity to be able to generate synergies and improve profitability then it comes back to really some trade offs between further acquisitions versus buybacks the buyback program now is a well established part of our dna and we will continue to make choices in terms of how we allocate capital between buybacks and acquisitions depending on the opportunities that present themselves it s good to have that option and again the main thing to bear in mind is that we will stay absolutely focused and diligent in our approach as david mentioned during the presentation there in terms of products maybe keith you might start off and then randy you can add keith haas president building products yeah sure it s a great question thanks for asking it i think i d look at it in two dimensions i think the simplest is really just the vertical integration relationship between our divisions as i said about two thirds of what we do is either concrete products themselves or products that enable concrete construction and we consume i think about close to 50 of the cement that we buy in building products is either supplied by randy s group or by onne s group and as our footprint both in materials and products continue to expand that ratio will only go up and that drives value to the company but if you think about it in terms of beyond just those supply benefits oftentimes our products come together in a project itself and i think a good example would be going back to the united states but i think it s an issue all over the world is we talk a lot in terms of sustainability around the production of carbon and stuff but there s all other factors in that like a big issue for us in the u s is water management because it can it s kind of funny where you need it it s not there and then where you have too much of it you got to figure out something to do with and so as particularly stormwater is a big issue for us and something we ve invested heavily in and if you think about stormwater management whether it s a municipality or a private owner we kind of have a system that we can take to those that would say the pavement on top which has to have water permeate through it is manufactured in our architectural products division the aggregate that fills in that is made in our materials division the aggregate that s below that through which some of the stormwater filters comes from randy s group and then the structures that are underneath that to collect that stormwater filter it and then ultimately return it to the aquifer are made in our infrastructure products business which is part of building products and again it s almost all concrete or aggregates there s cement that s going into the concrete and it s a solution that cuts across even divisions within my own group that have to work together to be able to provide it but it s an entire sort of site solution package that uniquely we can bring to people and specify the whole thing together and we have a team that interfaces with a customer that cuts across these divisions so that the customer really has one single point of contact so they don t have to dial around to 10 or 12 different people and then our own internal resources figures how to coordinate the teams within our businesses to be able to deliver that on time at the right price and deliver again the value for them which we get to bring us value to us which we return to value as our shareholders randy lake president americas materials yeah i guess if you just build on that theme we re seeing certainly a changing of the dynamics in regards to infrastructure work in that we now are much more active in the design build aspect right so it goes from an evolution of our product to asphalt which is maybe not as flashy as what keith described but the movement away from a prescriptive specification to a performance based specification which then allows us to use more recycled material and we warranty that the only way you can warranty that is to have a connection with keith s group in terms of that underlying infrastructure that s part of a design build project so if you think about going to a state agency which is relatively risk averse in offering something like that that s an overall solution it gives us a competitive advantage that we wouldn t have otherwise if we had a connectivity with the products that keith s teams offer senan murphy group finance director next question i might come back to this side of the room arnaud lehmann bank of america analyst thank you very much arnaud lehmann from bank of america i would have three questions if i may the first one is could you provide us an update on your 300 basis point margin improvement target i believe you said a few months ago you could give us maybe a pass into 2020 and 2021 and please remind us how much of it you delivered in 2019 if the target is still relevant secondly in terms of your geographic developments i mean your you ve left india 100 now it s clearly a focus on europe and north america would australia fit well in your organization in the medium long term if you had opportunities there i mean it s a fairly consolidated cement market strong vertical integration market is a bit depressed now but in terms of structure could it be attractive to you and lastly maybe a technicality on the india jv disposal what is the reason you sold it on the eur300 million are there included in your eur6 7 billion net debt at year end thank you senan murphy group finance director yes thanks arnaud three questions there i might just take them in reverse order in terms of the india disposal and the geographic development i might start with and then david you might pick up on the development side and also address the margin improvement program that we re driving just in terms of taking india first india closed at end of the year so there s no cash shown in our 2019 performance the eur300 million of cash was would be some of it is already in the bank and the rest of it would be received under an installment vendor loan over the next two years in terms of that position we re very pleased with the multiple that we received got for that price and it also gives us the option to take that capital and deploy it elsewhere and we ve talked about that for a while in terms of looking across our portfolio and looking for opportunities where we feel that we can take capital and redeploy it elsewhere and get a better return and that was simply the case there so we make economic decisions not emotional decisions in terms of how we allocate capital i think in terms of again geographic developments i think we ve talked about the fact that we are very focused on the markets that we re in the developed markets in north america europe we see significant opportunities for further acquisitions in those markets you see bolt ons coming through this year it happened to be a high degree of bolt ons in the products world that can change from year to year and that will come down to what opportunities present themselves going forward so at this point in time i think we re very comfortable with the footprint of businesses we have today there s plenty of opportunities for us to continue to grow in those markets and we ll continue to do that david you might pick up on performance improvement david dillon president global strategy business development yes on the 300 basis points but it s a continuous business it s actually about the year on year making businesses better which is a core part of crh we ve made a good start i think what you re seeing first and foremost is the benefits of our portfolio realignment where we ve become narrower and more focused you see those benefits coming through what is very pleasing is all three divisions have made progress and if you take out the u k actually tremendous progress has been made within emat as well and the europe materials division but what it is is a year on year improvement process i mean i d like to be part of a company that has continuous improvement at its core because you will continue to improve it doesn t stop at one year or the next it continues to improve and i think if we were sitting here at the middle of last year we were thinking ok what is the basis point improvement this year given we have thousands of locations to run this through it s all incremental we delivered very well is a good start and i think what we re doing is continuing to improve we don t stop yesterday or tomorrow we keep on going and i think we have detailed plans in place we ll see how the year unfolds in terms of how that develops out but i m very confident that we re well on track for what we re doing year on year over the next number of years senan murphy group finance director i might just come back to this side of the room again here do you want to yes great number two yassine touahri on field investment research analyst good morning yassine touahri from on field investment research two questions first when we look at the construction industry worldwide we see more and more labor strategies we see more and more tighter environmental regulations and a big impact of digitalization what solution can you develop and invest in to address those changes and those challenge and when we look at your building products division where would you like the division to be in let s say five years from now would you consider adding new line of products would you consider developing what you have what s the strategy there and then my second question is on imo 2020 i think you discussed about the short term impact do you see a risk that long term environmental regulation could limit the supply of liquid asphalt and if this is a risk what strategy would you deploy to address this issue senan murphy group finance director you got two questions there products keith do you have a vision for products and also maybe you might address the labor shortages and randy obviously in imo i know you answered earlier but you might just supplement the answer keith haas president building products let me go first then just in terms of labor shortages i think it you are correct i mean it continues to be an issue for the industry and certainly in some ways affects our business you look at whether it s europe or the united states they re tight labor markets i think it affects our customers more than it affects us because we have ways to drive efficiencies in our own factories every year we get productivity improvements therefore for a fixed amount of labor we can have higher output i don t think the same is actually applying at the same rate in the customer base so contracting and a lot of products that we do have to be manually installed and so the rate of productivity there growth is not doesn t appear to be as fast so there s it s kind of in a way there s probably a better demand environment than there is a supply environment in some ways and that s kind of in some ways it s good because i believe it s lengthening the upcycle but obviously we d like the whole industry to operate more efficiently so kind of what are we doing about it i think a couple of things one is we do have a significant business in what we call infrastructure products or structural concrete which is factory built building components so to ease construction you could call it modular or prefab or whatever else our specialty is doing that in concrete and taking the kind of off site construction and bringing it to the job site whether that s going underground the structure whether it s going above ground in the structure so that s one thing two you heard me referenced the idea that we make products that are related to concrete construction so what i mean by that is we have products that speed concrete construction in the field or make it easier to do and make it safer to do like in our construction accessories business and our infrastructure products business so the more that we can make it safer and easier to build whether that s prefab or actually on site i think it helps our customers execute their projects faster so we re investing in those businesses quite heavily and investing in ways to make the installation of our products easier and digitalization you mentioned it has a role to play in that and so each one of the businesses within my group has a digital strategy and it varies depending on the type of business so in our heavy concrete construction parts of our business it s more about digital integration of the design process with the manufacturing process so you would have heard of bim so the product is designed electronically or building is designed electronically that s broken down into the components of the building and what we re working on is to be able to seamlessly connect that from designer into factory there s a lot of steps in that to be able to do that but we are on that journey and then we have other businesses that are more consumer or distributor facing where it s about more kind of traditional electronic commerce of ordering from catalogs and being able to seamlessly interact with customers electronically and what we re trying to do through that whole strategy is make it easy for them to do business with us and hard for them to do business with others differentially and relatively speaking so those are our main strategies i think just in terms of long term vision and what we re concentrated on now is building out the core product platforms that we have and how they can grow and what adjacencies they can go into to more fully satisfy customers we talk about vertical integration but we also talk about integration of our capabilities within segments of construction be that for distributors or for contractors and offering a more full service solution that s probably our main focus but we are thinking longer term about other segments of the industry that we should be in because the world is moving that way and we ll look at that over time think carefully about how new opportunities adapt to our core capabilities and when those match up i think we ll make moves in that direction but the timing of that would be very uncertain so sorry long answer i ll turn it over to you now randy randy lake president americas materials i just realized that i don t want to be answering after you it s a lot more creative answers a lot more interesting than mine as i mentioned earlier imo 2020 we ve seen no impact to date actually one of the underlying theses is would be that actually there will be a higher availability of liquid asphalt of bitumen at lower cost and so that would have some impact in the market we re not seeing that take place how we prepare for that i think as you go back to our history 15 years ago we used 0 wrap in our mixes today it s north of 20 so it s creating an environment we have less dependency upon liquid asphalt so that content gets reduced actually has a higher performance in terms of the product that we re importing to that we deliver i think that s our that s the way we view the world we can t predict exactly what s going to happen we ll react to those things as they happen in the market but what we can control is the product that we re making and ultimately less dependency on liquid asphalt senan murphy group finance director just watching the time back here and i think in the interest of the fact that we have questions on the web i might move back here with one more question to this side and we view this as our last question from the floor number two david o brien goodbody analyst thank you david o brien from goodbody just a couple for me please firstly you talked about stability in the u k market i m just wondering what are the prospects for you progressing profitability in 2020 specifically in the u k and secondly the margin performance in the u s business was pretty stellar in 2019 what are your backlogs telling you about margin progression at this stage and finally going back to your pretty ambitious carbon targets if you look at the two cement networks in europe and the u s clearly carbon reduction has been a keener focus in europe for some time now how do the two networks compare in terms of clinker ratio alternative fuel usage etc senan murphy group finance director thanks david three questions there onne and randy i m going to divide them up between you guys so in terms of the u k stability question onne you might take that in terms of the u s backlogs and margin performance randy you can incorporate that into your discussion and then i guess between the two of you both of you have cement businesses within your portfolio you have obviously the newly acquired ash grove business and our canadian business and what we acquired in suwannee and then onne obviously you ve worked closely with randy and the team in terms of and you have a view of europe versus the u s so maybe we d start with the u k and then randy you might take up backlogs and then come back and both of you cover the cement conversation both sides of the atlantic onne van der weijde president europe materials yes very important for us is infrastructure development in the u k we saw three years of declining demand in that segment and i think the first thing what the government has done is sending out a very positive signal and i think that is the most important because the industry was a little bit where we re going and while the government has now done with the commitment and also what is going to appear hopefully in the new budget is much more commitment to spend on infrastructure and that has changed the sentiment and that is very important for us to say what is going to happen because there s a long lead time and it will take some time before the project starts so that s why i m i think the sentiment will help to stabilize in 2020 and if i look at the projects we have in the pipeline i was just mentioning high speed 2 we have about 20 locations along the corridor from london to birmingham and we had a preferred supplier we have won two thirds of all the ready mixed contracts awarded in the major segments along the road we have major aggregate supply contracts as a preferred so it doesn t lead to shipping out of the gate today but i see good progress that that will start at the end of the year so i m positive that we will recover randy lake president americas materials and just turning to kind of the kind of our margin sentiment what we see in the backlog i guess we track certainly on a weekly basis kind of the quantum of work that we bid or win rate by market in kind of the underlying margins and we re seeing margin progression so it d just be indicative of the fact that there s a good environment in terms of infrastructure spend so we feel confident kind of all through the chain of margin progression as we go into next year and i ll let onne talk a little bit about the journey in regards to where europe is in terms of cement production because we re relatively new i would say one thing in particular within north america now we run the cement platform with one team so we took the ash grove business the florida cement assets and the canadian cement business one leadership team kind of one face to the market i think what that allows us to do is really leverage a lot of the capabilities in a very quick fashion and the experiences from onne and his team in and around operational improvements ash grove in particular was a very fine company we have been a long term customer but we certainly found opportunities whether that s in the use of alternative fuels that we would have learned directly from onne and his team the focus on clinker factors that would never have happened without kind of the extensive technical resources so i would say there s a ways to go in regards to improving the performance of our north america cement assets and it s really on writing on the cocktails of the journey that really onne and his team have been on but you can talk more about that right onne van der weijde president europe materials yeah so just to start where you left randy in terms of alternative fuels and clinker reduction and everything else we have developed very detailed roadmaps and that is on a company by company basis on a country by country basis so these 520 kilos per tonne on cement we have detailed them we have planned them it s part of our normal capex so we are quite confident that the targets we have said that we can deliver that in the normal course we re a little bit ahead in that advantage we can bring to the u s so we have an exchange and people on the ground in the u s also to continue the journey we are much further and we are close to 50 replacement of fossil fuels in europe and we re going to try to do the same in the u s in terms of growth western europe is more stable there is some growth but it s not fantastic but for us the growth region is eastern europe all the way from poland to romania is a good market and it continues to grow so even today we have a relatively well mild winter right now in the east and we see good volume growth in eastern europe senan murphy group finance director just looking at the list of questions i have here from the webcast and then ticking them off i think most of them have actually been addressed in the questions that have come up and answers that have been responded here i think there s only one that i just can notice here that hasn t i don t think have been addressed so far david just in terms of further disposals and now that we re out of india that we have plans to exit all of emerging markets david dillon president global strategy business development active portfolio management is the new muscle i think we ve developed over the last five years here at crh so we re always looking at everything i think parts of our business here we re always going to look at every year how we re delivering the right cash or delivering the right margin improvement are we delivering growth the right returns and it s a constant churn i would say which is exactly what you want in a group like ours as well this is what we re doing so i would say the answer is yes we will have further investments the question is how much they would be and over what time frame but it s actually just part of our ongoing business now i would say and embedding acquisitions in the right way as well in terms of emerging markets it s quite small now within what we have i think we ve got a small position in china which is very very small but also the philippines philippines is actually a good business it s improved quite a bit over the last 12 months i think we were here 12 months ago sort of saying a challenging period we ve really made good improvements in that business and we saw a doubling of profits actually in that business over the last year and continued progress in 2020 but overall our footprint 95 of it is in the developed markets of europe and north america and again that s where our focus is and we see great opportunities there senan murphy group finance director i think in the interest of time we ll close the session here this morning can i just thank you all for your time and attention and taking time out of your busy schedule and coming to listen to our results presentation here this morning if you have any follow up questions and anything that wasn t addressed this morning our ir team are available and certainly willing to help in terms of answering any questions that you may have or any follow ups that you may have from this morning s presentation and the next time we ll update you will be in april in advance of our agm so we ll give our trading update in april and at that point we ll be able to give you a further update in terms of how 2020 is unfolding and how it s progressing so until that time please keep well and stay safe thank you

central banks in australia and canada will hold policy meetings next week the first since the outbreak of the coronavirus escalated into a global crisis but with policymakers having limited firepower they will probably maintain a wait and see approach until a clearer picture starts emerging about the impact of the virus whose spread has multiplied several fold in the past week investors will also be waiting anxiously for the latest nonfarm payrolls report out of the united states as they push up their bets that the federal reserve will be compelled to slash interest rates soon opec will come under the spotlight too as it meets to decide if there is a need for additional output cuts rba to hold rates as outlook dims it will be a crucial week for the australian dollar as a slew of important data releases and a policy meeting by the reserve bank of australia will help investors gauge the likelihood of a near term rate cut australia s economy had lost steam even before the virus outbreak and judging by the business spending numbers released this week the lacklustre growth probably persisted in the fourth quarter the full q4 gdp estimate is out on wednesday and in the run up to that business inventories and net exports contribution for the quarter will be watched on monday and tuesday respectively later in the week january trade thursday and retail sales friday data should also attract some attention however what traders will be more eager to know is whether or not recent developments have prompted a shift in policy stance at the rba which meets on tuesday for its rate setting decision although the bank is not anticipated to make any changes to its cash rate at the march meeting any sign that it s tilting towards a distinctly more dovish viewpoint could induce fresh selling pressure for the aussie however having already plummeted to 11 year lows the oversold aussie could easily reverse higher if hints of policy easing help lift the market mood will unpredictable poloz deliver a surprise rate cut a day after the rba meeting it will be the turn of the bank of canada to set interest rates boc rate cut expectations have been on the rise since the coronavirus started spreading uncontrollably and markets have now priced cuts of almost 75 basis points in the overnight rate by year end that may look excessive considering that canada s economy isn t doing too badly and inflation is running above the 2 target midpoint however under the surface there are several trouble spots exports are struggling consumer spending is soft and anti pipeline protests on a busy railway route have been causing huge disruptions to freight traffic during february when adding to that the potential impact from the virus on the current and upcoming quarters plus the fact that growth already slowed markedly in the second half of 2019 stephen poloz co may decide waiting would be riskier than slashing rates immediately and announce a surprise reduction next week but if poloz still feels that the economy is in a pretty good place and the boc stands pat in march the odds are very high that it would cut in april no action on wednesday would also put greater weight to friday s employment report for february however as far as the canadian dollar is concerned unless the boc is unexpectedly upbeat it will be difficult for the currency to stem its slide versus the us dollar chinese pmis to set market tone one indicator policymakers as well as traders will definitely be watching to understand the scale of the damage of the coronavirus on china s economy is the official manufacturing pmi due on saturday forecasts are for the pmi to drop from 50 0 to 46 0 in february if markets wake up to a worse than expected figure on monday which is a strong possibility given that much of the economy has been paralysed by the lockdown the risk off mood is likely to deepen later on monday the caixin manufacturing pmi will be published and it will be interesting to see whether the private survey is in line with the government one can japanese household spending rebound japan s economy was ravaged by the sales tax hike a typhoon and the trade war in q4 last year causing gdp to shrink by 1 6 quarter on quarter however while the higher sales tax may have been the main culprit in keeping shoppers at home the strong consumption enjoyed earlier in the year was not sustainable to begin with as wages had been falling for much of 2019 wage growth and household spending stats for january are due on friday and any pickup at the start of 2020 would provide some hope to policymakers that the economy wasn t in such dire straits before being struck by the virus outbreak in february ahead of friday s numbers q4 capital expenditure data will be monitored for any possible revisions to the dismal preliminary gdp readings any positives in next week s figures might further help the yen to restore its safe haven status after the february wobble on the whole though the yen s brief tumble appears to have been triggered by one off flows and risk sentiment and dollar moves will likely continue to be the main drivers for the japanese currency in the coming weeks euro perks up for all the wrong reasons the euro is enjoying a rare rally against the dollar as fed rate cut expectations and unwinding of carry trades bolster the single currency short covering could also be aiding this recovery which can only indicate that traders have not changed their gloomy outlook for the euro area data coming up next week is not anticipated to change the narrative for the eurozone economy and any disappointing readings may temporarily put the brakes on the euro s ascent kicking off the releases are german export numbers for january on monday along with the final ihs markit

friday pound on the backfoot ahead of brexit talks the british pound has been unable to capitalize on the dollar s pullback as hard brexit fears have unnerved investors after both the uk and the eu set out tough negotiating positions for future trade talks uk pm boris johnson went a step further and warned he could walk away from the talks in june if by then the broad outline of a deal does not conform to that of a canada style agreement that put the pound in a tailspin sending cable below the 1 29 level with negotiations due to formally start on march 3 brexit headlines are likely to be the main driver for sterling over the coming days as it will be extremely quiet on the data front apart from the final uk pmi readings ism pmis and jobs report eyed in the us after february s unexpectedly weak flash pmis by ihs markit investors will be dissecting key data out of the us next week for any signs that growth in the world s largest economy may have already started to falter from the impact of the virus epidemic first on the radar is the ism manufacturing pmi on monday the index is expected to decline slightly to 50 5 in february to hold just above expansionary territory more crucially the ism s non manufacturing gauge that includes the vast services sector is forecast to stay unchanged at 55 5 when released on wednesday in a massive contrast to ihs markit s print of 49 4 which pointed to a contraction in the sector january factory orders are out on thursday before attention turns to the all important nonfarm payrolls report on friday after a solid gain of 225k jobs in january the us economy is projected to have added 178k jobs in february this would represent a notable slowdown but nothing worrying just yet about the labour market average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen by 3 2 year on year while the jobless rate is predicted to hold at 3 6 if the us indicators don t stray too far from the forecasts there could be some paring back of fed rate cut expectations which have soared over the last week as traders price in a high risk of a global recession markets now see the fed lowering rates at least three times this year as the disruptions from the virus outbreak bring economic activity around the world to a standstill the us dollar which only last week hit 3 year highs made a dramatic reversal to the downside as recession fears intensified but if next week s numbers go some way in calming those fears the greenback could in line for a bit of a rebound opec meeting will saudi arabia go it alone opec and its allies known as opec will hold a scheduled meeting on thursday and friday and are likely to agree to additional output cuts as the demand outlook for oil continues to deteriorate in the face of a long term impact on the global economy from the coronavirus but there are doubts as to whether the alliance will be able to agree to lower production caps as key member russia does not appear to have yet come around to the idea even as oil prices slump to more than one year lows russia had rebuffed attempts to hold an emergency meeting earlier in february and its refusal to back new output reductions could force saudi arabia to go it alone with some other arab nations possibly joining it the lack of unity among the major producers does not bode well for oil so anything less than the recommended cut of 600 000 bpd will not do much in boosting prices

with a net worth of at least 16 million for single individuals or 32 million for married filers warren would impose a 2 wealth tax on net worth between 50 million and 1 billion and a 6 wealth tax on net worth greater than 1 billion the chart below compares the two proposals sanders s proposal warren s proposal tax rates for married filers 1 tax on net worth of 32 million to 50 million 2 tax on

wyden s cory booker s and julián castro s mark to market proposals sen ron wyden d ore and presidential candidates mayor pete buttigieg sen cory booker d n j julián castro and warren have each proposed mark to market taxes on wealthy and high income individuals each of these proposals would tax unrealized gains in publicly traded property and would impose an additional tax upon the sale of nontraded property each of the proposals would also increase the capital gains rate so that it is equal to the ordinary income rate for these taxpayers ron wyden s mark to market proposal wyden s mark to market proposal would apply to individuals estates or trusts with income in excess of 1 million or assets exceeding 10 million in each of the three prior tax years for purposes of determining whether the 10 million asset test is satisfied the first 2 million of combined value of a taxpayer s primary and secondary personal residences would be excluded the value of a taxpayer s operating family farm would be included only to the extent it exceeds 5 million and the first 3 million of a taxpayer s retirement savings would excluded these taxpayers would be required to mark to market their publicly traded assets on an annual basis and pay a tax on any appreciation or take a loss on any depreciation at the end of the tax year as if they had been sold in addition a look back charge would be imposed on gains from non publicly traded assets like closely held businesses investment real estate and art and collectibles upon a realization event which would generally include any transfers of these types of property or the death of the owner the look back charge would minimize any benefit of deferring the tax until disposition of the asset however the proposal requests comments as to whether the look back charge should be an interest charge on deferred tax a yield based tax or a surtax based on an asset s holding period proceeds from the primary and secondary residences of a taxpayer only in excess of 2 million and proceeds from a family farm only in excess of 5 million would be subject to the look back charge rule wyden s proposal would not apply to assets held in tax preferred savings accounts which would continue to be taxed in the same manner as under current law wyden s proposal would also include transition rules that would require taxpayers to pay tax on pre proposal built in gains over an unspecified period publicly traded corporations would generally not be subject to wyden s proposal but there would be anti abuse rules that would prevent taxpayers from using a corporation to avoid application of the mark to market rules the wyden proposal would apply the regime at the partner or s corporation shareholder level and an interest in a partnership or s corporation would generally be treated as a nontraded asset cory booker booker has proposed a mark to market tax that would apply in a manner similar to wyden s booker s proposal would impose a mark to market tax on publicly traded assets and a yield based tax upon the sale of non traded assets the yield based tax would result in the same tax as for the owner of publicly traded property assuming each appreciated on a constant basis and the taxpayer sold stock with a value equal to the tax in each year booker s plan would allow taxpayers to prepay taxes to minimize the yield based tax realization for these purposes would include death and transfers to other family members and entities as well as gifts of appreciated property to charities booker s proposal would also repeal section 1031 the like kind exchange which permits taxpayers to exchange real estate tax free booker s mark to market regime would apply only to gains realized after the taxpayer exceeds a 2 million lifetime exemption on combined realized and unrealized gains taxpayers below this threshold would continue to pay taxes on capital gains upon realization rather than under the mark to market regime pete buttigieg and elizabeth warren buttigieg and warren each have proposed a mark to market tax for the wealthiest 1 of individual taxpayers and to tax capital gains and dividends at ordinary income rates for these taxpayers only traded assets would be marked to market a separate but unspecified regime would apply to nontraded assets buttigieg and warren each estimate that this tax would generate over 2 trillion in revenue over 10 years julián castro julián castro has proposed a mark to market system for the wealthiest 0 1 of taxpayers like wyden s and booker s proposals castro s tax would be imposed annually on the unrealized gains of publicly traded securities regardless of whether the securities are sold castro s plan also contemplates an unspecified look back tax on the sale of nontraded property similar to wyden s realization would include death and transfers to family members castro would raise the capital gains tax rate to match ordinary income tax rates for

new revenue the revenue would be used to provide every u s citizen over the age of 18 with a guaranteed income of 1 000 per month regardless of income or employment status which yang calls a freedom dividend income tax proposals michael bennet s and mitt romney s proposal to repeal stepped up basis sens michael bennet d colo and mitt romney r utah have proposed to repeal stepped up basis for investments that are passed to heirs at death subject to an exemption of 1 6 million for individuals and 3 7 million for married couples under current law the basis of property acquired from a decedent is stepped up to the fair market value at death with the result that appreciation in the property during the life of the decedent is not subject to income tax bennet and romney would repeal section 1014 as a result a taxpayer who acquires property from a decedent would receive that property with the decedent s tax basis and upon a sale of that property the taxpayer would pay tax based on the decedent s original tax basis the exemption of 1 6 million for individuals and 3 7 million for married couples is sometimes referred to as a sprinkle basis system similar to the system briefly in place in 2010 and would allow the executor of an estate to sprinkle additional basis to assets passing from a decedent joe biden former vice president joe biden would restore the top individual income tax rate to 39 6 from 37 would tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income 39 6 rather than 20 under current law for taxpayers who earn more than 1 million and would tax unrealized capital

000 45 on income between 500 000 and 2 million 50 on income between 2 million and 10 million 52 on income above 10 million sanders also proposes to cap itemized deductions at 28 for households making over 250 000 and to repeal the 20 pass through deduction sanders would also tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for households making over 250 000 sanders proposes to restore the corporate tax rate to 35 from 21 currently treat large master limited and other partnerships as corporations for tax purposes eliminate expensing and accelerated depreciation for corporations so that investments are depreciated based on their economic life sanders would also limit the interest deductions of corporations to 20 of adjusted taxable income and tighten the related party rules sanders would also revise the international tax rules by taxing worldwide income at the u s corporate rate i e sanders would repeal the 10 5 gilti rate and apply a per country limit on foreign tax credits i e disallow cross crediting sanders would further restrict inversions by limiting interest deductions presumably only for inverted corporations to 105 of a u s corporation s share of net interest expense over worldwide income presumably based on the group s income sanders would also treat companies that are managed and controlled in the united states as domestic corporations and would drastically expand the definition of an inverted corporation to one owned by 50 of the same presumably u s shareholders after a merger sanders would retain the base erosion and anti abuse tax beat but increase the rate to 17 5 from 10 and exclude deductible payments that give rise to includable u s income he would repeal the reduced 13 125 tax rate for foreign derived intangible income fdii and deny u s foreign tax credits for excise tax payments by oil extractive gambling and other companies finally sanders would require corporations with revenues over 25 million to publicly disclose significant portions of their tax returns and country by country financial information elizabeth warren warren has several proposals to increase taxes on individuals and corporations that would raise revenue for

earnings would be subject to a country by country minimum tax at the same rate of 35 on a worldwide basis foreign corporations would also subject to u s tax based on their u s sales which would be equal to what they would have owed if they were subject to a country by country minimum tax warren would also eliminate immediate expensing of investments for corporations and require them to depreciate or amortize investments based on the investment s economic life warren has also proposed a 7 surtax on corporations with worldwide profits exceeding 100 million this new surtax would be separate from the existing corporate tax warren estimates that amazon would pay 698 million in taxes if the surtax was adopted amy klobuchar to finance her higher education plan sen amy klobuchar proposes raising taxes on capital gains and dividends for taxpayers in the two highest income tax brackets she would also impose a 30 minimum tax on people earning more than 1 million alexandria ocasio cortez and jan schakowsky ocasio cortez s and schakowsky s bill will would increase the top marginal individual income tax rate to 59 they estimate that when combined with federal payroll taxes and state and local taxes the effective income tax rate for taxpayers who earn over 10 million would be 70 this increase in individual income tax rate to 59 is estimated to raise about 2 trillion or more over a decade financial transaction tax proposals kamala harris sanders warren and andrew yang have each proposed financial transaction taxes on trades of stocks bonds and derivatives sanders would apply a 0 5 tax for stocks a 0 1 tax for bonds and a 0 005 for derivatives and would provide an income tax credit to offset the financial transaction tax for taxpayers with income of less than 50 000 or 75 000 for couples kamala harris financial transactions tax is similar to sanders except that her tax rate would be lower than his 0 2 for stock trades and 0 002 for payments under derivative contracts and she has not indicated whether any taxpayers would be exempt from the tax sanders estimates that his proposal would raise over 2 4 trillion in revenue over 10 years and harris projects that her tax would raise over 2 trillion over that period yang has also proposed a 0 1 tax on financial transactions yang projects that this tax would raise 50 billion in revenue per year and would finance his freedom dividend warren would also impose a 0 1 tax on the sale of stocks bonds and derivatives that would be assessed and collected on financial firms warren estimates that this tax would generate over 800 billion in revenue between 2020 and 2029 proposals for additional taxes beto o rourke s war tax beto o rourke d texas has proposed an additional war tax as part of a broader initiative to improve care for veterans each congressionally authorized war would trigger a separate war tax covering the entire duration of combat activities the revenue generated from the war tax would go into a new trust for veterans established at the outset of each war the trust funds would support hospital care medical services disability compensation and any other programs directly related to the care of veterans of that war the war tax would be levied on households without current or veteran members of the armed forces and implemented on a progressive basis as shown below the policy has no stated exemptions for low income taxpayers adjusted gross income of the taxpayer amount of tax less than 30 000 25 at least 30 000 but less than 40 000 57 at least 40 000 but less than

sanders has also proposed to impose additional taxes on corporations based on the ratio of its ceo s compensation and its median employees compensation his plan would apply to publicly and privately held companies with annual revenue of 100 million or more 0 5 between 50 and 100 to 1 1 for ratios between 100 and 200 to 1 2 for ratios between 200 and 300 to 1 3 for ratios between 300 and 400 to 1 4 for ratios between 400 and 500 to 1 5 for ratios over 500 to 1 sanders estimates that if median worker pay is increased to 60 000 a year and ceo pay is capped at 3 million no additional tax would result however if corporate behavior does not change sanders estimates that the proposal would generate an additional 150 billion in revenue over a decade this revenue would be used to pay for sanders proposal to eliminate medical debt elizabeth warren s social security tax warren has proposed a new 14 8 contribution requirement on annual earnings of 250 000 or 400 000 for joint filers split evenly between employers and employees she would also impose a separate 14 8 tax on net investment income of taxpayers who meet those thresholds the revenue would be used to fund the social security trust fund and permit current and future recipients of social security to receive an additional 200 in monthly benefits elizabeth warren s lobbying tax warren has proposed that companies and organizations that spend between 500 000 and 1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35 tax on those expenditures lobbying expenditures over 1 million would be subject to a 60 tax and lobbying expenditures over 5 million would be subject to a 75 tax gift estate tax proposals mike bloomberg mike bloomberg would lower the threshold value of estates subject to the estate tax to an unspecified amount cory booker booker also has proposed to restore the estate tax structure to 2009 levels and rates by lowering the threshold value of estates subject to the tax to 7 million for married taxpayers from the current 22 8 million threshold bernie sanders sanders would also reduce the threshold value of estates subject to estate tax to 7 million for married taxpayers in addition the existing flat 40 estate tax rate would be replaced with the following progressive rates 45 for the value of an estate between 3 5 million and 10 million 50 for the value of an estate between 10 million and 50 million 55 for the value of an estate in excess of 50 million an additional 10 surtax would apply to estate value in excess of 500 million 1 billion for married couples sanders also proposes to 1 change the rules for grantor retained annuity trusts grats and other types of trusts and valuation techniques and 2 increase existing protections for farmland and conservation julián castro julián castro would replace the estate and gift tax with an income and payroll tax on inheritances in excess of a 2 million lifetime exemption castro estimates that the new inheritance tax would generate 250 billion in revenue over 10 years discussion warren s and sanders wealth tax proposals each apply only to the wealthiest americans and have no effect on other taxpayers if the wealth tax proposals were enacted without changes to the income tax taxpayers subject to them who earn current income would be subject to both the income tax and the wealth tax with respect to that income however taxpayers who hold and do not sell appreciated assets would be subject only to the wealth tax thus the proposals retain the current disparate tax treatment between capital and labor also the wealth tax requires annual valuations and is subject to constitutional challenge on the other hand because the wealth tax generates revenue each year it is more likely to raise revenue even when faced with the possibility of repeal by a future congress buttigieg s and warren s mark to market taxes apply to the wealthiest 1 of individuals wyden s and booker s mark to market proposals would apply to fewer taxpayers than buttigieg s or warren s castro s proposal is limited to the top 0 1 wealthiest individuals each of the proposals would impose tax on appreciated holdings but not on labor which is currently subject to current tax at the highest marginal rates thus the proposals generally equalize the tax treatment of labor and capital each of the mark to market proposals would be relatively easy to apply to publicly traded assets but would be more complicated to apply to non traded assets mark to market taxation is widely believed to be constitutional but still may be subject to challenge a look back regime or yield based tax for nontraded assets may raise less revenue if taxpayers anticipate that it will be repealed by a future congress and delay realization until after repeal yang s vat would apply to all americans including low and middle income taxpayers although vats are generally regressive the regressive effect of yang s vat is offset somewhat by the use of the revenue to pay his freedom dividend the financial transaction taxes proposed by harris sanders warren and yang would fall disproportionately on the wealthy who have more financial assets but it would also be borne by foreigner taxpayers who hold about 20 of u s long term securities a financial transactions tax does not present significant valuation difficulties because the tax is imposed when the securities are sold or exchange it also would not face constitutional challenge however it could affect market liquidity and would be borne to some extent by the middle class biden s and bloomberg s proposals are significantly less radical than the other candidates they would not impose a wealth tax or mark to market tax and instead would only impose realization upon death only bloomberg would impose a surtax on earners of more than 5 million bloomberg and biden would also increase the corporate rate but only to 28 rather than 35 biden s 15 minimum tax is less severe than warren s 7 surtax and he alone would repeal the 10 000 cap on the state and local tax deduction although he would also reduce the value of deductions to 28 for high income individuals the romney bennet proposal to repeal stepped up basis represents the most modest proposal it would end the current ability of taxpayers to entirely avoid income tax upon death but it would permit taxpayers to indefinitely defer paying tax on appreciated assets and

kids play with blocks in a classroom at kimball elementary school during the ample free time provided as part of washington d c s public preschool programs credit lillian mongeau the hechinger report update april 29 2020 since this story was first published in late february the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged child care programs across the nation especially in hard hit east coast cities four and a half million child care slots could be lost nationally nearly half of the currently available stock according to a recent analysis by the center for american progress given that the country was already short on child care slots this would be a massive blow to parents trying to find child care when the economy reopens in late april democratic senators renewed a push for child care relief funding they d like to see 50 billion allocated to provide care for the children of frontline workers and protect child care payrolls from the federal government but so far those pleas have not led to any action this story also appeared in nbc news with tens of millions of families now out of work and millions more trying to work from home while caring for young children 2020 is turning out to be far from the working moms moment coronavirus has pulled back the veil between workers professional existence and their home lives and women again seem to be suffering the most disproportionally represented in the care and service industries women make up the majority of essential workers single mothers a growing group faces special challenges and experts have predicted that women working from home will continue to shoulder more of the child care burden than their male partners the upcoming election will still be important to the fate of working women in america though it is hard to say how other than adding to the federal child care subsidy fund in 2017 president donald trump has paid little attention to child care and presumptive democratic nominee joe biden has yet to state a firm position despite everything that has changed in the last two months this story about how we got to this point and what solutions may help us change course is still relevant to anyone hoping to understand how america might chart a path forward that would lead to a healthier environment for young children and their working parents washington d c ameykay stocks a mail carrier and mother of five has sent all of her children now ages 5 to 16 to her local public schools here from the year they turned 3 few families in america have such an option nationally only 68 percent of 4 year olds and 40 percent of 3 year olds were enrolled in preschool in 2017 according to the national center for education statistics most but not all preschool programs receive some public funding which makes it difficult to say exactly how many students benefit from such funding according to steve barnett co director of the national institute for early education research hardly any children younger than 3 are enrolled in publicly funded child care of any kind these percentages are low compared to the rest of the developed world according the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd but washington d c is one of a growing number of cities to offer public preschool and it is more generous than most all 4 year olds and most 3 year olds living here regardless of income get a spot in a free public preschool program and though district officials say they are still working on improving the program city wide stocks has been thrilled with what her children have learned she s mastered puzzles on her own stocks said of her now 5 year old she s not into electronics more with the whole fantasy land of kitchen and playing with pots and pans last year she had a whole pet center and was playing chef and taking orders stocks and her husband a sign installer expect all five of their children to attend college she credits some of the kids academic success to having a highly qualified classroom teacher since the age of 3 but the children aren t the only ones who ve benefitted when her oldest child justina was born stocks was working at macy s and kay jewelers and having trouble affording the 68 a week she owed for day care after receiving child care subsidies for low income families from the city the day care offered long hours but stocks needed multiple forms of public transportation to get there then to her two jobs and then back in time to get justina some days she d end up spending 20 she could ill afford on a taxi to get back in time 337 to 495 billion one estimate of the cost of a fully funded high quality universal early education system things became easier in the fall of 2007 when justina then 3 was first eligible for the preschool program at nearby garfield elementary the school was easier to reach the cost of day care justina still went in the mornings before school dropped and stocks was happier with the quality of care it relieved a lot of stress off of me stocks said we ve had mr carter he s been there since justina was in kindergarten and he s had my last child he s wonderful stocks solution is unusual but her need is not nationally 71 percent of mothers with children younger than 18 work and 65 percent of women with children younger than 6 do according to the bureau of labor statistics in fact the percentage of women with children under 18 who participate in the work force is higher than that of any other group of women in addition 67 percent of children under age 6 have either two working parents or a single parent who works according to the most recent data from kids count a database containing statistics about american children this means a lot of kids 21 3 million of them according to the national center for education statistics are cared for regularly by someone other than their mother related how cities are convincing voters to pay higher taxes for public preschool two girls answer their teachers questions on a book about apples during their preschool class at kimball elementary school in washington d c credit lillian mongeau the hechinger report despite these overwhelming numbers the federal government does little to subsidize child care that hurts working moms who are more likely than working dads to leave their jobs when they can t find child care according to a survey conducted by the liberal think tank center for american progress and working moms were 40 percent more likely than working dads to say that child care issues had negatively affected their careers at the same time working moms earn just 71 cents for every dollar earned by working dads according to an analysis by the national women s law center compounding the wage gap is the country s lack of paid parental leave which sets it apart from the rest of the developed world and disproportionately affects working moms if women work it s difficult to earn enough to afford child care but if they take time out of the workforce both their family s short and long term financial stability are harmed by that choice we don t have the supports that women need to stay in the workforce consistently if they want to said julie vogtman the director of job quality at the national women s law center which argues that the dual roles of child care providing both education for children and work support for women are equally important if women work it s difficult to earn enough to afford child care but if they take time out of the workforce both their family s short and long term financial stability are harmed by that choice the female workforce is shrinking and the birth rate is slowing neither of which are good for the country s bottom line american women have been leaving the workplace slowly but steadily for the past two decades and have lost their long held international lead just 57 percent of women work now compared to a high of 60 percent in 1990 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics women have been having fewer children year over year for about the same amount of time even though many report wanting more children than they have of adults ages 20 to 45 who wanted more children 64 percent cited the cost of child care as their primary reason for curtailing their family size according to a 2018 survey by the new york times led by sen elizabeth warren once a single working mom herself the democratic presidential candidates are taking notice of these trends three of the leading candidates warren sen bernie sanders and sen amy klobuchar mentioned the importance of expanding child care during the south carolina debate there s no doubt that warren s real life predicament in 1978 she was a recent law school grad and the divorced mother of two children has fueled her conviction that universal child care is a national necessity warren s solution as she has frequently recounted on the campaign trail flew in from oklahoma in the form of her aunt bee but mary poppins like aunts are in short supply instead warren has insisted since early 2019 that what working mothers need is a national policy that would provide them with free child care 71 percent proportion of millennial voters in favor of spending more public funds on child care in february 2020 sanders followed suit he released an even more expensive plan that would create universal child care and preschool for every young american regardless of his or her family s income warren s proposal includes a sliding scale fee to be paid by higher income families to defray the cost to the federal government like warren sanders is now calling for higher wages for child care providers and higher standards for their qualifications right now the idea of free high quality child care for every kid is just as crazy a pipe dream for most working moms as an actual british nanny floating through their window clutching a talking umbrella teacher irene taguian leads a 4 year old preschool class at lafayette elementary school in an upscale neighborhood of washington d c credit lillian mongeau the hechinger report but in some states such as oklahoma and west virginia and a few cities including new york and washington d c free preschool is becoming a reality universal preschool doesn t solve the whole problem but it makes public education available to children younger than five while closing some of the child care gap related finding a good preschool isn t easy try it d c s preschool program with its offer of publicly funded full day care for 3 and 4 year old children was responsible for increasing the city s maternal labor force by 10 percentage points from 2008 to 2017 according to research published in 2018 by the center for american progress researchers determined that the bump in employment affected women at both the upper and lower ends of the pay scale interestingly those in the middle already a highly employed group did not see much change mary charles and her husband who have one child live in washington d c she is an it manager at a government office building and he is a government contractor they are firmly middle income earners in their city and say paying for child care in the years before their daughter could start preschool was a big stretch this issue has come to the head in the last couple years because families can t make ends meet with one full time worker it was 20 000 a year and that s considered not expensive charles said for us that was a significant part of our budget to make more money they rented out their basement which meant sharing their kitchen and charles husband dj d on the weekends for extra cash they were not eligible for income based child care subsidies charles said the availability of public preschool which charles said has exceeded her expectations for quality was a large part of their decision to stay in the city rather than moving to the otherwise cheaper suburbs i think it should be available more places charles said nixon s rejection of the bill reinforced the still widely held belief that if a woman works it is up to her to arrange for a suitable substitute to care for her children although where poor women are concerned legislators seem to forget about the supposed benefit of their staying home with children we as a society are making a value judgment about who should be working vogtman said there has been an expectation that low income women women of color would and should go to work and white women middle class women should stay home with their children this judgement signed off on by both the left and the right has cleared the way for 50 years of targeted child care and preschool policies that divide working moms into two camps with different priorities and challenges bags and jackets hang in cubbies at lafayette elementary school one of the many locations 4 year olds in washington d c can receive a free preschool education credit lillian mongeau the hechinger report accordingly most children with working parents are not eligible for subsidized child care on any significant scale until the school year following their fifth birthday the federal funding that does exist about 22 2 billion is meant to help poor families cover child care costs but only one in six eligible families get the aid because there is not enough money for all of them and that figure does not take into account the many families who earn more than 85 percent of their state s median income and are therefore ineligible for federal help but are still unable to cover the cost of child care now that middle class moms are facing many of the same challenges low income moms have faced for decades unaffordable unavailable or unsatisfactory care for their children while they must work to put food on the table the needs of the two groups may be aligning in ways that could drive real change this issue has come to the head in the last couple years because families can t make ends meet with one full time worker said elise gould a senior economist at the economic policy institute a think tank people are beginning to realize that it s not their fault or an inability to manage their own finances that is making the cost of child care unaffordable for them 46 percent proportion of child care workers who receive some kind of public assistance meanwhile the women who do provide most of the nation s young children with care often live on the edge of poverty the median wage for early childhood educators is 11 17 per hour or 23 240 per year according to the u s bureau of labor statistics nearly half 46 percent make so little that they qualify for some form of public assistance including food stamps medicaid and child care subsidies according to the center for the study of childcare employment at the university of california berkeley both warren s and sanders plans would address the qualifications and pay of child care providers and preschool teachers in addition to offering subsidized care to a broader swath of the public on a smaller scale so would the child care for working families act of 2019 sponsored by sen patty murray of washington and rep bobby scott of virginia both democrats the bill boasted 174 co sponsors including rep chris smith of new jersey a republican and democratic presidential primary candidate klobuchar but has not made it out of committee all of these plans depend on the federal government spending significantly more money i absolutely would be willing to pay higher taxes not just so that my own kids could attend pre k but also to give the same opportunity to other kids and other moms in my position president donald trump has presided over one of the most significant increases to subsidized child care funding more than 3 billion since fiscal year 2017 and though republicans in general are supportive of expanding child care subsidies making the bolder democratic plans a reality would require a new wealth tax that is unlikely to gain conservative support the economic policy institute report that calculated current federal spending at 22 billion per year estimated that a national early childhood system that compensated caretakers in line with k 12 teachers and served all age eligible children would cost 337 to 495 billion a year the report also predicts increased tax revenues from moms returning to work and providers earning higher incomes warren s plan at an estimated cost of 1 07 trillion over the coming decade would cost less on an annual basis her proposal includes a privately funded off set in the form of higher income families kicking in a portion of the cost for their kids to attend the programs sanders plan which his campaign has estimated would 1 5 trillion would not include the private offset a poster lists the rules in teacher pyrrha hallums 4 year old preschool class at kimball elementary school in washington d c credit lillian mongeau the hechinger report still plans as bold as theirs are what s needed to really jolt the economy according to experts i get how you think you might want to expand eligibility on the margins gould said of politicians tendency to propose incremental solutions but offering subsidies only to the poorest families saves the government money but doesn t get at the workforce issues for the providers or the parents she said increasingly no one is left out of the delicate balance of how to afford having kids ensure they are well cared for and work the hours necessary to make a living jamie smith is a lawyer by training but hasn t worked full time in law since her oldest now 13 was born with severe disabilities the mother of four said securing a place for her youngest now 4 in her local public school s preschool program in washington d c marks the first

australian dollar closes at an 11 year low against the us china slowdown concerns strike at the resource based economy the aussie was lower for both economic and safety reasons the aussie fell to its lowest level against the us dollar in almost eleven years this week as concerns over the coronavirus induced slowdown in china and by extension the world struck hard at the outlook for the resource based economy technically the future has been ordained since last thursday when the aussie broke through support at 0 6660 which had been the low for 11 years and had been reached but not crossed in august and october last year and again early in february friday s close at 0 6509 brings the australian dollar back to the level of march 12 2009 at the nadir of the reaction to the financial crisis the aussie has been under a two year siege as the us china trade war exacted an ever increasing toll on its economy and sentiment the brief rise from 0 6700 in early october to just over 0 7000 as the year changed has turned to ashes as the potential benefit from the us china trade pact was subsumed in the mainland health crisis and its still unknown economic costs while the aussie s heavily oversold position in most technical indicators would normally presage a bounce the emotion and safety driven nature of the recent move argues that fear needs to abate before the currency can recover

reversion tendency of all markets they do not however negate the fears that are stalking global markets and the australian dollar
i would like for any journalist or other democrat to tell the public which of obama s or any other democrat s policies are meant to help the private sector as a whole instead of a specific special interest group or the government democrat operatives posing as journalists know how unpopular democrat policies are so they attempt to mislead the public into believing that some of their presidential candidates are running as moderates they are not everyone running seeks to confiscate more power and money from the people to move toward a more autocratic powerful government democrats call themselves progressives but everything they seek to do cascades the economy backward toward collapse it s as if they never learned anything from history or don t care because they just want power it is truly sad that highly paid professors teach children a load of crap so that they believe socialism is good almost everyone also gives obama credit for bringing the country out of the severe recession of 2008 even though facts clearly show that the steps and policies were in place for recovery before he took office there were essentially three major things that caused the recession to end before obama s policies took effect the first was that the federal reserve substantially lowered interest rates and massively injected mountains of liquidity into the economy in 2008 they kept rates near zero throughout obama s eight years the lower rates also substantially helped the budget by reducing current and potential interest expense the second was that in the fall of 2008 while bush was still president congress passed tarp the troubled asset relief program to provide temporary loans totaling 750 billion mostly to financial entities to prevent absolute collapse the loans were counted as expenses in the budget instead of assets so they artificially pushed up the deficit in fy2009 and artificially lowered deficits under obama as the government made a profit on tarp the repayment of loans plus massive receipts from fannie and freddie masked the massive spending increase under obama in the operating budget obama also took credit for reducing the deficit the third massive piece to the recovery was oil prices in the summer of 2008 speculators jacked up the prices of crude oil to over 130 per barrel and around 4 per gallon for gasoline 5 in some places these prices served as a massive depressant on the economy harming all businesses and greatly harming the poor and middle class airlines and travel were decimated we heard experts talking about oil going to 200 per barrel as for the umpteenth time we heard the lie about peak oil that we were running out obama famously said his policies would bankrupt coal companies and cause utility and gas prices to skyrocket he clearly didn t mind the harm his policies would do to the overall economy and especially the poor and middle class whom he always pretended to care about obama along with many others also said we couldn t drill drill drill our way to energy independence that showed pure economic ignorance president bush in july 2008 lifted a 1990 executive order by george h w bush banning offshore drilling while at the same time calling for drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge the issue of offshore drilling became central in the 2008 presidential election not least because of the oil price increases since 2003 by january 2009 the speculators had run for the hills and crude oil was below 40 and the average price per gallon was below 2 the economy all businesses and all people had been given a great goose the economy was clearly poised for a recovery one of the first things obama did as president in february 2009 was to again block drilling showing that he is a very slow learner and doesn t really care about the poor or the overall economy he also blocked pipelines that passed environmental muster the economy entered the recovery stage in june 2009 around 130 days after obama took office which was clearly before any of obama s policies could have had more than a minimal effect if any so why do we repeatedly hear that obama s policies gave us the economic recovery when it clearly isn t true obama did get bipartisan support for a 900 billion stimulus plan in february 2009 where he promised shovel ready jobs and put the brilliant biden in charge the stimulus plan did a few things it was called temporary but served the purpose of pushing up the baseline budget which greatly harmed the long term budget trajectory it rewarded political supporters like unions and bundlers but even obama admitted in 2010 that the shovel ready jobs were not there president obama s policies of high taxes and massive new regulations gave the u s the slowest economic recovery in seventy years despite almost zero interest rates and massive federal reserve intervention we did get a lot more people on food stamps and disability we got stagnant wages especially for those at the bottom it has seemed like an odd goal for a country that likes economic prosperity to support policies that make more people dependent on government instead of giving more people the opportunity to move up the economic ladder but that is what most journalists and other democrats support there were two very good things in the economy during obama s years and neither was because of his policies the first is that the stock market skyrocketed it skyrocketed because interest rates were near zero and people mutual funds and pension funds were trying to get a higher of return the second is that oil production went up substantially on state lands because of fracking and more drilling two things that obama and other democrats oppose yet obama took credit for the additional production he and his supporters like to lie or they are delusional obama s supposed claim to fame on the economy was the affordable care act he and those supporting this law continually lied through the complicit media to get it passed we were told that you could keep your doctor keep your plan that the law would reduce costs and reduce the deficit these were all obvious lies because the 2 000 page law with 10 000 pages of regulations and 20 new taxes clearly reduced options by taking away freedom of choice it was a dictatorial policy after it passed premiums and out of pocket costs skyrocketed more people had policies but they couldn t afford the deductible and out of pocket expenses when obamacare came up short of funds obama illegally stole funds elsewhere without going through congress he abused his power life expectancy also went down for four straight years obama also seemed to have little concern for opiate abuse which greatly harmed the economy life expectancy also dropped for four straight years after obamacare was implemented when trump took office the u s and world economies were slowing the cbo projected job growth of 1 8 million in trump s first three years we were told that the labor force was aging and that is all we could get economic experts like paul krugman and mark zandi who always shill for democrats predicted a severe recession with millions of job losses instead in the first three years we got around seven million new jobs one million fewer part time jobs a higher labor participation rate a record high around seven million job openings and we finally got rising wages especially for those at the bottom we also got record oil production because of trump s policies and despite rising interest rates we have had soaring stock markets until the current coronavirus scare because of trump s tax cuts we also got stabilized health care insurance rates after trump got rid of the individual mandates despite predictions prices would soar freedom of choice and more competition always work we have a lot of slow earners life expectancy finally ticked back up after getting rid of the individual mandates we also have fewer people on food stamps because more people especially minorities the disabled blue collar workers and the less educated have more economic opportunities and are earning more many categories of workers have reached record low unemployment no president obama it did not take magic to bring back manufacturing jobs it just took good policies we were told that the tax cuts would only help the rich and would cause revenues to go down trillions those were both lies the experts also said trump s tariffs and putting the hammer down on china would cause great harm to the economy and inflation they were wrong as usual why are they called experts and continually quoted as if they know what they are talking about when they are wrong so often think how much better off we are because trump started moving the supply chain away from china before the virus hit after decades of allowing jobs and manufacturers to move without many restrictions it is economically stupid to become so dependent on a power hungry country now which of trump s policies resembles obama s and would cause him or other democrats to state or imply that the current excellent economic situation is because of obama it is not luck that the u s economy is doing so much better than europe and other countries around the world it is because trump s policies focus every day on getting the power and purse back to the people as fast as possible instead of building up the greedy powerful government he is the opposite of the dictator and fascist that he is called raising the mandatory minimum wage to 15 will barely help people in high cost cities like san francisco while it will absolutely destroy job opportunities and the economy in small medium and large cities and rural areas throughout the united states it will cause great harm to the poor minorities the less educated and the disabled it will cause many more people to become dependent on the government which appears to be the goal it is truly a shame that people are either so economically illiterate or don t care that it will greatly compound the income and wealth gap instead of narrowing it going to any form of medicare for all or any version of obamacare where you take away freedom of choice will also destroy millions of jobs and cause great harm throughout the united states but it will make the very wealthy dc area richer and more powerful which is clearly the goal the most harmful policy of all is any form of the green new deal or the paris climate accord where we give up fossil fuels it is and has always been a lie that bureaucrats and politicians can control temperatures sea levels and storm activity if we just hand them billions of dollars we have a billionaire with nine houses running lecturing us on our carbon footprint we have the owner of the washington post having many houses and recently paying 165 million for one saying he will donate 10 billion for climate change so the greenies get off his back we have obama paying 13 million for a coastal house on martha s vineyard where he knows it soon it will be under water if he believes the green propaganda getting rid of fossil fuels will destroy tens of millions of jobs and destroy the economy as a whole and will absolutely reduce our quality and length of life then the democrats try to bribe people into voting for them by saying they will give them free stuff like education education will only be free if fake indians like warren work for free instead of charging 400 000 plus benefits for teaching one class the washington post and other media outlets spew forth lies every day as they campaign for democrats and seek to destroy trump and everyone around him why don t the fact checkers at the wapo call out the lie by obama that the current economy is because of him it is as big a lie as all the lies on obamacare the lie that we only have twelve years before the climate is destroyed the lies about russian collusion the lies that democrats care about the poor the lie about hands up don t shoot the lies about judge kavanaugh the lies about the white christian boys are racists the continuous lies that hillary and the bidens aren t corrupt or the lies about trump and charlottesville the fact checkers aren t fact checkers at all they are sycophants spewing forth talking points of the leftists while pretending that some are moderates or centrists they are not

federal reserve officials and their global counterparts are staring down an economic threat unlike any they have ever faced as markets look to them to contain the fallout from a rapidly spreading virus with limited ammunition and tools ill suited to deal with broken supply chains and quarantined consumers no playbook exists for dealing with the economic threat posed by the coronavirus which has already shuttered factories and impaired companies across the globe the outbreak has sickened more than 86 000 people and has been spreading rapidly outside of china where it first surfaced japan south korea iran and italy are all battling major outbreaks in many cases imposing quarantines to contain the spread that has disrupted supply chains forcing companies like apple and toyota to idle factories in china and grounding airlines as consumers stayed home sending stock prices plunging in the best case scenario the virus is quickly contained and the global economy suffers a hiccup the american economy is in its 11th year of an expansion and many economists believe that the underlying fundamentals remain strong and that growth will continue helping to insulate the united states from a big shock

virus epidemic carnagie endowment for international peace notes that when sars hit in 2002 and 2003 china was the source of 8 percent of all the manufacturing goods exported worldwide by 2018 this figure had ballooned to 19 percent in a lopsided fashion the world has become more dependent on china economically even as china has become less dependent on the rest of the world many countries now import more chinese made intermediate goods which they then use as components to make finished goods to be shipped overseas this means that any disruptions to chinese manufacturing supply chains often create enormous global domino effects china has held its own economic vulnerability vis à vis other countries in check across many manufacturing sectors the country has managed to remain increasingly

though the projected decline in expected gdp growth is lowest for japan the impact will be larger in some respects because it is the largest economy in asia outside of china that means the nominal gdp

among china s neighbors behind only that of south korea from that vantage point south korean and japanese firms will feel the biggest impact the report also predicts vietnam will be affected the most due to its high dependence on chinese supply chains but its sharp overall growth rate more than 7 percent in 2019 provides a partial buffer meanwhile the impact on the economies of hong kong and singapore will be more severe given that they were already experiencing a slow pace of growth due to structural weaknesses even before the crisis unfolded indirectly japan and south korea are also

markings in the short to medium term as described above has never been witnessed by the writer over the many past decades in the context of the external environmental challenges spreading out nearly in all of the key economic driver nations the important question to raise is have our stubbornly insular leaders in politics governance business academia professions religions and media taken cognizance of the above recognizing that sri lanka is an itself facing a significantly heightened challenge in managing its external debt the prime minister has appealed for a three year moratorium in debt repayments from india stating that such a grant will lead to similar concessions from china whilst signaling sri lanka s willingness to enter in to a new programme of support from the imf based on terms consistent with the macro economic policies of the new regime it is deeply regrettable that in the face of significantly heightened external and internal risks our leaders continue to articulate insular outlook driven pronouncements and are taking governance actions connected with the control of internal security risks as the top priority retaining independence sovereignty and not tolerance of external influences and foreign dictates unwillingness to honour international obligations under subscribed to conventions international relations being driven by popular mandate of voters seeing international conspiracies to grab land and rich resources of the nation abhorring trade agreements suspending foreign shareholder entity registrations taxation reforms which are unaffordable and debt management negative depending on the fiscal stimuli to generate in isolation growth in the economy and new job creations national reconciliation based on prosperity through security and development frowning on judicial reviews and actions of independent commissions being inconsistent with people s aspirations quarrelling over sandanaya s and symbols seeking regular blessings and advise on governance and policy from religious leaders seeking a two third majority in parliament and deployment of armed services personnel in key civilian jobs as a way to improve governance effectiveness appointing commissions of inquiry on political victimization and national reconciliation describing the coronavirus scare as western media hype initiatives in winning votes and religious dignitary support etc in examining challenging issues afresh in forging ahead with its agenda for prosperity through security and development and finding home grown solutions to overcome contemporary challenges in the best interest of all sri lankans have our leaders excluded from their visionary focus the emerging external risks described before and also failed to bear in mind that sri lanka is an import dependent country without independent food and medicines security and energy supply assurance a significant savings gap crying out for foreign direct investments in spurring growth and generating new job opportunities the essential need for adopting a clear non aligned policy linked to fostering closest relations with india need to control the trade deficit and rapidly enhance export earnings need to preserve foreign worker remittances and grow services income need to effectively manage the external debt and associated management of the trade deficit external reserves exchange rate risks inflation and the sovereign credit rating currently just above junk bond status exploit locational advantage and value bearing sea routes and maritime hub options exploitation of bay of bengal and law of the sea extended resources these leaders appear to be blind to challenges of the aging population malnutrition need for change management in moving out of sectors with low productivity quality and competitiveness low level of preparedness to have skilled workforce to serve the needs of the fourth industrial revolution and link up with the next generation itc and artificial intelligence research innovation and creativity being out of priority focus when will realism and urgency force our leaders to wake up and collectively address the external and internal risks with professionalism and commitment who will impress on leaders the importance of what jack welch said face reality as it is not as it was or as you wish it to be control your own destiny or someone else will when the rate of change inside an institution becomes slower than the rate of change outside the end is in sight the only question is when

it has been a lifetime that somehow the handlers of our economy haven t struck the right solutions to not only steady the economy but to make it grow as was expected pakistanis crave for the much needed prosperity that we enviously see in other countries that started late and started badly the reasons they advanced are too numerous and varied all are generally escape arguments to deflect blame and justify dysfunctional policies the present government raised expectations and nurtured hope however its handling of the economy is subpar to say the least economic jargon aside there are some common sense observations that need common sense answers the problems of the balance of payments current account deficit tax collection higher interest rate currency devaluation and fatf would be discussed in these pages first the balance of payments our government s expenses often exceed earnings resulting in its inability to pay for imports and service the external debt the income expense gap is filled by borrowing from local and foreign lenders alongside austerity measures quite precariously last year 2018 19 the mark up on the government s outstanding debt exceeded its total revenue for the first time in our history by a whopping rs53 billion implying that the country was run on borrowed money in the broad revenue distribution around 50 goes to debt servicing 8 9 is for pensions etc and another 13 14 is for salaries civil and military the pension expenditure alone has increased five folds from rs85 billion in 2009 10 to around rs421 billion in 2019 20 all this and other essential and fixed expenses eat up to 110 of the net federal revenue there is hardly any money left for development military upgradation and running the government for which the government resorts to new loans administratively the federal government is entitled to 42 5 from the divisible pool but draws around 67 and still does not have enough money this situation warrants federal provincial resource re distribution under the nfc award rationalising the disproportionate government expenditure and cutting down the size of the government however the pti government is also making up for revenue shortfall through imf dictated measures like optimising tax collection increasing utilities and fuel costs raising interest rates and resorting to currency devaluation all of which seem to have backfired these measures are standard imf antidotes called monetary approach to the balance of payment inspired from the chicago school of thought more suited to developed economies rather than developing countries in our analysis of these measures first is tax collection the targets given by the imf to the fbr being non reflective of the situation on ground repeatedly remain unattainable the vigorous collection methods have eroded whatever is left of a business friendly environment and further depleted the tax revenue and gdp growth the fbr asked the imf review mission recently to set the fy20 tax collection target at rs4 5 4 7 trillion as per its expectations the imf agreed to relax the original target of rs5 5 trillion down to rs5 2 trillion the net shortfall would entail government borrowing and deeper cuts in the developmental expense it is felt that if the government efficiently collects the sales tax that every pakistani pays to millions of businesses controls the fbr corruption and boosts non tax revenue the situation can be turned around floating international bonds and imposing agricultural tax are some other options second is the higher interest rate the killer of growth due to higher mark up the private sector is not borrowing from banks consequently producing less and therefore paying less tax people with money prefer fixed term monthly bank deposits to reap easy profits rather than investing in property and business this has caused retrenchments reduced new hiring and triggered unemployment further decreasing the tax revenue the low productivity is dragging down gdp growth for the year pushing it down to the imf s projected level of 2 4 from the government expectation of 3 5 proponents of higher interest rate consider it lucrative for capital inflows or hot money but conversely it runs the risk of capital flight and currency destabilisation once the interest rate is jacked up and the hot money leaves third the massive depreciation of currency by up to 35 has played real havoc done with the intent to reduce imports and boost exports it has boomeranged limiting the import bill has also limited tax revenue dwindling imports especially the industrial raw material has affected large scale manufacturing slowing industrial output and job creation and reducing business productivity in an import driven economy like ours the rising cost of imports has caused spiraling inflation reducing import led consumption and production resulting in unemployment those affected are the young pti voters in a demographically young pakistan the cumulative effect already exacerbated by a high interest rate has been recession the exchange rate stability is also owed to borrowed foreign exchange remittances incoming loans aid etc with external debt servicing pressure remaining intact depreciation has registered a minuscule increase of 352 million in exports which increased from 11 181 billion in the first half of fy19 to 11 533 billion in the first half fy20 falling income levels and stubbornly high and rising inflation have adversely affected consumption of domestically produced stuff and the retail sector in january 2020 the annual consumer inflation rose to a staggering 14 6 almost three times higher than the 5 6 last year domestic budgets are in a tailspin and the public initially willing to give time to the new government has become increasingly disillusioned in a nutshell the economy is hit hard by the double whammy of increased cost of capital due to the high interest rate and increased cost of production due to rupee depreciation and restrictive import regime our economic managers would do well to immediately reduce the interest rate by a good margin to bolster the sagging confidence of the business community the recent signals from islamabad are encouraging however those with conspiratorial bend smell a rat they speculate that persisting with a high interest rate is to lay the ground work for the next imf programme a standard practice by the imf team now entrenched in our financial institutions the policymakers only concern is to return the debt instalments with interest to the lending institutions without any regard for the social repercussions of their policies lastly some input on our informal economy ie pakistan is run on the resilience of our ie which though undocumented remains larger than the formal economy there is a view that documenting the ie would leave us at the mercy of the imf wb and their western patrons with understandable implications therefore the government needs to heed the proposal of fixed tax by traders and small merchants rather than yielding to the elite driven policies that remains beholden to the west constituting a new economic team even by reaching across the aisle is the need of the hour perhaps we could still wriggle out of this financial quagmire by pursuing growth friendly and politically sustainable policies the tall claims of the pti are confronted by an indomitable make or break challenge published in the express tribune february 27 2020 like opinion editorial on facebook follow etoped on twitter to

lebanon s protests take a troubling turn during dire financial crisis the country s new government has yet to take the urgent actions needed to pull the country back from the brink of chaos mona yacoubian coinciding with lebanon s worst financial crisis in decades popular protests in the country have been ongoing for more than four months the protests were initially sparked by a government tax on the popular whatsapp messaging service they quickly evolved into lebanon s largest sustained peaceful protest movement the demonstrations were notable for being geographically diverse and starkly anti sectarian women and youth have played outsized roles in the protests which emphasized a focus on civic engagement recently however the protests have taken a troubling turn with episodic clashes between protesters and security forces more worrying the lebanese economy continues its downward spiral with mounting fears that a total economic meltdown may be only weeks away usip s mona yacoubian looks at how the protests have evolved amid the country s economic crisis and what it all means for the united states how have the protests evolved in lebanon we ve seen the protests take a more troubling turn while a new prime minister and cabinet were named demonstrators continue to demand more significant change despite looming financial catastrophe the new government has yet to take the urgent actions needed to pull the country back from the brink of chaos meanwhile it appears that the protests could take a turn toward more serious violence two recent episodes are particularly concerning week of rage frustrated by continued government inaction protesters declared a week of rage in late january some protesters attacked banks and atms while police responded forcefully using teargas water cannons and rubber bullets injuring hundreds according to the lebanese red cross journalists and news organizations were also targeted by security forces parliament protests on february 11 protesters sought to block members of parliament from participating in a vote of confidence on the new cabinet supporters of the new government clashed with demonstrators and more than 350 people were injured in clashes around the parliament building a member of parliament was injured after protesters attacked his car these developments bear close watching as the economic situation grows more dire see below protests could devolve into much broader social unrest and even anarchy a more decided turn toward violence would mark a disturbing evolution for the largely peaceful protests research on nonviolent protest underscores three important lessons to bear in mind regarding protests that turn violent they are met with higher levels of state repression external groups reduce their support for the goals of the protests and participation in the protests could also diminish at the same time the economic conditions that prompted the protests continue to deteriorate as lebanon approaches a total financial collapse what is the prognosis for lebanon s economy and what has been the impact of the deterioration to date lebanon is heading toward a financial collapse as debt repayments come due it is one of the most indebted countries in the world with a debt to gdp ratio that is expected to reach 160 percent by the end of 2020 on march 9 a 1 2 billion eurobond payment is due while additional payments totaling 3 5 billion in principal and interest will be due by june many financial analysts believe lebanon will likely default on the coming payment as its foreign exchange reserves dwindle while the lebanese government has not requested an imf bailout it will likely face that decision very soon with significant economic and social implications an imf package would likely include demands for comprehensive reforms as well as significant austerity measures going forward the socioeconomic trends do not bode well lebanon is already suffering from rising impoverishment and unemployment failing infrastructure and inadequate health services poverty rates have nearly doubled since the beginning of the protests four months ago and could be as high as 50 percent unemployment is rising as the economy grinds to halt significant layoffs took place toward the end of 2019 as the financial crunch hit youth unemployment in particular is high and estimated at nearly 36 percent among university graduates according to the international labor organization inflation has also surged as the lebanese pound has suffered an estimated 60 percent devaluation significant economic contraction is expected this year as lebanon reels from the crisis brain drain is another concern as those with talent and the means are leaving as opportunities dry up and the situation becomes more dire lebanon hosts a large number of syrian refugees what has been the impact of the financial crisis on the refugee population as with impoverished lebanese citizens syrian refugees have suffered significantly in the current crisis the vast majority were living below the poverty line since well before the financial crisis the devaluation of the lebanese lira has had an adverse impact on the cash assistance syrian refugees receive from the united nations refugee agency dramatically undercutting their already limited purchasing power prior to the current economic downturn syrian refugees were already subject to harassment and the threat of forced return these threats are now compounded by the crisis the new cabinet has alluded to the need to return refugees to their country underscoring the lebanese government s rejection of any sort of integration or resettlement of refugees into lebanese host communities as the economy continues to deteriorate pressure may mount to force syrian refugees to return to syria what are the implications of the current crisis for the united states a failed state in lebanon is not in the united states national security interest maintaining security and stability in lebanon remains an important priority for the u s chaos and state failure in lebanon would have significant negative ramifications as noted lebanon hosts a large refugee population the largest per capita in the world which could be further displaced in the event of state collapse creating yet more instability should lebanon descend into chaos bad actors across the spectrum from sunni jihadist groups such as isis to hezbollah the lebanese shiite militant organization could exploit the resulting security and political vacuum to their benefit given the tumult already prevailing in the region particularly in neighboring syria and just beyond in iraq preserving lebanon s relative stability is an important bulwark against broader regional turmoil this article is cross posted here with permission on agreement from the united states institute of peace
ambassador kosnett s remarks at the kosovo consulate general new york february 28 2020 as prepared ladies and gentlemen good afternoon let me begin by thanking consul general teuta sahatqija and her staff for hosting us today they do a tremendous job building ties between our two great countries it is a great pleasure to be here with old friends and new we are here today because we share an appreciation and respect for both kosovo and the united states in this spirit i would like today s engagement to be an open conversation so i will try to keep my opening remarks short to allow more time for discussion i d like to start us off by offering my perspective on three topics how i see kosovo today america s priorities in the relationship and finally how members of the kosovo diaspora in the united states can support the effort to build a better future for all the people of kosovo first then kosovo today some of you know that i first served in the u s diplomatic mission in kosovo all too briefly in 2003 when the opportunity arose to return to ksovo in 2018 this time with my wife alison we jumped at it we ve been back in kosovo a little over a year now and it has been a wonderful experience last year on july 4 i was privileged to mark the 20th anniversary of our diplomatic presence in kosovo by presiding at the opening of our new embassy in pristina possibly the most advanced most environmentally sound complex of buildings in kosovo the embassy is more than a modern office for the americans and local staff who work there it is a meeting place for people of all communities and a physical manifestation of america s commitment to an enduring partnership with kosovo each year the american people give millions of their tax dollars to support programs and activities in kosovo these programs build the capacity of the government ensure the rights of minority groups and the most vulnerable members of society enhance the capacity of the legal system and help businesses meet international product standards and gain access to new markets we also partner with the government on initiatives to encourage greater participation of women in the economy support entrepreneurs from all kosovo s diverse communities create a stable and secure supply of energy and better prepare young people to be the engines of future growth we support the development of the courts and police as well as the kosovo security force i know how appreciative kosovo citizens are for the assistance they ve received from the u s these past two decades but i ve also learned that the relationship is very much a two way street kosovo for example has shown courage and leadership in its approach to combating terrorism and confronting violent extremism often more than much larger and richer countries the united states is assisting kosovo to build the capacities of the kosovo security force not just for defense but so kosovo can make good on its promise to begin to pay back its allies for the military assistance it has received and to reach its aspirations of becoming a peacekeeping force and security contributor recently kosovo has shown to the world that this security force is able to provide aid to others in need when the tragic earthquake struck albania kosovo s emergency response corps worked hand in hand with our crisis response team sending help to its neighbor within hours of the quake i see this as an example of how kosovo is maturing into a supportive regional partner it is true that our governments will not always agree on every issue that is normal in a mature partnership there may be times when relations between governments become strained and there are consequences i imagine we will get into some current topics during the discussion session and i ll talk a bit about how our economic assistance is set to evolve but i have no doubt the fundamental bond between our two democracies is and will remain solid let s talk about our shared priorities when my embassy colleagues and i talk about america s priorities and our hopes for kosovo we group the issues into three categories peace justice and prosperity by peace i mean better relations between kosovo and its neighbors particularly serbia but also peaceful neighborly ties among ethnic communities within kosovo for all kosovo s citizens should have the right to live in freedom without fearing their neighbors and also without fearing that if they reach out a hand of friendship to their neighbors from another community someone from their own community will object and peace by this definition is closely related to justice when people in kosovo raise the topic of justice i find they they are usually talking about fighting corruption and building a judicial system and a police force people trust that is vital but i would broaden the definition of justice to include adherence to the rule of law equal and respectful treatment for all citizens regardless of gender ethnicity or sexual orientation and equal opportunity for all supporting those efforts is important to my government and to me and we put a lot of energy into helping to improve kosovo s judicial and law enforcement institutions the results have been encouraging but we have a long way to go including in removing improper political influence from the judicial system this would be a good point to say that building a just society isn t easy when i speak in kosovo i take pains to note that as america tries to build that just society a more perfect union to borrow another phrase from our founders we are still struggling with the legacy of a long and painful history both kosovo and the united states are works in progress we need to work together and learn from each other to build societies dedicated to inclusion to liberty and justice for all liberty and justice for all also means economic opportunity for all what our founders called the pursuit of happiness and that brings me to our third priority supporting kosovo on the road to prosperity the economic picture many of us would agree is mixed too many of kosovo s people in government offices in some non governmental organizations and even in some corners of the private sector have become overly reliant on foreign aid and remittances imagining that the current high levels of assistance and remittances will last forever too many times someone working in government or business has pitched a sound idea to me then asked which u s government agency is going to pay for it let s be clear we are proud of the work we do in kosovo and the programs we support but u s government efforts are focused on ensuring kosovo can stand on its own two feet and on having governmental institutions deliver and respond to citizens needs america provides kosovo with assistance not as a permanent subsidy but to help institutions and sectors to become more self sufficient in agriculture for example usaid focuses on investing in pilot projects to show farmers how to move up the value chain even this sort of aid isn t designed to last forever as usaid administrator green highlighted recently at the united nations the purpose of foreign assistance is to end the need for its existence there is also a fair amount of magical thinking about foreign direct investment people who should know better ask when the u s government is going to make general motors or ford invest in kosovo sidestepping the question of how to make kosovo a country businesses want to invest in this sort of complacency crosses political party lines and generational lines too as the youngest nation in europe kosovo should be poised to benefit from a demographic dividend that contributes to a more prosperous future as more and more citizens enter the work force and pay taxes that can be used to provide wide social benefits but an estimated 220 000 citizens left kosovo during the last decade that is roughly 10 percent of kosovo s population without making a concerted investment in retaining and building talent and supporting private sector led growth kosovo can t expect the change needed for a positive future let s talk about remittances at present remittances from people like you are holding kosovo s economy together twelve percent of kosovo s economy is derived from economic activity supported by money flowing in from outside but it s not real investment sadly the vast majority of remittances are used to purchase goods manufactured abroad and imported into kosovo much diaspora money goes into building vacation homes better but still not the same as investing in an ongoing commercial activity and let s be frank the whole remittance structure is a house of cards america s experience with other diaspora communities is that remittances fall sharply a generation after the initial wave of emigration so kosovo s future is dependent on its ability to expand private sector growth and to begin to produce some of the goods it now procures from abroad with diaspora dollars private sector growth will create jobs it will help keep kosovo s youth in kosovo and offer real alternatives to seeking jobs in an already bloated public sector and all is not bleak first of all while many talented people have left kosovo including people sitting in this room many of the most talented have chosen to remain when i compare the kosovo i knew in 2003 to the kosovo of today i am especially impressed by a rising generation of young people educated multilingual who could be successful anywhere in the world but are choosing to try to build a future at home in kosovo young people in the tech sector in particular speak of learning lessons from other small countries that have achieved economic success by unleashing their private sector countries like israel singapore estonia slovenia many are reaching across community boundaries even across borders to make friends and do business with people from other communities they are not afraid of seeking foreign money but as investment capital not aid gjirafa is a great example a small investment from usaid coupled with the dynamism of its young founder mergim cahani had a catalytic effect now girafa is the leading online retail marketplace in kosovo and a leader in search as well it is the desire to see kosovo develop its economy and become more economically self sufficient that is driving our current effort led by special presidential envoy ric grenell to inject energy into the process of improving kosovo s relations with serbia by encouraging initiatives to improve air road and rail links between kosovo and serbia we hope to energize the economies and business opportunities on both sides of the border improve the free movement of people and build connections that will lead to greater human cooperation and economic growth we ve developed these initiatives in consultation with business leaders in both countries and now i move on to my last point kosovo s future relies in the end on one factor alone the commitment of its citizens to build that future i encourage you to think about how to structure your own support toward the goal of kosovo s self sufficiency so what else can you do in fact a lot i am not here to endorse particular programs or businesses but rather to raise awareness about the plethora of opportunities out there for you to play a role in kosovo s future success so with that caveat in mind you can also invest in an existing business or even create your own just look at the success of a diaspora s investment in jaha solar the company not only created jobs in kosovo but was also a smart business decision for investors jaha s german quality solar panels produced in kosovo compete on the european market with prices that are competitive with china you can follow in the footsteps of the shkreli lukaj and other families by sponsoring a scholarship for kosovo s youth you can support kosovo non profits such as teach for kosovo modeled after teach for america which is looking for funding but also for fellows to work in kosovo s schools you can follow the example of bonevet s founder vllaznim xhiha who built his fortune abroad but established a foundation with programs run by local youth encouraging the success of kosovo s future generations perhaps a more modest commitment many diaspora members take extended vacations in kosovo and truth be told at neighboring beaches take some time from your vacation to mentor local businesses and organizations and provide them with expertise and innovative ideas one good place to start if you are looking for such opportunities is germin which puts diaspora around the world in touch with local businesses and organizations looking for services sharing your knowledge and know how can be priceless for a kosovo business a small tech startup run by kosovo youth won a contract with lufthansa through contacts of a diaspora in fact they report that 90 percent of their clients come from diaspora and your influence does not have to be constrained to charity or the economic sphere there are examples of how people like you who have spent time in other political and economic systems send back a component of these values when they return to or interact with their countries of origin and have a positive impact they contribute to changing outdated attitudes about issues such as gender equality protection of civil rights and inclusion of the lgbti community over time as diasporas share new perspectives with those who remain in the country of origin subtle shifts in the values those people hold may occur i encourage you to help advocate for the needs of wartime sexual violence survivors and other victims of violence and past trauma including by helping to fill the gaps in mental health needs i spoke earlier about how the energy and commitment of kosovo s young entrepreneurs and of the inspiring teach for kosovo project how about unleashing the youth of the diaspora to backstop them know a young kosovo american citizen with a business or tech degree or just a winning attitude maybe a daughter son niece nephew if you have the means why not subsidize one to take a year off to live in kosovo and bring their education and their enthusiasm to support a local company or municipality or educational institution they will gain valuable experience in the process and give their language skills a workout in this room there are people who would do a brilliant job of organizing a corps of diaspora youth like that who wants to volunteer thank you for listening to my ideas about how we can help build a self sufficient kosovo now i look forward to hearing your ideas and i am happy to take questions on any topic thank you for your attention

after a relatively empty schedule last week there s a lot more going on this coming week i fear though that it s likely to be drowned out by any news about the covid 19 virus and particularly its spread in the us the first week of the month is always dominated by the us nonfarm payrolls nfp this week we also have two central bank meetings the reserve bank of australia rba on tuesday and the bank of canada boc on wednesday neither is expected to cut rates but everyone will want to see what their take is on the economic outlook as the virus spreads around the globe there will be an opec plus meeting in vienna on thursday and friday as the group tries to get to grips with the sudden plunge in demand and prices in the wake of the virus finally the democratic party in the us will hold its super tuesday round of presidential primaries which may determine who gets to challenge trump at the november election assuming trump is still in office then nfp not what it used to be but still what it is the nfp is still a major focal point for the market each month but not like it used to be the economist magazine had an article last month entitled traders lose interest in america s jobs report markets react less to jobs data than they did before the financial crisis they explained that the reason for the subsequent lack of interest is that falling unemployment is no longer a good guide to the fed s actions that is to say the fed s mandate is to achieve maximum employment and stable prices the us is already beyond what they had thought was maximum employment which they had estimated to be somewhere between 4 0 4 3 unemployment it s currently 3 6 that means job growth could slow considerably and the unemployment rate rise notably before they would consider loosening policy to boost employment on the other hand with inflation still below target they re not going to raise rates even if employment increases further in short neither a good nor a bad figure is likely to cause them to change policy any time soon while everyone focuses on the nfp the fed is probably watching the average hourly earnings figure more closely there are two reasons one since the unemployment rate is already well below what they thought the us economy could accommodate without causing a surge in inflation they are wondering whether the unemployment rate is a good guide to how tight the labour market is some members of the rate setting federal open market committee fomc have argued that wage growth not the unemployment rate is a better guide to how tight the labor market is that is if growth in wages isn t accelerating it means employers can still find new workers without bidding up the price of labour therefore by definition the labour market isn t tight on the other hand wages rising at an accelerating pace would show that it s getting harder and harder to find workers secondly the committee wants to see inflation get back up closer to their 2 target they therefore hope to see a tighter labour market feeding through to higher wages which will force companies to raise their prices the phillips curve that describes the relation between wage growth and inflation the phillips curve is unusually flat nowadays not just in the us but in many other countries as well posing a puzzle for policymakers everywhere as economies no longer function the way they learned in grad school does it matter the market is already positive the fed is going to cut a month ago investors were pricing in one rate cut this year a week ago two rate cuts now three cuts i doubt if the nfp or average earnings could be either so bad or so good as to change peoples minds either way in fact the entire us yield curve out to 30 years is at or below the overnight fed funds rate when that happens usually the fed comes into line with the market not the other way around in any case the market is looking for a figure that s slightly better than usual but nothing out of the ballpark the forecast for the nfp number is 190k which is slightly higher than the six month average for the initial figure of 172k but below the average of the final figure of 205k so really it would be well within the recent trend the unemployment rate is forecast to fall back to 3 5 where it was for most of q4 last year that s the lowest it s been since it hit 3 4 in june 1969 back when the beatles the ballad of john and yoko and elvis presley s in the ghetto were in the top 10 the difference between now and q4 last year though is that the participation rate in january was 63 4 up from 63 2 then the participation rate bottomed out in september 2015 at 62 4 and has been creeping up ever since it s still well below the record 63 7 set in march 2000 but it s headed in the right direction the same unemployment rate at a higher participation rate shows a stronger labor market that would tend to be positive for the dollar at least momentarily the forecast for average hourly earnings ahe this month is the same as it was last month 0 3 mom and 3 0 yoy i think it would be serious if the yoy rate of growth slips below 3 0 it s been above that level since august 2018 as i mentioned above a slower rate of growth in earnings suggests slack in the labour market regardless of what the unemployment rate is at least according to traditional economics in my view this is the main point people should be focusing on does earnings growth start to accelerate or does it continue to slow or does it level off as the market is predicting i expect the currency market to react more to the ahe than to the nfp number itself while the employment data is excellent there are signs that we may have reached a turning point for the labor market first off the number of job openings has peaked it s now down on a year on year basis if the current trend continues the number of unemployed persons will once again exceed the number of job openings this limits the possible increase in employment secondly the jobs plentiful minus jobs hard to get indicator from the conference board consumer confidence survey has peaked in the past a turning point in that indicator has signaled a turning point for the us unemployment rate the labor market therefore bears watching although it s not yet a deciding factor for the fed central bank meetings the rba and boc the two central bank policy committees that meet during the week are not expected to change rates but they will be closely watched nonetheless as usual to see what their take on the covid 19 virus is so far officials have been cautious they ve expressed concern but they obviously don t want to spread panic in the markets besides they re economists not epidemiologists and they don t know anything more than anyone else does unless they get some confidential briefings from the health authorities which is entirely possible the rba will be especially closely watched as australia s economy is intimately entwined with china s at their last meeting on 4 february they said the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable but that the coronavirus was a source of uncertainty it is too early to determine how long lasting the impact will be they observed my guess is that they might be a bit more definite about the impact although of course they still don t know whether this will blow over quickly or turn into a global pandemic they also implied that rates had perhaps hit bottom for now and they would wait to see what the effect is as the lower rates percolate through the economy with interest rates having already been reduced to a very low level and recognising the long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy the board decided to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting since it can take up to three quarters for the impact of a rate cut to be fully felt throughout the economy this statement to me portended a long period of no change in rates assuming as fed chair powell would say no material reassessment of the outlook the virus has however changed the market s view of what s likely to happen right after the last meeting and indeed up to a week ago the market wasn t fully pricing in another rate cut until august or september but just over the last week that s changed now the market is pricing in one cut by june and a pretty good chance of another cut by the end of the year meanwhile the rba itself has highlighted the labour market as the key variable that it s watching the unemployment rate red line has risen from the low of 4 9 hit a year ago to 5 3 but at the same time the participation rate blue line has continued to rise it s now within a whisker of its record high of 66 2 set last august in a case like this the rising unemployment rate may be a sign of improvement in the labour market in that more opportunity is bringing discouraged workers back to work employment is continuing to rise although the pace of growth has slowed recently net net i expect the rba will continue with its fairly optimistic tone while it s almost sure to be more concerned about the virus impact on the australian economy it remains focused on employment and employment is doing well unless and until the unemployment rate moves meaningfully higher say back to 5 5 and the participation rate begins to trend lower i wouldn t expect them to start hinting at another rate cut a result along those lines would probably be bullish for aud the risk is if they think the fall in activity stemming from the virus could push inflation down further it s already below their target range there s a big debate among economists about whether the virus will inflict a demand shock which is deflationary because everyone is staying home and not buying anything or a supply shock which is inflationary because no one is going to work and producing things it s pretty clearly a demand shock in the commodity currency countries that s what the rba could be worried about the bank of canada boc is thought to be in more of a rush until a week ago the market was discounting one rate cut some time from now some time from july to september now however people are looking for two cuts at least with a good chance of a third the first in april the second in september and maybe a 50 50 chance of another one by the end of the year if you remember the boc surprised the market well surprised me at least when it turned distinctly cautious at its meeting in january growth in the near term will be weaker and the output gap wider than the bank projected in october they said the economy until recently has been operating close to capacity meaning that it no longer is the kicker is that they didn t even mention the coronavirus specifically they were focused on the us iranian tensions that were bubbling around then 22 january and bemoaned the fact that there remains a high degree of uncertainty and geopolitical tensions have re emerged what are they going to say now although the geopolitical tensions that they were worried about then have faded from view the uncertainty in the world has increased sharply last time they said they would be paying particular attention to developments in consumer spending the housing market and business investment consumer spending as measured by retail sales seems to have hit bottom and be rebounding a bit the boc expects to see that maintained thanks to growth in population and incomes but worries that the consumers could start to save more of their incomes out of caution for the future the housing market is more or less neutral house prices red line have gone nowhere for the last year or so while housing starts are fairly steady although they may be starting to trend lower we ll have to see it s hard to get an up to date reading on business investment although we ll know more later today when the q4 gdp figures are released the business outlook does not appear to be particularly rosy and expectations for sales growth are falling so it s likely that investment will be soft in q1 this year the bottom line here is that although it hasn t met the criteria it set for another rate cut the boc is likely to be even more worried at this meeting than it was at the last one it could take a more dovish stance and drop a hint about a future rate cut last time it said it would be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast this time it could say that yes indeed it expects the slowdown to be more persistent that would set the market up for a rate cut at the next meeting on 15 april cad negative opec meeting once more into the fray the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec meets thursday and will be joined on friday by a number of non members that are co operating with the cartel most notably russia this group called opec is caught between a rock low prices as demand slips away and a hard place higher production by non members most notably the us the conundrum faced by the group is only likely to get worse for the time being as much of the world s shipping air transport and industrial activity grinds to a halt because of the covid 19 virus for example chinese refinery runs are reportedly down by 3mn barrels a day b d italy is enforcing quarantines in the lombardy and veneto regions which consume more than 25 of the petroleum products used in the country etc etc the problem is opec can t agree to cut output fast enough to bring supply and demand back into balance because governments are already suffering from lower income due to lower prices they don t want to compound their problems saudi arabia initially proposed that the group should cut output by over 1mn b d but that was rejected russia rejected a later compromise of 600 00 b d the latest was a report in the wall street journal quickly denied that saudi arabia kuwait and the uae were considering unilaterally cutting output by 300 000 b d given that the saudis originally thought a cut of more than 1mn b d was necessary the market would laugh at a 300k cut and it looks like the group won t be even able to reach consensus on that i expect that the meeting will fail to come up with any convincing action to bring supply back into balance with demand oil prices are likely to fall further dragging the currencies of oil producing countries cad nok mxn down with them finally we may get some winnowing out of the democratic candidates for president after super tuesday when 14 of the 50 states hold their primary elections at the same time the busiest day of the primary season the big question is whether bernie sanders will remain in the lead or whether one of the other candidates will pull even with him which would probably result in a brokered convention where delegates debate and vote and debate and vote until they can settle on a candidate other important data out during the week include the us ism manufacturing pmi on monday and the eu wide cpi on tuesday the last one before the 23 march ecb meeting
the sustained selloff driven by fears of global economic damage from the spreading coronavirus prompted both the federal reserve and the white house to hunt for possible remedies eyeing tools they have used during past crises to calm the public only by staging a late rally in the final 15 minutes of trading was the dow able to avert its third daily loss this week of more than 1 000 points the week marked the fastest 10 plus percent drop in history the stock market fell for the seventh straight day friday with the dow jones industrial average losing 357 points or 1 4 percent as the coronavirus outbreak began to look more and more like a worldwide economic crisis advertisement the traditional tactics however may not work against a financial panic driven by a global health scare that lacks precedent or antidote a sign of the crisis fighting difficulties ahead came in the afternoon when federal reserve chairman jerome powell issued an unusual statement vowing to act as appropriate to defend the us economy from the outbreak many analysts interpreted the statement as a pledge to cut interest rates a signal that often heartens investors but this time the selloff continued after a week that shaved more than 4 trillion from global stock values powell s effort was among a series of steps meant to reassure frazzled investors nothing so far appears to be working the fundamentals of the us economy remain strong powell said however the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity the federal reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy meanwhile federal health officials scrambled friday to get coronavirus testing up and running in every state as the trump administration signaled it may also invoke a 70 year old defense law to guarantee the availability of protective gear should the virus spread advertisement the centers for disease control and prevention said two more americans tested positive for the virus out of the group of quarantined passengers from the diamond princess cruise ship and santa clara county in california reported another case bringing the national total to 63 health officials confirmed the santa clara case as the second in the united states believed to have been transmitted to a person who didn t travel internationally or come in close contact with anyone who had it the world health organization upgraded the risk level from the virus to very high as it continued to spread around the globe friday evening the state department issued an advisory telling americans to avoid nonessential travel to italy which has seen nearly 900 cases a travel advisory already is in place for china the list of countries touched by the illness climbed to nearly 60 as mexico belarus lithuania new zealand nigeria azerbaijan iceland and the netherlands reported their first cases more than 83 000 people worldwide have contracted the illness with deaths topping 2 800 president trump lashed out friday at democrats who have questioned his handling of the coronavirus threat calling it their new hoax at a campaign rally in south carolina trump accused democrats of politicizing the coronavirus and boasted about preventive steps he s ordered in an attempt to keep the virus that originated in china from spreading across the united states trump administration political appointees and nonpartisan career government scientists both agree that the current risk to americans is low although that could quickly change but some political officials are continuing to offer assurances that concerns will blow over soon advertisement i acknowledge that this could change i acknowledge the situation could deteriorate i acknowledge the risks white house economic adviser larry kudlow told reporters friday but given what we know looks to me like the market has gone too far evercore isi an investment firm told clients friday that it now expects the fed to cut rates by a half percentage point at its march 17 18 meeting something few expected just one week ago meanwhile white house officials held meetings of their own friday considering potential tax cut packages that they hope might boost consumer confidence this comes after several days of unsuccessful efforts by trump and his economic team to cajole people to buy stocks and drive prices higher typically the fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain it also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of us treasury securities effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash the white house and congress meanwhile can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with money but the best remedy for the coronavirus could lie beyond washington s immediate powers central banks don t make vaccines said david kotok chairman of cumberland advisors advertisement the renewed selling intensified calls for the fed to rescue the economy from an unforeseen shock the medical emergency already has disrupted global production networks curtailed air travel and hobbled economies in asia europe and the middle east with medical experts urging americans to prepare for serious disruptions in their daily lives pleas for early action are coming from wall street and some former members of the fed s rate setting committee the calls for action came as capital economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the united states could be enough to tip the economy into a mild recession between election day in 2016 and feb 12 of this year the dow jones industrial average rose by 61 percent in four days this week it surrendered one third of that gain it s uncertain how effective cutting interest rates might be economists call episodes like the epidemic or the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks an exogenous shock meaning an unpredictable development that arises from outside the economy or financial system yet has significant economic consequences the fed normally acts only after assessing voluminous data on business and consumer activity using sophisticated computer models that forecast the future by comparing current conditions to what s happened in the past there is no recent precedent for the coronavirus outbreak for the fed to use in its models if the united states suffers a serious outbreak and people stay home fearing possible contagion cutting interest rates would probably do little to persuade them to return to work or go out to shop or dine this is a very tough one for the fed to deal with said dean baker senior economist at the center for economic and policy research advertisement the fed has a long history of fighting financial and economic downturns including the 1987 stock market plunge known as black monday and the russian debt default more than a decade later in 2008 after the collapse of the housing bubble the fed dropped interest rates to zero six days after the sept 11 attacks with financial markets closed and smoke still curling from the world trade center rubble then fed chairman alan greenspan cut the benchmark us lending rate by half a percentage point the central bank also pumped 102 billion into the financial system material from the associated press was used in this report
ambassador kosnett s remarks at the kosovo consulate general new york february 28 2020 by rafaela prifti ladies and gentlemen good afternoon let me begin by thanking consul general teuta sahatqija and her staff for hosting us today they do a tremendous job building ties between our two great countries it is a great pleasure to be here with old friends and new we are here today because we share an appreciation and respect for both kosovo and the united states in this spirit i would like today s engagement to be an open conversation so i will try to keep my opening remarks short to allow more time for discussion i d like to start us off by offering my perspective on three topics how i see kosovo today america s priorities in the relationship and finally how members of the kosovo diaspora in the united states can support the effort to build a better future for all the people of kosovo first then kosovo today some of you know that i first served in the u s diplomatic mission in kosovo all too briefly in 2003 when the opportunity arose to return to ksovo in 2018 this time with my wife alison we jumped at it we ve been back in kosovo a little over a year now and it has been a wonderful experience last year on july 4 i was privileged to mark the 20th anniversary of our diplomatic presence in kosovo by presiding at the opening of our new embassy in pristina possibly the most advanced most environmentally sound complex of buildings in kosovo the embassy is more than a modern office for the americans and local staff who work there it is a meeting place for people of all communities and a physical manifestation of america s commitment to an enduring partnership with kosovo each year the american people give millions of their tax dollars to support programs and activities in kosovo these programs build the capacity of the government ensure the rights of minority groups and the most vulnerable members of society enhance the capacity of the legal system and help businesses meet international product standards and gain access to new markets we also partner with the government on initiatives to encourage greater participation of women in the economy support entrepreneurs from all kosovo s diverse communities create a stable and secure supply of energy and better prepare young people to be the engines of future growth we support the development of the courts and police as well as the kosovo security force i know how appreciative kosovo citizens are for the assistance they ve received from the u s these past two decades but i ve also learned that the relationship is very much a two way street kosovo for example has shown courage and leadership in its approach to combating terrorism and confronting violent extremism often more than much larger and richer countries the united states is assisting kosovo to build the capacities of the kosovo security force not just for defense but so kosovo can make good on its promise to begin to pay back its allies for the military assistance it has received and to reach its aspirations of becoming a peacekeeping force and security contributor recently kosovo has shown to the world that this security force is able to provide aid to others in need when the tragic earthquake struck albania kosovo s emergency response corps worked hand in hand with our crisis response team sending help to its neighbor within hours of the quake i see this as an example of how kosovo is maturing into a supportive regional partner it is true that our governments will not always agree on every issue that is normal in a mature partnership there may be times when relations between governments become strained and there are consequences i imagine we will get into some current topics during the discussion session and i ll talk a bit about how our economic assistance is set to evolve but i have no doubt the fundamental bond between our two democracies is and will remain solid let s talk about our shared priorities when my embassy colleagues and i talk about america s priorities and our hopes for kosovo we group the issues into three categories peace justice and prosperity by peace i mean better relations between kosovo and its neighbors particularly serbia but also peaceful neighborly ties among ethnic communities within kosovo for all kosovo s citizens should have the right to live in freedom without fearing their neighbors and also without fearing that if they reach out a hand of friendship to their neighbors from another community someone from their own community will object and peace by this definition is closely related to justice when people in kosovo raise the topic of justice i find they they are usually talking about fighting corruption and building a judicial system and a police force people trust that is vital but i would broaden the definition of justice to include adherence to the rule of law equal and respectful treatment for all citizens regardless of gender ethnicity or sexual orientation and equal opportunity for all supporting those efforts is important to my government and to me and we put a lot of energy into helping to improve kosovo s judicial and law enforcement institutions the results have been encouraging but we have a long way to go including in removing improper political influence from the judicial system this would be a good point to say that building a just society isn t easy when i speak in kosovo i take pains to note that as america tries to build that just society a more perfect union to borrow another phrase from our founders we are still struggling with the legacy of a long and painful history both kosovo and the united states are works in progress we need to work together and learn from each other to build societies dedicated to inclusion to liberty and justice for all liberty and justice for all also means economic opportunity for all what our founders called the pursuit of happiness and that brings me to our third priority supporting kosovo on the road to prosperity the economic picture many of us would agree is mixed too many of kosovo s people in government offices in some non governmental organizations and even in some corners of the private sector have become overly reliant on foreign aid and remittances imagining that the current high levels of assistance and remittances will last forever too many times someone working in government or business has pitched a sound idea to me then asked which u s government agency is going to pay for it let s be clear we are proud of the work we do in kosovo and the programs we support but u s government efforts are focused on ensuring kosovo can stand on its own two feet and on having governmental institutions deliver and respond to citizens needs america provides kosovo with assistance not as a permanent subsidy but to help institutions and sectors to become more self sufficient in agriculture for example usaid focuses on investing in pilot projects to show farmers how to move up the value chain even this sort of aid isn t designed to last forever as usaid administrator green highlighted recently at the united nations the purpose of foreign assistance is to end the need for its existence there is also a fair amount of magical thinking about foreign direct investment people who should know better ask when the u s government is going to make general motors or ford invest in kosovo sidestepping the question of how to make kosovo a country businesses want to invest in this sort of complacency crosses political party lines and generational lines too as the youngest nation in europe kosovo should be poised to benefit from a demographic dividend that contributes to a more prosperous future as more and more citizens enter the work force and pay taxes that can be used to provide wide social benefits but an estimated 220 000 citizens left kosovo during the last decade that is roughly 10 percent of kosovo s population without making a concerted investment in retaining and building talent and supporting private sector led growth kosovo can t expect the change needed for a positive future let s talk about remittances at present remittances from people like you are holding kosovo s economy together twelve percent of kosovo s economy is derived from economic activity supported by money flowing in from outside but it s not real investment sadly the vast majority of remittances are used to purchase goods manufactured abroad and imported into kosovo much diaspora money goes into building vacation homes better but still not the same as investing in an ongoing commercial activity and let s be frank the whole remittance structure is a house of cards america s experience with other diaspora communities is that remittances fall sharply a generation after the initial wave of emigration so kosovo s future is dependent on its ability to expand private sector growth and to begin to produce some of the goods it now procures from abroad with diaspora dollars private sector growth will create jobs it will help keep kosovo s youth in kosovo and offer real alternatives to seeking jobs in an already bloated public sector and all is not bleak first of all while many talented people have left kosovo including people sitting in this room many of the most talented have chosen to remain when i compare the kosovo i knew in 2003 to the kosovo of today i am especially impressed by a rising generation of young people educated multilingual who could be successful anywhere in the world but are choosing to try to build a future at home in kosovo young people in the tech sector in particular speak of learning lessons from other small countries that have achieved economic success by unleashing their private sector countries like israel singapore estonia slovenia many are reaching across community boundaries even across borders to make friends and do business with people from other communities they are not afraid of seeking foreign money but as investment capital not aid gjirafa is a great example a small investment from usaid coupled with the dynamism of its young founder mergim cahani had a catalytic effect now girafa is the leading online retail marketplace in kosovo and a leader in search as well it is the desire to see kosovo develop its economy and become more economically self sufficient that is driving our current effort led by special presidential envoy ric grenell to inject energy into the process of improving kosovo s relations with serbia by encouraging initiatives to improve air road and rail links between kosovo and serbia we hope to energize the economies and business opportunities on both sides of the border improve the free movement of people and build connections that will lead to greater human cooperation and economic growth we ve developed these initiatives in consultation with business leaders in both countries and now i move on to my last point kosovo s future relies in the end on one factor alone the commitment of its citizens to build that future i encourage you to think about how to structure your own support toward the goal of kosovo s self sufficiency so what else can you do in fact a lot i am not here to endorse particular programs or businesses but rather to raise awareness about the plethora of opportunities out there for you to play a role in kosovo s future success so with that caveat in mind you can also invest in an existing business or even create your own just look at the success of a diaspora s investment in jaha solar the company not only created jobs in kosovo but was also a smart business decision for investors jaha s german quality solar panels produced in kosovo compete on the european market with prices that are competitive with china you can follow in the footsteps of the shkreli lukaj and other families by sponsoring a scholarship for kosovo s youth you can support kosovo non profits such as teach for kosovo modeled after teach for america which is looking for funding but also for fellows to work in kosovo s schools you can follow the example of bonevet s founder vllaznim xhiha who built his fortune abroad but established a foundation with programs run by local youth encouraging the success of kosovo s future generations perhaps a more modest commitment many diaspora members take extended vacations in kosovo and truth be told at neighboring beaches take some time from your vacation to mentor local businesses and organizations and provide them with expertise and innovative ideas one good place to start if you are looking for such opportunities is germin which puts diaspora around the world in touch with local businesses and organizations looking for services sharing your knowledge and know how can be priceless for a kosovo business a small tech startup run by kosovo youth won a contract with lufthansa through contacts of a diaspora in fact they report that 90 percent of their clients come from diaspora and your influence does not have to be constrained to charity or the economic sphere there are examples of how people like you who have spent time in other political and economic systems send back a component of these values when they return to or interact with their countries of origin and have a positive impact they contribute to changing outdated attitudes about issues such as gender equality protection of civil rights and inclusion of the lgbti community over time as diasporas share new perspectives with those who remain in the country of origin subtle shifts in the values those people hold may occur i encourage you to help advocate for the needs of wartime sexual violence survivors and other victims of violence and past trauma including by helping to fill the gaps in mental health needs i spoke earlier about how the energy and commitment of kosovo s young entrepreneurs and of the inspiring teach for kosovo project how about unleashing the youth of the diaspora to backstop them know a young kosovo american citizen with a business or tech degree or just a winning attitude maybe a daughter son niece nephew if you have the means why not subsidize one to take a year off to live in kosovo and bring their education and their enthusiasm to support a local company or municipality or educational institution they will gain valuable experience in the process and give their language skills a workout in this room there are people who would do a brilliant job of organizing a corps of diaspora youth like that who wants to volunteer thank you for listening to my ideas about how we can help build a self sufficient kosovo now i look forward to hearing your ideas and i am happy to take questions on any topic thank you for your attention

common share compared with a net loss of 13 8 million or 2 89 per common share for the year ended november 30 2018 in the year ended november 30 2019 the lower net loss is attributed to the higher recognition of mallinckrodt upfront fees due to the change in contract term with mallinckrodt which was terminated effective august 15 2019 compared to the original ten year term combined with increased administrative expense related to professional and legal fees and decreased r d expenses in the year ended november 30 2018 the net loss was attributed to lower recognition of mallinckrodt upfront fees combined with increased r d expenses the company recorded revenues of 3 4 million for the year ended november 30 2019 versus 1 7 million for the year ended november 30 2018 licensing revenue consisted primarily of commercial sales of the 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 mg strengths of generic focalin xr under the par agreement the higher increased revenue in the year ended november 30 2019 compared to year ended november 30 2018 is primarily due to the change in contract term with mallinckrodt that terminated on august 15 2019 and the recognition of up front fees on the termination of the mallinckrodt agreement expenditures for r d for the year ended november 30 2019 were lower by 4 2 million compared to the year ended november 30 2018 the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower expenditures in clinical and other biostudies stock based compensation as well as patent litigation expenses partially offset by higher third party consulting fees selling general and administrative expenses were 4 2 million for the year ended november 30 2019 in comparison to 3 5 million increase is due to higher expenses related to administrative costs partially offset by a decrease in marketing cost and wages and benefits the company had cash of 0 065 million as at november 30 2019 compared to 6 6 million as at november 30 2018 the decrease in cash was mainly due to expenditures for r d and selling general and administrative expenses which are partially offset by receipt from par and cash inflow provided from financing activities the increase in cash during the year ended november 30 2018 was mainly due to the cash receipts provided from financing activities derived from the company s two registered direct offering in march 2018 the 2018 debenture financing in september 2018 and an underwritten public offering in october 2018 offset by ongoing expenditures in r d and selling general and administrative expenses as of november 30 2018 the company had a

common share compared with a net loss of 13 8 million or 2 89 per common share for the year ended november 30 2018 in the year ended november 30 2019 the lower net loss is attributed to the higher recognition of mallinckrodt upfront fees due to the change in contract term with mallinckrodt which was terminated effective august 15 2019 compared to the original ten year term combined with increased administrative expense related to professional and legal fees and decreased r d expenses in the year ended november 30 2018 the net loss was attributed to lower recognition of mallinckrodt upfront fees combined with increased r d expenses the company recorded revenues of 3 4 million for the year ended november 30 2019 versus 1 7 million for the year ended november 30 2018 licensing revenue consisted primarily of commercial sales of the 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 mg strengths of generic focalin xr under the par agreement the higher increased revenue in the year ended november 30 2019 compared to year ended november 30 2018 is primarily due to the change in contract term with mallinckrodt that terminated on august 15 2019 and the recognition of up front fees on the termination of the mallinckrodt agreement expenditures for r d for the year ended november 30 2019 were lower by 4 2 million compared to the year ended november 30 2018 the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower expenditures in clinical and other biostudies stock based compensation as well as patent litigation expenses partially offset by higher third party consulting fees selling general and administrative expenses were 4 2 million for the year ended november 30 2019 in comparison to 3 5 million increase is due to higher expenses related to administrative costs partially offset by a decrease in marketing cost and wages and benefits the company had cash of 0 065 million as at november 30 2019 compared to 6 6 million as at november 30 2018 the decrease in cash was mainly due to expenditures for r d and selling general and administrative expenses which are partially offset by receipt from par and cash inflow provided from financing activities the increase in cash during the year ended november 30 2018 was mainly due to the cash receipts provided from financing activities derived from the company s two registered direct offering in march 2018 the 2018 debenture financing

i am not a gold bug but i have been around gold bugs and gold market enthusiasts for more than 30 years from doug casey of crisis investing fame to adrian day of global analyst and of course the godfather of gold investing in the u s jim blanchard jim blanchard fought for years to legalize the ownership of gold for americans and eventually worked with president richard nixon to accomplish the feat back in the 1970s and i ve also been friends with geologists and mining experts including rick rule the ceo of sprott s otcmkts spoxf u s holdings advertisement advertisement investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips then on the investment fund front there was ian mcavity who was on the board and directed central fund now sprott physical gold and silver trust nysemkt cef but up until june of last year i had never recommended a gold investment and now i remain in my recommendation to buy and own gold but in a very specific way gold can be an emotional investment many folks have a want or need to own it as for them it is a better store of value than fiat currencies including the u s dollar and those same investors will also view it as an inflation hedge still others see it as an absolute asset to have for when the financial armageddon strikes advertisement advertisement but i see gold differently gold to me is valued on some of the just mentioned rationales but it is more accurately priced based on more specific economic and market conditions interest rates and gold interest rates are one of the biggest drivers for gold gold in and of itself does not earn a dime in interest or dividends so by buying and holding it you are incurring an important cost in opportunity lost in interest story continues so as interest rates in the u s rise gold will tend to suffer as the pain of the lost opportunity of earning more interest drives away buyers and in turn when interest rates are low and falling then the opportunity cost of holding gold drops and the demand to own it rises look at the following graph that plots the price of gold and short term u s dollar interest rates for the trailing year three month london interbank offer rate libor is plotted in white and the spot price for gold is fittingly in gold source chart by bloomberg 12 month history three month libor white and spot gold gold advertisement advertisement you can clearly see that as interest rates drop gold is rising and if you look at the same chart for the trailing three years you ll see that as interest rates climbed in 2017 and continued sharply into 2018 gold prices and the gold market were having a tough time source chart by bloomberg 36 month history three month libor white and spot gold gold and u s inflation continues to remain low as seen in the core u s personal consumption expenditure index pce the federal reserve and its open market committee fomc uses this index as an inflation gauge source chart by bloomberg data from the bureau of economic analysis advertisement advertisement u s core personal consumption expenditure index the fomc made policy errors in 2018 as it acted to influence short term u s interest rates it raised the target range for fed funds a benchmark market rate for banks to lend to one another it reversed its mistake and i expect that it will make further corrections to lower the target range resulting in lower u s interest rates this should benefit the price of gold but the u s is just one of the primary markets for interest rates and for the rest of the globe s major markets in europe and asia short and longer term interest rates are even lower than in the u s many markets have negative yields source chart by bloomberg advertisement advertisement amount of negative yielding debt in u s dollars the amount of negative yielding debt and negative yielding bank deposits makes gold outside the u s all the more attractive to buy and own that s because it doesn t have negative yields making for a cheaper store of value and savings and this buying helps gold prices in the u s as demand rises under this condition and given the slowdowns in european and asian economies including borderline recession or actual recessions negative yields outside the u s aren t going away for some time this will continue to help gold demand u s dollar and gold gold for u s investors is priced in u s dollars so it makes sense that as the dollar rises in value gold will feel the pinch and as the dollar falls in value gold will gain all other factors aside source chart by bloomberg advertisement advertisement bloomberg u s dollar index white spot gold gold you can see that over the trailing five years that the u s dollar and the spot price of gold have an inverted market relationship back in 2015 the dollar was up and the price of gold was lower then into early 2016 the dollar fell back and gold rallied in price later in 2016 the dollar headed to recent highs and gold suffered in the market then as the dollar plunged in value in 2017 into 2018 gold was generally higher in price and this reversed in mid 2018 until late in that year as the dollar slipped and gold went up for 2019 the dollar has been generally in a range but again you can see that as the dollar edged higher in that range gold drifted lower and in june 2019 the dollar was slipping again and gold did better advertisement advertisement but i believe that interest rates are right now more important for gold spot prices as u s rates head lower and global rates head deeper into negative territory calamity in the markets many think that gold makes for a good hedge during stock market calamity but that really doesn t pan out with history take for example the plunge in the s p 500 in the fourth quarter of 2008 the s p 500 dropped as the impact of the financial crisis took hold of stocks and sent them into the basement but gold didn t do much better it ended the year below the higher prices it saw earlier in 2008 source chart by bloomberg advertisement advertisement 2008 s p 500 white and spot gold gold and then we can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 when the s p 500 had a full slip and slide from my perspective that market action was due to expectations that several companies would report lower sales and earnings growth source chart by bloomberg 2018 s p 500 white and spot gold gold as the errant fomc led u s interest rates higher gold started to go down and even during much of the heavy selling and the drop in the s p 500 gold remained low and only as selling begat more selling in mid december did gold begin to rise a bit even then it still was much lower than earlier in the year advertisement advertisement that said market calamity can drive some demand for gold particularly when the markets are dropping very heavily on any given day such as has been the case over the past few days but one of the reasons for gold gaining might not be concerns about stocks but rather concerns over the possibility of slowing u s economic growth for example fears that the coronavirus from china will have a major impact on the u s could take gold higher and in turn this would support even lower interest rates and a lower u s dollar all about investing in gold there are several ways you can invest in gold to start you can buy coins either in the form of bullion or in numismatic or collectable coins you can buy allocated gold where a certain amount of bullion becomes your explicit property or you can own unallocated gold which remains under the ownership of a bank here you essentially have interest in a certain amount of gold in storage coins have bid offer rates and can also have commissions and if you choose to have them delivered you will also have shipping and insurance costs this is perhaps not the best investment in my opinion unless you derive some personal benefit from holding coins allocated gold comes with the benefit of ownership and the storage facilities are audited in that storage but you will have bid offer costs and you will incur storage fees which mean that gold not only has an opportunity cost to own it but a further actual cost to store it as mentioned above when you buy unallocated gold a bank or financial firm is allowing you to buy and sell bullion but instead of delivering it to your doorstep it carries the gold on its books as an accounting item for you think of it as when you buy a stock and your broker holds the stock for you journaling your holdings in your account here you still pay bid offer costs but unallocated gold comes with lower and sometimes no storage costs the firms will view the storage costs as their responsibility absorbing the fees from the income they make off your transactions one of my long time friends and former business partner from my banking days is chris gaffney he is the president of world markets at tiaa federal savings bank which is part of the massive non profit financial and retirement firm tiaa tiaa offers coins but more importantly unallocated gold with no storage fees and lower bid offer costs he and his team can be reached at 800 926 4922 my old office number at mark twain bank or online here taking the fund route then you can look at a gold exchange traded fund such as the spdr gold shares nysearca gld which synthetically holds gold bullion this is a very easy means of buying and owning gold as more and more brokerages eliminate commissions but it doesn t mean that it s free that storage either real or synthetic comes into play for the etf with an expense ratio of 0 40 or 40 on an 10 000 investment this means that you will have an actual cost to hold shares of the etf as it doesn t pay a penny in dividends source chart by bloomberg spdr gold shares etf white and spot gold gold gld does track spot gold pretty well as you can see in the graph of the two but that embedded cost represented in the expense ratio means that it will lag gold prices and that gap widens over time as the expenses add up over the past five years gld has lagged the intercontinental exchange s nyse ice benchmark price for gold by 4 5 source chart by bloomberg ice total return spdr gold shares gld white and ice benchmark price a better way to own gold there is another way to invest in gold you could buy a mining company but they come with all sorts of complications what are the reserves the costs of production what are the hedging costs they have all sorts of other financial risks and rewards just like for any other company that digs something out of the ground and gets it to the market but my recommendation that i presented to my profitable investing subscribers back in june 2019 isn t a mining company it is rather a company that owns and acquires royalties of gold production and interests in gold production and in turn it generates cash flows from the stream of gold flowing across its books it pays shareholders a cut of the profits throughout each year the company is franco nevada nyse fnv although it is based in canada it lists its shares in the u s markets this company doesn t operate any mines so it has no capital expenditures to dig or prop up mines or any heavy equipment instead it has an office in toronto and just manages the gold flows and resulting cash flows and dividends the dividend isn t high as the distributions are running at 25 cents and are projected to increase in the next declaration to 26 cents but at the current stock price the distributions yield 0 8 that s way better than zero and it s way better than less than zero when looking at the other fees and expenses involved in gold investing source chart by bloomberg total return franco nevada white and spdr gold shares red and franco nevada continues to outperform gold and the gld etf since i recommended the shares in june to date franco nevada has returned 40 6 including dividends compared to the return of gld of only 15 4 so if i m going to recommend gold i m staying for now with franco nevada for my profitable investing subscribers and note as a foreign company it should be held in a taxable account canada for now doesn t withhold taxes for individual investors with qualified retirement accounts but that could change as ottawa has a history of quick and severe tax policy changes and withholding taxes are generally easy to reconcile for taxable accounts but for tax free retirement accounts it does get harder i err on the side of caution neil george was once an all star bond trader but now he works morning and night

the sustained selloff driven by fears of global economic damage from the spreading coronavirus prompted both the federal reserve and the white house to hunt for possible remedies eyeing tools they have used during past crises to calm the public the traditional tactics however may not work against a financial panic driven by a global health scare that lacks precedent or antidote a sign of the crisis fighting difficulties ahead came in the afternoon when federal reserve chairman jerome powell issued an unusual statement vowing to act as appropriate to defend the u s economy from the outbreak many analysts interpreted the statement as a pledge to cut interest rates a signal that often heartens investors but this time the selloff continued after a week that shaved more than 4 trillion from global stock values powell s effort was among a series of steps meant to reassure frazzled investors nothing so far appears to be working the fundamentals of the u s economy remain strong powell said however the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity the federal reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy evercore isi an investment firm told clients friday that it now expects the fed to cut rates by a half percentage point at its mid march meeting something few expected just one week ago meanwhile white house officials held meetings of their own friday considering potential tax cut packages that they hope might boost consumer confidence this comes after several days of unsuccessful efforts by president donald trump and his economic team to cajole people to buy stocks and drive prices higher the fed and white house deliberations illustrate how policymakers are searching for ways to arrest the sudden selloff which some analysts say raises the possibility of a recession later this year typically the fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain it also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of u s treasury securities effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash the white house and congress meanwhile can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with money but the best remedy for the coronavirus which has sickened more than 83 000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3 000 could lie beyond washington s immediate powers central banks don t make vaccines said david kotok chairman of cumberland advisors the renewed selling intensified calls for the fed to rescue the economy from an unforeseen shock the medical emergency already has disrupted global production networks curtailed air travel and hobbled economies in asia europe and the middle east with medical experts urging americans to prepare for serious disruptions in their daily lives pleas for early action are coming from wall street and some former members of the fed s rate setting committee the fed can t fix broken supply chains or calm concerns about health and safety but the fed can ensure that liquidity conditions remain supportive so firms can get funding through the disruption it can also provide support to financial markets said nathan sheets chief economist for pgim fixed income more generally the message that the fed is attentive and on the case has tended to help soothe the economy and the markets during past episodes by friday surveys of investors showed there was a nearly unanimous belief that the fed would cut rates by at least a quarter percentage point at its march 17 18 meeting that represents a sharp and sudden change from one week ago when just 11 percent expected fed action according to the cme group the shift comes as capital economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the united states which has seen roughly 60 cases so far could be enough to tip the economy into a mild recession it s uncertain though how effective cutting interest rates might be economists call episodes like the epidemic or the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks an exogenous shock meaning an unpredictable development that arises from outside the economy or financial system yet has significant economic consequences the fed normally acts only after assessing voluminous data on business and consumer activity using sophisticated computer models that forecast the future by comparing current conditions to what s happened in the past there is no recent precedent for the coronavirus outbreak for the fed to use in its models recessions can occur after the fed has begun raising interest rates to head off incipient inflation or after warning signs such as widespread layoffs or falling equipment orders as the economy gradually deteriorates the fed can cut rates to encourage more spending the white house and lawmakers meanwhile often support more spending or tax cuts to boost the economy the coronavirus which first emerged in china and has now spread to countries including south korea japan italy iran brazil and the united states poses a unique challenge in this case the virus materialized with no warning and after initially appearing to be confined to china swept into roughly 60 countries trump who has been criticized for a delayed and uncertain response to the crisis so far has given no hint of plans for any economic stimulus but his aides are looking at a range of options china stands as a cautionary tale the chinese government s aggressive measures to fight the crisis which included imposing quarantines over an area that is home to perhaps 60 million people chilled both supply and demand china s virus fighting campaign prevented employees from leaving their homes and working on assembly lines thus depressing the supply of goods and it kept people from patronizing restaurants movies or retail stores thereby cutting demand if the united states suffers a serious outbreak and people stay home fearing possible contagion cutting interest rates would probably do little to persuade them to return to work or go out to shop or dine this is a very tough one for the fed to deal with said dean baker senior economist at the center for economic and policy research the fed has a long history of fighting financial and economic downturns including the 1987 stock market plunge known as black monday and the russian debt default more than a decade later in 2008 after the collapse of the housing bubble the fed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for years in a bid to resuscitate the u s economy the fed moved quickly in the wake of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks to try and limit the economic fallout six days later with financial markets closed and smoke still curling from the world trade center rubble then fed chairman alan greenspan cut the benchmark u s lending rate by half a percentage point the central bank also pumped 102 billion into the financial system to grease the gears of the economy and ease an anticipated slowdown according to a subsequent study by the federal reserve bank of st louis until friday fed officials had been cautious in their public comments richard clarida the fed s vice chairman said earlier this week that the upheaval in china could reverberate through the global economy but it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook he said in a speech to an economists conference in washington for the past three years the fed has helped investors shrug off trump s serial trade wars cutting interest rates three times last year as inflation remained low between election day in 2016 and feb 12 of this year the dow jones industrial average rose by 61 percent in four days this week it surrendered one third of that gain as investors puzzled over what the virus will mean for corporate earnings by itself this week s historic stock market meltdown erasing nearly two years worth of gains and incurring the fastest 10 plus percent drop in history highlights the current peril economists are struggling to assess the extent of the calamity amid conflicting information about the virulence of the illness the likely public reaction if it spreads in the united states and the potential response from the fed or the trump administration to some the profound uncertainty recalls the financial crash that hit the united states and europe more than a decade ago forecasting in this environment feels eerily reminiscent of the crises the ground keeps shifting beneath me as i try to gain my footing diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton tweeted thursday the cloudy outlook shows no signs of clearing anytime soon on friday fitch solutions a risk analysis firm said it was revising down its forecasts for several european economies including germany after already having lowered its asian estimates one day earlier fitch said south korea would grow by just 1 7 percent this year down from its 2 2 percent original forecast and that estimate could go lower the firm said citing the risk that the outbreak will not be controlled by june

world economy needs potent economic medicine the covid 19 epidemic is accelerating and as the new coronavirus approaches pandemic status it is increasingly likely that the economic impact will be severe alongside intensifying public health responses governments must step in to mitigate the virus s impact on growth employment and living standards there are three reasons to worry that covid 19 will hit the global economy hard first regional and national travel restrictions will curb the flow of goods and services across borders and within countries this is already happening in china where growth forecasts for the first half of 2020 are being slashed as the world s second largest economy and home to much of the global supply chain china s slowdown is already being reflected in large us and european companies reduced earnings forecasts second increased uncertainty will translate into reduced big ticket spending by households and small businesses holidays and business travel are already being reconsidered as evidenced by the 200 000 plus airline cancellations so far this year auto and home purchases will likely follow suit before long businesses will put off investment in structures plant and equipment creating major negative ripple effects across the world s economies third sharp declines in global equity markets if sustained will harm the real economy plunging markets stoke fear and uncertainty reduce household wealth and therefore erode consumer spending they also raise the cost of capital for firms which means less hiring and reduced capital expenditures in short covid 19 and the responses to it could easily lead to a global spending shortfall which would soon be followed by mounting job losses potentially pushing real economies everywhere to the brink of recession but governments have tools for fighting recession low inflation below central bank targets in most cases means that monetary policy can be eased without raising concerns of overheating and ultra low bond yields will allow governments in developed and many emerging economies to borrow and spend on stimulus measures in any case the policy response should be flexible and reversible in the event that the epidemic and its economic impact are less severe than feared so what specifically should governments do first they must implement measures to stabilise commercial activity without delay corporate tax cuts infrastructure spending and other measures with delayed effects are ill advised tax holidays or reductions of payroll sales and value added taxes have more to recommend them the point is to boost disposable purchasing power within days not months by putting more money in the hands of middle and low income households who tend to spend a greater fraction of their incomes wisely that is what the united states the united kingdom and many other countries did during the 2008 09 great recession though many economists including me would have preferred an even bigger stimulus package second even if the effectiveness of monetary policy has been diminished after a decade of low and even negative interest rates the major central banks should announce fresh rate cuts and liquidity provisions when fear strikes the demand for money can spike central banks should make clear far in advance that they will meet or even exceed that demand as former european central bank president mario draghi demonstrated at the height of the eurozone crisis a stated commitment to do whatever it takes may well be the most powerful weapon in monetary policymakers arsenal third governments everywhere should adopt legislation to increase and extend unemployment benefits at least temporarily as with cutting regressive taxes increased unemployment benefits will put cash in the hands of those most likely to spend it in the near term providing a necessary offset to weaker spending elsewhere in the economy moreover in the case of the us the federal government should authorise temporary block grants to states facing hard budget constraints in order to avert near term deficits that would require counterproductive tax increases or spending cuts again this approach proved effective during the last recession when federal transfers to states offset about one third of state governments budget shortfalls finally all governments should immediately boost spending on medical services which must be made available to those most at risk from the coronavirus the elderly the poor and the marginalised both in cities and remote rural communities policymakers should immediately authorise spending for fleets of mobile medical units to reach those who cannot otherwise access proper care yes some commentators will fret about the fiscal consequences of tax cuts and increased government spending but they will be wrong to do so low and falling bond yields mean that most advanced and large emerging economies have extraordinary leeway to borrow at little cost central banks are ready to hoover up any government debt that financial markets cannot absorb besides emergency measures will be temporary and subject to reversal after the crisis passes deficits are tomorrow s problem the challenge today is to fight covid 19 and its harmful economic effects not acting forcefully and immediately would be akin to letting the patient die just to teach him a lesson partisanship and zero sum politics are no excuse for governments to shirk their fundamental obligations to citizens indeed if any good can come from this crisis it is that politicians might finally find a way to set aside their differences and do their job 2020 project syndicate
tax systems in countries differ and it is difficult to ascertain the ideal tax rate as this would vary depending on the political economy and levels of inequality all governments try to lower tax rates but there are always fiscal pressures that come in the way of policy in this context it is useful to see how our tax rates compare globally rarely does a country have a singular tax rate the principles of public economics are based on the ability to pay with the state taking on the job of redistribution therefore one can look at the highest tax rate as an indication of a regime s obtrusiveness in the case of corporate tax rate too various models are pursued even in india companies can follow alternative regimes and companies receive several exemptions hence tax rates per se may not be strictly comparable the same holds for taxes on goods gst while now a staple in most countries has different structures for instance it may not always be applicable at a single rate with governments differing on nature of goods and services and some taxing necessities at a lower rate to make a meaningful comparison the data here is sourced from trading economics to maintain homogeneity comparison is made between the corporate tax rate highest income tax rate and sales tax rate of 10 countries five developed countries and the brics nations to see where india stands the accompanying graphic shows that russia has the lowest tax rates for individuals as well as corporates however at 20 the goods tax remains on par with that in other countries the developed countries have rates significantly higher than india s when it comes to personal income reflecting the relative friendliness of our tax regime corporate tax rate in india is lower than that in half the countries considered and hence comes at the median level evidently the government has made efforts to rationalise tax rates on both counts and while the issues of exemptions can be debated it is significant that india is well aligned with global standards as for taxes on goods india s 18 rate is at the lower end south africa china japan and brazil do better gst rates are not cast in stone and in the last couple of years several changes have been made to them and over a period of time these rates can be expected to reach equilibrium therefore india appears well positioned on the tax curve interestingly barring brazil and russia in all countries considered the corporate tax rate is lower than the personal tax rate implying industry is favoured this is significant because when profitable corporates pay lower taxes than individuals the surplus goes back to shareholders who constitute the elite the other issue on budgets relates to deficits and government debt here too there are problems with defining what constitutes deficit and debt given that all countries have the concept of off balance sheet activity which get aligned to the accounting standards yet based on the commonly accepted definitions these two variables have been plotted in the accompanying graphic to give an idea of how much our budgets are aligned with those of other countries this quite revealing because it again shows that india is well placed in the global context the fiscal deficit at 3 3 excludes states is on par with most countries and is sixth on the list usa has the highest deficit among the developed nations while such levels can be justified given that the dollar is the world economy s anchor currency the fact remains that the government is definitely spending more than it earns germany runs a surplus as does russia which has the benefit of oil money china too has a deficit of 4 2 which reinforces the rather aggressive role governments play in emerging markets as this is during a slowdown in the world economy india s debt to gdp ratio includes state liabilities and at 69 6 is at the median level the developed countries enjoying the benefit of international currencies have higher debt ratios usa and japan are above 100 and the uk backed by the pound has a ratio of 81 the ratio for france is also close to 100 for the euro currencies these ratios have been moderated since the euro crisis which led to substantial restructuring and has only stabilised recently india can take comfort in the fact that its debt ratio is denominated in rupees and hence poses no contagion risk in extreme situations the government too has shown character in following the frbm path the 3 3 number 3 5 for fy21 combined with states deficits of not more than 3 would amount to 6 5 which the system can support hence while there has been a call for fiscal stimulus the government has been prudent in not allowing fiscal numbers to go overboard at the same time the tax reforms have worked towards aligning rates with global standards while there is still scope given the highly diversified tax paying class for tinkering with rates the principles of public economics have largely been adhered to critics may highlight the inclusion of contingent liabilities but to make a fair assessment government assets would also have to be included in the calculation often this point is missed and liabilities of psus are pointed at without looking at their assets which have significant value the writer is chief economist care ratings views are personal
the financial markets plunged into a state of abject panic this week thanks to the novel coronavirus as the rising number of covid 19 cases fanned fears that a recession could be on the way stocks fell at record speed investors also piled into government bonds sending yields to new lows a sign that the world s money guys are desperate for safe bets as the possibility of a true pandemic becomes real why is the coronavirus such a menacing economic threat the first most obvious answer is that the disease could disrupt life and commerce as the world knows it global supply chains are already getting scrambled as much of china the world s factory has been put on lockdown chinese consumers have stopped shopping hurting sales of everything from cars to iphones tourists are staying home and if coronavirus truly washes across the u s as public health officials seem to expect it could prevent americans from going to the office their favorite restaurants or the movies as people s daily routines grind to a halt so too could the economy that brings us to the second less obvious concern that s contributing to the climate of fear if the coronavirus does cause a severe economic slump the normal playbook for fighting recession might not work very well here s why most downturns are the result of what economists call demand shocks some financial calamity befalls the country gas prices spike a stock bubble bursts or housing prices go into freefall or the fed hikes interest rates too aggressively and as a result businesses and households cut back spending when this happens the government has plenty of ways to respond central bankers can cut interest rates to encourage more borrowing and investment lawmakers can increase government spending or lower taxes in order to get businesses humming and put money in people s pockets advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement a budding pandemic is likely to be different for starters it creates demand problems that can t necessarily be solved by putting money in people s pockets families aren t going to spend a tax cut on a trip to disney world if they re afraid to go out in public at the same time as the economist s ryan avent pointed out earlier this week coronavirus is also threatening to create a supply shock by simply cutting off access to goods and services slashing interest rates won t help a factory that suddenly can t get supplies from china or whose workers are stuck at home and families also can t spend their tax cut on that disney vacation if the park is closed to prevent the virus from spreading advertisement none of this means that policy makers should just sit by and watch misfortune unfold on friday federal reserve chair jerome powell said that he and his colleagues stand ready to intervene as necessary to stabilize the economy but in the end it s just not clear how much he or anybody else who isn t in charge of a public health response can do issue number three people are worried that a recession brought about by coronavirus could trigger landmines that have seemingly been waiting to explode in the financial world china watchers have long worried about the massive amount of iffy lending undertaken by the country s banks those risks could now come to a head as the country s economy slows in the u s a decade of low interest rates has led to a junk bond boom particularly among energy companies with oil prices falling it s possible that many drillers could default on their debts many of which have been diced up repackaged and sold to investors as collateralized loan obligations few people expect the fallout out to be as bad as the great recession but it could deepen any downturn fourth there s just the sheer uncertainty of it all nobody has any real frame of reference for what s coming the world s way right now outbreaks like sars and swine flu haven t prepared us for a hard to spot wildly contagious pathogen we don t know what the public health and economic damage will be and we don t know what knock on effects it could trigger we have few answers and plenty to be afraid of as always the markets are worried about fear itself

trader fred demarco works on the floor of the new york stock exchange friday feb 28 2020 global stock markets are falling further on spreading virus fears ap photo richard drew the stock market fell for the seventh straight day friday with the dow jones industrial average losing 357 points or 1 4 percent to close at 25 409 only by staging a late rally in the final 15 minutes of trading was the dow able to avert its third daily loss this week of more than 1 000 points the sustained selloff driven by fears of global economic damage from the spreading coronavirus prompted both the federal reserve and the white house to hunt for possible remedies eyeing tools they have used during past crises to calm the public the traditional tactics however may not work against a financial panic driven by a global health scare that lacks precedent or antidote a sign of the crisis fighting difficulties ahead came in the afternoon when federal reserve chairman jerome powell issued an unusual statement vowing to act as appropriate to defend the u s economy from the outbreak many analysts interpreted the statement as a pledge to cut interest rates a signal that often heartens investors but this time the selloff continued after a week that shaved more than 4 trillion from global stock values powell s effort was among a series of steps meant to reassure frazzled investors nothing so far appears to be working the fundamentals of the u s economy remain strong powell said however the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity the federal reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy evercore isi an investment firm told clients friday that it now expects the fed to cut rates by a half percentage point at its mid march meeting something few expected just one week ago advertisement meanwhile white house officials held meetings of their own friday considering potential tax cut packages that they hope might boost consumer confidence this comes after several days of unsuccessful efforts by president donald trump and his economic team to cajole people to buy stocks and drive prices higher the fed and white house deliberations illustrate how policymakers are searching for ways to arrest the sudden selloff which some analysts say raises the possibility of a recession later this year typically the fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain it also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of u s treasury securities effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash the white house and congress meanwhile can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with money but the best remedy for the coronavirus which has sickened more than 83 000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3 000 could lie beyond washington s immediate powers central banks don t make vaccines said david kotok chairman of cumberland advisors the renewed selling intensified calls for the fed to rescue the economy from an unforeseen shock the medical emergency already has disrupted global production networks curtailed air travel and hobbled economies in asia europe and the middle east with medical experts urging americans to prepare for serious disruptions in their daily lives pleas for early action are coming from wall street and some former members of the fed s rate setting committee the fed can t fix broken supply chains or calm concerns about health and safety but the fed can ensure that liquidity conditions remain supportive so firms can get funding through the disruption it can also provide support to financial markets said nathan sheets chief economist for pgim fixed income more generally the message that the fed is attentive and on the case has tended to help soothe the economy and the markets during past episodes by friday surveys of investors showed there was a nearly unanimous belief that the fed would cut rates by at least a quarter percentage point at its march 17 18 meeting that represents a sharp and sudden change from one week ago when just 11 percent expected fed action according to the cme group the shift comes as capital economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the united states which has seen roughly 60 cases so far could be enough to tip the economy into a mild recession it s uncertain though how effective cutting interest rates might be economists call episodes like the epidemic or the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks an exogenous shock meaning an unpredictable development that arises from outside the economy or financial system yet has significant economic consequences the fed normally acts only after assessing voluminous data on business and consumer activity using sophisticated computer models that forecast the future by comparing current conditions to what s happened in the past there is no recent precedent for the coronavirus outbreak for the fed to use in its models recessions can occur after the fed has begun raising interest rates to head off incipient inflation or after warning signs such as widespread layoffs or falling equipment orders as the economy gradually deteriorates the fed can cut rates to encourage more spending the white house and lawmakers meanwhile often support more spending or tax cuts to boost the economy the coronavirus which first emerged in china and has now spread to countries including south korea japan italy iran brazil and the united states poses a unique challenge in this case the virus materialized with no warning and after initially appearing to be confined to china swept into roughly 60 countries trump who has been criticized for a delayed and uncertain response to the crisis so far has given no hint of plans for any economic stimulus but his aides are looking at a range of options china stands as a cautionary tale the chinese government s aggressive measures to fight the crisis which included imposing quarantines over an area that is home to perhaps 60 million people chilled both supply and demand china s virus fighting campaign prevented employees from leaving their homes and working on assembly lines thus depressing the supply of goods and it kept people from patronizing restaurants movies or retail stores thereby cutting demand if the united states suffers a serious outbreak and people stay home fearing possible contagion cutting interest rates would probably do little to persuade them to return to work or go out to shop or dine this is a very tough one for the fed to deal with said dean baker senior economist at the center for economic and policy research advertisement the fed has a long history of fighting financial and economic downturns including the 1987 stock market plunge known as black monday and the russian debt default more than a decade later in 2008 after the collapse of the housing bubble the fed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for years in a bid to resuscitate the u s economy the fed moved quickly in the wake of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks to try and limit the economic fallout six days later with financial markets closed and smoke still curling from the world trade center rubble then fed chairman alan greenspan cut the benchmark u s lending rate by half a percentage point the central bank also pumped 102 billion into the financial system to grease the gears of the economy and ease an anticipated slowdown according to a subsequent study by the federal reserve bank of st louis until friday fed officials had been cautious in their public comments richard clarida the fed s vice chairman said earlier this week that the upheaval in china could reverberate through the global economy but it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook he said in a speech to an economists conference in washington for the past three years the fed has helped investors shrug off trump s serial trade wars cutting interest rates three times last year as inflation remained low between election day in 2016 and feb 12 of this year the dow jones industrial average rose by 61 percent in four days this week it surrendered one third of that gain as investors puzzled over what the virus will mean for corporate earnings by itself this week s historic stock market meltdown erasing nearly two years worth of gains and incurring the fastest 10 plus percent drop in history highlights the current peril economists are struggling to assess the extent of the calamity amid conflicting information about the virulence of the illness the likely public reaction if it spreads in the united states and the potential response from the fed or the trump administration to some the profound uncertainty recalls the financial crash that hit the united states and europe more than a decade ago forecasting in this environment feels eerily reminiscent of the crises the ground keeps shifting beneath me as i try to gain my footing diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton tweeted thursday advertisement the cloudy outlook shows no signs of clearing anytime soon on friday fitch solutions a risk analysis firm said it was revising down its forecasts for several european economies including germany after already having lowered its asian estimates one day earlier fitch said south korea would grow by just 1 7 percent this year down from its 2 2 percent original forecast and that estimate could go lower the firm said citing the risk that the outbreak will not be controlled by june

yen s position as the go to currency the japanese yen surged by 3 33 to end the week at 107 89 against the u s dollar risk aversion in the week weighed heavily on the nikkei which slumped by 9 59 leaving the index down by 8 89 for february out of china there were no material stats to provide direction ahead of private sector pmis on the weekend a lack of stats left updates on the coronavirus to provide direction that was ultimately positive for the yuan in contrast the sell off across the global stock markets weighed on the csi300 and hang seng though they did fare better than the pack the csi300 fell by 5 05 with the hang seng falling by 4 32 in the week in the week ending 28th february the yuan rose by 0 50 to cny6 9920 against the greenback

have been communicated throughout our company we have structured departmental goals around these factors and have created employee incentive plans in which every employee will have a meaningful incentive for our success regulatory environment the fda is currently considering changes which may include increased regulation of laboratory developed tests ldts by the fda in october 2014 the fda announced its proposed framework and timetable and indicated it would move toward greater oversight of ldts the fda has not finalized the framework they announced in 2014 in 2017 the fda shifted its approach to oversight of ldts indicating that they would work with congress and stakeholders on a new legislative framework and pathway for all diagnostic testing in 2018 the fda began limited enforcement activities on a subset of ldts known as pharmacogenetic testing pgx neogenomics is a member of the american clinical laboratory association acla which has been in active discussions with the fda and congress regarding fda oversight of ldt s at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this proposed framework or if there will be any additional changes to current rules and regulations we closely monitor changes in legislation and take specific actions to identify and estimate the impact of changes in legislation whenever possible as regulatory changes can affect reimbursement for clinical laboratory services we do not anticipate significant changes to our clinical revenue in 2020 based on known changes in legislation operating segments the company reports its activities in two operating segments the clinical services segment and the pharma services segment we have presented the financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker codm including revenues cost of revenue and gross margin for each of our operating segments the segment information presented in these financial statements has been conformed to present segments on this revised basis for all prior periods assets are not presented at the segment level as that information is not used by the codm clinical services our clinical services segment includes the cancer testing services we offer to community based pathologists hospitals academic centers and oncology groups and is designed to be a natural extension of and complementary to the services that they perform within their own practices we believe our relationship as a non competitive partner to community based pathology practices hospital pathology labs and academic centers empowers them to expand their breadth of testing and provide a menu of services that matches or exceeds the level of service found in any center of excellence around the world 39 table of contents neogenomics inc pharma services our pharma services segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials this portion of our business often involves working with the pharmaceutical firms sponsors on study design as well as performing the testing required to validate assays in development and support of phase i ii and iii clinical trials our medical team often advises the sponsor and works closely with them as specimens are received from enrolled sites we also work on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine patients response to a particular drug as studies unfold our clinical trials team reports the data and often provide key analysis and insights back to the sponsors our pharma services segment provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients oncology programs from discovery to commercialization in biomarker discovery our aim is to help our customers discover the right content we help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform for molecular screening and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data in other pre and non clinical work we can use our platforms to characterize markers of interest moving from discovery to development we help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and if applicable develop a companion diagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large scale clinical trial testing whether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one our pharma services group provides significant technical expertise working closely with our customers to support each stage of clinical trial development each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time dedicated project management and quality assurance oversight we have experience in supporting submissions to the federal drug administration for companion diagnostics and our pharma services strategy is focused on helping bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world class laboratory services in oncology to key pharmaceutical companies in the industry critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note b summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements our critical accounting policies are those where we have made difficult subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and or where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition accounts receivable stock based compensation deferred taxes revenue recognition we adopted accounting standards codification asc 606 revenues from contracts with customers on january 1 2018 using a full retrospective method of adoption under this method the company has restated its results for each prior reporting period presented as if asc 606 had been effective for those periods the adoption of this standard required us to implement new revenue policies procedures and internal controls related to revenue recognition in addition the adoption resulted in enhanced financial statement disclosures surrounding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the new standard impacted each of our two reportable segments differently due to the transactional nature of the clinical services segment versus the generally long term nature of our pharma services segment contracts the specific effect on our reportable segments is explained further in note b summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements clinical services revenue the company s specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form or electronic equivalent the performance obligation is satisfied and revenues are recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed and the results have been delivered to the ordering physician these diagnostic services are billed to various payers including client 40 table of contents neogenomics inc direct billing commercial insurance medicare and other government payers and patients revenue is recorded for all payers based on the amount expected to be collected which considers implicit price concessions implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the company expects to receive based on negotiated discounts historical collection experience and other anticipated adjustments including anticipated payer denials collection of consideration the company expects to receive typically occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing for commercial insurance medicare and other governmental and self pay payers and within 60 to 90 days of billing for client payers the following table reflects our estimate of the breakdown of net revenue by type of payer for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 2019 2018 2017 medicare and other government 18 15 14 commercial insurance 23 17 17 client direct billing 59 68 69 total 100 100 100 client direct billing is down 9 as compared to 2018 due to the acquisition of genoptix historically genoptix has had has less volume of client direct billings within their payer mix however our proportion of client direct billing remains high as more payers including private commercial insurances and medicare advantage plans are practicing consolidated payment or bundled payment models where they pay the hospitals a lump sum which is intended to include laboratory testing this reflects an increase in the amount of risk sharing that cms and other private payers are encouraging providers such as hospital systems to undertake on january 1 2018 medicare made a significant change to what is known as the 14 day rule the net result of this rule change is that certain molecular tests that were previously billed to clients are once again eligible to be billed directly to the medicare program pharma services revenue the company s pharma services segment generally enters into contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as other contract research organizations cros to provide research and clinical trial services ranging in duration from one month to several years the company records revenue on a unit of service basis based on number of units completed and the total expected contract value the total expected contract value is estimated based on historical experience of total contracted units compared to realized units as well as known factors on a specific contract by contract basis certain contracts include upfront fees final settlement amounts or billing milestones that may not align with the completion of performance obligations the value of these upfront fees or final settlement amounts is usually recognized over time based on the number of units completed which aligns with the progress of the company towards fulfilling its obligations under the contract the company also enters into other contracts such as validation studies for which the sole deliverable is a final report that is sent to sponsors at the completion of contracted activities for these contracts revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the final report to the sponsor any contracts that contain multiple performance obligations and include both units of service and point in time deliverables are accounted for as separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized as previously disclosed the company negotiates billing schedules and payment terms on a contract by contract basis while the contract terms generally provide for payments based on a unit of service arrangement the billing schedules payment terms and related cash payments may not align with the performance of services and as such may not correspond to revenue recognized in any given period amounts collected in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the balance sheet the associated revenue is recognized and the contract liability is reduced as the contracted services are subsequently performed contract assets are established for revenue that has been recognized but not yet billed these contract assets are reduced once the customer is invoiced and a corresponding account receivable is recorded additionally certain costs to obtain contracts primarily for sales commissions are capitalized when incurred and are amortized over the term of the contract amounts capitalized for contracts with an initial contract term of twelve months or less are classified as current assets and all others are classified as non current assets most contracts are terminable by the customer either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts all contracts require payment of fees to the company for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract 41 table of contents neogenomics inc trade

under the contract days sales outstanding dso increased from 77 days at december 31 2018 to 81 days at december 31 2019 due to timing of cash receipts stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs for all share based payment awards made to employees non employee contracted physicians and directors based upon the awards initial grant date fair value for stock options we use a trinomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards and recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods the company s periodic expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures see note b summary of significant accounting policies and note m stock compensation in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information regarding the assumptions used in our valuation of stock based compensation deferred taxes our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates the factors included in the analysis are historical and projected future taxable income including evolving business practices of our industry changes in existing tax laws regulations rates and future operating results may impact the amount of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets over time management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets as of december 31 2018 and 2019 the company determined that sufficient positive evidence did not exist to conclude that it is more likely than not that net operating losses generated by the company s switzerland and singapore operations would be able to be utilized in future periods and has therefore established a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated by such losses 42 table of contents neogenomics inc

revenues from contracts with customers asc 606 this standard update calls for a number of revisions in the revenue recognition rules the company adopted this asu on january 1 2018 using a full retrospective method of adoption under this method the company has restated its results for each prior reporting period presented as if asc 606 had been effective for those periods the adoption of this standard required us to implement new revenue policies procedures and internal controls related to revenue recognition in addition the adoption resulted in enhanced financial statement disclosures surrounding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers for further details see note c revenue recognition 49 table of contents neogenomics inc the new standard impacts each of our two reportable segments differently due to the transactional nature of the clinical services segment versus the generally long term nature of our pharma services contracts the specific effect on our reportable segments is explained below clinical services revenue under the new standard substantially all of our bad debt expense which has historically been presented as part of general and administrative expense is considered an implicit price concession and is reported as a reduction in revenue as a result of asc 606 we reported a material cumulative reduction in clinical revenue from previously reported periods and a similar reduction in general and administrative expenses pharma services revenue the adoption of asc 606 also resulted in changes to the timing of revenue recognition related to pharma services contracts as certain individual deliverables such as study setup fees for which revenue was previously recognized in the period when the deliverables were completed and invoiced are recognized over the remaining performance period under the new standard additionally certain costs to obtain contracts primarily for sales commissions are capitalized when incurred and are amortized over the term of the contract under asc 606 the company is required to make estimates of the total transaction price per contract including estimates of variable consideration and the number of performance obligations and recognize the estimated amount as revenue as it transfers control of the product or performance obligations to its customers the estimation of total transaction price number of performance obligations variable consideration and the application of the related constraint was not required under previous gaap and requires the use of significant management judgment and estimates the company elected certain practical expedients as allowed under the standard including the following contracts that began and ended within the same annual reporting period were not restated contracts with variable consideration were estimated using the transaction price at the date the contract was completed contract modifications that occurred prior to the earliest reporting period have not been retrospectively restated but have rather been reflected as an aggregate adjustment in the earliest reporting period the cumulative effect of this standard did not result in a material change to our pharma services revenue in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 2017 04 intangibles goodwill and other simplifying the test for goodwill impairment this standard eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test instead an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2019 the company early adopted this standard on january 1 2018 the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements accounting pronouncements pending adoption in august 2018 the fasb issued asu

implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software the implementation costs should be presented as a prepaid asset on the balance sheet and expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement the standard was effective for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 the company will adopt this pronouncement as of january

losses included in other comprehensive income this update was effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those periods certain provisions of asu 2018 13

experience current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount which may result in earlier recognition of credit losses under the new standard it also requires that credit losses related to available for sale debt securities be recorded as an allowance through net income rather than reducing the carrying amount under the current

in the usd cad this week took out all the resistance lines up to 1 3500 after penetrating to 1 3465 the pair retreated to 1 3410 just below a prominent line from may and early june last year the 21 day moving average steepened its climb while the 100 day average has yet to turn conclusively higher and the 200 day average reflects the august to december decline the first resistance at 1 3475 is moderately strong the site of a series of tops from late april to early june 2019 next is a weak line at 1 3500 the highs of a few sessions in the same april to june period next is 1 3535 the close and open for three days at the end of may and beginning of june above that are two weak lines from december 2018 at 1 3600 and 1 3645 below there is strong support at 1 3340 1 3300 1 3260 and 1 3225 all related to the november through february ranges beneath that are the lines at 1 3185 1 3135 1 3080 1 3040 and 1 2960 usd cad sentiment poll near term predictions have unsurprisingly soared but the farther out we go the stronger become the bearish expectations the one week view is less bullish 50 to 62 but then the bulls wishes have been fulfilled the bearish view is diminished 25 to 38 and the uncertain opinion has rise to 25 from flat the forecast of 1 3443 is just above the current market the one month view is less bullish 25 vs 48 more bearish 68 vs 52 and 7 percent neutral up from flat the forecast is 1 3312 is up from last week s 1 3199 but below friday s close the one quarter view is nearly equal in bullish sentiment 22 vs 25 much higher in the bearish view 72 vs 44 and decidedly less unsure 6 vs 31 the forecast at 1 3227 is up from last week s 1 3159 and nearly even with this week s open at 1 3225 the rapid emotional and one direction movement this week has clearly left traders unconvinced that it is permanent though parts of the rational the strong us economic statistics and the slipping canadian economy are real the potential for deterioration in the months ahead is high and the sharply lower us treasury rates will remain as long as the coronavirus drags on despite this week s rise in the usd cad the future is most uncertain
this article was produced by sludge an independent ad free investigative news site covering money in politics click here to support puerto rico was still recovering from hurricane maria when a magnitude 6 4 earthquake struck on jan 7 leveling buildings along its southern coast and damaging power plants that provide electricity throughout the territory rebuilding from the earthquake could cost as much as 3 billion for the island which is already more than 70 billion in debt despite the financial crisis puerto rico is facing a group of hedge funds and wall street firms that have invested puerto rican debt recently struck a deal with the washington appointed financial oversight and management board to help them extract massive profits from the island the deal which was agreed to on feb 9 and must still be approved by the legislative assembly would require puerto rico to make immediate cash payments to the bondholders and to pay back the rest of the debt at a higher rate and more quickly than what the parties had previously been agreed upon while a portion of the debt would be discharged under the new agreement the bondholders would be entitled to collect up to 77 cents on the dollar for debt that many of them purchased for pennies in the wake of hurricane maria the agreement could also jeopardize lawsuits brought by activists from puerto rico and the united states contending that a portion of the debt may be illegal because it violates puerto rico s constitutional debt limit or because of how its sale was initially negotiated this agreement is a bailout for wall street hedge funds that puts a heavy burden on the people of puerto rico and will inevitably lead to a second bankruptcy a coalition of 50 activist groups wrote in a letter to congress organized by the center for popular democracy hedge funds that bought this illegal debt for cents on the dollar are positioned to make a killing on their predatory investments while the people of puerto rico still reeling from hurricane maria and ongoing earthquakes are going to continue to face austerity measures and crippling sales taxes for decades to come puerto rico gov wanda vázquez opposes the agreement because it would not prevent pension cuts and her government has filed a motion in court to challenge it vasquez is a member of the pro statehood new progressive party which has a majority in both legislative chambers as the democrats running for president seek support from puerto ricans both those who will vote in the island s primary election on march 29 and those who may vote in the states three of them joe biden amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg have taken large contributions from executives and senior employees of the firms according to a sludge review of federal election commission records biden for example has taken more than 20 000 in large contributions from employees of firms involved in this deal his donors include frank brosens the co founder and owner of taconic capital advisors which owns at least 191 million worth of cofina bonds 2 000 from clinton biondo managing partner at puerto rico bondholder fir tree partners and 2 800 from kenneth eberts a partner and portfolio manager at goldman sachs asset management the division of the wall street banking giant that specializes in so called vulture investing in the distressed debt of places like puerto rico in a december 2019 opinion piece for the orlando sentinel biden criticized president trump s treatment of puerto rico and said that as president he would direct more federal support to the island we must rebuild the island and rebuild trust to make sure that puerto ricans have sound homes schools and hospitals real opportunities and a path to the middle class biden wrote any time a candidate says they are with puerto rico but at the same time are receiving money from companies and hedge funds that are profiting from puerto rico that shows either that they are not clear about how to support puerto rico or that they are not being forthright about their intentions julio lópez varona co director of community dignity campaigns with the center for popular democracy told sludge what we hope that candidates that are talking about supporting pr and its recovery understand is one that cancellation of the debt has to be part of that and two that they can t be getting money from the people that are making the recovery impossible lópez varona said pete buttigieg who is struggling to get support from non white voters recently released his el pueblo unido plan to drum up support among latinos the plan would offer political representation to puerto rico and establish a commission on disaster relief to focus on island and coastal regions including puerto rico and florida but buttigieg is also taking big bucks from executives of hedge funds that are looking to extract profit from puerto rico s economic crisis under the recent deal his donors include michael stern 1 000 partner and investment manager at stonehill capital management a new york hedge fund that is party to the agreement brian pennington 2 800 director of risk and quantitative resources at goldentree asset management a top puerto rico bondholder and conor barnstable 2 800 partner at hedge fund davidson kempner capital management another buttigieg donor is aristeia capital partner robert lynch who gave the maximum of 2 800 lynch is listed as a bundler for buttigieg meaning that he collected at least 25 000 worth of checks for buttigieg s campaign buttigieg also has another bundler who is an executive as a puerto rican bondholder firm though not one that is party to the recent deal william rahm senior managing director at centerbridge partners was among the more than 20 bundlers that the buttigieg campaign omitted from its original disclosure as the american prospect reported centerbridge is one of the funds that attempted to conceal its puerto rico debt holdings through shell companies klobuchar who visited puerto rican leaders in may 2019 to in her words listen to their needs and find ways to help has also received large contributions from companies that stand to benefit from the deal including from executives of taconic capital goldman sachs asset management and davidson kempner klobuchar s total haul from executives from firms signing the agreements is 14 900 executives at other hedge funds invested in puerto rican debt that were not part of the feb 9 deal have made donations to the candidates as the american prospect has outlined these other funds including baupost group bluemountain capital and oaktree capital are likely to negotiate a separate deal to secure profitable returns from puerto rico candidates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders last year refunded contributions from executives at taconic capital cand bluemountain capital after activists raised questions about them sludge asked the biden buttigieg and klobuchar campaigns if they oppose the new agreement between the bondholders and the oversight board and whether they would return the bondholders contributions but none responded last year a book by journalist ryan grim published revelations on how dnc chair tom perez edged out a victory over his progressive challenger keith ellison after a backroom deal for the dnc to support puerto rico statehood secured the votes of puerto rico s five dnc delegates perez s win was sealed with a shift in support to his camp by the new york dnc delegation which has ties to puerto rico bondholders that have contributed heavily to

however than confidence was shaken as the s p 500 fell 4 4 on thursday to 2 978 76 the dow jones industrial average shed 1 190 95 points its largest one day point drop in history bringing its loss for the week to 3 225 77 points or 11 1 to put that in perspective the dow s 508 point loss on oct 19 1987 was equal to 22 6 it is a race to the bottom for u s indices jingyi pan of ig said in a report it may still be too early to call a bottom given the uncertainty around the matter of the coronavirus impact investors came into 2020 feeling confident the federal reserve would keep interest rates at low levels and the u s china trade war posed less of a threat to company profits after the two sides signed a truce in january the s p 500 s decline puts the index into what market watches call a correction some analysts have said that was long overdue in a record setting bull market though mizuho bank noted it was the fastest correction since the great depression in the 1930s u s bond prices soared as investors fled to safe investments the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note fell as low as 1 24 a record low according to tradeweb when yields fall it s a sign that investors are

federal reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to protect the economy they are pricing in a 96 probability of a cut at the fed s next meeting in march just a day before they were calling for

via international man international man australia has proposed a law that provides a 25 000 fine and two years in jail for those who make cash transactions of 10 000 or more if passed the currency restrictions on the use of cash bill could be implemented in 2020 do you see this legislation as orwellian jeff thomas oh yes very much so the claim by the australian government s black economy taskforce is that the law will help stamp out tax evasion money laundering and other crimes what we ll be seeing is a plethora of laws popping up in all the countries that were a part of the post war prosperity boom the us canada japan australia europe and others all those jurisdictions dove headlong into the debt pit that the us created after 1971 all of them are now facing an economic crisis as a result consequently all of them will be creating capital controls my belief is that each will host several of these laws and the others will all adopt them each law will be justified as protection against money laundering terrorism tax evasion a rising black market or a combination of those scare tactic focal points as such the populace of each country will welcome them not understanding that the real purpose is to have the banks determine how much you re allowed to spend by having each country put forth a portion of the laws then having all the others copy them they ll hope to make the laws appear to be less draconian after all how bad could they be if all these countries support them many of these laws will be based on the assumption that cash will be eliminated and all transactions must be undertaken by the banks banks will also be authorised to examine what you re spending the money on at first the oversight would relate to large expenditures but later it would be smaller expenditures that together make up larger amounts the outcome would be that all outlays would be suspect and could be refused by the bank those depositors who had a history of transactions having been in question would find that all transactions would be monitored in future as though they weren t already international man how can people combat the laws that are coming jeff thomas anyone who lives in any of the countries that are most seriously at risk still has time prior to the passage of the laws to liquidate his holdings in those countries then he may move the proceeds to a jurisdiction that s likely to be safer if you own a home sell it now and rent it back from the new owners that way you get to remain in the house you like but the value of your house would have been taken out of the country that gives you a nest egg elsewhere in addition to making it easier to walk away from the house after things begin unravelling in a crisis your true net worth consists of the amount of wealth that you have already succeeded in expatriating so you liquidate all assets and get the proceeds safely out if things don t go so badly the money can always be repatriated but if things do go badly you will have kept your family from becoming casualties international man is a cashless society the only way for governments and central banks to continue to wield their power through debt based paper currency jeff thomas no there s a host of means which they can employ in my belief they ll use the shotgun method coming at people with a variety of approaches at the same time that would make it more likely that when people seek loopholes in the system those loopholes will already be closed and people resign themselves to their fate in normal times they d be likely to drag the process out in order to be less obvious but they re running out of time the house of cards hasn t collapsed but it s shaking and they ll want to entrap your wealth as much as possible as quickly as possible international man the trend toward eliminating cash completely is accelerating in a cashless society every transaction can be tracked and centrally controlled what does this mean for privacy and freedom jeff thomas it means three things first it means that they can keep tabs on all your transactions your financial privacy is gone we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us second it means that in future transactions can be refused if they re questionable maybe your trip to panama has been deemed unjustified by the powers that be or your transfer to a bank in singapore has been deemed invalid in this way they ll be able to not only monitor your transactions but limit your monetary freedom those who repeatedly operate outside of the accepted norm may well go onto watch lists where they increasingly must seek permission to make transactions at first this won t be as simple as an allowed refused programme it will be more polite you ll receive a notice that says for policy reasons we have been unable to complete this transaction please provide additional documentation as to the purpose of the transaction for our records they ll bury you in requests for documentation you ll accept the idea that you must provide them with information and very soon you ll become accustomed to pleading with your bank to use your own money as you see fit third because they have a record of all your transactions your government can change the method of taxation from an annual voluntary tax payment to a direct debit i believe that they would soon announce that they ll be performing direct debits quarterly or even monthly for your benefit their claim will be that they re relieving you of the hardship of the annual big hit and replacing it with a series of smaller ones you ll then see a series of debits on your bank statements that are intentionally confusing you won t be able to figure out their method for determining the debit amounts although it will over time become apparent that they re taking more and more international man what happens once negative interest rates are incurred on deposits jeff thomas well once you have no choice but to entrust all your transactions to your bank negative interest rates will be implemented after that they ll rise again and again my guess is that you ll see rates on your bank statement such as 2 371 one month followed by 2 592 the following month it will seem very technical and you ll come to think of it as being like the stock market going up and down each month as necessary but it will be a scam it will quite simply be the theft of your money on deposit international man what should people be doing to combat this trend jeff thomas well first off i d expect that this will begin in the us eu canada etc and then spread outward there are those jurisdictions like switzerland the channel islands etc that are more geared to providing favourable services to their clients than the large powers do they ll hold out at first but once the majority of the world is on board with this scam they ll jump on board also after all it s a license to skin you each month what bank is going to pass that opportunity up so in the end it will go global international man do you see any hope for either derailing this system or opting out of it jeff thomas as long as the current economic system remains as it is no the only escape is to either get out of cash or move to a country that s likely to continue to use cash and the best that will do will be to buy you a bit more time ultimately this will succeed up until the day comes when there s a collapse in the system itself some people will try to escape through the use of cryptos but if cryptos become the one and only loophole we can be sure that they will be either taken over or outlawed there s zero chance that the powers that be will allow for this massive wealth grab to be thwarted by those who deal in cryptos i should mention that at this point i don t have any particular vision in mind as to how this might be done but the achilles heel of cryptos is that they are exchanged for goods and services at some point it will be at that point that a red flag is raised and the trader is exposed and prosecuted for economic terrorism or whatever trumped up term is created at the time cryptos just may be the greatest economic invention of the twenty first century and that s just why they can t be allowed to go mainstream all on their own they can defeat the banks most profitable money maker and that can t be allowed to happen editor s note governments around the world have put their money printing on overdrive unfortunately there s little any individual can practically do to change the course of these trends in

by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time there is never a good time for a global pandemic but this moment is especially bad and that is because the world is more in debt than it has ever been according to a report from the international institute of finance the global debt to gdp ratio hit 322 in the third quarter of 2019 in developed markets debt hit 383 of gdp this includes everything from household debt to corporate and sovereign debt this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now business insider spurred by low interest rates and loose financial conditions we estimate that total global debt will exceed 257 trillion in 2020 driven mainly by non financial sector debt now approaching 200 trillion said the report in these conditions an economic shock can do a lot of damage think of it like going into fire season after weeks of drought debt itself won t be the problem but if there is a significant slowdown debt will exacerbate that problem it doesn t matter how low interest rates are if businesses and individuals simply don t have the cash flow to make debt payments advertisement so lowering interest rates which is what policymakers have been doing in the face of any kind of slow down since the financial crisis may not be that helpful if things really go south meanwhile president donald trump who has called himself the king of debt seems most interested in keeping confidence up so the stock market doesn t fall this is cosmetic his administration crippled america s ability to respond to pandemics a while ago so it s clear his interest has never been in solving problems like the one coronavirus poses he just wants everything to seem fine debt will make all of that more difficult down for a count americans households are 14 5 trillion worth of debt according to data compiled by the new york federal reserve that s about 1 5 trillion more than we were holding the last time household debt peaked in 2008 the biggest chunk of this debt is held in mortgages then student loans then auto loans followed by credit cards that means that if a significant economic slowdown does come and people are forced to work less or not at all they ll have trouble paying down the debt they owe we already know that coronavirus is causing massive supply chain disruptions manufacturing jobs especially depend on factories having every part they need to build what they build those parts come from all over the world especially china and in china especially hard hit provinces like guangdong and hubei advertisement if factories can t open employees will likely see their hours cut back for americans living paycheck to paycheck that could mean the difference between making and missing debt payments enough of this kind of household financial strain could slow the entire economy especially since consumer spending is its brightest spot right now the american consumer really is the firewall between an expanding economy and a recession mark zandi said chief economist at moody s analytics told reuters related stories corporate america has the same problem in its financial stability report last may the new york fed noted that growth in business debt has outpaced gdp for the past 10 years with the most rapid growth in debt over recent years concentrated among the riskiest firms and goldman sachs is predicting that in a worse case scenario corporate earnings the thing that keeps these debt levels manageable could actually contract in 2020 due to the coronavirus advertisement to be clear there are a wide range of opinions out there about what coronavirus impact will be while the market basically ignored it until this week there are some economists even former fed chair janet yellen who say it could take the us and the world to the brink of recession but even if the spread of the coronavirus is slowed in the next few weeks there will be parts of the economy that won t snap back as quickly as others what s worse in a lot of cases these are parts of the economy that were already hurting for example while trump has credited himself for a renaissance in american manufacturing the reality is that there has been no such thing during his presidency for the entire second half of 2019 the institute of supply management which tracks manufacturing activity calculated that the sector was contracting it just barely managed to swing back to growth in january but the coronavirus spread will likely end all that according to deutche bank 20 of us inputs are imported from china manufacturing businesses are especially dependent on these inputs as part of their supply chains once these supply chains are broken they can take some time to recover advertisement deutsche bank the auto industry serves as a good example back in 2011 when japan was hit by the tohoku earthquake and tsunami the industry s domestic output fell 60 and took seven to eight months to recover according to capital economics the rest of the country s economy bounced back much faster in january about 986 000 americans were employed in motor vehicle parts manufacturing in some way shape or form according to the bureau of labor statistics if auto supply chains are broken and factories close for a time they could see their hours cut back significantly that in turn would make it harder for workers and businesses to pay down their debt pile king of debt king of denial none of this seems to be concerning the president of the united states at least not directly in fact until this week he s basically been in a state of denial according to the washington post trump didn t want to say much about the coronavirus for fear that it would harm his chances of making another trade deal with china instead of preparing for a crisis he s been worrying about the stock market in an effort to keep investor confidence up he s resorted to his normal nonsense calling media reporting on the coronavirus fake news while his minions on right wing fringe sites bully dr nancy messonnier a center of disease control official handling the coronavirus response advertisement he s also sent his administration out to tell people to look past the coronavirus in a cnbc interview this week economic adviser larry kudlow buy stocks the virus story is not going to last forever he said and that s why i like the world health organization saying let s not overreact to me if you are an investor out there and you have a long term point of view i would suggest very seriously taking a look at a market a stock market that is a lot cheaper than it was a week or two ago the long term investor none of this will work and stocks will continue to stocks slide for reference the dow jones industrial average is down another 9 5 since kudlow told americans to buy the dip even if the administration could show some semblance of competence which it hasn t that may only calm things down temporarily the bad news of coronavirus ravages on the economy is only beginning the market is aware that corporate earnings are going to get hit in a meaningful way going forward and it knows what everyone s balance sheet looks like too
investors fearing that the spread of the coronavirus is tipping the global economy into a recession handed the stock market its largest weekly loss since the 2008 financial crisis on friday amid worries that one of the longest economic expansions in history may be coming to an end with the virus now detected in at least 56 countries companies are readjusting their annual profit expectations economists are lowering their forecasts for global growth and policymakers have signaled that they are ready if needed to act to stabilize the economy as the stock market dropped again on friday jerome h powell chair of the federal reserve issued a short statement affirming that the central bank would use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy after the fed s statement the s p 500 pared some of its losses closing the day down 0 8 percent though the index remained down 11 5 percent for the week
washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the coronavirus poses evolving risks to the u s economy and signaled the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates if necessary to sustain the country s longest ever expansion the rare statement issued friday by powell before the financial markets closed for the u s weekend came as stocks posted their seventh straight daily loss a slump which earlier prompted a string of wall street banks to predict the fed would start reducing rates at its meeting next month if not sooner yields on u s treasury securities one of the world s safest assets this week fell to record lows as investors turned increasingly concerned that the deadly virus would damage u s and global economic growth the fundamentals of the u s economy remain strong powell said in the four sentence statement friday however the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity the federal reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy the missive recalls previous instances when the fed changed course or had to address a budding crisis when credit markets began to seize up in august 2007 the central bank issued a statement saying it was prepared to act as needed just last june powell said the fed would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion the fed cut rates at its meetings in july september and october but has since been on hold and indicated it planned to be so long as there was no material change to the outlook the virus may now deliver such a shift in the economy amid mounting concern it s already hurt the chinese economy and now threatens to damage supply chains demand tourism and trade elsewhere the s p 500 pared losses after the statement was remained lower for the day closing down 0 8 on friday and 11 5 lower over the week the largest drop since 2008 squarely on the table michael feroli chief u s economist at jpmorgan chase co in new york said powell has put an interest rate cut squarely on the table for when the federal open market committee meets march 17 18 in washington this is a step in the right direction to help calm some of the concerns he said this is important in that they re saying they re not going to be stubborn here fed officials spent the week pushing back somewhat on the need for emergency rate cuts saying there was too much uncertainty about the virus s economic impact despite its spread from china there is also doubt over what lower rates would achieve given they may not prompt consumers or companies to spend if they re uncertain about the future or scared for their health but stocks kept sliding and economists started slicing their forecasts for the u s economy some started to warn of the weakest global expansion in a decade as the impact of the virus outbreak rippled from china to europe and the americas i hope the fed gets involved and i hope they get involved soon president donald trump who s repeatedly pressured the fed to cut rates told reporters later on friday the debate now is whether central bankers will wait until their march meeting or act quicker as well as the size of a potential move buys time the statement buys some time with the caveat that they follow through with a rate cut said derek tang an economist at lh meyer monetary policy analytics in washington the question is will it buy them enough time to reach mid march that is less clear the statement released friday was from powell not the full fed board nor from the fomc which has the ultimate say on rate moves in normal circumstances u s data are published with too much of a delay to make a strong case for a fed move based on current economic reports but officials could look at the crashing markets fall in private sector forecasts earnings warnings by companies and the rise in the dollar to argue the virus has delivered a shock to demand that could slow inflation at a time when they are already striving to hit their 2 target demand shock financial markets are suggesting that a very substantial demand shock is under way said laura rosner a senior economist and partner at macropolicy perspectives llc which sees cuts in march and april we are starting at a low base of inflation so that certainly helps make the case as well goldman sachs group inc economists said friday they now expect the coronavirus to inflict a short lived global contraction on the world economy that forces the fed to slash interest rates by 75 basis points over the first half of this year bank of america corp forecast a half point cut at the fed s march meeting to stem the panic in markets
the u s economy is likely growing at a 2 6 annualized rate in the first quarter based on the latest economic data the atlanta federal reserve s gdpnow forecast model showed on friday that compared to a 2 7 pace estimated by the atlanta fed s gdp program issued thursday meanwhile the new york fed is less optimistic but raised its forecast q1 by 0 1 percentage point the new york fed staff nowcast stands at 2 1 for the first quarter positive surprises from manufacturing and housing data accounted for most of the increase the new york fed said in the wake of the recent economic reports growth estimates for the january march quarter ranged from as low as a 1 0 rate to as high as a 2 4 pace the economy grew at a 2 1 rate in the fourth quarter lifted by an improvement in the trade balance as imports declined sharply goldman sachs earlier this week lowered its u s growth outlook for the first quarter as the domestic economy takes a hit from the global coronavirus outbreak cnbc said the bank slashed its u s gdp growth forecast to just 1 2 from 1 4 seeing a more severe drag from the epidemic that growth rate is drastically slower than the 2 1 increase in the fourth quarter and 2 3 for the full year 2019 the risks are clearly skewed to the downside until the outbreak is contained jan hatzius goldman s chief u s economist said in a note on monday an increasing amount of companies suggesting potential production cuts should supply chain disruptions persist into q2 or later friday s fed revisions came hours after the government said u s consumer spending slowed in january and could lose further momentum as the fast spreading coronavirus outbreak which has sparked a stock market sell off and revived fears of a recession causes households to tighten their purse strings other data on friday showed the goods trade deficit contracted sharply last month as both imports and exports declined while the narrowing goods trade deficit could be a boost to the calculation of gross domestic product a lot depends on how the coronavirus unfolds in the united states the coronavirus epidemic which has killed nearly 3 000 and infected at least 80 000 people most of them in china is viewed by financial markets as the catalyst that could interrupt the longest economic expansion on record now in its 11th year federal reserve chair jerome powell sought to calm financial markets on friday saying the fundamentals of the u s economy remain strong powell also acknowledged that the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity and said the u s central bank would use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy the fed bank cut interest rates three times in 2019 financial markets have fully priced in a 25 basis points rate cut at the fed s march 17 18 policy meeting according to cme group s fedwatch tool consumers shielded the economy from global headwinds for most of 2019 but they won t prove immune to the coronavirus outbreak said lydia boussour a senior u s economist at oxford economics in new york persistently low inflation bolsters the case for a fed rate cut as soon as march given the sharp tightening in financial conditions the commerce department said consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased 0 2 last month as unseasonably mild weather reduced demand for heating and undercut sales at clothing stores consumer spending shot up 0 4 in december economists polled by reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0 3 in january while a separate report on friday from the university of michigan showed its consumer sentiment index increased to a near two year high in february it noted that a fifth of respondents mentioned the coronavirus in the final days of the survey in part because of the plunge in stock prices with consumers often responding to changes in stock markets some weakening in sentiment could be coming soon said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new

the july september quarter s brisk 3 2 pace the economy grew at a 2 1 rate in the fourth quarter matching the third quarter s pace the coronavirus epidemic prompted goldman sachs early this week to cut its first quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by two tenths of a percentage point to a 1 2 rate growth estimates for the january march quarter were already on the low side because boeing suspended production of its troubled 737 max plane starting last month but the shrinking goods trade deficit could somewhat limit the downside to gdp growth a third report on friday the

whack that was a week of share market falls to remember as the old saying of markets going up the stairs and down the elevator was once again proved true as the coronavirus covid 19 extended its tentacles across the world including europe and the middle east there was no vaccine available for the australian share market which plunged repeatedly on each day of bad news by the end of the week

covid 19 has really spooked investors who are worried that there could be worldwide downgrades of company earnings and economic growth and potentially a very length period of recovery in that

requiring their 24 000 hour recertification refurbishment or have been otherwise removed from service for greater than 90 days are excluded from the utilization calculation until their first day back in field service coil tubing units that have been removed from service for greater than 90 days are excluded from the utilization calculation until their first day back in field service production services revenue was 23 0 million in q4 2019 up 0 6 million 3 compared to 22 4 million in q4 2018 the increase in q4 2019 activity levels for our production oriented service rigs was a result of our e

during q4 2019 had rig crews been available cwc believes it could activate 19 of the 62 inactive service rigs with minimal capital expenditure resulting in a 103 active service rig fleet cwc s service rig utilization in q4 2019 of 61 q4 2018 51 was driven by 33 656 operating hours being 8 higher than the 31 232 operating hours in q4 2018 in addition the q4 2019 average revenue per hour of 664

services of 646 in q4 2019 is 21 per hour higher 3 than 625 in q4 2018 the lower utilization reflects the continuing challenge of lower crude oil prices during the quarter compared to a year ago as

20 000 bbls day starting october 1 2019 effectively reduced the number of alberta e p companies affected by the production curtailment the widening price differential between wti and wcs is partially a result of this increased crude oil supply which saw an increase in alberta crude oil storage levels in november 2019 nearing all time highs last achieved in 2018 as more pipeline space gets freed up on existing pipelines crude by rail continues to grow and once construction of the enbridge line 3 replacement project is completed the wti wcs differential should begin to narrow thereby allowing

dr judy shelton nomination to the federal reserve board is a great decision here some of the reasons for my endorsement i spent the first three decades of my life in argentina a country destroyed in great part by dreadful monetary policy all my savings in pesos were wiped out by central bank malfeasance for a time argentina pegged the peso to the u s dollar but after it was abandoned two decades ago the argentine peso went from a one to one relationship with the dollar to being worth less than two cents today judy shelton u s president donald trump s nominee for governor of the federal reserve arrives to a senate banking committee confirmation hearing in washington d c u s on thursday feb 13 2020 shelton a former economic adviser to trump s campaign has challenged whether the institution should regulate the value of money and whether its mandate as set by congress photographer andrew harrer bloomberg 2020 bloomberg finance lp in 1976 during the early days of my university studies nobel laureate friedrich hayek published a small but powerful book titled the denationalisation of money the manipulation of money and credit was creating problems around the globe and hayek recommended monetary competition as a way out of the inflationary spiral after studying keynesian and chicago school economics i had the privilege of studying under dr hans sennholz a german economist who received his ph d under ludwig von mises the textbook for monetary economics at grove city college where sennholz was teaching was mises s theory of money and credit the famed economist lionel robbins at the london school of economics wrote the book s introduction and showered it with praise in continental circles it has long been regarded as the standard textbook on the subject it is hoped that it will fill a similar role in english speaking countries i know few works which convey a more profound impression of the logical unity and the power of modern economic analysis the failure of most central banks to prevent inflation during the 1960s and 70s led many sound money advocates to call for a return to a true gold standard but then things changed soon after alan greenspan was named federal reserve chairman in 1987 i attended a monetary conference at which dr sennholz spoke he surprised his audience of mostly diehard monetary hawks by saying from now on monetary policy will cease to be a major topic of concern because dr greenspan knows what he is doing i was one of those who were surprised but he was right despite the prevalence of inflation in a number of countries monetary issues are among those that have shown most improvement in economic freedom indices i think the above paragraphs are sufficient to explain my fixation on the importance of sound money the soundness of money depends on how well it serves as a medium of exchange a unit of account and a store of value the crisis of 2008 showed that we did not have all the answers the federal reserve has not acted as irresponsibly as say the argentine central bank but since its creation in 1913 the dollar has lost 96 of its value thus in 2010 i was involved in an effort to increase focus on sound money then located at the atlas economic research foundation where i had the privilege to act as co chair with dr judy shelton among those who joined the effort and contributed research and advice were jerry jordan former president of the federal reserve bank in cleveland dr allan h meltzer of carnegie mellon university author of a history of the federal reserve and dr gerald o driscoll former vice president of the federal reserve bank of dallas we also attracted talented young economists not all agreed on precise policy solutions but most agreed with dr shelton s ideal of having a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world through her clear writings she has always aimed at making sound money more accessible to the general public and her writings attracted more traffic to atlas websites than those of all other authors combined we expected dr shelton to be attacked by those who prefer government interference and the political manipulation of money but she has also been attacked by those who do not want new ideas to challenge the cozy relationship between banks the fed and politicians i do not have time to focus on all the attacks against her so i will mention just a few specifically i stand with those who have written in her favor including steve forbes who was calling for her nomination even before donald trump s inauguration the wall street journal jim dorn of the cato institute and american principles project chairman sean fieler the wall street journal editorial board came to dr shelton s defense anticipating two major lines of attack against her one is that she has long supported a return to the gold standard the other is that she has more recently abandoned that belief in monetary discipline for political reasons hey no one said these critics are consistent they re also not honest shelton s views on gold are not so different than those of former fed chairman alan greenspan they see a role for gold but not a direct return to a gold standard in fixing the dollar now a book which carried an endorsement by larry kudlow now director of the national economic council dr shelton recommended something similar to what alan greenspan floated in 1981 the creation five year treasury notes payable in gold not a very radical idea on the topic of her monetary discipline with the current low levels of inflation and recent market fears she is not the only one to change her views about raising interest rates the wsj reminded its readers how in december of 2018 the fed acting on a whim decided to raise interest rates only to reverse its decision when it saw the reaction in the markets in his defense of judy shelton in his piece on the daily caller sean fieler stressed the need for president trump to play a more active role explaining why this fight with the fed is worth the effort as fieler explains the federal reserve has special privileges which allows them to play politics and further works hard to protect them he writes that republican kentucky sen rand paul introduced legislation to stop the fed from lobbying congress and asked the fed to disclose how much it had spent on such lobbying in the past paul s legislation went nowhere and his letter to the fed s inspector general received no substantive response as a result the fed remains legally free to manipulate both markets and politicians as long as it deems such manipulation necessary to achieve its objectives of particular concern was a piece by bill dudley former vice chair of the federal reserve open market committee who wrote trump s reelection arguably presents a threat to the u s and global economy and that in this context fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020 fieler notes that dudley s comments were so shocking that sen thom tillis r nc publicly called for hearings on the fed s potential electoral interference one of the most misleading articles in what looks like an orchestrated campaign to derail dr shelton s nomination was that of the economist which opposed her on the grounds that the fed is one of the few parts of america s government not to have been afflicted by the country s toxic partisan divides and win at all costs politics no mention in the piece of her tenure as vice chair and chair of the national endowment for democracy ned a bipartisan organization funded mostly by congress shelton joined ned s board of directors in 2005 and served as vice chair from 2010 to 2014 she also served on ned s budget audit committee and was the designated expert on russia ukraine and belarus after her ned tenure she was named u s director of the european bank for reconstruction and development she has proven she can work in a bipartisan and non divisive manner the economist was more lenient with the apparent shift in dr shelton s views abandoning any call for interest rate hikes she is not the only one to change though when conditions change it is natural to change views on how to deal with those conditions an outstanding economist now at the treasury department who has also penned strong criticisms of central banks once confided in me in reference to the 2008 crisis alex i had no idea that so much liquidity was needed when one of these crises comes around i doubt that any reader of this column has ever studied the prospect of negative ex ante interest rates offered when you make a deposit in economies that are growing and are not in crisis such as switzerland although i am certain that dr shelton has not changed her desire for sound money she has adapted her views on how to get there so have i and most of the economists in my midst i hope that dr shelton is confirmed but even if she is not i am sure that she will continue devoting her many talents working for a free economy and a free society with the constitution and her outstanding principles as a guide

desperate economic times call for desperate economic measures yet despite the clearest of evidence that the coronavirus epidemic is spreading and roiling global financial markets and the world economy the federal reserve is taking a wait and see attitude before acting by so doing it is heightening the risk that both the u s and global economies might be in for a very hard landing fears of the epidemic s long term financial and market impacts are wreaking major financial havoc global and u s equity markets have declined by around 15 percent in a matter of days this has wiped out around 4 3 trillion in u s wealth alone according to the federal reserve s own estimates such a reduction in wealth if sustained could cause u s consumers to cut back on spending by a full 1 percent of gross domestic product gdp the carnage in financial markets has not been limited to the global equity markets either indeed there has been a marked spike in interest rate spreads on high yield and emerging market debt as investors have become markedly more risk averse if past is prologue such a sharp dialing back in risk could be the start of a global credit crunch that in turn could cause a sharp slowing in both the u s and global economies the plunge in equity prices and the marked rise in interest rate spreads are not the only financial market indicators that should be ringing alarm bells at the fed indeed the collapse in long term u s treasury market yields to historically low levels should be alerting the fed to real trouble ahead this is especially the case considering that in the past the bond market has been a very reliable predictor of economic recessions ahead still other indicators that should be keeping fed officials awake at night are the collapse in international commodity prices and the marked weakening of emerging market currencies as investors repatriate funds from the emerging market countries to the safe haven of the u s dollar a stronger u s dollar is going to make it more difficult for american exporters to compete abroad meanwhile the abrupt reversal of capital flows from emerging market economies coupled with the collapse in international commodity prices could bring about yet another round of emerging market exchange rate crises a particular concern for the global economic outlook is that the economic damage that financial market dislocation is now causing is coming at a time when the coronavirus epidemic is inflicting considerable direct damage to the global economy with major countries like china italy and south korea all severely restricting the movement of their workers these economies are bound to experience the equivalent of economic cardiac arrests meanwhile as apple and the global automobile makers keep reminding us trouble in the chinese economy is causing major disruptions in global supply chains at the same time that the international travel industry is grinding to a halt the only justification for fed inaction at this late stage in the crisis would be for us to believe that the coronavirus will soon peak and will soon be brought under control but it would seem that one would have to be delusional to entertain such a belief with the virus now having reached every corner of the globe and with the number of new coronavirus cases outside china now exceeding those in china there is every reason to think that the epidemic is bound to get worse before it gets better with financial markets experiencing turmoil reminiscent of the 2008 global market meltdown and with china the world s second largest economy having ground to a virtual halt one has to wonder what more evidence the fed needs before acting decisively indeed one would have thought that the least that the fed should now be doing to calm down global financial markets would be to cut interest rates now and not wait until its next scheduled meeting on march 17 18 preferably to get more bang for the buck the fed should do so in coordination with the european central bank the bank of england and the bank of japan desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney

victor davis hanson donald trump has at least five strong historical arguments for his reelection one he is an incumbent incumbent presidents have won 14 of 19 reelection bids since 1900 the few who lost did not enjoy positive approval ratings in a gallup poll from earlier this month trump enjoyed his highest approval rating since his inauguration squeezing out a 49 percent favorable rating vs 50 percent unfavorable two the public perception of the economy usually determines any presidential election as incumbents gerald ford jimmy carter george h w bush and herbert hoover learned the hard way currently the u s is enjoying low inflation low interest rates positive economic growth near record low unemployment rising workers wages and record gas and oil production three unpopular optional wars derail incumbent presidencies the quagmire in vietnam convinced lyndon johnson not to run for reelection in 1968 jimmy carter was tarnished by the seemingly never ending iranian hostage crisis of 1979 1981 the iraq war drove down george w bush s second term approval ratings and helped derail his would be republican successor john mccain four scandals also can destroy a presidency as when watergate forced the resignation of richard nixon five the opponent matters barry goldwater was caricatured as an out of touch extremist and made incumbent lyndon johnson s election a sure thing in 1964 george mcgovern s radicalism ensured that richard nixon would be reelected in 1972 ronald reagan was assured of a second term by walter mondale s anemic candidacy how does trump stack up on all such criteria his poll numbers have climbed steadily since democrats began impeachment proceedings against him in september 2019 his gallup approval rating is now four points higher than when he was inaugurated in january 2017 unlike his 2016 bid trump now has far more campaign money the full backing of the republican party a mostly positive record of economic achievement a lot more campaigning and governing experience and presidential incumbency true the u s continues to borrow about 1 trillion per year trump has followed the profligate spending habits of his predecessors george w bush and barack obama who both dramatically increased the national debt during their eight year tenures china is reeling from the hong kong protests the coronavirus the trade war with the u s and the global outcry over its forced imprisonment of minority groups if the chinese economy crashes it could take down global commerce a notch both the stock and housing markets here in america are overheating at some point they will be due for a reset all that said few economists are predicting a recession in the next eight months before the election given the near record employment and increased disposable income from rising wages and lower taxes gallup found that 63 percent of the public approves of the trump economy the highest rating for any president in that category over the last 20 years will trump get into a war china iran and north korea would benefit if trump were not reelected any of them might seek a confrontation over the summer to provoke trump into an unpopular pre election shootout yet trump s record suggests that he is unlikely to favor preemptory attacks nation building or the use of u s ground troops in large numbers so far he has used mostly air and sea power to accomplish limited objectives without committing u s ground troops to the usual nasty places in the middle east scandal wise trump has already been impeached by the house but was acquitted by the senate special counsel robert mueller s team spent 22 months and some 35 million to investigate collusion between the trump campaign and russia in the 2016 election and came up short the more democrats have sought to abort the trump presidency through impeachment congressional investigations lawsuits and sheer hysteria the more trump seems teflon like and his approval ratings go up trump s greatest advantage in 2020 however may be his most likely opponent the unapologetic socialist sen bernie sanders the various agendas of the radical sanders turn off a majority of the public even mainstream democrats are terrified of sanders redistribution schemes former front runner joe biden appears befuddled on the campaign trail and has been hurt by revelations about his son hunter s ukrainian shenanigans the only other serious democratic contender is multibillionaire mike bloomberg compared to his rivals bloomberg is a moderate with unlimited financial resources and ample experience as a three term new york city mayor yet bloomberg s first debate was a disaster he has variously posed as a democrat republican and independent his strength as a moderate in a sea of extremists was nullified by his decision to apologize for or disown many of the decisions that made him an effective mayor bloomberg has been more reckless in speech than even trump almost daily an embarrassingly crass quote pops out of his past add it all up and if one looks at 2020 dispassionately and historically the election appears to be trump s to lose victor davis hanson authorvdh gmail

it looks more and more likely that the novel form of coronavirus will do meaningful economic damage to the united states stock and bond prices already suggest that the outbreak could halt the longest expansion on record and even send the nation into recession the risks loom larger because this particular crisis is ill suited to the usual tools the government has to stabilize the economy if a recession happens it will probably be a result of this poor fit between the economic effects of the potential pandemic and the mechanisms the government uses to try to keep the economy growing
feb 28 2020 jordan times jeffrey d sachs new york the narcissism and panglossian cluelessness of the wall street elite is a marvel to behold sitting on their perches of power and enjoying tax breaks easy money and soaring stock markets they are certain that all is best in this best of all possible worlds critics must be fools or devils when i have mentioned my support for us presidential candidate bernie sanders in their company it has been to audible gasps as if i had invoked lucifer s name they are certain that sanders is unelectable or that if somehow elected he would bring about the collapse of the republic to varying degrees the same sentiments can be found even in liberal media outlets like the new york times and the washington post this disdain is both telling and absurd in europe sanders would be a mainstream social democrat he wants to restore some basic decency to american life universal publicly financed health care above poverty wages for full time workers along with basic benefits such as family leave for infants and paid leave for illness college education that does not drive young adults into lifelong debt elections that billionaires cannot buy and public policy determined by public opinion not corporate lobbying which reached 3 47 billion in the united states in 2019 the us public supports all these positions by large majorities americans want government to ensure health care for all they want higher taxes on the rich they want a transition to renewable energy and they want limits on big money in politics these are all core sanders positions and all are commonplace in europe nonetheless with each sanders primary victory the befuddled wall street elite and their favorite pundits puzzle over how an extremist like sanders wins the vote an insight into wall street s cluelessness is found in a recent financial times interview with lloyd blankfein the former ceo of goldman sachs blankfein a billionaire who earned tens of millions of dollars each year argued that he s merely well to do not rich more bizarrely he meant it you see blankfein is a low single digit billionaire in an era when more than 50 americans have a net worth of 10 billion or more how rich one feels depends on one s peer group the result however is the elite s and the elite media s shocking disregard for the lives of most americans they either do not know or don t care that tens of millions of americans lack basic healthcare coverage and that medical expenses bankrupt around 500 000 each year or that one in five us households has zero or negative net worth and that nearly 40 per cent struggle to meet basic needs and the elite hardly take notice of the 44 million americans burdened by student debt totaling 1 6 trillion a phenomenon essentially unknown in other developed countries and while stock markets have soared enriching the elites suicide rates and other deaths of despair such as opioid overdoses have also soared as the working class has fallen further into financial and psychological insecurity one reason the elites do not notice these basic facts is that they have not been held to account for a long time us politicians of both parties have been doing their bidding at least since president ronald reagan took office in 1981 and ushered in four decades of tax cuts union busting and other perks for the super rich the coziness of wall street and washington is well captured in a 2008 photo making the rounds again donald trump michael bloomberg and bill clinton are golfing together it is one big happy family clinton s chumminess with wall street billionaires is telling this was the norm for republicans going back to the start of the twentieth century but wall street s close links with the democrats are more recent as a presidential candidate in 1992 clinton manoeuvred to link the democratic party to goldman sachs through its then co chair robert rubin who later became clinton s secretary of the treasury with wall street backing clinton won the presidency from then on both parties have been beholden to wall street for campaign financing barack obama followed the clinton playbook in the 2008 election once in office obama hired rubin s acolytes to staff his economic team wall street has certainly gotten its money s worth for its campaign outlays clinton deregulated financial markets enabling the rise of behemoths like citigroup where rubin became a director after leaving the white house clinton also ended welfare payments for poor single mothers with damaging effects on young children and stepped up mass incarceration of young african american men obama for his part largely gave a free pass to the bankers who caused the 2008 crash they received bailout money and invitations to white house dinners rather than the jail time that many deserved with the mega hubris of a mega billionaire former new york city mayor michael bloomberg thinks he can buy the democratic nomination by spending 1 billion of his 62 billion fortune on campaign ads and then defeat fellow billionaire donald trump in november this too is most likely a case of cluelessness bloomberg s prospects deflated as soon as he appeared on the debate stage with sanders and the other democratic candidates who reminded viewers of bloomberg s republican past allegations of a hostile work environment for women in bloomberg s business and of his support for harsh police tactics against young african american and latino men no one should underestimate the deluge of hysteria that trump and wall street will try to whip up against sanders trump accuses sanders of trying to turn the us into venezuela when canada or denmark are the obvious comparisons in the nevada debate bloomberg ludicrously called sanders s support for worker representation on corporate boards as in germany s co determination policy communist but american voters are hearing something different healthcare education decent wages paid sick leave renewable energy and an end to tax breaks and impunity for the super rich it all sounds eminently sensible indeed mainstream when one cuts through the rhetoric of wall street which is why sanders has been winning and can win again in november jeffrey d sachs professor of sustainable development and professor of health policy and management at columbia university is director of columbia s centre

with new cases of covid 19 outside china rising the chances of a pandemic and global recession have increased recently what are the implications for the gold market coronavirus spreads over the world unfortunately the new coronavirus remains the hottest topic of the news although the covid 19 epidemic has been slowing down in china since the beginning of february it has quickly spread to several other countries the who s situation report from february 26 says that the infections of the new coronavirus has been reported in 37 countries actually for the first time since the beginning of the epidemic on december 8 there have been more new cases reported from countries outside of china than from china with so many countries including the western ones struggling with the disease the covid 19 ceased to be asian issue and has become a truly global issue as world inches closer to the real pandemic the financial markets could become even more nervous so we could see more safe haven flows into the gold market recessionary odds increase although the covid 19 outbreak has not evolved yet into the full blown and officially declared pandemic it has already infected the global economy this is because the new coronavirus has hit not west africa as ebola or china s from 2003 as sars but the very second biggest economy in the world according to nominal gdp according to the ppp the largest which is the center of manufacturing and global supply chains and although it is true that the covid 19 is less lethal than previous viruses investors should acknowledge that the majority of the economic costs associated with epidemics comes not from the increased mortality or morbidity but from the behavioral changes of people who fear the infection so they reduce their activities the world s economic growth in 2019 was barely above the recessionary threshold of 2 5 percent the recent increase in cases in japan and italy which are both large economies already on the brink of recession should hamper the global growth instead of the recovery we could thus see even bigger slowdown although the us has looked teflon like so far the recent ihs markit report casts doubt about the resilience of american economy according to the survey business activity in the u s contracted in february for the first time in since the great recession with the exception of the government shutdown in 2013 due to the disruptions caused by the new coronavirus what is important is that the decline was driven not only by the deteriorating manufacturing performance yet still expanding but also by the decline in the service sector moreover the long term interest rates have declined as the chart below shows the 10 year treasury yield has plunged below 1 4 percent pushing the spread between long term and short term bond yields into negative territory again the inversion of the yield curve increases the odds of recession it also makes the fed more likely to step in and cut the federal funds rate you know just in case indeed the markets expect the dovish move as early as in april chart 1 10 year treasury yields blue line left axis and the spread between 10 year treasuries and 3 month treasuries red line right axis from january 2019 to february 2020 implications for gold what does it all mean for the gold market well the covid 19 is beneficial for gold s outlook even before the epidemic started the gold s prospects were positive due to the easy monetary policy and increased recessionary risk the outbreak of the new disease may only strengthen these tendencies i e slowing down already fragile global growth and push central banks to adopt an even more accommodative stance moreover as the chart below shows the stock market volatility and the credit spreads have increased meanwhile the us dollar has weakened recently which makes the macroeconomic environment even more friendly to gold chart 2 cboe vix index green line right axis and ice bofaml us corporate bbb option adjusted spread red line left axis in 2020 now the key question is of course how persistent the effects of the coronavirus shock will be if it is contained quickly the risk appetite comes back to the markets and investors may withdraw somewhat from the gold market however with new cases rising outside china it is likely that the new virus would stay with us for some time affecting the global economy beyond the first quarter of 2020 and thus supporting gold prices want free follow ups to the above article and details not available to 99 investors sign up to our free newsletter today
danielle chemtob and tim funk charlotte observer editor s note this article is published through the n c news collaborative a partnership of bh media gannett and mcclatchy newspapers in north carolina that aims to better inform readers throughout the state when the 2008 recession hit carl caudle s historic bed and breakfast in the north carolina mountains his profits were slashed travelers cut back on vacations and businesses canceled corporate getaways he said as his business in tryon has slowly recovered he s faced new competition from airbnb and popular online travel sites often direct customers to larger hotel chains he said rather than local inns like his it really cut the legs out from under our industry he said still he says the economy is better than it has been in years in the town of just over 1 600 as north carolinians prepare to head to vote on super tuesday a new poll from elon university found that nearly half of north carolina voters believe that the economy has improved since 2017 the year president donald trump took office but at the same time a majority also said it was at least somewhat difficult for families to afford housing in their communities and the vast majority supported raising the federal minimum wage the elon university poll was conducted in partnership with the charlotte observer the news observer and the durham herald sun as part of the north carolina priorities project economic conditions in the time since denise collier opened her shoe store in burnsville she s seen new businesses crop up in the downtown once dotted with vacant storefronts she started her business three years ago so she could be a part of that revitalization every year since her business has grown trump has boasted about an economy where for example the national unemployment rate now 3 6 is the lowest in 50 years the gdp the value of all goods and services produced in the united states grew by 2 3 last year and until this week s market reaction to the coronavirus the stock market was roaring in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america trump tweeted in mid 2018 and the best time ever to look for a job according to elon s poll 48 of north carolina voters say the economy has improved since 2017 another 74 believe it will improve or stay the same in the next year but democrats running for president say some of the credit for good economic news should go to former president barack obama who presided over the post 2008 recovery the candidates mostly point to disappointing wage growth under trump and argue that many american families are still struggling the economy is doing great for billionaires but for ordinary people things are not so good sen bernie sanders i vt said at last week s democratic presidential debate in charleston s c half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck 500 000 people tonight are sleeping on the street including 30 000 veterans that is not an economy working for the american people that s an economy working for the 1 caudle the inn owner said both parties do not focus enough on boosting small businesses well what about a small business person who quite frankly is struggling but yet we do employ 20 or 30 people and we want to continue to employ them he said where is the focus on that section of the economy what matters most to north carolina voters in 2020 here are voices from all 100 counties journey across the 100 is a listening tour that visited all 100 counties in north carolina to talk with people regular people not career politicians about what s on their minds as the 2020 election approaches by julia wall minimum wage the elon poll found that 94 of respondents supported boosting the minimum wage which has been 7 25 per hour since 2009 though they differed on how much it should be increased just 14 believed it should be more than 15 an hour all the democratic presidential candidates still standing favor raising the federal minimum wage and all but one of them wants to double it to 15 per hour the holdout businessman tom steyer who recently proposed tripling it to 22 per hour former new york city mayor michael bloomberg opposed raising the minimum wage as recently as 2015 now he s for it their argument for the hike while the federal minimum wage hasn t budged the cost of living including for necessities like housing and prescription drugs has skyrocketed forcing some workers to take on two or three jobs to make ends meet when i was a kid a minimum wage job could support a family of three said sen elizabeth warren d mass who s among the candidates today it won t keep a mom and her baby out of poverty as a real estate agent in charlotte larriette legette has witnessed this trend she s in favor of raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour the pay increases have not been that significant for someone to really live comfortably on what they re being paid she said trump and most republicans have opposed increasing the federal minimum wage when the democratic controlled u s house passed legislation last july to raise it to 15 per hour senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky announced that the gop controlled senate would not take up the bill he argued that it would depress the economy at a time when it s thriving trump threatened to veto the bill if it somehow reached his desk the white house said at the time that its policies were driving economic growth and increasing workers take home pay more effectively and efficiently than raising the minimum wage democrats who hope to run against trump this fall have cast the republicans opposition as unfair especially at a time when ceo salaries are way up there used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you worked hard you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create said former vice president joe biden it s time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they re worth caudle said he doesn t believe that the federal government should mandate a 15 minimum wage and said he worries it could hurt his business how do you have a federal minimum wage that addresses the huge disparity in cost of living from one corner of this country to another he said on trade close to 40 of respondents said recently approved international trade deals will have a positive effect on the economy but the majority said it would have a negative impact or make little difference samreen nawaz the owner of an indian and pakistani restaurant in cary said she is concerned the trade war will have ripple effects throughout the economy putting tariffs on another country is definitely a setback she said president trump who has made trade policy one of his centerpiece issues has imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum started a trade war with china and essentially re negotiated a trade agreement usmca with mexico and canada he also prefers bilateral trade agreements to multilateral ones and he s focused on trying to reduce the u s trade deficit he has defended his get tough trade policy even as many in the business community have questioned it the real cost would be if we did nothing the president told the economic club of new york last year the cost of doing nothing was killing us as a country caudle said while he supports the free market china also has a leg up over american businesses especially because workers there earn so much less i think having huge trade wars is not effective and i think also having no trade policies where we re trying to compete on an unlevel playing field is also unfair he said as a group the democrats have agreed that china needs to be held accountable for its theft of intellectual property and other trade sins but they have all criticized the way trump has waged it often via twitter and say he s hurt the u s economy and groups particularly farmers that rely on exports for their livelihoods donald trump is treating farmers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos said sen amy klobuchar d minn by blocking chinese markets trump s trade war has has been disastrous for american workers and consumers said bloomberg who has business ties in china unlike trump he favors multilateral trade agreements biden agreed that china should not get away with its cheating but said trump has mismanaged the dispute the former vice president wants to set global trade standards with the united states leading the effort to write those rules warren believes most trade deals have helped multinational corporations rather than workers she s called for more transparency as future pacts are being negotiated democrats are split on the usmca trade deal which was changed some after the democratic led house demanded concessions those who have said they support the revised deal former biden bloomberg former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg klobuchar and warren the two senators klobuchar and warren voted for it in the upper chamber sanders also a member of the senate voted against the usmca in the senate because there was no mention of climate change steyer initially supported the pact calling it a win for our great partners in labor but he later came out in opposition saying that he cannot support a deal that doesn t mention climate and work to protect our planet for future years the democrats are unanimous in wanting to include labor and environmental leaders in all trade negotiations affordable housing legette rents a house to a tenant who receives a federal voucher commonly known as section 8 but other landlords she knows have stopped taking the rental subsidy altogether a practice some charlotte activists are seeking to ban she s supportive of expanding the program and dramatically reducing the often years long waits renters face in receiving a voucher especially in major cities some of those people they really need help she said when they re making the incomes that they make it s really impossible for them to sustain a regular rental payment according to the elon poll 68 of north carolina voters say it s somewhat or very challenging to find affordable housing in their community with a 50 000 a year salary for a family nearly 70 said the federal government should take action to increase the amount of affordable housing for democrats this year the lack of affordable housing is a central issue most of their campaign websites spell out in detail their proposals to spend billions of dollars in the next decade to solve this problem plaguing many cities including charlotte and raleigh president trump meanwhile has established a white house council for eliminating barriers to affordable housing development to be chaired by hud secretary ben carson it will work with state and local leaders to identify and remove obstacles that impede development of affordable housing but instead of spending much more money the trump administration proposes cutting 8 6 billion or 15 from housing programs democrats want to invest in more programs like the national housing trust fund which helps preserve rehab and develop affordable housing trump wants to eliminate them the affordable housing plans outlined by the seven remaining democratic presidential candidates are similar in some ways most of them for example want to expand availability of federal housing vouchers to low income families and to give tax credits for first time homebuyers there are some differences in approach and pricetag sanders wants to spend 2 5 trillion with a t over the next 10 years to build nearly 10 million permanently available housing units biden has proposed 640 billion and warren 500 million the two former mayors who dealt with affordable housing in their last jobs have also stressed the issue bloomberg who has been endorsed by more than 100 mayors around the country touted his record during tuesday night s debate in charleston during his 12 years as mayor of new york city we created 175 000 units of affordable housing buttigieg said in laying out his plan as president i will measure success not just by the size of the stock market or gross national product but by whether working and middle class families are succeeding rising real estate prices are squeezing the first time hombuyers legette works with out of the market she said wall street backed firms are snapping up homes that would otherwise be available in the market a lot of the investors are coming and buying those up and paying cash therefore it hurts the individual who has to get a loan she said so that can be very challenging for first time homebuyers even if they do have adequate financing options editor s note this is the first in a series for the north carolina priorities project an effort of the

expect the call to last about 60 minutes we had another great quarter and have a lot of important things to talk about today so i ll now turn it over to jose jose jose r mas chief executive officer thanks mark good morning and welcome to mastec s 2019 fourth quarter and year end call today i ll be reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results as well as providing my outlook for 2020 and the markets we serve i m happy to report that our financial results for 2019 were again at record levels 2019 marks the fourth consecutive year of record financial performance more importantly we are again providing record levels of adjusted revenue ebitda net income cash flow and eps guidance for 2020 i d like to congratulate and thank the men and women of mastec for their fantastic performance i m honored and privileged to lead such a great group the men and women of mastec are committed to the values of safety environmental stewardship integrity honesty and in providing our customers a great quality project at the best value these traits have been recognized by our customers and it s because of our people s great work that we ve been able to deliver these outstanding financial results and position ourselves for continued growth and success now some fourth quarter highlights revenue was 1 7 billion fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 210 million and fourth quarter adjusted eps was 1 30 for the full year 2019 revenue exceeded 7 billion for the first time at just under 7 2 billion 2019 adjusted ebitda was 843 million 2019 full year adjusted earnings per share was 5 21 versus 3 77 in 2018 and cash flow from operations for the year was 550 million all of these metrics were a record levels for 2019 in summary we had an excellent quarter and another great year first i d like to make some comments on the fourth quarter actual results came in right where we expected them with a little bit of changes in the mix communications revenue and margins were basically flat sequentially which was good considering the slowdown associated with the merger activity in the industry as expected oil and gas revenues were impacted by the push out of work into 2020 margins were again strong as we perform very little cost reimbursable work our electric transmission segment delivered strong double digit revenue growth and significant margin improvements versus last year s fourth quarter and our power generation group delivered the best quarter of the year generating 333 million of revenue in the fourth quarter with nearly 8 segment ebitda margins reflecting on the full year while every financial metric was at record levels the truth is 2019 could have been even better while our oil and gas group had a great year there was a significant amount of revenue pushed into 2020 that we had the resources to complete in 2019 and in communications the merger of t mobile and sprint delayed a lot of activity until the merger decision was reached i mentioned this because i believe there is a significant amount of pent up demand that will benefit us in 2020 and beyond while those effects aren t expected to completely subside until the second half of 2020 it gives a significant amount of visibility into our full year expectations regarding 2020 today we announced revenue guidance of 8 billion and ebitda guidance of 900 million our expectation is that all of our segments will enjoy revenue growth and all but oil and gas should enjoy double digit revenue growth with regards to margin we expect margin improvements in communications electric transmission and power generation with the decrease in oil and gas margins related to project mix in communications we expect our growth this year to be driven by the continued expansion of fiber optic networks investments in wireless network capacity and 5g related work as we ve said before the expected 5g capex budgets and length of the spending cycle are both unprecedented 5g significantly enhances the number of opportunities for mastec based on the total number of network elements involved each of those elements require significant construction activity our expertise on deploying wireless services coupled with our ability to do extensive front end work in conjunction with optimization and data management and data maintenance allow us to sell these services across any carrier or geography as an end to end service based on how much denser a 5g network is the level of activity required to deploy these networks around the world is unparalleled our reputation history and expertise uniquely position us to be a leader in 5g deployment we also believe that we re incredibly well positioned for the long term network maintenance opportunities this cycle won t just be about the initial deployment but we ll also be driven by the increased maintenance requirements of a bigger more dense complex and evolving network as the largest wireless contractor in north america we are uniquely positioned to execute on these opportunities we are making significant investments today in people and resources as we are in the early stages of a sizable multi year opportunity we expect strong growth in the years to come with a significant improvement in margins as we reach full scale and utilization we are also very encouraged by the recent court rulings related to the t mobile sprint merger t mobile sprint and dish network all have significant build plans while the uncertainty around the outcome of the pending merger led to lower activity levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 which we believe will continue into the first half of 2020 we expect activity levels to significantly increase in the second half of 2020 moving to our oil and gas segment we expect another strong year we are enjoying strong broad based performance across our long haul and midstream project integrity work utility main replacements and facility construction we have excellent visibility based on current backlog levels and verbally awarded work while backlog at year end was roughly 1 9 billion subsequent and verbal awards amount to roughly another 1 4 billion our work today is more diversified in both number of projects and geographic concentration we expect oil and gas to have a slower start compared to 2019 as we have fewer winter projects and most of our projects are starting in the spring for example we have four major project starting toward the end of the first quarter five in the second quarter and another couple in early third quarter 2020 revenues will be more back half loaded because of the work schedules we have already been awarded work for 2021 and activity levels and demand is very strong margins in this segment were very strong in 2019 and included in our guidance is a margin reduction in 2020 primarily related to the expectation of a change in mix with more cost reimbursable work in 2020 our electric transmission group had a very solid year while we were expecting 2019 to be more of a transition year leading into what we believe will be a very strong 2020 in this business the last couple of quarters have been better than we had forecast ebitda for the full year 2019 nearly tripled 2018 levels we expect double digit revenue growth in this segment in 2020 with continued margin expansion catalysts driving the business include the shift to clean energy grid enhancements and general spending around replacing and strengthening aging infrastructure our power generation group also delivered strong revenue growth revenues grew 56 from last year s fourth quarter and i m pleased to announce that this segment exceeded 1 billion in annual revenue for the first time a 700 million increase since 2017 the segment has record backlog of nearly 1 3 billion and we expect them to deliver another solid year of strong growth we saw a nice uptick in margins in the fourth quarter and expect margins to improve on a full year basis in 2020 we ve done a great job diversifying this segment and we have strong opportunities in the wind solar power generation and civil markets and expect continued long term growth opportunities to recap we had another record year in 2019 and we expect 2020 to be even better more importantly we are even more excited about our longer term prospects the markets we serve are evolving changing and growing and we are confident mastec has positioned itself to be a leader across all of the segments we serve i ll now turn the call over to george for our financial review george george l pita executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jose and good morning everyone today i ll cover fourth quarter and annual 2019 financial results including cash flow liquidity and capital structure as well as our initial guidance expectation for 2020 as marc indicated at the beginning of the call our discussion of financial results and guidance will include non gaap adjusted earnings and adjusted ebitda reconciliation and details of non gaap measures can be found in our press release on our website or in our sec filings in summary we had strong fourth quarter 2019 results and capped off a record 2019 year by virtually all gaap and adjusted financial measures our record year end 2019 level of backlog also supports our expectation that 2020 will be yet another record year for mastec and importantly long term trends in our end markets support our optimism for continued growth in 2021 and beyond as we enter 2020 our balance sheet is an excellent shape as 2019 generated another year of record cash flow from operations and our expectation is that 2020 cash flow from operations will exceed 2019 at yet a new record level as noted in yesterday s release we are pleased that s p global ratings has recognized our consistent strong cash flow performance and leverage profile with this recent ratings upgrade in summary our capital structure provides us with ample liquidity and comfortable leverage metrics allowing us full flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities turning to a quick recap of fourth quarter and annual 2019 results fourth quarter 2019 revenue was 1 7 billion adjusted ebitda was 210 million or 12 of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings were 1 30 per share annual 2019 revenue was 7 18 billion adjusted ebitda was 43 million or 11 7 of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings were 5 21 per share with all of these metrics representing record performance levels fourth quarter financial performance was strong and generally in line with our expectation as we entered the quarter looking back to our initial annual 2019 guidance a year ago our actual 2019 adjusted earnings performance significantly exceeded that initial expectation with actual annual 2019 adjusted ebitda of 843 million beating our initial expectation by 63 million and actual annual adjusted diluted earnings of 5 21 per share beating our initial expectation by 0 87 per share now i will cover some detail regarding our segment results fourth quarter 2019 oil and gas segment revenue of 587 million decreased 38 compared to the same period last year due to as previously communicated lower revenue on a large project as regulatory delays caused an early winter break and pushed project completion activity into 2020 inclusive of this impact annual 2019 oil and gas segment revenue was 3 1 billion a 5 decrease compared to annual 2018 levels fourth quarter 2019 oil and gas segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 23 of revenue and annual 2019 oil and gas segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 20 3 annual 2019 oil and gas segment adjusted ebitda margin rate of 20 3 was 660 basis point improvement over last year and as we have previously communicated this performance includes the benefit of project mix with reduced 2019 revenue levels of lower margin large project cost plus activity as we move forward 2020 we expect multiple and significant oil and gas segment project activity based on the combination of our year end 2019 backlog coupled with a significant 2020 verbal award activity that jose referred to in his remarks we anticipate that oil and gas segment annual 2020 revenue will grow in the mid single digit range with annual adjusted ebitda margin rate in the high teens range with this estimate including an increased level of lower margin profile large project cost plus activity in 2020 based on our current expectation of a late spring early summer restart for selected 2020 project activity to be completed in 2019 project activity to be completed in 2020 as well as a similar start date pattern for 2020 new project activity we expect that oil and gas segment revenue activity will follow a more traditional pattern unlike 2019 for 2020 we expect revenue and project activity to decline during the first half of 2020 when compared to the first half last year with second half 2020 revenue and project activity expected to show significant growth compared to the second half last year and revenue and project activity picking during the third quarter of 2020 fourth quarter 2019 communication segment revenue of 674 million increased 4 compared to the same period last year annual 2019 communication segment revenue of 2 6 billion increased approximately 2 4 compared to last year fourth quarter and annual 2019 communications segment revenue trends are characterized by continued double digit growth in wireless and wireline fiber services partially offset by decreases approximating 30 install to the home services as a reminder annual 2018 communication segment revenue also included approximately 75 million in non recurring puerto rican hurricane release efforts both fourth quarter and annual 2019 communication segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 8 of revenue and this decreased rate level reflects ramp up costs related to fiber project start up costs and crew capacity initiatives as we invested in communications segment capacity growth in 2019 in order to maximize our future potential as jose indicated in his remarks the u s telecommunications market is rapidly evolving and we believe this evolution will drive significant and long term demand for our wireless and wireline fiber services we expect annual 2020 communications segment revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin rate to show strong increases when compared to 2019 with annual 2020 revenue approaching 3 billion and annual 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate approaching 10 this expectation includes the assumption that both revenue growth rates and adjusted ebitda margin rate performance will improve during the year with first quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate expected to approximate first quarter 2019 levels and adjusted ebitda margin rate performance improving in the second quarter of 2020 and accelerating throughout the balance of the year importantly while our communication segment annual 2020 expectation reflects a significant improvement when compared to 2019 performance we anticipate the communications segment market trends will continue to progress over the year affording us the potential for continued significant additional revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin rate improvements in 2021 and beyond fourth quarter 2019 electrical transmission segment revenue increased approximately 16 compared to the same period last year to approximately 115 million and annual 2019 revenue was 413 million fourth quarter 2019 electrical transmission segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 8 of revenue and annual 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate was 7 1 and on an annual basis 2019 s performance represented a 450 basis point improvement compared to 2018 levels this segment also ended 2019 with a strong backlog of over 500 million we expect annual 2020 electrical transmission segment revenue will show strong growth somewhere in the high teens to low 20 range with a slight improvement in adjusted ebitda margin rate when compared to 2019 we also believe and market conditions for this segment are supportive and expect continued strong revenue and adjusted ebitda margin growth for this segment in the coming years fourth quarter 2019 power generation and industrial segment revenue increased approximately 50 to 333 million and annual 2019 revenue grew 55 to 1 billion we ve been saying for several years that this segment has significant growth potential and we are proud to have delivered on this expectation with this segment s revenue growing from 300 million in 2017 to approximately 1 billion in a short two year period fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate was 7 7 of revenue a strong sequential improvement and well over the annual 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate of 3 9 for this segment in summary annual 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate performance for this segment was negatively impacted by operating inefficiencies related to managing high levels of revenue growth and we believem the fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate performance is more indicative of the longer term margin profile potential for this segment we continue to experience a very active market and renewable project activity as evidenced by record power generation and industrial segment year end 2019 backlog levels that approach 1 3 billion as we look toward 2020 we expect this segment will show strong revenue growth somewhere in the high 20 to high 30 range we also expect annual 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate performance to improve somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 basis points over last year to the high mid to high single digit range now i will discuss a summary of our top 10 largest customers for the annual 2019 period as a percentage of revenue at t revenue derived from wireless and wireline fiber services was approximately 15 and install to the home services was approximately 5 on a combined basis these three separate service offerings totaled approximately 20 of our total revenue as a reminder it s important to note that these offerings while falling under one at t corporate umbrella are managed and budgeted independently within that organization giving us diversification within that corporate universe equitrans midstream corporation was 11 of revenue energy transfer was 8 verizon comprised of both wireline fiber and wireless services was 5 of revenue and epic midstream pipeline was also 5 phillips 66 was 4 and duke energy kinder morgan were each at 3 with iberdrola and nextera energy rounding up our top 10 customers at 2 each individual construction projects comprised 64 of our annual revenue with master service agreements comprising 36 and this mix highlights that despite increased project activity levels we continue to have a substantial portion of our revenue derived on a recurring basis at year end 2019 our backlog of approximately 8 billion represented the highest year end level in mastec history notable backlog activity during the fourth quarter included a sequential increase in communications power generation and industrial and electrical transmission segment backlogs it is worth noting that last year s year end 2018 electrical transmission segment backlog included approximately 250 million of puerto rican storm restoration services that ultimately never led to revenue generation and thus unduly impacts current year over year backlog comparisons for this segment and this represents the last period of this comparability issue as no puerto rican storm restoration backlog was reflected in any 2019 backlog amounts lastly it should be noted as we ve indicated for years backlog can be lumpy as large projects burn off each quarter and new large contract awards only come into backlog at a single point in time and this trend is evident given a significant oil and gas 2020 verbal award activity jose mentioned in his remarks in summary our backlog performance and trends support our optimism regarding the strength of our end markets which are exhibiting sizable multi year growth opportunities now i ll discuss cash flow liquidity and working capital usage as well as capital investments for the year ended 2019 we generated a record level of 550 million in cash flow from operations and ended the year with net debt defined as total debt less cash of 1 36 billion which equates to a book leverage ratio of 1 6 times we ended the 2019 year with dsos at 91 days compared to 81 days last year of this 10 day increase in dsos approximately eight days was due to the combination of lower fourth quarter 2019 revenue levels on selected oil and gas project activity coupled with fixed or higher project retainage balances simply based on project timing additionally we had about 75 million in ordinary course collections from one customer the equivalent of approximately four days outstanding arrive in january rather than by year end given the seasonality of our first quarter 2020 revenue coupled with fixed retainage amounts we would expect dso levels for that quarter to approximate year end levels and then return within our stated dso profile of mid to high 70s to mid to high 80s we are proud that annual 2019 cash flow from operations reached a new record level and the 2019 free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less net cash capex once again exceeded net income adjusted net income this performance was based on ordinary course billing and collection activity and highlights the strength of our cash flow profile accordingly we also expect record annual 2020 cash flow from operations growing at a rate slightly higher than our planned 2020 earnings expansion with free cash flow once again exceeding adjusted net income as we begin 2020 our long term capital structure is solid with low interest rates no significant near term maturities a strong capital structure and ample liquidity this combination gives us full flexibility to take advantage of any potential growth opportunities to maximize shareholder value as a reminder we have approximately 129 million remaining in open share repurchase programs regarding our spending on equipment annual 2019 net cash capex defined as cash capex net of equipment disposals was approximately 91 million and we incurred an additional 206 million in equipment purchase purchases under finance leases we anticipate incurring approximately 150 million in net cash capex in 2020 with an additional 150 million to be incurred under finance leases moving to our initial 2020 guidance we are projecting annual 2020 revenue of 8 billion with adjusted ebitda of 900 million or 11 3 of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings of 5 63 per share as noted in the tables in yesterday s release effective with the first quarter of 2020 for all presented periods adjusted diluted earnings per share measures will exclude the net of tax impact of amortization of identified intangible assets for all of the company s acquisitions we believe this presentation is common practice and will improve comparability of our results with our largest public peer we also believe this presentation better represents the company s adjusted diluted earnings per share results given the non cash non operational nature of these charges coupled with the inherent volatility in these charges from the purchase accounting process the supplemental schedules in our press release yesterday show the impact of this presentation change which equates to approximately 0 23 per share for both the annual 2020 and 2019 periods and thus an apples to apples comparison of adjusted diluted earnings per share on this presentation basis is 5 63 per share for 2020 compared to 5 44 per share in 2019 effective with the first quarter of 2020 all historical period data results will be shown under this new presentation basis as we have previously provided some color as to 2020 segment expectations i will briefly cover other guidance expectations for modeling purposes we expect annual 2020 interest levels to approximate 75 million with this level excluding any potential share repurchase activity that may occur in 2020 our estimate for 2020 share count is 76 3 million shares we expect annual 2020 depreciation expense to approximate 3 2 of revenue a slight increase over 2019 s rate due to the timing impact of 2019 capital additions and acquisition activity we expect that annual 2020 other segment equity and earnings from our equity interest in waha pipeline operations will approximate 2019 s level we expect annual 2020 corporate segment adjusted ebitda to be a net cost of slightly less than 1 of overall revenue with this improvement over 2019 primarily expected as a result of lower expected earn out charges we expect net income attributable to non controlling interest will approximate 2019 s levels and cadence and lastly we expect that the annual 2020 adjusted income tax rate will approximate 24 with this expectation including a near zero tax rate during the first quarter due to an expected discrete deferred tax benefit that will be recognized only in the first quarter with subsequent 2020 quarterly adjusted tax rates approximating 26 and this blend reached to an annual 2020 adjusted tax rate that approximates 24 our first quarter 2020 revenue expectation is 1 3 billion with adjusted ebitda guidance of 108 million or 8 3 of revenue and adjusted earnings guidance at 0 48 per adjusted diluted share as a reminder first quarter results typically represent our lowest earnings level of the year due to winter weather seasonality and a transition to new customer capital budgets and also reflects previously discussed timing cadence of 2020 oil and gas project activity in terms of some additional color on the expected timing of 2020 consolidated revenue performance we expect first half 2020 consolidated revenue to decline in the mid single digit range when compared to the first half of 2019 and second half 2020 consolidated revenue to increase in the high 20 range compared to the second half of 2019 this expectation incorporates previously indicated timing cadence of expect 2020 oil and gas project activity as well as the expectation that communication segment 2020 revenue growth levels will accelerate during the year based on the anticipated 2020 revenue timing we expect that first half 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate will be in the high single digit range and due to increased second half 2020 revenue levels second half 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate will accelerate exceeding our annual 2020 expectation of 11 3 of revenue in summary we are proud of our record 2019 performance and to be in position to have new record performance expectations for 2020 importantly as we look beyond 2020 we strongly believe that our markets afford us significant and expanding multi growth opportunities that concludes our prepared remarks and now w ll turn the call over to the operator for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you and now we ll take our first question from blake hirschman from stephens blake hirschman stephens analyst yes good morning guys congrats on a great year jose r mas chief executive officer thank you blake blake hirschman stephens analyst first off on the communications please can you just elaborate a little bit on some of the things sprint t mobile and the others that kind of held back activity in the back half of the year and probably will end in the first half and then expand a little bit more on some of the things that give you confidence that activity really accelerate into the back half of 2020 jose r mas chief executive officer sure so i think if you look at 2019 a lot of the slowdown in the second half was all related to the merger activity so it was those companies that were engaged in the merger activity outside of those companies if you look at at t or you look at verizon i don t necessarily think that they slowed down in the second half if you look at our fourth quarter revenues with at t and you back out our install piece we were actually up about 10 with that customer in the fourth quarter versus last year and i know there s a lot of questions around our first half guide and even our q1 guide and and how much of a ramp it has to happen in the second half one of the things that i d like to point out across all segments specifically communications we re actually expecting that segment to be up in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 19 so despite the slowdown from sprint and t mobile and even dish right just all three of them combined in the merger we re still seeing a lot of activity in the industry the problem is we re not seeing the level of activities we would have hoped relative to 5g we know it s coming we geared up for it we think we re in a great position so i think it s all great part of the story right there is going to be a lot more work we re well positioned to execute on and we re well positioned to do really well and we re looking forward to it coming we think it comes in the second half of the year and it s exciting prospects for us blake hirschman stephens analyst and then the follow up sticking with communications i know you ve been ramping up hiring and it s impacted the margins is that the main drag here or is there any project associated issues as well and then when do you think at what point in the year are you going to be lapping the worst of that accelerated hiring rate thanks a lot jose r mas chief executive officer well the hiring rate is going to be dependent on where we re seeing the industry at any given point in time while we made investments in 2019 that we think we re going to pay huge dividends for us it s all a function of revenue so our margins aren t declining our margins are kind of steady on a sequential basis and that s our expectation so to the extent when that revenue flows in is when we think we ll see margin appreciation based on utilization that s still what we believe we think that really starts hitting in the second half of 2020 and that s really the only change to what our expectations and guidance has been blake hirschman stephens analyst all right i ll turn it down to jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and we ll take a question from noelle dilts from stifel noelle dilts stifel analyst hi good morning jose r mas chief executive officer good morning noelle noelle dilts stifel analyst thanks good morning i wanted to touch on move on to the oil and gas segment on pipeline i m just trying to get a sense of the visibility you re talking about for 2021 and the work you ve booked so when you talk about that 1 4 billion of verbal awards is there any way you could get us give us a sense of how much of that work might continue into 21 and i just would like to get a sense of how you re thinking about visibility in the market given some of the comments we re hearing of midstream companies that are expressing a more conservative approach to capex jose r mas chief executive officer we understand what people are saying we obviously read it we re in contact with all of our customers we understand what each customer is doing you re going to see a different customer mix for us over the course of the next couple of years while there are some customers that are slowing down there are a number of other customers that are still going to be spending considerably in the years to come we re very bullish about not only 2020 but 2021 the 1 4 billion is actual awarded projects there are a lot more projects that we are chasing right now that will be executed in the next 18 24 months that we re very excited about we expect to be in the same place in 2020 that we ve been in the last couple of years we ll be at full capacity we re going to struggle to figure out ways to get all the work done in the second half of this year that we re going to have and we think we re going to be in a similar position in 2021 based on the conversations that we re having with our customers and the expected jobs that we re hoping to win and be executing not just in 20 but in 21 longer term we ve talked about it before we re huge believers in what s happening with lng we think that s going to create an enormous amount of work in outer years so despite all the noise and despite particular customers and what they re doing with capex we re still very bullish as to what s happening in our industry noelle dilts stifel analyst thanks that s very helpful and then just sticking with oil and gas you guys did provide a lot of helpful guidance around margins and how you re thinking about them for the year but specifically as it relates to the first quarter of 20 it looks like revenues will be down sequentially but how are you could you just give us a little bit more detail on how you re thinking about the margin profile for oil and gas in the first quarter and maybe even into the second just hep us with the mix of cost plus versus more fixed price in the first half of the year versus the second jose r mas chief executive officer hey look i think what s happening in q1 are a couple things one is we had some project push outs from 19 that we would have been hoping to work on some of those projects early in the year even if it there was restoration related work that would ve generated more revenue we were probably caught a little flatfooted on that relative to finding work to back that up because we at the end of the day we re committed to the jobs that we have so we ve got to have the capacity to do them once they start so q1 will be slower the reality is that the way a lot of our contracts work is even though revenues will be down we ll be compensated on some jobs for some of our expenses or margins and q1 should be very strong again we re not expecting a dramatic drop to margins it ll be less than they were in q4 but they ll be solid for first quarter as we look at project starts going into the second quarter and third quarter we expect that business to begin to ramp we expect to have a really strong second half just based on our work schedules to kind of put it in perspective what we re kind of thinking for 2020 is we ll do about 1 billion in the first half of the year and roughly 2 2 billion in the second half of the year that s kind of how our guidance plays out obviously second quarter being almost double with first quarter is and if you go back to i don t know 2018 or so you ll see that we did about 1 1 billion in the second half of 2018 so to believe our guidance you ve got to kind of believe that we re going to do what we did in 2018 plus about 100 million for the second half versus what we did in 18 we think that s very doable we think the work schedule and plans that we have out play perfectly to that so we are i think on an overriding theme we take guidance very seriously we take a lot of pride in the fact that we ve been able to deliver the guidance for such a long period of time it s what gives us our credibility it s very important to us so we wouldn t put out any numbers that we didn t think were achievable and we think our second half plan is very achievable relative to the work that we re having today noelle dilts stifel analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thanks noelle operator and we ll take our next question from jamie cook with credit suisse jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning nice quarter i guess two questions jose one just going back to the communications business and you talked about investment and that we need revenues to improve the margins but just broadly can you talk about is the investment in 2020 the same versus 2019 or how do we think about how you re ramping headcount in our business or are we just starting to moderate because you want to see the revenues come through and then my second question on the oil and gas side understanding you have great visibility and your market share is very high but are you seeing any sort of changes in terms and conditions when you re bidding on projects just because the market broadly is weaker even if your market share is high and whether that s a risk to the business thank you jose r mas chief executive officer sure so i ll answer the second part first in oil and gas again i think that we ve done a great job of building a brand and building our reputation i think our customers know what we can deliver and i think that s put us in an advantageous position i don t see any difference in the margin profile of jobs on a go forward basis as what we ve seen in the past i think customers generally are looking for contractors that they know are going to deliver their projects on time and on schedule and for a long time we ve executed on that and done very well and i think the results have spoken for themselves and they are demonstrated in our financial results but the reality is that it s the production in the field results that allow you to perform financially so i think it speaks for itself on the communication side of the business we re going to continue to ramp we ll moderate it a little bit in the first half of the year but we see a lot of work coming and we want to be well positioned for it again we re going to see a stronger second half than first half maybe we re not we don t have huge expectations for what the merged entities are going to end up doing in the first half of the year we expect some pickup in the second if anything i think our guidance is conservative relative to what we could ultimately do with some of them so again we re very bullish jamie cook credit suisse analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thank you jamie operator and we ll take our next question from andrew kaplowitz with citi andrew kaplowitz citi analyst good morning guys jose r mas chief executive officer good morning andy andrew kaplowitz citi analyst it was a nice quarter so you just going back to oil and gas maybe if i could ask noelle s question in different way is the 1 4 billion that you mentioned are you going to put that in backlog in q1 and then last quarter you had mentioned initial guide high single digit growth for the year in oil gas now you guys are talking about mid single digit is that more of just sort of discounting how mvp plays out is that some deferrals or cancellations that you ve seen for this year maybe more color you can give us around that change jose r mas chief executive officer yes so the first question around what we expect to be in backlog at the end of q1 we expect the full 1 4 billion to turn into contracts in the first quarter more than half of that has already turned into contracts so we would expect that other half to be concluded here in the next month or so so we re hoping all of that falls into backlog at the end of q1 from a look i don t we re guiding growth in our oil and gas business it s not double digit growth it s low single digit growth i think that s relative to all of the noise that s out there i think that s excellent results with that said there s definitely a level of conservatism built into that we re not anticipating that every project is going to go perfectly and we re going to be able to do everything in 2020 that we would like to do or that our customers would like us to do we re making the assumption and some things are going to get delayed and some things we re going to push that s been a i think a prudent way of looking at guidance and that s kind of what we ve done in the last couple of years if everything hits that we re supposed to do in 2020 that number is going to be a lot better but i think we re taking a moderate view to guidance which i think is reasonable at this point in time and it just speaks to the strength of our work and what we booked relative to that industry andrew kaplowitz citi analyst that s helpful gentlemen and then i just want to ask you about power generation your backlog at 1 3 billion this is quite high obviously maybe you can talk about sort of the makeup of what s going on is it more win in construction work than you re winning ahead of ptc expiration i know you gave us already the expectations for power gen but given the backlog and the nice snapback in margins could power gen be a 100 million annual ebitda business or greater in the not too distant future jose r mas chief executive officer yes so a couple of things right i think their growth has been broad based obviously renewables is a big piece when solar and actually waste to all types of waste to energy has been a driver for us we re encouraged by i don t know if you re aware but the ptc wind credit got extended so that s something that isn t really a driver of the business today we re going to see a lot of strength in that industry hopefully for the next couple of years so the business is just very solid they ve done a good job of building the business we ve been very focused on trying to prepare ourselves to take advantage of whatever could come through an infrastructure build we think there s lots of pieces there that are going to get significant investments once our government decides to invest in infrastructure which we think is it s not a matter of if it s a matter of when o some of the things that we re doing that are really opening us up to that marketing and giving us the ability to hopefully take advantage of that market once it comes but it s relatively broad based and again i think they re executing very well i think you ve seen it in improvement of margins our margins will subside a little bit in the first quarter again and then start to grow we expect to have better full year margins in that business than we had in 2019 the management team there has done a phenomenal job quite frankly that business has an opportunity also to significantly beat what our expectations are in 2020 and they re just doing a great job and again they ve very diversified mix of work andrew kaplowitz citi analyst thanks jose jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question will come from brent thielman with d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning jose r mas chief executive officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey jose heard or i guess some would suggest that sprint t mobile are months behind in meeting this sort of three year 97 5g coverage they need to get to and presume that would need maybe to accelerate some spending are you having more active dialog there do you think they ll emerge as a more relevant customer for you in future jose r mas chief executive officer i think there was no question about it we ve been having dialog with them throughout the entire merger activity period we think all of those we think both the remaining entities which are going to be t mobile and dish they have significant build plans we have great opportunities the industry has great opportunities there s going to be a lot of work i think again we ve taken a moderate view relative to what we think we can achieve in the second half with them i think there s a lot of upside related to that but again it s part of what we ve invested in we ve made significant investments over the course of the last years to position ourselves as the best alternative for carriers as they think about their long term needs i think carriers understand our position in the market they understand what we bring and i think that s going to create a lot of opportunities for us so again we re very excited again if you look at how we plan 2020 even on the communications side we re guiding to roughly i don t know 1 4 billion in the first half of the year or 1 5 billion 1 6 billion in the second half of the year and if you look at the last few years 2016 2017 2018 2019 we ve always done about 100 million more in the second half of year than we ve done in the first half of the year consistently over the last five years if you look at our plans for this year it roughly correlates to 150 million to 200 million more in the second half of this year and relative to all the things that s happened in the industry especially with dish and t mobile we think that s not a very unrealistic or difficult stretch to get to and that s kind of what we ve got built in for them brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay that s great and i got to ask i guess just given the cash flow this last year expectations this next year leverage is down how are you thinking about buybacks today versus m a and other opportunities for capital allocation jose r mas chief executive officer look the same way we always have right i think we ve been very opportunistic relative to our stock we ve made significant purchases in points where we ve thought that the stock is undervalued obviously with the performance of the stock here especially in the last week we believe the stock is very undervalued we were hit before the slowdown already we got to the point where we thought we were significantly under valued now we think we re ridiculously undervalued so obviously something we ll be looking at we re in a great position to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise we think they create a lot of shareholder value so it s absolutely something that we ll be considering and focused on brent thielman d a davidson analyst all right agreed with that thank you jose jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from alex rygiel with b riley mr rygiel we can t hear you maybe your mute function is engaged alex rygiel b riley analyst jose you re there jose r mas chief executive officer yes hey alex how are you alex rygiel b riley analyst pretty good sorry a couple of quick questions first on communications what s the catalyst to getting the margins back above 10 is it just better labor utilization or is it more to it than that jose r mas chief executive officer yes i think it s about revenues coming in i think we ve built our cost structure up a little bit based on the investments that we ve made in the people that we ve hired revenues have to come into support that so i think we ve done a good job of maintaining the margin levels where they ve been as soon as we see a relatively nice uptick in revenue i think we ll begin to see it in margin so i think it s right around the corner we understand our business really well we track it in a lot of details so again it s something that we feel very comfortable is coming we wish it would have been here already obviously our expectations were for revenue to have grown a little bit more in 19 than they did but we re very confident that s going to come in the second half of 20 alex rygiel b riley analyst and then secondly with regards to the oil and gas business can you quantify the revenue from large pipeline projects that you expect in 2020 and talk a little bit about the competitive environment jose r mas chief executive officer so i think even in 19 and looking at 20 we don t have any single project that s making up the dramatic portion of our work we had that a little bit in 17 and 18 where one project made up a significant amount of our revenues i think if you look at 19 we had more of a broad based mvp was probably our biggest project but very broad based beyond that i think you re going to see the same thing in 2020 that s encouraging for us so obviously we re spreading our risk we re spreading on geographic profile with that said there s a lot of work out there i know there s a lot of concern there s a lot of questions we re amazed by the level of activity around not just projects for 2020 but planned projects beyond that so that s our expectation that you re going to just see a lot more not mega projects but a lot of big projects that will have the opportunity to work on and perform alex rygiel b riley analyst great thank you operator and our next question comes from steven fisher with ubs steven fisher ubs analyst great thanks good morning jose r mas chief executive officer good morning steven fisher ubs analyst just wanted to really follow up on that last point that you were talking about with alex and if you could talk a little bit more about the customer mix that you talked about the mix shift that you talked about with noelle to what extent does that reflect a regional change or some other product mix shift and then what are you assuming in terms of timing of some of these big project approvals and then when they might come through jose r mas chief executive officer yes so look i think if you look at the business right we generated 20 margins in 2019 we re going to have margins that are close to that in 2020 obviously couple of hundred basis points less is what we re expecting relative to the mix with it being consistently good right so we expect really good margins in oil and gas both in the first quarter first half second half quite improving as the year goes on it s a very exciting time part of that is driven by the mix of projects that we have to the extent that we do more cost reimbursable work in those periods the margins tend to be a little bit lower because that work ends up being you don t have as much risk but obviously the returns are a little bit lower so we feel really good about the mix of work that we ve got we feel really good about where the project stands so the fact that the great majority of our projects really aren t facing significant regulatory hurdles obviously mvp is the one that everybody wants to talk about because it s out in the press and we ve got some permits to get to completely finish that but even on mvp there s a lot of work to do irrespective of what happens with the supreme court and all of these permits right so we ve got to go back to work there s a lot to do full completion of that project will have some dependency on permits but for the most par there s a lot of activity around these jobs and most of the other jobs aren t in that circumstance so again good geographic diversification good mix of work is helping us both grow revenues and maintain the margin profile steven fisher ubs analyst thanks for that but you did mention there was a customer mix shift this year i was just wondering how different that might be and in what way jose r mas chief executive officer well look i think they re always is right because you ve got the broad based answer isn t one midstream company reduces capex it doesn t necessarily have a huge impact on our business because there s others that are increasing capex so there s others that have project plan that are hitting in the particular year so it s not one customer driven right we ve done big projects for customers they roll in they roll out they have significant projects one year they may not have a lot of activity the following year they may end up coming back a couple of years later so it s important for us to have broad based relationships with lots of customers and kind of figure out who s spending and what time period and make sure we re in front of them and have great opportunities and i think we ve been able to do that steven fisher ubs analyst got it just a quick one on telecom how much did quadgen add to backlog in q4 i assume it was fairly modest and then do you expect the bookings to kind of on a quarterly basis in communications be consistent with fourth quarter or are they going to be kind of lumpy up and down quarter to quarter jose r mas chief executive officer look it s going to depend on the big opportunities for us for further for significant further backlog expansion is going to come from some of the new entities and what happens post merger that s not i think that s going to play out over the course of the next couple of quarters and not necessarily next quarter for the quadgen question it was relatively small it was well under 100 million a lot of the work that they do was for us a portion of that work which wouldn t do anything to our backlog so it really didn t have a meaningful impact to backlog steven fisher ubs analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from chad dillard with deutsche bank chad dillard deutsche bank analyst hi good morning guys jose r mas chief executive officer good morning chad chad dillard deutsche bank analyst so can you talk about the 2020 mix of wireline versus wireless and how that compare to 2019 and then also on electric transmission side can you just talk about your project pipeline the prospects there and how to think about that jose r mas chief executive officer yes so for 2020 we re actually expecting growth in both wireline and wireless i think the wireline growth will be fairly consistent throughout the year where we ve got a lot of projects that we re working on so it ll be really strong both first half second half i think wireless is really strong again showing growth first half i think showing more growth in the second half so both of those markets we continue to believe are very strong there s a lot of activity there s a lot of fiber being placed for multiple reasons right one is obviously for wireless backhaul but the second you ve got the cable companies doing a lot relative to providing higher speed broadband to homes so there s a lot of activity there on the wireless side i think we ve talked about it a lot i think every carrier is going to have massive spend plans for a long period of time as they begin to roll out 5g from an electrical transmission side i think we ve done a really good job with the business right i think they ve executed they performed on the projects we expect strong double digit growth this year i think george said north of 20 we ve got our backlog is actually very strong we got a lot of projects that fall outside of the 18 month backlog period so our total backlog in transmission is considerably higher than what our stated and published backlog number is there we ve got a lot of projects outstanding some of which we think we re going to win that are going to have a very positive impact to backlog so everything s working very well there we ve always talked about having the goal of all of our segments being north of a 1 billion we saw power gen do that in the last year we think ultimately it s just a matter of time before the electrical transmission gets there chad dillard deutsche bank analyst and then on cash conversion can you just talk about just how to think about that in 2020 as well as just like how to think about the cadence as we go through the year thanks george l pita executive vice president and chief financial officer we ve talked about obviously we re expecting record cash flow from ops for the year our dso level will be a little higher in the first quarter it will be similar to what we did in the fourth quarter but we ll still generate significant cash flow so i don t think it ll be relatively consistent it s not going to be as lumpy as it was two years ago when we had some structural issues that slowed collections now at this point everything that we re dealing with is just ordinary course corrections and movements outside of maybe retainage and that sort of thing so no question that for the year we expect record cash flow as well as we did in 2019 frankly we could have done a little bit better on cash flow so we expect that our cash flow in 2020 should grow a little bit higher than our overall growth in terms of earnings is concerned and once again we expect that free cash flows can exceed net income chad dillard deutsche bank analyst thanks i ll pass it on jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from adam thalhimer with thompson davis adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst well that s perfect hey george i think you seem to stress that verizon wireless was a good opportunity in q4 and i think historically verizon used small kind of local contractors for wireless work is there a larger opportunity there jose r mas chief executive officer so i don t know if you directed it to george and myself we ve been saying that for a while right i think verizon as we looked at the one fiber project contracted that project very differently than they ve historically contracted anything i think that s opened the doors for significant dialogue with that customer around what they re going to do in the future i think what we all need to understand is irrespective as much noise and press it gets 5g is an extremely early stages and the amount of activity levels required to ultimately deploy that are going to increase considerably multiples of what it is today which is going to give every every carrier significant challenges as they think about their build out plan so i think every carrier that exists out there today is going to have opportunities available to the industry for people to come in and take advantage of it and really create different types of relationships than they ve seen in the past to be able to execute on their plans and verizon is no different adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst and jose the power gen business is so big now can you kind of walk us through what percent of the mix now between wind solar biomass jose r mas chief executive officer the breakout of each of those adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst yes i m just just a little more color on it it s become a big piece of the story now so just some more color on internally within that business what s really driving things jose r mas chief executive officer yes i think it s a mix of all of it right solar is a relatively new business for us it s a great opportunity our hope is 15 20 of that business this year will be related to solar wind continues to be a significant piece of the business for us it ll probably be 40 50 of revenues in 2020 then the balance is a mix of all other types of work right everything else we ve talked about over the course of the last year all the pieces are growing probably obviously solar is new so that s growing faster but again it s a very broad mix of projects and again i think they re performing very well and executing well on all projects mixes adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst got it thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thanks adam operator and our next question comes from sean eastman with keybanc capital markets sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions jose r mas chief executive officer good morning sean sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst a quick question i m just curious of the 2019 mix how much of the o g segment is integrity work and utility main replacements the stuff that the investment community s a little more comfortable having exposure to just curious what that is today maybe what kind of strategies are in place or sort of growth trajectory we can see around that more sort of defensible type of work jose r mas chief executive officer so a couple things right one is we re very excited about that market we think that s a growing market there s obviously lots of needs in different parts of the country where more dollars are being spent than others it s relatively a 200 million to 400 million business for us at any given point in time with that said we agree that s a defensible market but we don t we also agree we also believe that the rest of our business is pretty solid right so i know that there s a distinction in the market between them but i think it s important to mention that we feel really good about the long term ability of the rest of our business to continue to perform and maintain at current levels sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and second one is just around so we ve got these sprint t mobile merger which is a positive development around the 5g opportunity set but then we ve also got this coronavirus backdrop and some potential supply chain impacts around that and so just be helpful to get a sense for an update on just the overall timing on when some of the 5g macro tower work is going to start to kick off in earnest jose r mas chief executive officer well some of it is started right so it depends on what carrier so i think when you look at the carriers that weren t involved in the merger they ve kind of set their build plans for 2020 so we ve got a good feel for what where they re going to do we think we ll equipment hasn t been an issue to date they ve done a good job of preplanning on their procurement side so they ve done a lot relative to that some of the guys that are coming out of the merger they stopped a lot of the work that they were doing or significantly slowed it down so we think there was an inventory build there as well which we think somewhat offsets any potential procurement issues as we look at least to the end of 2020 beyond that we don t think it s been it hasn t been an issue in the industry to date we obviously have no idea what s going to ultimately happen there and how much worse that gets and if it does end up having long term issues with certain types of equipment but all our customers are super focused on it they re working hard on it they re trying to find alternate sources if so needed so there s a lot of attention being paid to that right now at the customer level sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst excellent i appreciate your time thanks jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our final question will be coming from justin hauke with robert w baird justin hauke robert w baird analyst yes thanks two quick numerical ones here just the first one on the diversification of the client base in oil and gas for the second half ramp i guess i m just curious i mean it looks like mvp based on the percentages you gave with your customers was about 25 or so of the full year revenue how much scope is left on that project that s part of that ramp versus maybe everything else that you ve booked and are going to book in the first quarter jose r mas chief executive officer yes so none of mvp is not in the 1 4 billion of subsequent and verbal awards that we talked about we would consider that part of what we had from our pending works so they re separated and i think that s important to note we expect a considerable amount of revenue from mvp to finish the job we re not going to get into specifics but i think if you look at 2019 levels there s probably roughly that much left to finish that job to completion how much of that happens in 20 versus or if it pushes some in 21 we ll see and i think probably all we ll say about that customer justin hauke robert w baird analyst okay so that s enough and that s actually helpful and the second one is just on quadgen the revenue contribution looks like it was a little bit more than what we were expecting what s the acquired revenue assumption that you guys are taking from that business in 20 jose r mas chief executive officer in 2020 on a gross basis if you look at the revenue is probably just under a 100 million but a significant portion of that is internal to mastec so it ll get reversed and consolidation so it s probably 50 million add roughly justin hauke robert w baird analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer for the full year justin hauke robert w baird analyst great operator and there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any concluding remarks jose r mas chief executive officer all right this concludes our year end 2019 call i d like to thank everybody for supporting us during the year and participating

this article is more than 4 years old noel celis afp via getty images amid surging uncertainty about the coronavirus one thing seems clear china will report that its economy grew close to 6 in 2020 a sharp slowdown is the last thing china s leaders can afford so expect beijing s fiscal engineers municipal governments central bank policymakers and statisticians to pull out all the stops to create the impression gross domestic product gets as close to this year s target as humanly possible when temperatures fall and face masks come off though the global economy will confront a china that s not as healthy and more systemically risky than ever before the number that matters most isn t 6 it s 34 trillion that s how much worth of public and private debt in u s dollar terms china had as of 2019 this bookend is useful because it marks the price tag from beijing s last effort to beat economic gravity the 10 years between 2009 just after wall street crashed and 2019 saw humankind s greatest stimulus campaigns that explosion of multilane highways international airports stadiums city halls university campuses five star hotels and museums kept growth north of 6 and helped the country s leaders maintain legitimacy but the coronavirus is loosening the rug beneath the feet of china s policymakers in two ways one a slow and opaque response to an outbreak skirting pandemic status is denting their legacy two it s piercing the veil of economic inevitability on which beijing has dined for many years true short sellers don t make tend to make much money betting against china inc yet so called minsky moments when credit fueled booms go awry come whether or not you re ready here think japan in the 1980s latin america asia and russia in the 1990s and the u s in 2008 policymakers can t easily control the fallout when economies hit a wall visual china group via getty images visual china group via getty images this doesn t mean china is going to crash anytime soon the closed nature of its financial system does indeed afford china s government a variety of unique shock absorbers not least of which 3 2 trillion of foreign exchange reserves there s no getting around the fact though that china s financial system will end 2020 on weaker footing than it entered it with half a billion of its citizens on lockdown and supply chains reeling china probably won t reach 6 this year a better reading of the true state of chinese growth will come from how key trading partners from japan to south korea to australia fare china s economy confronts coronavirus risks from a weakened position after 18 months of trade warring to combat u s president donald trump s tariffs beijing s fiscal managers and the people s bank of china swung further toward stimulus mode that includes allowing regional governments to up borrowings expect more of the same in 2020 as china s outbreak hobbles any number of growth engines when it comes to the fallout for the most populous nation economists don t know what they don t know the direct costs of china s economy wide shutdown to contain the spread of covid 19 are visible in empty streets and shuttered stores says analyst thomas gatley of gavekal research but the extent of the second order impacts is much harder to see how much of the economic damage wrought by those closures will last even after businesses reopen gatley estimates that chinese companies collectively will lose around 710 billion in cashflows in the first quarter in the face of this huge pressure he says many firms will have no choice but to default or delay payment on their cash obligations to staff banks and suppliers and to curtail their capex plans this year even this of course could prove optimistic if so the 1 7 trillion rout u s stocks suffered the first two days of this week could be a harbinger of things to come it s the risk trump didn t consider when tossing sand into china s export engine how the economic trauma would boomerang back america s way bad enough china is facing a potential health crisis even worse it s doing so in a weakened position global investors have plenty of reasons to worry thirty four trillion in fact

remarks and analysis by jose followed by a financial review from george these discussions will be followed by a q a period and we expect the call to last about 60 minutes we had another great quarter and have a lot of important things to talk about today so i ll now turn it over to jose jose jose r mas chief executive officer thanks mark good morning and welcome to mastec s 2019 fourth quarter and year end call today i ll be reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results as well as providing my outlook for 2020 and the markets we serve i m happy to report that our financial results for 2019 were again at record levels 2019 marks the fourth consecutive year of record financial performance more importantly we are again providing record levels of adjusted revenue ebitda net income cash flow and eps guidance for 2020 i d like to congratulate and thank the men and women of mastec for their fantastic performance i m honored and privileged to lead such a great group the men and women of mastec are committed to the values of safety environmental stewardship integrity honesty and in providing our customers a great quality project at the best value these traits have been recognized by our customers and it s because of our people s great work that we ve been able to deliver these outstanding financial results and position ourselves for continued growth and success now some fourth quarter highlights revenue was 1 7 billion fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 210 million and fourth quarter adjusted eps was 1 30 for the full year 2019 revenue exceeded 7 billion for the first time at just under 7 2 billion 2019 adjusted ebitda was 843 million 2019 full year adjusted earnings per share was 5 21 versus 3 77 in 2018 and cash flow from operations for the year was 550 million all of these metrics were a record levels for 2019 in summary we had an excellent quarter and another great year first i d like to make some comments on the fourth quarter actual results came in right where we expected them with a little bit of changes in the mix communications revenue and margins were basically flat sequentially which was good considering the slowdown associated with the merger activity in the industry as expected oil and gas revenues were impacted by the push out of work into 2020 margins were again strong as we perform very little cost reimbursable work our electric transmission segment delivered strong double digit revenue growth and significant margin improvements versus last year s fourth quarter and our power generation group delivered the best quarter of the year generating 333 million of revenue in the fourth quarter with nearly 8 segment ebitda margins reflecting on the full year while every financial metric was at record levels the truth is 2019 could have been even better while our oil and gas group had a great year there was a significant amount of revenue pushed into 2020 that we had the resources to complete in 2019 and in communications the merger of t mobile and sprint delayed a lot of activity until the merger decision was reached i mentioned this because i believe there is a significant amount of pent up demand that will benefit us in 2020 and beyond while those effects aren t expected to completely subside until the second half of 2020 it gives a significant amount of visibility into our full year expectations regarding 2020 today we announced revenue guidance of 8 billion and ebitda guidance of 900 million our expectation is that all of our segments will enjoy revenue growth and all but oil and gas should enjoy double digit revenue growth with regards to margin we expect margin improvements in communications electric transmission and power generation with the decrease in oil and gas margins related to project mix in communications we expect our growth this year to be driven by the continued expansion of fiber optic networks investments in wireless network capacity and 5g related work as we ve said before the expected 5g capex budgets and length of the spending cycle are both unprecedented 5g significantly enhances the number of opportunities for mastec based on the total number of network elements involved each of those elements require significant construction activity our expertise on deploying wireless services coupled with our ability to do extensive front end work in conjunction with optimization and data management and data maintenance allow us to sell these services across any carrier or geography as an end to end service based on how much denser a 5g network is the level of activity required to deploy these networks around the world is unparalleled our reputation history and expertise uniquely position us to be a leader in 5g deployment we also believe that we re incredibly well positioned for the long term network maintenance opportunities this cycle won t just be about the initial deployment but we ll also be driven by the increased maintenance requirements of a bigger more dense complex and evolving network as the largest wireless contractor in north america we are uniquely positioned to execute on these opportunities we are making significant investments today in people and resources as we are in the early stages of a sizable multi year opportunity we expect strong growth in the years to come with a significant improvement in margins as we reach full scale and utilization we are also very encouraged by the recent court rulings related to the t mobile sprint merger t mobile sprint and dish network all have significant build plans while the uncertainty around the outcome of the pending merger led to lower activity levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 which we believe will continue into the first half of 2020 we expect activity levels to significantly increase in the second half of 2020 moving to our oil and gas segment we expect another strong year we are enjoying strong broad based performance across our long haul and midstream project integrity work utility main replacements and facility construction we have excellent visibility based on current backlog levels and verbally awarded work while backlog at year end was roughly 1 9 billion subsequent and verbal awards amount to roughly another 1 4 billion our work today is more diversified in both number of projects and geographic concentration we expect oil and gas to have a slower start compared to 2019 as we have fewer winter projects and most of our projects are starting in the spring for example we have four major project starting toward the end of the first quarter five in the second quarter and another couple in early third quarter 2020 revenues will be more back half loaded because of the work schedules we have already been awarded work for 2021 and activity levels and demand is very strong margins in this segment were very strong in 2019 and included in our guidance is a margin reduction in 2020 primarily related to the expectation of a change in mix with more cost reimbursable work in 2020 our electric transmission group had a very solid year while we were expecting 2019 to be more of a transition year leading into what we believe will be a very strong 2020 in this business the last couple of quarters have been better than we had forecast ebitda for the full year 2019 nearly tripled 2018 levels we expect double digit revenue growth in this segment in 2020 with continued margin expansion catalysts driving the business include the shift to clean energy grid enhancements and general spending around replacing and strengthening aging infrastructure our power generation group also delivered strong revenue growth revenues grew 56 from last year s fourth quarter and i m pleased to announce that this segment exceeded 1 billion in annual revenue for the first time a 700 million increase since 2017 the segment has record backlog of nearly 1 3 billion and we expect them to deliver another solid year of strong growth we saw a nice uptick in margins in the fourth quarter and expect margins to improve on a full year basis in 2020 we ve done a great job diversifying this segment and we have strong opportunities in the wind solar power generation and civil markets and expect continued long term growth opportunities to recap we had another record year in 2019 and we expect 2020 to be even better more importantly we are even more excited about our longer term prospects the markets we serve are evolving changing and growing and we are confident mastec has positioned itself to be a leader across all of the segments we serve i ll now turn the call over to george for our financial review george george l pita executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jose and good morning everyone today i ll cover fourth quarter and annual 2019 financial results including cash flow liquidity and capital structure as well as our initial guidance expectation for 2020 as marc indicated at the beginning of the call our discussion of financial results and guidance will include non gaap adjusted earnings and adjusted ebitda reconciliation and details of non gaap measures can be found in our press release on our website or in our sec filings in summary we had strong fourth quarter 2019 results and capped off a record 2019 year by virtually all gaap and adjusted financial measures our record year end 2019 level of backlog also supports our expectation that 2020 will be yet another record year for mastec and importantly long term trends in our end markets support our optimism for continued growth in 2021 and beyond as we enter 2020 our balance sheet is an excellent shape as 2019 generated another year of record cash flow from operations and our expectation is that 2020 cash flow from operations will exceed 2019 at yet a new record level as noted in yesterday s release we are pleased that s p global ratings has recognized our consistent strong cash flow performance and leverage profile with this recent ratings upgrade in summary our capital structure provides us with ample liquidity and comfortable leverage metrics allowing us full flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities turning to a quick recap of fourth quarter and annual 2019 results fourth quarter 2019 revenue was 1 7 billion adjusted ebitda was 210 million or 12 of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings were 1 30 per share annual 2019 revenue was 7 18 billion adjusted ebitda was 43 million or 11 7 of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings were 5 21 per share with all of these metrics representing record performance levels fourth quarter financial performance was strong and generally in line with our expectation as we entered the quarter looking back to our initial annual 2019 guidance a year ago our actual 2019 adjusted earnings performance significantly exceeded that initial expectation with actual annual 2019 adjusted ebitda of 843 million beating our initial expectation by 63 million and actual annual adjusted diluted earnings of 5 21 per share beating our initial expectation by 0 87 per share now i will cover some detail regarding our segment results fourth quarter 2019 oil and gas segment revenue of 587 million decreased 38 compared to the same period last year due to as previously communicated lower revenue on a large project as regulatory delays caused an early winter break and pushed project completion activity into 2020 inclusive of this impact annual 2019 oil and gas segment revenue was 3 1 billion a 5 decrease compared to annual 2018 levels fourth quarter 2019 oil and gas segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 23 of revenue and annual 2019 oil and gas segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 20 3 annual 2019 oil and gas segment adjusted ebitda margin rate of 20 3 was 660 basis point improvement over last year and as we have previously communicated this performance includes the benefit of project mix with reduced 2019 revenue levels of lower margin large project cost plus activity as we move forward 2020 we expect multiple and significant oil and gas segment project activity based on the combination of our year end 2019 backlog coupled with a significant 2020 verbal award activity that jose referred to in his remarks we anticipate that oil and gas segment annual 2020 revenue will grow in the mid single digit range with annual adjusted ebitda margin rate in the high teens range with this estimate including an increased level of lower margin profile large project cost plus activity in 2020 based on our current expectation of a late spring early summer restart for selected 2020 project activity to be completed in 2019 project activity to be completed in 2020 as well as a similar start date pattern for 2020 new project activity we expect that oil and gas segment revenue activity will follow a more traditional pattern unlike 2019 for 2020 we expect revenue and project activity to decline during the first half of 2020 when compared to the first half last year with second half 2020 revenue and project activity expected to show significant growth compared to the second half last year and revenue and project activity picking during the third quarter of 2020 fourth quarter 2019 communication segment revenue of 674 million increased 4 compared to the same period last year annual 2019 communication segment revenue of 2 6 billion increased approximately 2 4 compared to last year fourth quarter and annual 2019 communications segment revenue trends are characterized by continued double digit growth in wireless and wireline fiber services partially offset by decreases approximating 30 install to the home services as a reminder annual 2018 communication segment revenue also included approximately 75 million in non recurring puerto rican hurricane release efforts both fourth quarter and annual 2019 communication segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 8 of revenue and this decreased rate level reflects ramp up costs related to fiber project start up costs and crew capacity initiatives as we invested in communications segment capacity growth in 2019 in order to maximize our future potential as jose indicated in his remarks the u s telecommunications market is rapidly evolving and we believe this evolution will drive significant and long term demand for our wireless and wireline fiber services we expect annual 2020 communications segment revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin rate to show strong increases when compared to 2019 with annual 2020 revenue approaching 3 billion and annual 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate approaching 10 this expectation includes the assumption that both revenue growth rates and adjusted ebitda margin rate performance will improve during the year with first quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate expected to approximate first quarter 2019 levels and adjusted ebitda margin rate performance improving in the second quarter of 2020 and accelerating throughout the balance of the year importantly while our communication segment annual 2020 expectation reflects a significant improvement when compared to 2019 performance we anticipate the communications segment market trends will continue to progress over the year affording us the potential for continued significant additional revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin rate improvements in 2021 and beyond fourth quarter 2019 electrical transmission segment revenue increased approximately 16 compared to the same period last year to approximately 115 million and annual 2019 revenue was 413 million fourth quarter 2019 electrical transmission segment adjusted ebitda margin rate was 8 of revenue and annual 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate was 7 1 and on an annual basis 2019 s performance represented a 450 basis point improvement compared to 2018 levels this segment also ended 2019 with a strong backlog of over 500 million we expect annual 2020 electrical transmission segment revenue will show strong growth somewhere in the high teens to low 20 range with a slight improvement in adjusted ebitda margin rate when compared to 2019 we also believe and market conditions for this segment are supportive and expect continued strong revenue and adjusted ebitda margin growth for this segment in the coming years fourth quarter 2019 power generation and industrial segment revenue increased approximately 50 to 333 million and annual 2019 revenue grew 55 to 1 billion we ve been saying for several years that this segment has significant growth potential and we are proud to have delivered on this expectation with this segment s revenue growing from 300 million in 2017 to approximately 1 billion in a short two year period fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate was 7 7 of revenue a strong sequential improvement and well over the annual 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate of 3 9 for this segment in summary annual 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate performance for this segment was negatively impacted by operating inefficiencies related to managing high levels of revenue growth and we believem the fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate performance is more indicative of the longer term margin profile potential for this segment we continue to experience a very active market and renewable project activity as evidenced by record power generation and industrial segment year end 2019 backlog levels that approach 1 3 billion as we look toward 2020 we expect this segment will show strong revenue growth somewhere in the high 20 to high 30 range we also expect annual 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate performance to improve somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 basis points over last year to the high mid to high single digit range now i will discuss a summary of our top 10 largest customers for the annual 2019 period as a percentage of revenue at t revenue derived from wireless and wireline fiber services was approximately 15 and install to the home services was approximately 5 on a combined basis these three separate service offerings totaled approximately 20 of our total revenue as a reminder it s important to note that these offerings while falling under one at t corporate umbrella are managed and budgeted independently within that organization giving us diversification within that corporate universe equitrans midstream corporation was 11 of revenue energy transfer was 8 verizon comprised of both wireline fiber and wireless services was 5 of revenue and epic midstream pipeline was also 5 phillips 66 was 4 and duke energy kinder morgan were each at 3 with iberdrola and nextera energy rounding up our top 10 customers at 2 each individual construction projects comprised 64 of our annual revenue with master service agreements comprising 36 and this mix highlights that despite increased project activity levels we continue to have a substantial portion of our revenue derived on a recurring basis at year end 2019 our backlog of approximately 8 billion represented the highest year end level in mastec history notable backlog activity during the fourth quarter included a sequential increase in communications power generation and industrial and electrical transmission segment backlogs it is worth noting that last year s year end 2018 electrical transmission segment backlog included approximately 250 million of puerto rican storm restoration services that ultimately never led to revenue generation and thus unduly impacts current year over year backlog comparisons for this segment and this represents the last period of this comparability issue as no puerto rican storm restoration backlog was reflected in any 2019 backlog amounts lastly it should be noted as we ve indicated for years backlog can be lumpy as large projects burn off each quarter and new large contract awards only come into backlog at a single point in time and this trend is evident given a significant oil and gas 2020 verbal award activity jose mentioned in his remarks in summary our backlog performance and trends support our optimism regarding the strength of our end markets which are exhibiting sizable multi year growth opportunities now i ll discuss cash flow liquidity and working capital usage as well as capital investments for the year ended 2019 we generated a record level of 550 million in cash flow from operations and ended the year with net debt defined as total debt less cash of 1 36 billion which equates to a book leverage ratio of 1 6 times we ended the 2019 year with dsos at 91 days compared to 81 days last year of this 10 day increase in dsos approximately eight days was due to the combination of lower fourth quarter 2019 revenue levels on selected oil and gas project activity coupled with fixed or higher project retainage balances simply based on project timing additionally we had about 75 million in ordinary course collections from one customer the equivalent of approximately four days outstanding arrive in january rather than by year end given the seasonality of our first quarter 2020 revenue coupled with fixed retainage amounts we would expect dso levels for that quarter to approximate year end levels and then return within our stated dso profile of mid to high 70s to mid to high 80s we are proud that annual 2019 cash flow from operations reached a new record level and the 2019 free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less net cash capex once again exceeded net income adjusted net income this performance was based on ordinary course billing and collection activity and highlights the strength of our cash flow profile accordingly we also expect record annual 2020 cash flow from operations growing at a rate slightly higher than our planned 2020 earnings expansion with free cash flow once again exceeding adjusted net income as we begin 2020 our long term capital structure is solid with low interest rates no significant near term maturities a strong capital structure and ample liquidity this combination gives us full flexibility to take advantage of any potential growth opportunities to maximize shareholder value as a reminder we have approximately 129 million remaining in open share repurchase programs regarding our spending on equipment annual 2019 net cash capex defined as cash capex net of equipment disposals was approximately 91 million and we incurred an additional 206 million in equipment purchase purchases under finance leases we anticipate incurring approximately 150 million in net cash capex in 2020 with an additional 150 million to be incurred under finance leases moving to our initial 2020 guidance we are projecting annual 2020 revenue of 8 billion with adjusted ebitda of 900 million or 11 3 of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings of 5 63 per share as noted in the tables in yesterday s release effective with the first quarter of 2020 for all presented periods adjusted diluted earnings per share measures will exclude the net of tax impact of amortization of identified intangible assets for all of the company s acquisitions we believe this presentation is common practice and will improve comparability of our results with our largest public peer we also believe this presentation better represents the company s adjusted diluted earnings per share results given the non cash non operational nature of these charges coupled with the inherent volatility in these charges from the purchase accounting process the supplemental schedules in our press release yesterday show the impact of this presentation change which equates to approximately 0 23 per share for both the annual 2020 and 2019 periods and thus an apples to apples comparison of adjusted diluted earnings per share on this presentation basis is 5 63 per share for 2020 compared to 5 44 per share in 2019 effective with the first quarter of 2020 all historical period data results will be shown under this new presentation basis as we have previously provided some color as to 2020 segment expectations i will briefly cover other guidance expectations for modeling purposes we expect annual 2020 interest levels to approximate 75 million with this level excluding any potential share repurchase activity that may occur in 2020 our estimate for 2020 share count is 76 3 million shares we expect annual 2020 depreciation expense to approximate 3 2 of revenue a slight increase over 2019 s rate due to the timing impact of 2019 capital additions and acquisition activity we expect that annual 2020 other segment equity and earnings from our equity interest in waha pipeline operations will approximate 2019 s level we expect annual 2020 corporate segment adjusted ebitda to be a net cost of slightly less than 1 of overall revenue with this improvement over 2019 primarily expected as a result of lower expected earn out charges we expect net income attributable to non controlling interest will approximate 2019 s levels and cadence and lastly we expect that the annual 2020 adjusted income tax rate will approximate 24 with this expectation including a near zero tax rate during the first quarter due to an expected discrete deferred tax benefit that will be recognized only in the first quarter with subsequent 2020 quarterly adjusted tax rates approximating 26 and this blend reached to an annual 2020 adjusted tax rate that approximates 24 our first quarter 2020 revenue expectation is 1 3 billion with adjusted ebitda guidance of 108 million or 8 3 of revenue and adjusted earnings guidance at 0 48 per adjusted diluted share as a reminder first quarter results typically represent our lowest earnings level of the year due to winter weather seasonality and a transition to new customer capital budgets and also reflects previously discussed timing cadence of 2020 oil and gas project activity in terms of some additional color on the expected timing of 2020 consolidated revenue performance we expect first half 2020 consolidated revenue to decline in the mid single digit range when compared to the first half of 2019 and second half 2020 consolidated revenue to increase in the high 20 range compared to the second half of 2019 this expectation incorporates previously indicated timing cadence of expect 2020 oil and gas project activity as well as the expectation that communication segment 2020 revenue growth levels will accelerate during the year based on the anticipated 2020 revenue timing we expect that first half 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate will be in the high single digit range and due to increased second half 2020 revenue levels second half 2020 adjusted ebitda margin rate will accelerate exceeding our annual 2020 expectation of 11 3 of revenue in summary we are proud of our record 2019 performance and to be in position to have new record performance expectations for 2020 importantly as we look beyond 2020 we strongly believe that our markets afford us significant and expanding multi growth opportunities that concludes our prepared remarks and now w ll turn the call over to the operator for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you and now we ll take our first question from blake hirschman from stephens blake hirschman stephens analyst yes good morning guys congrats on a great year jose r mas chief executive officer thank you blake blake hirschman stephens analyst first off on the communications please can you just elaborate a little bit on some of the things sprint t mobile and the others that kind of held back activity in the back half of the year and probably will end in the first half and then expand a little bit more on some of the things that give you confidence that activity really accelerate into the back half of 2020 jose r mas chief executive officer sure so i think if you look at 2019 a lot of the slowdown in the second half was all related to the merger activity so it was those companies that were engaged in the merger activity outside of those companies if you look at at t or you look at verizon i don t necessarily think that they slowed down in the second half if you look at our fourth quarter revenues with at t and you back out our install piece we were actually up about 10 with that customer in the fourth quarter versus last year and i know there s a lot of questions around our first half guide and even our q1 guide and and how much of a ramp it has to happen in the second half one of the things that i d like to point out across all segments specifically communications we re actually expecting that segment to be up in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 19 so despite the slowdown from sprint and t mobile and even dish right just all three of them combined in the merger we re still seeing a lot of activity in the industry the problem is we re not seeing the level of activities we would have hoped relative to 5g we know it s coming we geared up for it we think we re in a great position so i think it s all great part of the story right there is going to be a lot more work we re well positioned to execute on and we re well positioned to do really well and we re looking forward to it coming we think it comes in the second half of the year and it s exciting prospects for us blake hirschman stephens analyst and then the follow up sticking with communications i know you ve been ramping up hiring and it s impacted the margins is that the main drag here or is there any project associated issues as well and then when do you think at what point in the year are you going to be lapping the worst of that accelerated hiring rate thanks a lot jose r mas chief executive officer well the hiring rate is going to be dependent on where we re seeing the industry at any given point in time while we made investments in 2019 that we think we re going to pay huge dividends for us it s all a function of revenue so our margins aren t declining our margins are kind of steady on a sequential basis and that s our expectation so to the extent when that revenue flows in is when we think we ll see margin appreciation based on utilization that s still what we believe we think that really starts hitting in the second half of 2020 and that s really the only change to what our expectations and guidance has been blake hirschman stephens analyst all right i ll turn it down to jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and we ll take a question from noelle dilts from stifel noelle dilts stifel analyst hi good morning jose r mas chief executive officer good morning noelle noelle dilts stifel analyst thanks good morning i wanted to touch on move on to the oil and gas segment on pipeline i m just trying to get a sense of the visibility you re talking about for 2021 and the work you ve booked so when you talk about that 1 4 billion of verbal awards is there any way you could get us give us a sense of how much of that work might continue into 21 and i just would like to get a sense of how you re thinking about visibility in the market given some of the comments we re hearing of midstream companies that are expressing a more conservative approach to capex jose r mas chief executive officer we understand what people are saying we obviously read it we re in contact with all of our customers we understand what each customer is doing you re going to see a different customer mix for us over the course of the next couple of years while there are some customers that are slowing down there are a number of other customers that are still going to be spending considerably in the years to come we re very bullish about not only 2020 but 2021 the 1 4 billion is actual awarded projects there are a lot more projects that we are chasing right now that will be executed in the next 18 24 months that we re very excited about we expect to be in the same place in 2020 that we ve been in the last couple of years we ll be at full capacity we re going to struggle to figure out ways to get all the work done in the second half of this year that we re going to have and we think we re going to be in a similar position in 2021 based on the conversations that we re having with our customers and the expected jobs that we re hoping to win and be executing not just in 20 but in 21 longer term we ve talked about it before we re huge believers in what s happening with lng we think that s going to create an enormous amount of work in outer years so despite all the noise and despite particular customers and what they re doing with capex we re still very bullish as to what s happening in our industry noelle dilts stifel analyst thanks that s very helpful and then just sticking with oil and gas you guys did provide a lot of helpful guidance around margins and how you re thinking about them for the year but specifically as it relates to the first quarter of 20 it looks like revenues will be down sequentially but how are you could you just give us a little bit more detail on how you re thinking about the margin profile for oil and gas in the first quarter and maybe even into the second just hep us with the mix of cost plus versus more fixed price in the first half of the year versus the second jose r mas chief executive officer hey look i think what s happening in q1 are a couple things one is we had some project push outs from 19 that we would have been hoping to work on some of those projects early in the year even if it there was restoration related work that would ve generated more revenue we were probably caught a little flatfooted on that relative to finding work to back that up because we at the end of the day we re committed to the jobs that we have so we ve got to have the capacity to do them once they start so q1 will be slower the reality is that the way a lot of our contracts work is even though revenues will be down we ll be compensated on some jobs for some of our expenses or margins and q1 should be very strong again we re not expecting a dramatic drop to margins it ll be less than they were in q4 but they ll be solid for first quarter as we look at project starts going into the second quarter and third quarter we expect that business to begin to ramp we expect to have a really strong second half just based on our work schedules to kind of put it in perspective what we re kind of thinking for 2020 is we ll do about 1 billion in the first half of the year and roughly 2 2 billion in the second half of the year that s kind of how our guidance plays out obviously second quarter being almost double with first quarter is and if you go back to i don t know 2018 or so you ll see that we did about 1 1 billion in the second half of 2018 so to believe our guidance you ve got to kind of believe that we re going to do what we did in 2018 plus about 100 million for the second half versus what we did in 18 we think that s very doable we think the work schedule and plans that we have out play perfectly to that so we are i think on an overriding theme we take guidance very seriously we take a lot of pride in the fact that we ve been able to deliver the guidance for such a long period of time it s what gives us our credibility it s very important to us so we wouldn t put out any numbers that we didn t think were achievable and we think our second half plan is very achievable relative to the work that we re having today noelle dilts stifel analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thanks noelle operator and we ll take our next question from jamie cook with credit suisse jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning nice quarter i guess two questions jose one just going back to the communications business and you talked about investment and that we need revenues to improve the margins but just broadly can you talk about is the investment in 2020 the same versus 2019 or how do we think about how you re ramping headcount in our business or are we just starting to moderate because you want to see the revenues come through and then my second question on the oil and gas side understanding you have great visibility and your market share is very high but are you seeing any sort of changes in terms and conditions when you re bidding on projects just because the market broadly is weaker even if your market share is high and whether that s a risk to the business thank you jose r mas chief executive officer sure so i ll answer the second part first in oil and gas again i think that we ve done a great job of building a brand and building our reputation i think our customers know what we can deliver and i think that s put us in an advantageous position i don t see any difference in the margin profile of jobs on a go forward basis as what we ve seen in the past i think customers generally are looking for contractors that they know are going to deliver their projects on time and on schedule and for a long time we ve executed on that and done very well and i think the results have spoken for themselves and they are demonstrated in our financial results but the reality is that it s the production in the field results that allow you to perform financially so i think it speaks for itself on the communication side of the business we re going to continue to ramp we ll moderate it a little bit in the first half of the year but we see a lot of work coming and we want to be well positioned for it again we re going to see a stronger second half than first half maybe we re not we don t have huge expectations for what the merged entities are going to end up doing in the first half of the year we expect some pickup in the second if anything i think our guidance is conservative relative to what we could ultimately do with some of them so again we re very bullish jamie cook credit suisse analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thank you jamie operator and we ll take our next question from andrew kaplowitz with citi andrew kaplowitz citi analyst good morning guys jose r mas chief executive officer good morning andy andrew kaplowitz citi analyst it was a nice quarter so you just going back to oil and gas maybe if i could ask noelle s question in different way is the 1 4 billion that you mentioned are you going to put that in backlog in q1 and then last quarter you had mentioned initial guide high single digit growth for the year in oil gas now you guys are talking about mid single digit is that more of just sort of discounting how mvp plays out is that some deferrals or cancellations that you ve seen for this year maybe more color you can give us around that change jose r mas chief executive officer yes so the first question around what we expect to be in backlog at the end of q1 we expect the full 1 4 billion to turn into contracts in the first quarter more than half of that has already turned into contracts so we would expect that other half to be concluded here in the next month or so so we re hoping all of that falls into backlog at the end of q1 from a look i don t we re guiding growth in our oil and gas business it s not double digit growth it s low single digit growth i think that s relative to all of the noise that s out there i think that s excellent results with that said there s definitely a level of conservatism built into that we re not anticipating that every project is going to go perfectly and we re going to be able to do everything in 2020 that we would like to do or that our customers would like us to do we re making the assumption and some things are going to get delayed and some things we re going to push that s been a i think a prudent way of looking at guidance and that s kind of what we ve done in the last couple of years if everything hits that we re supposed to do in 2020 that number is going to be a lot better but i think we re taking a moderate view to guidance which i think is reasonable at this point in time and it just speaks to the strength of our work and what we booked relative to that industry andrew kaplowitz citi analyst that s helpful gentlemen and then i just want to ask you about power generation your backlog at 1 3 billion this is quite high obviously maybe you can talk about sort of the makeup of what s going on is it more win in construction work than you re winning ahead of ptc expiration i know you gave us already the expectations for power gen but given the backlog and the nice snapback in margins could power gen be a 100 million annual ebitda business or greater in the not too distant future jose r mas chief executive officer yes so a couple of things right i think their growth has been broad based obviously renewables is a big piece when solar and actually waste to all types of waste to energy has been a driver for us we re encouraged by i don t know if you re aware but the ptc wind credit got extended so that s something that isn t really a driver of the business today we re going to see a lot of strength in that industry hopefully for the next couple of years so the business is just very solid they ve done a good job of building the business we ve been very focused on trying to prepare ourselves to take advantage of whatever could come through an infrastructure build we think there s lots of pieces there that are going to get significant investments once our government decides to invest in infrastructure which we think is it s not a matter of if it s a matter of when o some of the things that we re doing that are really opening us up to that marketing and giving us the ability to hopefully take advantage of that market once it comes but it s relatively broad based and again i think they re executing very well i think you ve seen it in improvement of margins our margins will subside a little bit in the first quarter again and then start to grow we expect to have better full year margins in that business than we had in 2019 the management team there has done a phenomenal job quite frankly that business has an opportunity also to significantly beat what our expectations are in 2020 and they re just doing a great job and again they ve very diversified mix of work andrew kaplowitz citi analyst thanks jose jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question will come from brent thielman with d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning jose r mas chief executive officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey jose heard or i guess some would suggest that sprint t mobile are months behind in meeting this sort of three year 97 5g coverage they need to get to and presume that would need maybe to accelerate some spending are you having more active dialog there do you think they ll emerge as a more relevant customer for you in future jose r mas chief executive officer i think there was no question about it we ve been having dialog with them throughout the entire merger activity period we think all of those we think both the remaining entities which are going to be t mobile and dish they have significant build plans we have great opportunities the industry has great opportunities there s going to be a lot of work i think again we ve taken a moderate view relative to what we think we can achieve in the second half with them i think there s a lot of upside related to that but again it s part of what we ve invested in we ve made significant investments over the course of the last years to position ourselves as the best alternative for carriers as they think about their long term needs i think carriers understand our position in the market they understand what we bring and i think that s going to create a lot of opportunities for us so again we re very excited again if you look at how we plan 2020 even on the communications side we re guiding to roughly i don t know 1 4 billion in the first half of the year or 1 5 billion 1 6 billion in the second half of the year and if you look at the last few years 2016 2017 2018 2019 we ve always done about 100 million more in the second half of year than we ve done in the first half of the year consistently over the last five years if you look at our plans for this year it roughly correlates to 150 million to 200 million more in the second half of this year and relative to all the things that s happened in the industry especially with dish and t mobile we think that s not a very unrealistic or difficult stretch to get to and that s kind of what we ve got built in for them brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay that s great and i got to ask i guess just given the cash flow this last year expectations this next year leverage is down how are you thinking about buybacks today versus m a and other opportunities for capital allocation jose r mas chief executive officer look the same way we always have right i think we ve been very opportunistic relative to our stock we ve made significant purchases in points where we ve thought that the stock is undervalued obviously with the performance of the stock here especially in the last week we believe the stock is very undervalued we were hit before the slowdown already we got to the point where we thought we were significantly under valued now we think we re ridiculously undervalued so obviously something we ll be looking at we re in a great position to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise we think they create a lot of shareholder value so it s absolutely something that we ll be considering and focused on brent thielman d a davidson analyst all right agreed with that thank you jose jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from alex rygiel with b riley mr rygiel we can t hear you maybe your mute function is engaged alex rygiel b riley analyst jose you re there jose r mas chief executive officer yes hey alex how are you alex rygiel b riley analyst pretty good sorry a couple of quick questions first on communications what s the catalyst to getting the margins back above 10 is it just better labor utilization or is it more to it than that jose r mas chief executive officer yes i think it s about revenues coming in i think we ve built our cost structure up a little bit based on the investments that we ve made in the people that we ve hired revenues have to come into support that so i think we ve done a good job of maintaining the margin levels where they ve been as soon as we see a relatively nice uptick in revenue i think we ll begin to see it in margin so i think it s right around the corner we understand our business really well we track it in a lot of details so again it s something that we feel very comfortable is coming we wish it would have been here already obviously our expectations were for revenue to have grown a little bit more in 19 than they did but we re very confident that s going to come in the second half of 20 alex rygiel b riley analyst and then secondly with regards to the oil and gas business can you quantify the revenue from large pipeline projects that you expect in 2020 and talk a little bit about the competitive environment jose r mas chief executive officer so i think even in 19 and looking at 20 we don t have any single project that s making up the dramatic portion of our work we had that a little bit in 17 and 18 where one project made up a significant amount of our revenues i think if you look at 19 we had more of a broad based mvp was probably our biggest project but very broad based beyond that i think you re going to see the same thing in 2020 that s encouraging for us so obviously we re spreading our risk we re spreading on geographic profile with that said there s a lot of work out there i know there s a lot of concern there s a lot of questions we re amazed by the level of activity around not just projects for 2020 but planned projects beyond that so that s our expectation that you re going to just see a lot more not mega projects but a lot of big projects that will have the opportunity to work on and perform alex rygiel b riley analyst great thank you operator and our next question comes from steven fisher with ubs steven fisher ubs analyst great thanks good morning jose r mas chief executive officer good morning steven fisher ubs analyst just wanted to really follow up on that last point that you were talking about with alex and if you could talk a little bit more about the customer mix that you talked about the mix shift that you talked about with noelle to what extent does that reflect a regional change or some other product mix shift and then what are you assuming in terms of timing of some of these big project approvals and then when they might come through jose r mas chief executive officer yes so look i think if you look at the business right we generated 20 margins in 2019 we re going to have margins that are close to that in 2020 obviously couple of hundred basis points less is what we re expecting relative to the mix with it being consistently good right so we expect really good margins in oil and gas both in the first quarter first half second half quite improving as the year goes on it s a very exciting time part of that is driven by the mix of projects that we have to the extent that we do more cost reimbursable work in those periods the margins tend to be a little bit lower because that work ends up being you don t have as much risk but obviously the returns are a little bit lower so we feel really good about the mix of work that we ve got we feel really good about where the project stands so the fact that the great majority of our projects really aren t facing significant regulatory hurdles obviously mvp is the one that everybody wants to talk about because it s out in the press and we ve got some permits to get to completely finish that but even on mvp there s a lot of work to do irrespective of what happens with the supreme court and all of these permits right so we ve got to go back to work there s a lot to do full completion of that project will have some dependency on permits but for the most par there s a lot of activity around these jobs and most of the other jobs aren t in that circumstance so again good geographic diversification good mix of work is helping us both grow revenues and maintain the margin profile steven fisher ubs analyst thanks for that but you did mention there was a customer mix shift this year i was just wondering how different that might be and in what way jose r mas chief executive officer well look i think they re always is right because you ve got the broad based answer isn t one midstream company reduces capex it doesn t necessarily have a huge impact on our business because there s others that are increasing capex so there s others that have project plan that are hitting in the particular year so it s not one customer driven right we ve done big projects for customers they roll in they roll out they have significant projects one year they may not have a lot of activity the following year they may end up coming back a couple of years later so it s important for us to have broad based relationships with lots of customers and kind of figure out who s spending and what time period and make sure we re in front of them and have great opportunities and i think we ve been able to do that steven fisher ubs analyst got it just a quick one on telecom how much did quadgen add to backlog in q4 i assume it was fairly modest and then do you expect the bookings to kind of on a quarterly basis in communications be consistent with fourth quarter or are they going to be kind of lumpy up and down quarter to quarter jose r mas chief executive officer look it s going to depend on the big opportunities for us for further for significant further backlog expansion is going to come from some of the new entities and what happens post merger that s not i think that s going to play out over the course of the next couple of quarters and not necessarily next quarter for the quadgen question it was relatively small it was well under 100 million a lot of the work that they do was for us a portion of that work which wouldn t do anything to our backlog so it really didn t have a meaningful impact to backlog steven fisher ubs analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from chad dillard with deutsche bank chad dillard deutsche bank analyst hi good morning guys jose r mas chief executive officer good morning chad chad dillard deutsche bank analyst so can you talk about the 2020 mix of wireline versus wireless and how that compare to 2019 and then also on electric transmission side can you just talk about your project pipeline the prospects there and how to think about that jose r mas chief executive officer yes so for 2020 we re actually expecting growth in both wireline and wireless i think the wireline growth will be fairly consistent throughout the year where we ve got a lot of projects that we re working on so it ll be really strong both first half second half i think wireless is really strong again showing growth first half i think showing more growth in the second half so both of those markets we continue to believe are very strong there s a lot of activity there s a lot of fiber being placed for multiple reasons right one is obviously for wireless backhaul but the second you ve got the cable companies doing a lot relative to providing higher speed broadband to homes so there s a lot of activity there on the wireless side i think we ve talked about it a lot i think every carrier is going to have massive spend plans for a long period of time as they begin to roll out 5g from an electrical transmission side i think we ve done a really good job with the business right i think they ve executed they performed on the projects we expect strong double digit growth this year i think george said north of 20 we ve got our backlog is actually very strong we got a lot of projects that fall outside of the 18 month backlog period so our total backlog in transmission is considerably higher than what our stated and published backlog number is there we ve got a lot of projects outstanding some of which we think we re going to win that are going to have a very positive impact to backlog so everything s working very well there we ve always talked about having the goal of all of our segments being north of a 1 billion we saw power gen do that in the last year we think ultimately it s just a matter of time before the electrical transmission gets there chad dillard deutsche bank analyst and then on cash conversion can you just talk about just how to think about that in 2020 as well as just like how to think about the cadence as we go through the year thanks george l pita executive vice president and chief financial officer we ve talked about obviously we re expecting record cash flow from ops for the year our dso level will be a little higher in the first quarter it will be similar to what we did in the fourth quarter but we ll still generate significant cash flow so i don t think it ll be relatively consistent it s not going to be as lumpy as it was two years ago when we had some structural issues that slowed collections now at this point everything that we re dealing with is just ordinary course corrections and movements outside of maybe retainage and that sort of thing so no question that for the year we expect record cash flow as well as we did in 2019 frankly we could have done a little bit better on cash flow so we expect that our cash flow in 2020 should grow a little bit higher than our overall growth in terms of earnings is concerned and once again we expect that free cash flows can exceed net income chad dillard deutsche bank analyst thanks i ll pass it on jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from adam thalhimer with thompson davis adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst well that s perfect hey george i think you seem to stress that verizon wireless was a good opportunity in q4 and i think historically verizon used small kind of local contractors for wireless work is there a larger opportunity there jose r mas chief executive officer so i don t know if you directed it to george and myself we ve been saying that for a while right i think verizon as we looked at the one fiber project contracted that project very differently than they ve historically contracted anything i think that s opened the doors for significant dialogue with that customer around what they re going to do in the future i think what we all need to understand is irrespective as much noise and press it gets 5g is an extremely early stages and the amount of activity levels required to ultimately deploy that are going to increase considerably multiples of what it is today which is going to give every every carrier significant challenges as they think about their build out plan so i think every carrier that exists out there today is going to have opportunities available to the industry for people to come in and take advantage of it and really create different types of relationships than they ve seen in the past to be able to execute on their plans and verizon is no different adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst and jose the power gen business is so big now can you kind of walk us through what percent of the mix now between wind solar biomass jose r mas chief executive officer the breakout of each of those adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst yes i m just just a little more color on it it s become a big piece of the story now so just some more color on internally within that business what s really driving things jose r mas chief executive officer yes i think it s a mix of all of it right solar is a relatively new business for us it s a great opportunity our hope is 15 20 of that business this year will be related to solar wind continues to be a significant piece of the business for us it ll probably be 40 50 of revenues in 2020 then the balance is a mix of all other types of work right everything else we ve talked about over the course of the last year all the pieces are growing probably obviously solar is new so that s growing faster but again it s a very broad mix of projects and again i think they re performing very well and executing well on all projects mixes adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst got it thank you jose r mas chief executive officer thanks adam operator and our next question comes from sean eastman with keybanc capital markets sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions jose r mas chief executive officer good morning sean sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst a quick question i m just curious of the 2019 mix how much of the o g segment is integrity work and utility main replacements the stuff that the investment community s a little more comfortable having exposure to just curious what that is today maybe what kind of strategies are in place or sort of growth trajectory we can see around that more sort of defensible type of work jose r mas chief executive officer so a couple things right one is we re very excited about that market we think that s a growing market there s obviously lots of needs in different parts of the country where more dollars are being spent than others it s relatively a 200 million to 400 million business for us at any given point in time with that said we agree that s a defensible market but we don t we also agree we also believe that the rest of our business is pretty solid right so i know that there s a distinction in the market between them but i think it s important to mention that we feel really good about the long term ability of the rest of our business to continue to perform and maintain at current levels sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and second one is just around so we ve got these sprint t mobile merger which is a positive development around the 5g opportunity set but then we ve also got this coronavirus backdrop and some potential supply chain impacts around that and so just be helpful to get a sense for an update on just the overall timing on when some of the 5g macro tower work is going to start to kick off in earnest jose r mas chief executive officer well some of it is started right so it depends on what carrier so i think when you look at the carriers that weren t involved in the merger they ve kind of set their build plans for 2020 so we ve got a good feel for what where they re going to do we think we ll equipment hasn t been an issue to date they ve done a good job of preplanning on their procurement side so they ve done a lot relative to that some of the guys that are coming out of the merger they stopped a lot of the work that they were doing or significantly slowed it down so we think there was an inventory build there as well which we think somewhat offsets any potential procurement issues as we look at least to the end of 2020 beyond that we don t think it s been it hasn t been an issue in the industry to date we obviously have no idea what s going to ultimately happen there and how much worse that gets and if it does end up having long term issues with certain types of equipment but all our customers are super focused on it they re working hard on it they re trying to find alternate sources if so needed so there s a lot of attention being paid to that right now at the customer level sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst excellent i appreciate your time thanks jose r mas chief executive officer thank you operator and our final question will be coming from justin hauke with robert w baird justin hauke robert w baird analyst yes thanks two quick numerical ones here just the first one on the diversification of the client base in oil and gas for the second half ramp i guess i m just curious i mean it looks like mvp based on the percentages you gave with your customers was about 25 or so of the full year revenue how much scope is left on that project that s part of that ramp versus maybe everything else that you ve booked and are going to book in the first quarter jose r mas chief executive officer yes so none of mvp is not in the 1 4 billion of subsequent and verbal awards that we talked about we would consider that part of what we had from our pending works so they re separated and i think that s important to note we expect a considerable amount of revenue from mvp to finish the job we re not going to get into specifics but i think if you look at 2019 levels there s probably roughly that much left to finish that job to completion how much of that happens in 20 versus or if it pushes some in 21 we ll see and i think probably all we ll say about that customer justin hauke robert w baird analyst okay so that s enough and that s actually helpful and the second one is just on quadgen the revenue contribution looks like it was a little bit more than what we were expecting what s the acquired revenue assumption that you guys are taking from that business in 20 jose r mas chief executive officer in 2020 on a gross basis if you look at the revenue is probably just under a 100 million but a significant portion of that is internal to mastec so it ll get reversed and consolidation so it s probably 50 million add roughly justin hauke robert w baird analyst thank you jose r mas chief executive officer for the full year justin hauke robert w baird analyst great operator and there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any concluding remarks jose r mas chief

started pricing in the prospect of multiple rate cuts over the course of 2020 bank of america strategists now expect the fed to cut rates by 50 basis points at its march meeting but some analysts argue that because the virus in just a brief period has proven to be such a cataclysmic event it will do little to contain the bloodbath in equities a rate cut will theoretically offer a boost to consumer sentiment and credit availability and help limit the damage but it is not going to offset the possibility of a wider contraction in the market if we do see more travel shutdowns and supply chains permanently disrupted said karl schamotta chief market strategist at cambridge global payments look monetary policy just isn t up to the task of offsetting shutdowns in some of the world s largest economies we are going to need strong concerted fiscal stimulus for that he said john zechner a wealth manager and chairman of j zechner associates also argued that while central bank intervention might put investors at ease in the short run it s unclear if it is an effective long term strategy to calm markets advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the bigger issue is does a rate cut actually change economics you cut rates to stimulate the economy and that s why markets go higher because they anticipate better growth but if you look at any single company are they not spending money because the cost of capital is too high absolutely not he said this week s market contagion also sparks the question of whether markets were overbought and priced to perfection for so long that all it took was one cataclysmic event to prick the bubble yes and no said srinivas thiruvandanthai managing director at the jerome levy forecasting center and an expert in market cycles the markets had run up relentlessly and the underlying economic situation had not improved dramatically at the same time i would say this is much more than a catalyst because the implications of this virus could be far reaching and more importantly we have not got to the bottom of what this virus really is thiruvandanthai believes that markets will only stabilize once there s some semblance of how coronavirus can be controlled there are a few things that markets need to see first that it stops spreading second that the rate of acceleration of cases starts to fall and third something that gives the market some kind of closure and sense of timing for instance knowing that it will come under control say two or three months from now he said for schamotta the last five days have been a lesson in economic sobriety all the economic forecasts in the world don t add up to a lot when you are facing something truly out of left field man plans god laughs as the old yiddish proverb goes he said if you re an investor household or business assume that the future is inherently unpredictable and never over leverage

even the european press has already written about the russian fraudster builder alexander chikovani who is currently hiding from justice in spain as a result of a journalistic investigation by the british publication the london weekly the amounts on the accounts as well as the real estate purchased by the russian businessman and his family in who did not pay hundreds of millions of taxes became known a native of kemerovo alexander chikovani was running a construction business in the russian capital his company performed contract work for major developers in moscow and the moscow region the businessman s frivolous and irresponsible attitude towards work turned not only his business partners and clients but also their own employees against to do this just looking at the reviews about his company written by disgruntled employees who complained about non payment of salaries 5 years ago would be enough chikovani became known after the publication of an article on the russian forbes website about the company construction company gefest owned by chikovani the construction company took a loan of 50 million rubles but the businessman was in no hurry to return the debts to creditors or did not had any intention at all during the audit of the company it was also known that chikovani did not pay vat for three years thus causing significant damage to the country s budget for about 170 million rubles alexander chikovani who is the real owner of the construction company gefest instead of paying creditors withdrew more than 50 million rubles from the turnover in his favor despite the absence of a legal link between the owner and the company the court brought chikovani to vicarious liability using high technology it turned out that he was the owner and administrator of the domain where the official site of construction company hephaestus was located in addition the company s accounts were managed from devices whose ip addresses belonged either to chikovani personally or to companies controlled by him forbes and although chikovani himself denied his involvement in gefest law enforcement agencies were able to prove the businessman s guilt by identifying the necessary information from ip addresses which confirmed that the company s accounts were managed from other companies affiliated to the businessman most often directly from chikovani s personal account a little later it turned out that the company was deliberately brought to bankruptcy for non payment of debt obligations for this the entrepreneur was put on the federal wanted list from which he had to flee to spain at the end of last year it was found that the enterprising fraudster was hiding in spain his case became a concern for meps together with the ex minister of justice of spain the meps appealed to the law enforcement agencies of spain to check whether there are evidence of fraud in russia and the expediency of harbouring the russian fugitive on the territory of the eu which according to rootkit is closely linked to ethnic criminal groups this is just another case of european countries harboring criminals wanted in russia for spain patronage of criminal elements from russia or the cis is not uncommon even though the russian authorities seek to cooperate with spanish law enforcement agencies and in october 2019 issued spain thief in law tariel oniani nicknamed taro alexander chikovani is also closely associated with russian criminals contacting ethnic groups in terms of legalizing illegal assets he was introduced to the criminal world by his uncle george chikovani nicknamed gogi who like tariel oniani was one of the most famous thieves in law giorgi chikovani the real godfather of russian mafia his authority was unquestioned in the criminal world he received his first term of 15 years in prison at the age of 19 during his entire life uncle gogi served 26 years in camps and prisons the last time georgy chikovani visited the owner was in 2004 when the georgian authorities declared a merciless fight against crime the 79 year old goga was searched and a whole arsenal of weapons was found then the minister of internal affairs reported that the thief in law was detained for illegal possession of a large number of weapons he mentioned that chikovani is considered the boss of thieves in law and is one of the greatest authorities in the criminal world apparently it was him who paved the way for his relative to enter the criminal world and perhaps it is him who gave the initial capital to create a construction company earned on murder and extortion alexander chikovani s criminal activities continued and he like his uncle decided to involve his entire family in illegal operations and fraud trying to keep all the assets for himself he decided to rewrite all the property to his wife ksenia chikovani helping her husband ksenia became an accomplice to crimes since the wife acted as an accomplice of her own husband she also actively helped alexander in his scams in russia and can also be put on the wanted list hotels boarding houses restaurants and other properties in spain which according to our information chikovani began to purchase are now owned by ksenia chikovani and they re children moreover the woman is the beneficiary of two companies registered in spain ansada mediaterranea sl in barcelona and nueva constructora iberica in tarragona which specialize in trading renting and managing hotels restaurants spas and other real estate properties this information only confirms that the chikovani family plans to settle in europe for a long time this is also evidenced by the accounts found by the london weekly in their names with decent amounts of money in austrian banks just in case accounts were opened in asia in china and hong kong as a fallback route at united overseas bank limited in hong kong ksenia chikovani has an account with 3 463 746 in the same bank alexander chikovani has 1 363 008 hong kong dollars he also opened an account at the chinese bank industrial and commercial bank of china with 1 097 183 in europe according to the london weekly the chikovani family keeps their ill gotten capital in austria for example unicredit bank austria ag registered an account with 4 774 097 euros in the name of alexander chikovani while ksenia chikovani keeps 190 667 euros in another austrian bank kathrein privatbank ag for making transactions that resulted in the withdrawal of assets to companies controlled by the businessman alexander chikovani was brought to subsidiary liability by the court for the obligations of debtors totaling more than 200 million rubles all transactions for the withdrawal of assets for the purpose of personal enrichment were declared invalid by the courts in the relations between the russian federation and the kingdom of spain the agreement on legal assistance in civil cases of 1990 is still in force based on this the court decided to send a court order to the ministry of justice of spain for the provision of international legal assistance pavel petrovich kobyak a bankruptcy trustee of chikovani s former company haephestus introduced by the russian authorities challenged a number of transactions concluded by the debtor during the period when the actual management of gefest stroy llc was carried out by alexander chikovani according to the expert the company was deliberately bankrupted by its owner for the purpose of non payment of credit debts and the money was withdrawn abroad which is confirmed by the information of the british publication an independent manager is demanding the seizure of the assets of alexander chikovani and his wife in spain to satisfy creditor s claims connections to the ethnic criminal groups can help a fraudster who defrauded a large number of people to escape from justice in the eu forever why should people in spain live next to russian criminals such as alexander chikovani and his partner in law ksenia at the moment the spanish authorities are not in a hurry to co operate for the fair punishment of criminals sheltering people accused of fraud tax evasion money laundering and with ties with criminal groups on their territory for which they may pay in the near future when the criminal family of chikovani deceives someone from the citizens of spain a serious challenge for europe will be the confrontation with russian law enforcement agencies but we are confident that spain will soon hand over alexander chikovani and his entire family to the russian authorities along with their ill gotten property

our sec filings for factors that could cause material differences between forward looking statements and actual results we are not under any duty to update forward looking statements unless required by law i will now turn the call over to our ceo paul layne paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you dave and thank you all for joining us today welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call i m pleased to report that we had an exceptional year and that our core businesses have never been stronger than they were in 2019 the solid results we ve achieved further cement our conviction that the transformation plan announced last october represents a successful strategy for increasing shareholder value by lowering overhead selling non core assets and focusing the company s resources on our core assets i d like to divide my prepared remarks by highlighting the results of the year followed by the progress made on our transformation plan and then discuss the strategic benefits of the recent acquisition of the occidental towers in the woodlands david will then discuss the results of our mpc operating assets seaport and strategic developments segments along with our financial results i ll then finish by discussing our outlook for 2020 before opening up for questions before we begin i d like to mention our february 19 press release announcing that we have partnered with say the fintech start up reimagining shareholder communications for this call ideally this tool will enhance investor relations by allowing you our investors to ask questions in advance of our earnings calls and have visibility into other investors questions at the end of this call we will answer the top questions from the past week we are always looking for ways to elevate our capabilities respond to shareholder questions and make our earnings calls more transparent and engaging i hope that you will find this new technology helpful in that regard okay on to the highlights of the year we recorded the strongest annual land sales in the company s history selling 571 residential acres or 25 more than we did in 2018 and if you remember 2018 was an excellent year our mpc ebt or earnings before taxes increased by 54 6 million or 27 to 257 6 million up from 203 million we had substantial growth in our operating assets noi including our share of noi from non consolidated assets of 36 4 million or approximately 20 driven by increases in our office hospitality and multi family portfolios along with our other category which was driven by placing the las vegas ballpark in service in 2019 we continued the conversion of commercial land into vibrant income producing assets by starting construction on several new properties including 8770 new trails creekside apartments phase ii phase iii in millennium multi family ko ula retail and a stand alone restaurant at the merriweather district in columbia these new assets will contribute approximately 14 3 million of noi when stabilized on costs of approximately 154 1 million and an unlevered return on cost of 9 3 this combined with our acquisition of the occidental portfolio which i will talk about in a minute accounts for increase in our annual stabilized noi target not including the seaport of 51 4 million to 367 31 million or approximately 16 3 at ward village and honolulu we completed and delivered ke kilohana our workforce housing project and also began construction on our six tower ko ula in january of this year we launched public pre sales of our seventh condo project victoria place we have entered into hard contracts with 20 deposits on 185 homes or 53 of the total project as of february 21 an incredible pace we really could not be more pleased with the reception of this project in this incredible community in the seaport district we increased revenues by 23 million to 55 6 million in 2019 compared to the previous year due to increases at our existing businesses as well as the openings of new businesses such as jean georges critically acclaimed the fulton and malibu farm given the inherent volatility of opening new businesses we will be best served by waiting until we have gotten through a few more quarters to further evaluate our estimated stabilized noi guidance now turning to the transformation plan we announced in october as you hopefully recall the transformation plan had three key pillars first hhc will become lean by reducing our overhead expenses by 45 million to 50 million second we will become focused by selling approximately 2 billion of non core assets generating over 600 million of net proceeds to predominantly redeploy into share repurchases and development opportunities in our core mpcs finally we will employ a decentralized operating model that will allow us to accelerate growth in our core mpc business driving value creation in our decades long development pipeline i m pleased to report that even though it s only been just barely over four months since i became ceo and we announced that plan we have made substantial progress toward achieving the goals we set out on that call to that end we ve made meaningful progress toward our g a reduction goals in a very short timeframe and still remain committed to achieving the expected savings of 45 million to 50 million obviously we incurred a meaningful one time charge of 34 3 million associated with this restructuring and our corporate move to the woodlands will not occur until august of this year as a result our overhead in the fourth quarter does not reflect the true run rate amount of our current g a but as i said we are confident that we will achieve our g a goals and expect that the vast majority of these savings will be reflected in our results at an increasing amount throughout 2020 we have closed three non core asset sales cottonwood mall west windsor and bridges at mint hill for a total of 95 5 million and recorded a net gain associated with these sales of 27 1 million we remain confident that we will be able to achieve our target of 600 million in net proceeds from non core asset sales the goals of our plan also included reinvesting the proceeds of our non core sales into both share buybacks and into our core mpcs by leveraging our decentralized business model to effectuate faster decision making as we previously announced the board authorized a 100 million share buyback program on october 31 of last year in early november we began aggressively repurchasing shares and were able to purchase approximately 54 million before it became apparent that we were a finalist for the very large acquisition that i ll highlight now we completed the largest acquisition in the company s history with our purchase from occidental petroleum in the woodlands this acquisition is emblematic of both our recommitment to invest in our core mpcs as well as our ability to leverage our decentralized model to move with great speed when opportunities arise the acquisition included two class aaa office towers totaling 1 4 million square feet and a 126 000 square foot warehouse in the woodlands from occidental and closed at the end of december it also included 9 3 acres of prime developable land in the woodlands town center and a 63 acre office campus in west houston s energy corridor that we have already listed for sale a few benefits of this transaction this acquisition increases our office portfolio in the woodlands by approximately 50 and solidifies our dominance of the class a space in this dynamic market it protects against competitors entering the market and provides us with much needed inventory without construction risk and a new investment grade tenant in occidental petroleum who is leasing approximately 808 000 square feet which is the entirety of the larger of the two towers and the 126 000 square foot warehouse for 13 years additionally this purchase mitigates a good portion of the reduction in noi that we expect to see from non core asset sales and replaces the more volatile shorter term income from our hospitality and non core retail assets with extremely predictable long term investment grade income which clearly increases the value of our portfolio this is an excellent example of our new strategy and action proceeds from the sales of non core assets such as cottonwood mall west windsor and bridges at mint hill helped us accelerate this investment in one of our core mpc assets where we have significant competitive advantages and where we can achieve the highest risk adjusted returns we have extensive and long standing relationships in these core markets that give us a competitive advantage when strategic assets that we don t own become available such as in this case these relationships as well as our intimate market knowledge allow us to gauge tenant demand in a manner that no other owner can which is extremely valuable in underwriting these transactions while we have only owned the assets a short time we are seeing very strong activity in the market and are engaged with several prospects and look forward to updating you over the next several quarters needless to say it was both an incredibly busy and very rewarding fourth quarter at howard hughes corporation now i d like to turn it over to david o reilly david r o reilly chief financial officer thank you paul i m going to start with a quick review of our mpc operating assets strategic developments and seaport segment and then turn to our financial results as paul mentioned earlier mpc ebt increased substantially year over year due to both the higher price per acre being achieved and an increase in number of acres sold across the portfolio ebt increased 54 6 million to 257 6 million these figures truly hammer home the fact that the more we amenitize our communities the more people are drawn to them and the more valuable the remaining land becomes a great example of this is summerlin we opened the ballpark last year and the price per acre increased 82 000 from 566 000 to 648 000 if you extrapolate that increase across the remaining 2 991 residential acres that we own the uninflated undiscounted value has increased by almost 250 million bridgeland had a more modest increase in price per acre moving from 385 000 to 408 000 but for us bridgeland is more about velocity and reaching critical mass than maximizing price per acre we sold 773 lots in 2019 up from 620 in 2018 on our way to what we believe is a critical run rate of 1 000 lots per year this is what we are continuously doing in our mpcs adding value and keeping the virtuous cycle moving forward as we have mentioned previously new home sales in our communities are an excellent indicator of demand for future land sales across the portfolio new home sales were up 15 for the 12 months ending december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the increase was led by the woodland hills and bridgeland in the fourth quarter new home sales were up 41 3 overall compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to increases at the woodland hills bridgeland and summerlin this level of home sales gives us a great deal of confidence in our projected land sales for 2020 available spec homes are down in bridgeland and the woodlands to 93 and 47 units respectively representing a 1 1 months and 1 8 months of supply available and the woodland hills spec homes increased slightly from 32 to 34 and represents only a 2 3 months supply summerlin is not a spec home market speaking on summerlin to date we have closed on approximately 422 million of sales at the summit including 28 million of custom lots and 52 million of homes this quarter compared to 16 8 million and 40 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 respectively we have won contracts in escrow at the end of the fourth quarter worth approximately 82 7 million as was mentioned last quarter the summit is an ultra high end community and sales will always be lumpy from one quarter to the next with all of that said the project has exceeded our expectations for sales since inception and we expect the overall gross margin generated by the project to remain unchanged from our original expectations moving to our operating assets segment where we had both a great quarter and a great year for the fourth quarter of 2019 our noi increased 3 3 million or 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 this was largely due to increases in the office portfolio with lakefront north 100 fellowship drive aristocrat and two summerlin coming online along with a lease up at three hughes landing we also saw improvement in our multi family and hospitality assets all of this was partially offset by the seasonality of baseball at the las vegas ballpark for the full year 2019 we increase our noi by 20 increasing from approximately 180 million in 2018 to almost 217 million in 2019 this was a result of a large improvement in our office portfolio the opening of the baseball stadium last march and improvements in our hospitality and multi family assets the office and multi family portfolio noi increased as a result of new assets coming online late in 2018 and throughout 2019 as well as improved occupancy in existing buildings hospitality increases were driven by greater occupancy levels these increases were partially offset by a reduction in our retail portfolio of approximately 1 3 million due to one time positive adjustments at ward village in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 on a sequential basis we saw operating assets noi dropped by approximately 8 million this was largely due to the end of baseball season at the las vegas ballpark and the typically slower hospitality business in november and december in addition there were some termination fees and a few other small one time benefits in the third quarter that did not recur in the fourth quarter at the same time our stabilized noi target increased from 323 1 million last quarter to 367 3 million a 44 2 million increase this increase is largely attributable to the occidental acquisition note that this stabilized noi target is before the sale of our remaining non core assets which we we ll expect to reduce debt target by approximately 66 1 million to 301 2 million turning to our strategic developments segment we had another excellent quarter led by continued strong sales of condominiums at ward village and honolulu a ali i which began construction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2021 was 83 5 pre sold as of december 31 ko ula which broke ground in the third quarter of 2019 was 74 3 pre sold as of the end of the year that project completes in 2022 as paul mentioned in january of this year we began public pre sales on our seventh condominium project at ward village victoria place which is already pre sold 53 of the units with hard deposits as of february 21 this is a continued testament to the vibrant master planned community that we have created a product that we have designed a vibrant international market and our team on the ground in honolulu moving on to the seaport for the quarter ended december 31 2019 we had a net operating loss at the seaport district of 5 6 million compared to a net operating loss of 3 6 million in the same quarter of 2018 the loss was primarily due to funding start up costs with the retail food beverage and other operating joint venture businesses this loss was partially offset by 1 7 million improvement in our managed businesses for the year seaport noi loss including our share of noi from equity investments increased by 9 5 million to a net loss of 15 7 million the increased loss was due to decreases of 6 1 million 2 2 million and 1 million in our landlord operations managed businesses and events and sponsorships respectively landlord operations reduction in noi was primarily due to abercrombie fitch baking in during the second quarter of 2019 managed businesses increased loss was principally due to the increased losses at 10 corso como as the store was opened for a full year in 2019 as compared to less than three months in 2018 in addition start up costs and initial losses at the fulton and malibu farm and bar wayo contributed to the increased loss the events and sponsorship change was due to increased costs for winterland which was only opened for one month in 2018 as we have said we expect these losses to continue until the seaport reaches its critical massive offerings which will be primarily driven by the timing of the completion and stabilization of the jean george marketplace located in the tin building assuming that we receive timely approvals we expect the tin building to be opened in the summer of 2021 stabilization should occur within 12 to 18 months of opening now a quick overview of our earnings before summarizing some recent financing activity and our current leverage and liquidity i hope that you ve been able to review our 10 k earnings release and supplemental package filed yesterday which contains details of our financial and operational results we completed the fourth quarter with a gaap loss of 1 1 million or 0 03 per diluted share as compared to 37 3 million or 0 86 per diluted share for the same period last year the decrease was driven by lower condo sales due to timing of closings and higher g a expenses related to the restructuring and consulting fees for technology and data integration projects for the 12 months ended 2019 we had gaap earnings of 74 million or 1 71 per diluted share as compared to 57 million or 1 32 per diluted share in 2018 the increase was due to higher mpc sales and increase in gain on sale from the disposal of our non core assets higher minimum rental and selling profit from sales type lease revenue and higher other rental and property revenue in the operating segment and seaport segments these were partially offset by higher operating expenses in all four segments higher interest expense at the seaport in 250 water street and higher depreciation and amortization expense for the new assets we placed into service nareit defined ffo was 0 91 per diluted share for the quarter as compared to 1 72 for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower condo sales at ward village due to the timing of closings we had approximately 309 million of closings in ae o in the fourth quarter of 2018 and that obviously did not recur in 2019 for the year ended 2019 ffo was 4 58 per diluted share compared to 4 16 for 2018 the increase was primarily due to higher mpc land sales turning to our financings subsequent to the quarter end on january 7 2020 we closed on a 43 4 million construction loan for the creekside park apartments phase ii in december we closed on a 343 8 million bridge loan for the acquisition of the occidental towers which we rebranded the woodland towers at the waterway and also the woodlands warehouse we also modified and extended the 61 million loan for three hughes landing in november we closed on a 100 million note payable for 250 water street and repaid the original seller financing at a 4 9 million discount in october we closed on a 250 million credit facility secured by a land and certain other collateral in the woodlands and bridgeland mpcs this loan refinance the woodlands master credit facility and bridgeland credit facility with a combined principal balance of 215 million we ve reduced the interest rate from libor plus 2 87 to libor plus 2 5 as i mentioned before this facility is used to fund infrastructure costs at our mpcs that are largely reimbursed through the issuance of muds or municipal utility district bonds we currently have just over 280 million in mud receivables also in october we modified and extended 47 9 million loan for the outlet collection at riverwalk the total commitment was reduced to 30 9 million after a 15 million pay down as of the end of the fourth quarter our total consolidated debt to total assets was approximately 49 and our net debt to enterprise value closed the quarter at 37 from a liquidity perspective we finished the fourth quarter with approximately 423 million of cash on hand and as you can see from the projects under construction in the table on page 65 of the 10 k we have net equity requirements of 281 million we expect to fund these commitments through a combination of our free cash flow from our operating assets and mpc segments net proceeds from non core asset sales and lastly our existing cash balance to be clear we have enough cash and liquidity on hand to meet all of our current funding commitments without any additional cash being generated from mpc land sales or our operating properties with that i m going turn the call back over to paul for a few thoughts on our expectations for 2020 broken down by segments paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thanks david in our mpc segment as previously mentioned we had a record year with mpc ebt of 258 million based on both the momentum from 2019 as well as the limited current year to date results we remain optimistic that 2020 will be an excellent year with that said we do not expect to repeat the record results of our 2019 mpc ebt in 2020 a number of superpad sales in summerlin were accelerated into 2019 to meet our homebuilders and homebuyers demand and given the magnitude of work it takes to prepare a superpad we do not believe that these same types of results will be repeated in 2020 we expect that we will have an excellent but normalized year for land sales and the resulting mpc ebt will revert to more normal historical levels of between 180 million and 200 million for 2020 in our operating assets segment we see continued stabilization of recently developed or acquired assets strong same store performance and the addition of occidental towers all contributing to meaningful growth in our portfolio noi but as we ve mentioned we are actively engaged in non core asset sales and as we execute those sales our noi will decrease as such it is our expectation that our first quarter noi will be strong as we will have contributions from both the non core assets before they are sold and the benefit of the occupied occidental buildings we then expect the noi will modestly decline throughout the year as the headwinds of the non core sales will not be entirely offset by the growth of our stabilization of our recently completed or acquired assets within our strategic developments segment we have made meaningful progress in the identification and planning of the next several projects across the portfolio we have a number of projects ready to go in summerlin colombia the woodlands and ward village and remain committed to delivering on the promises of our transformation plan which stated our desire to accelerate growth in our core in mpcs but we are also steadfast in our commitment to the same disciplined approach to new development that we ve always had at hhc we will only start a project when we have both the capital to complete the project and we see ample market demand to fill that development at outsized risk adjusted returns obviously the occidental acquisition impacted our capital availability to start multiple new projects early in 2020 and we ll need to weigh on our future free cash flow and the proceeds of our non core asset sales to provide the fuel to fund new development projects we are optimistic that we will be able to talk about a number of new projects this year and we ll provide more detail on these projects as the timing of closing of our non core asset sales become more clear for the seaport district our goals for 2020 remain unchanged we are steadfast in our belief that there is a clear near term roadmap to unlocking value and intend to continue to execute on the strategy over 2020 and 2021 including opening and stabilizing our restaurant offerings on pier 17 which has progressed nicely with the continued stabilization of the fulton malibu farms and the early opening of bar wayo finally the restaurant offerings by andrew carmellini remain on track with mister dips scheduled to open in may and his italian chop house to open in july completing construction opening and stabilizing the tin building jean george food hall which we believe will only further increase traffic and solidify the seaport as a world class destination which remains on track for summer 2021 opening leasing the balance of the office space on pier 17 and the third floor the fulton market building we are working with a number of prospects for these spaces and hope that we can share a more detailed update on its progress in the coming quarters and finally working with the community and elected officials to finalize our plans for 250 water street and the remaining air rights finally our disciplined capital allocation approach will not change in 2020 we will continue to allocate the capital generated from operations and non core asset sales between new developments and share buybacks to where we see the greatest risk adjusted returns and opportunities to drive the greatest increases to shareholder value as you can see from our results since the day we announced the transformation plan the team has been working at a breakneck pace to deliver on results and close the largest transaction in our company s history as this has been my first full quarter as ceo i am incredibly proud of the work that the team has done and the improvements that we ve already made to the organization both operationally and culturally these improvements have only started to materialize in our results again thank you all for joining us today and look forward to talking with you as we get out on the road throughout the year we will now turn to q a before we open up the lines to those who have called in the first few questions have been generated by our investors over the past week through our newly implemented say technology application and will be read by dave striph dave can you please read the first question questions and answers david striph executive vice president of investor relations yes paul at what point would you expect the seaport to be cash flow neutral paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you dave we are steadfast on our plan at the seaport we are leasing space we are aggressively going to get our office space leased and get our restaurants opened and we re very excited about the jean george food hall which will open in approximately 18 months which will be a driver of not only foot traffic but also just the excitement at the seaport district we re at a point where maybe 12 to 18 months after the food hall stabilizes in 2021 we can look at this but at this point we re just excited about the opportunities of getting space leased and creating more sustainable noi david striph executive vice president of investor relations does the projected stabilized noi of 367 million include the chicago office tower paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors as shown on page 16 of our supplemental we are showing 14 4 million in our stabilized noi for 110 wacker david striph executive vice president of investor relations did the company receive any bids for assets during its period of ib retention and if so why were they rejected paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors we received a tremendous amount of interest in individual assets and these were the first people we went back to when we decided to sell non core assets this is why we ve gotten off to such a strong start of our sales 95 5 million with a 22 4 million gain with the sale as mentioned previously of cottonwood west windsor and bridges at mint hill david striph executive vice president of investor relations can you quantify the strategy around asset sales versus buybacks are there price levels that are especially attractive and what valuation would that be based on any other strategies to close the nav gap paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors dave why don t you take that david r o reilly chief financial officer sure and i ll reiterate some of what paul mentioned in his prepared remarks our disciplined capital allocation approach is not going to change in 2020 we re going to use the free cash flow that we generate from our recurring noi our land sales and our mpcs and profits from condominiums and we re going to allocate that capital where we re going to drive the highest risk adjusted returns be that through share buybacks or new development opportunities always making sure that we have ample and appropriate liquidity to finish all of our projects and maintain a well staggered pushed out maturity schedule of our maturing debt david striph executive vice president of investor relations do you anticipate any weakening demand in hawaii condos due to the coronavirus paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you dave it s really too early to know i think the whole world is looking at the coronavirus and trying to understand how it will impact commercial real estate we have diversified supply chain for construction in hawaii following the trump tariffs travel and tourism in hawaii and vegas certainly may be affected we are working from a our company has focused on how we can actually work from home effectively like probably most companies around the world we have had phenomenal sales at victoria place with 20 hard deposits we are unbelievably excited about that and we ll be talking more about that in the next several quarters sales pace could certainly slow but we generally see after it s been record setting david striph executive vice president of investor relations which pillar of the transformation plan do you think hhc will make the most significant progress on over the next quarter paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you i think that s a great question in our transformation plan we ve talked a lot about it in the last four months since it was enacted i think the ability to invest in our master planned communities will be the major pillar the perfect example is our investment in the occidental towers which we now are calling the woodlands waterway towers and the return of a 13 year investment grade lease for 935 000 feet between the office building and the warehouse i think that s a perfect example david striph executive vice president of investor relations what does the timeline look like for ko ula paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors dave you want to take that david r o reilly chief financial officer sure as shown on page 23 of our supplemental we remain on time to deliver that project in 2022 and we commenced construction as you probably remember in the third quarter of 2019 again as paul mentioned with the pace of sales at victoria place we re really excited that ko ula for a tower that s not delivering until 2022 is already over 70 sold david striph executive vice president of investor relations will you please give us an update as to the process of monetizing your non core assets including ballpark timelines where possible paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors sure we are on track and we completely believe that the 2 billion of asset sales netting 600 million is in the next 12 to 18 months exactly as we have projected this from the last four months that we ve been discussing it david striph executive vice president of investor relations as regards the south street seaport what changes if any do you anticipate implementing to the existing strategy and how long will it take to determine if the strategy is working paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you for the question dave the south street seaport with seaport district we are actively working literally every week on improving the plan as i mentioned before we re excited about the food hall that is under construction and if you are going to be in new york we want you to come to one of our concerts one of the 41 concerts that we have planned this spring and summer but the strategy has not shifted since our november plan that s been in place david striph executive vice president of investor relations what were the factors in your decision to change leadership in hawaii paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors the hawaii leadership really was tied to simon treacy deciding that it was his time that he wanted to retire and he spent two years mentoring the staff as a very strong leader and it worked out extremely well simon is a good brand and he did a lot of great things for our company it was time for him to go back to retirement which he had already retired once and doug johnstone is more than ready to run the region he has a great history in hawaii and he has a fantastic team behind him and we couldn t be more excited about the future of our region in hawaii david striph executive vice president of investor relations thanks paul that ends the say technology questions so i m going to turn it over to the operator to open it up for q a thank you operator this first question comes from alexander goldfarb of piper sandler please go ahead alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst hey good morning down there and first david and paul really appreciate the improved transparency certainly in the press release and then in your commentary so definitely helpful so a few questions from us first on the land sales obviously really really strong year in 19 generally you guys tell us to say don t model quarterly just focus on annual but given the outsized pace of 2019 should we be thinking more about a 2018 level or how should we be thinking about 2020 land sales and let s hope that the corona thing settles down so we ll put that aside david r o reilly chief financial officer yeah it s a great question alex and i m happy to talk through it and hopefully after the call you have a chance to go back and take a look at the transcript as well paul gave a little bit of guidance at the end of his prepared remarks regarding the performance for each of the segments and in there we talked a little bit about how the 19 results of mpc ebt hitting the kind of record of 258 million it s something that we think we re going to have a hard time recreating there were a couple of superpads in summerlin that we were able to accelerate to meet the homebuyer and homebuilder demand it s going to be very difficult to do that again so to see on an annual run rate basis to return to a more normalized but still very healthy and successful results of between 180 million and 200 million per year of mpc ebt is a level that we think very comfortable we should be able to achieve alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay thank you david and then the second question is on hawaii obviously the pre sales are just phenomenal just curious on the pricing you guys started out originally with some really high end units and then you quickly switched to more quote unquote workforce affordable units that flew off the shelves victoria place is more going back toward a higher price point so how is the market broadening meaning that there is more appetite for a wider range of price points or is it this particular asset where it s situated in the property that makes it applicable for a higher price point whereas a lot of the other projects that you are planning in the future will be more at the more sort of affordable workforce type price point paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors very good question i think the answer is where the property is first grow second row third row and then whether its workforce housing which is a requirement that we of course will meet but the pricing on a per square foot basis and we d be happy offline to talk to you about that specifically but the first row victoria place we right size the units and it s been extremely popular almost 2 000 a foot but they have sold at record pace so it s really more of where each particular property is located and the pricing related to that alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay and then just finally going back to the seaport appreciate the investor s question you were asked about the cash flow neutrality and you guys obviously said look it s going to take a while but as we think about sort of the drag on earnings and the operating cost of opening restaurants etc david do you think that this year is sort of the biggest year as far as the sort of costs that you have to put upfront because you re opening restaurants or should we think about the next few years are going to have similar outsized costs like this year does because maybe you re opening jean george or opening other different projects where you guys bear the operating impact of that david r o reilly chief financial officer it s a great question alex and it s one that is obviously challenging to answer and give a lot of certainty around but what i can tell you is i do think that 2020 will have meaningful headwinds as those pre opening expenses that flow through the p l and are not capitalized like the traditional real estate development will continue to materialize in our financial statements throughout the year and specifically over the next the first and second quarter will be opening the second floor of david chang s restaurant just after that as paul mentioned mister dips in may and then andrew carmellini s italian chop house will be coming on in july obviously those openings will go through the p l and i think will obfuscate some of the positive results that we ll see from those restaurants that have been open and stabilized like the fulton and malibu farm i do think as paul mentioned one of the keys to getting to cash flow neutrality and one of the really important things that we are focused on all the time is leasing the balance of the office space on the fourth floor of the pier and the third floor of the fulton market building we are casting a very wide net and i would tell you perhaps previously we were very focused on more synergistic tenants and they ve been great like nike and espn but now we are really focused on increasing net cash flow generating positive noi and getting tenants in there as soon as we possibly can that can pay the rent and have the credit to support our growth alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst thank you operator our next question today comes from alex barron of housing research center please go ahead alex barron housing research center analyst yeah thanks hey guys good job in the quarter paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you david r o reilly chief financial officer thank you alex barron housing research center analyst i wanted to ask about your master plan and the land sales right now it seems like the housing market is pretty strong and obviously your pricing reflects that but at the same time it feels like a lot of the strength is coming from builders kind of making a shift toward more affordable housing so are you guys shifting the size of your lots or how are you shifting your strategy to kind of meet that demand for more affordable housing just generally in bridgeland and in summerlin and so forth paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors yeah thank you alex and i always love getting your emails and your reports we are closely monitoring the demand cycles that we see especially in bridgeland and in some cases we have as you probably know minimized our lots size slightly but there is certainly a trend kind of a barbell if you will to shrink the lots somewhat and bring home prices down which increases our volume of lot sales but also we re also seeing a nice push on the upper end with some of the more custom homes both in summerlin and in bridgeland alex barron housing research center analyst okay interesting and in summerlin obviously you guys had a pretty huge sale this quarter about how many lots that that represent and what should we expect for 2020 is it going to be pretty lumpy like toward the end of the year or what paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors well as i mentioned in my prepared remarks summerlin had just a remarkable year last year and we couldn t be prouder of kevin orrock and his team and how they performed in my prepared remarks i did mention that let s don t count on the same accelerated incredible sales pace but we re optimistic that it s going to be another great year dave if you have any comments david r o reilly chief financial officer alex you know the difference obviously between bridgeland and summerlin where we re selling individual lots in bridgeland it tends to be a little bit more even quarter to quarter in terms of results whereas in summerlin when you re selling superpads it can and often has as it was in this year be a little bit more lumpy i would expect that that kind of a bit of quarterly volatility will continue to persist throughout 2020 although as we always say given that volatility you really need to look at our results on an annual basis to best judge how we re performing in that segment of our business alex barron housing research center analyst i understand that it ll be lumpy but i m saying would you expect the overall year to be similar in dollar values or you don t know at this point in time david r o reilly chief financial officer well as we ve said earlier we think the 262 million of revenue and the 257 million of ebt will be tough to replicate this year we are expecting something more in the 180 million to 200 million range more consistent with the previous excellent years that we experienced in 17 and 18 which 18 was a fantastic year if you remember that alex barron housing research center analyst right okay well best of luck for this year thank you paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you alex and our next question today comes from vahid khorsand of bws financial please go ahead vahid khorsand bws financial analyst good morning thanks for taking my question first question in terms of the non core sales you were mentioning that noi was going to go down after the first quarter does that mean you have negotiations under way for non core assets and you expect those to happen in the second quarter or third quarter paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors yes i mean we are actively involved as i mentioned before in our non core asset sales although we have given our guidance of 12 to 18 months that it would take starting four months ago but we are very positive about the actions that we are taking to get these things closed we don t ever want to announce things until they actually close but i think in the next quarter and two quarters you ll be hearing a lot of positive news vahid khorsand bws financial analyst and then when you had mentioned stabilized noi it was about 60 something million dollars without the non core assets are you projecting all of them to be disposed of this year david r o reilly chief financial officer no vahid we re still sticking to that 12 to 18 month time frame in terms of when we re going to be able to execute on the sales just from a full stabilized noi perspective obviously there s going to be the headwinds of those sales that will bring it down to a run rate level just over 300 million as paul mentioned in his remarks earlier vahid khorsand bws financial analyst okay and then my last question is on ward village i know we before you had mentioned how you can t record the sale until you deliver it you re not anticipating moving up development from 2021 to 2020 completion and so booking those sales david r o reilly chief financial officer i would love to think that we could accelerate and shave a year off of our construction time frame we just haven t figured how to do it just yet look we are going to try and deliver these towers on time and on budget and meet the expectations of not just our investors but those buyers of the units as well in ward village and i think the timing that we ve laid out in the supplemental that speaks to it on page 23 is one that we feel very good about being able to deliver on vahid khorsand bws financial analyst so comparatively speaking 2020 condo sales are going to be noticeably lower than 2019 david r o reilly chief financial officer correct we don t have a tower closing this year so from an earnings perspective we wouldn t see anything in the 12 months now we ll see a ali i close in 2021 ko ula in 2022 and if things continue to progress as they have with victoria place we re hopeful they will be adding that onto a project under construction during 2020 that would be a 23 delivery vahid khorsand bws financial analyst perfect thank you very much paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you david r o reilly chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question comes from peter abramowitz of jefferies please go ahead peter abramowitz jefferies analyst hi guys i just had a quick question wanted to dig into that office space of the seaport a little bit more so obviously you guys kind of have it s a very premium office space it s highly amenitized but as far as new york city goes not quite as close to public transportation kind of over there on the east side it s a little more central and west side in lower manhattan so just curious have you seen that effect how kind of some of the tenants or potential tenants you re speaking to does that affect how they kind of evaluate that space relative to other options they might have in lower manhattan paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors it s very good question this is very special office space we have 88 000 feet and in the pier building pier 17 that has the most dramatic views we certainly believe in all of lower manhattan we have strong interest from a number of tenants and as david mentioned earlier we have opened our ideas of who we would accept as a tenant and looking more directly oriented to noi achievement in a rapid fashion david david r o reilly chief financial officer see peter i don t think the distance to fulton street which is just a few blocks away west has had an impact and i would say our proximity to the incredible ferry system that has become a mainstay of public transportation in manhattan has actually been a pretty big benefit and a great tool that we ve used to attract incremental office users to the space so as paul said we think we have great amenities we don t view the distance and public transportation is a hindrance at all and we ve gotten a number of folks as we ve talked about in the past very close and within the couple of yards of the goal line and just haven t been able to get them to sign that lease so we re working with a number of tenants as paul said and we re hopeful that we ll be able to talk about that in the coming quarters with some positive progress peter abramowitz jefferies analyst got it thank you and then just as a reminder i think the majority of the space you re still trying to lease there is at pier 17 how much is that space and then how much from a square footage perspective do you have of office that you re still trying to lease elsewhere at the seaport paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors so at pier 17 we have on the main floor 88 000 feet and then there is approximately 46 000 in the fulton building on the uplands which we are actively working on as well and then there is some partial floor spaces on the pier as well which is a smaller amount of square footage peter abramowitz jefferies analyst okay so overall you re looking at like a 135 000 okay that s it for me thanks paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors great operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to paul layne for any closing remarks paul h layne chief executive officer and member of the board of directors thank you very much for joining us today we look forward to speaking with all of you in the future and that concludes our remarks for today thank you very much operator duration 59 minutes call

voters likely see in sanders someone who speaks convincingly to lost hopes and wants fundamentally to change a system that no longer offers them a credible path forward photo afp for the last 50 years almost every us presidential election has brought a new swing of the national political pendulum richard nixon s shifty administration gave way after gerald ford was in office long enough to pardon his former boss to the choirboy jimmy carter four years later in rode ronald reagan and then following george hw bush s one term interregnum came america s first baby boomer president bill clinton an impeached but brainy philanderer clinton was succeeded by bush s son the moralising and anti intellectual george w bush who then gave way to the spock like barack obama before the pendulum s widening swing extended all the way to the unprecedented fringe of donald trump so is it any wonder that as the democrats muddle through their nominating contest their most extreme candidate is running away with the race after the nevada caucuses us senator bernie sanders has more than just wind at his back he represents exactly the type of partisan reaction to trump that should be expected and he is the latest manifestation of the national political pendulum s steepening arc sanders a lifelong socialist who has never joined the democratic party embodies the opposite of america s 1980s style greed is good incumbent why has the arc of the united states electoral swings become so wide once upon a time successful presidential candidates had to embrace hope and optimism this made sense for the world s wealthiest country was on a more than century long upswing living large in its fevered american dream when leaders deviated from this script in periods of national difficulty think of carter s malaise speech or were blamed for temporary recessions at odds with rising tide expectations bush père the electorate showed them the door then the millennium turned and the american century was laid low by three successive existential body blows the 9 11 terrorist attacks misconceived and inconclusive wars in afghanistan and iraq and the 2008 global financial crisis for more than a decade since the crisis policymakers have tried everything to boost economic growth for nothing lifts more boats and yet debate still rages about what can be done to restore 4 percent annual gdp growth the answer is probably nothing sustainable as extreme tax cuts have shown simply put the us economy grew abnormally fast for the century after the civil war because human life spans almost doubled and productivity soared owing to breakthrough discoveries that rarely come around for example vaccines antibiotics electricity and microchips by contrast despite persistent and ever more extreme unconventional monetary policies since the financial crisis the congressional budget office expects real inflation adjusted gdp growth this decade to average just 2 percent annually this may not be secular stagnation so much as a reversion to mean since 1800 the us economy has grown at roughly the pace the cbo now projects and critically the last decade of ultra loose monetary policy widened wealth inequality so much that many in the middle class fell into the resulting chasm taking flagging faith in the american dream with them and with that faith probably went any hope for a moderate democrat to win the 2020 nomination after all democrats like joe biden pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar talk a lot even with their inevitable shift left like bill clinton and robert rubin avatars of an era that seemed good at the time but today is viewed as the period when jobs were globalised away median incomes stagnated and a new plutocracy was not just born but sponsored by its national leaders demographics like gravity are close to an immutable force as much as the traditional wise men and women of the democratic party try to convince voters that nominating sanders will re elect trump most of the party s youth immigrant and minority blocs the democrats literal future appear to disagree they likely see in sanders someone who speaks convincingly to lost hopes and wants fundamentally to change a system that no longer offers them a credible path forward after all why defend a status quo that leaves you deep in debt tenuously employed badly housed and one medical emergency away from economic ruin ironically this powerful message is similar to trump s appeal to disaffected working class voters to win the republican nomination and the presidency in 2016 elections are uncertain and for all the self serving rhetoric of the democratic establishment and of michael bloomberg s usd 460 million and counting in advertising that nominating sanders would ensure trump s re election there is likely a close to even chance that this consensus thinking is wrong sanders could win a presidential election for any number of reasons the country is almost perfectly divided regardless of candidate swing voters are unpredictable electoral math is tricky trump has plenty of weaknesses and a lot can happen between now and november let s not forget that most political and market forecasters got the 2016 election wrong today as america s national ethos of optimism seemingly gives way to bipartisan disillusionment sanders momentum is both understandable and not to be underestimated alexander friedman a co founder of jackson hole economics is a former chief executive officer of gam investments chief investment officer of ubs chief financial officer of the bill

mario plourde thank you jennifer and good morning everyone we are very pleased with the solid 2019 result that we are presenting to you today our operation generated record annual adjusted ebitda level for the second consecutive year annual adjusted ebitda surpassed the 600 million mark for the first time in cascades history all of our segment executed well in 2019 we are particularly encouraged by the operation improvement in tissue as the point to benefit being built from our ongoing modernization and optimization initiative on a consolidated basis in addition to the above tailwind for our businesses in 2019 include lower raw material and energy prices sales mix and pricing improvement in the recent business acquisition these were partially offset by higher production costs per ton largely due to the greater proportion of sales coming from converting activity and a slightly lower volume q4 sequential results reflected usual softer seasonal demand and less favorable pricing and sales mix in all business segments net earnings for the quarter were a loss of 26 million or 0 27 per share this compared to earnings of 0 42 in q3 and a loss of 0 71 last year on an adjusted basis we generated 0 30 per share in q4 this was stable with the third quarter and above the break even level in the fourth quarter of 2018 again on an adjusted basis ebitda of 162 million increased 35 over last year and decreased 6 when compared to q3 on a consolidated basis our adjusted ebitda margin reached 12 4 in q4 on the raw material side the q4 average index price for occ was down 56 year over year and 9 from q3 for the full year the average occ price was 45 below the 2018 levels white recycled paper grades used in our tissue segment decreased by 53 in q4 year over year and 13 from q3 annually the price for white grade paper decreased 34 from 2018 levels on the virgin pulp side hardwood and softwood pulp prices decreased sequentially and year over year in q4 and were also down for the full year pricing for raw material remain favorable for our operation outlook i will now briefly discuss the sequential fourth quarter performance for each of our business segment highlighted on page 8 to 11 on the presentation the containerboard segment generated q4 adjusted ebitda of 106 million down 10 sequentially and 5 year over year the sequential decrease reflect lower average selling price following the industry decreases announced in 2019 and lower seasonal volume and a slight market softness q4 margin remained very healthy at 23 5 but were down slightly from the 24 9 in q3 and were flat with last year we are pleased with this overall performance given the slight market softness in q4 operating rate was 92 down 2 sequentially with paper shipment to external customer decreasing 8 000 short ton reflecting seasonal trends and timing of the holiday season in 2019 shipments of converted product decreased 1 sequentially in millions of square feet outperforming the 4 decrease in the canadian market and in line with the 1 decrease in the u s market we took 18 000 ton of scheduled maintenance and capex downtime in q4 in line with announced plan slide 8 provides our downtime plan for 2020 we expect to take between 45 000 to 50 000 tons of maintenance capex and all of these on time throughout the year this compared to 61 0000 tons in 2019 moving now to tissue paper this segment posted stronger results both sequentially and compared to last year highlighting the successes we are generating from our turnaround initiative and good operational execution performance benefited from lower raw material prices higher volume more stable transportation costs price increases in all market announced in 2018 and a net positive contribution for orchids fourth quarter ebitda totaled 35 million representing a margin of 9 this was up from 24 million or a margin of 6 in q3 on the volume side shipment increased by 3 year over year this reflects a 4 decrease in external shipment of parent rolls due to higher integration in the closure of two paper machine in toronto which remove 44 000 annually converting shipment increased 5 reflecting higher demand in our work targeted market segment our average selling price increased 4 year over year in the fourth quarter this reflect price increase announced in the second half of 2018 a favorable sales mix and a stronger canadian dollar on a sequential basis the average selling price decreased by 1 largely due to the lower portion of converted product in our sales mix compared to q3 the european boxboard operation generated good q4 result sales decreased 1 compared to last year and were down 5 from q3 sequential result reflected lower seasonal volume partially offset by a slightly higher selling price while year over year performance reflects the reverse the exchange rate impact was negative in both cases the average q4 selling price decreased in both euro and canadian dollar year over year this reflects the higher portion of recycled products sold following the acquisition of barcelona cartonboard price decreased due to market softness in recycled board in a less favorable geographical sales mix the average q4 selling price of recycled boxboard decreased by eur24 year over year while virgin boxboard increased by eur22 on a sequential basis the 5 decrease in sales reflects the decrease in volume related to the usual seasonality in the period adjusted ebitda decreased by 1 million or 4 from q3 levels primarily due the usual seasonality and the energy credit received in q3 year over year ebitda increased by 4 million or 20 as the impact from the lower average selling price was offset by benefits related to lower raw material and energy costs and higher shipment levels largely related to the acquisition of barcelona as for the specialty products please note that the sales and ebitda numbers of our recovery activity has been reclassified and are now reported within the corporate activity segment prior year s numbers have been adjusted to reflect this change fourth quarter sales in the specialty product were 105 down 16 from 123 million in q3 this was largely driven by the divestiture of our activity in france in q3 to a lesser degree lower seasonal volume and industrial and consumer packaging and the less favorable sales mix in the model pulp segment also impacted the top line performance q4 ebitda of 9 million was 7 million below q3 levels this reflected the business divestiture of our operation in france lower overall volumes and higher fixed costs the september 2019 fire at the rockingham model pulp facility also had negative impact result during the quarter we are very satisfied with the performance and the integration of the u s model pulp assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018 this acquisition solidifies our position in the north american market for the year ebitda margin for the specialty product group stood at 11 2 in 2019 compared to 9 2 last year as mentioned before corporate activity now includes the result of our recovery operation the recovery â the recovered paper market remains difficult with quarterly average selling price continuing their decline while these conditions are favorable for other segments the negatively impact the performance of the recovery activities and explain the negative variance versus 2018 we expect occ market to remain favorable for buyers in the coming months due to the excess of material in north america the current low generation season in rubbers demand from domestic mill supported the recent small index adjustment published in february and the market for higher grade as recently experienced tighter condition and is more influenced by export activities there appears to be a consensus in the market the pricing for virgin pulp wood hardwood and softwood as likely it bottom with canadian nbsk producer announcing price correction in the last few months it is terribly difficult to estimate any potential impact on the global market steaming from the recent global event including finland mill strike drought condition in chile and indonesia and coronavirus outbreak in china i will now pass the call to allan who will discuss the main highlights for our financial performance after which i will conclude our presentation allan allan hogg thank you mario and good morning everyone so will begin on slide 15 with an overview of our ppi s our fourth quarter shipments decreased by 22 short â 22 000 short tons or 2 6 from q3 this was driven by decreases of 3 and 5 in containerboard and european boxboard respectively reflecting the usual seasonal demand trends in the last three months of the year shipment levels increased by 4 in tissue with the addition of the orchids activities fourth quarter capacity utilization rate of 90 was stable compared to the prior year and was 4 below third quarter levels for 2019 working capital came in at 10 1 of sales while consolidated return on assets stood at 12 moving now to sales as detailed on slide 16 and 17 on a year over year basis fourth quarter sales increased by 31 million or 3 this reflects the contribution from recent business acquisition in tissue boxboard europe and specialty products and higher sales volume in tissue and specialty products offsetting these benefits were less favorable selling price and sales mix in all business segments with the exception of tissue and lower sales in recovery activities due to both lower recycled material pricing sequentially q4 sales decreased by 37 million or 4 reflecting less favorable selling price and sales volume moving now to operating income and adjusted ebitda as highlighted on slide 18 q4 adjusted ebitda of 152 million increased 39 million from the prior year level results benefited from a stronger performance of the tissue segment that were partially mitigated by lower containerboard and recovery activities results sequentially q4 adjusted ebitda decreased by 9 million this was largely the result of software performances in containerboard and specialty products the effect of which were more than offset by a stronger contribution from tissue papers take note once again that the impact of other ifrs 16 accounting for leases contributed approximately 7 million to ebitda in the quarter and 29 million for the full year please refer to slide 32 for supplemental information slide 20 and 21 illustrate the year over year sequential volumes of our q4 adjusted earnings per share and a reconciliation with the specific items that affected our quarterly results as reported the company reported a loss of 0 27 in the fourth quarter this compared to a reported loss of â per share of 0 31 last year both periods included specific items on an adjusted basis eps increased by 0 30 compared to last year s results higher operating results and lower financing expenses were offset by higher depreciation expenses the change in depreciation reflects the business acquisitions and operational capital projects and the adoption of ifrs 16 standard for leases on an adjusted basis sequential eps of 0 30 were unchanged from q3 levels on slide 22 and 23 we illustrate the specific items that were recorded during the quarter the main items includes 64 million of impairment charge related to certain tissue and boxboard europe assets and to the goodwill in our recovery operations a 10 million loss from the sale of some equipment restructuring costs and other charges following facility closures and the acquisition of markets at 2 million unrealized loss on financial instruments and also were 14 million charge on the repurchase of long term debt related to our refinancing last november fourth quarter adjusted cash flow from operations increased by 18 million year over year to 107 million adjusted free cash flow levels increased by a smaller amount of 1 million year over year this reflects the higher net capex and dividend paid in the current period as well as higher net financing expenses in the fourth quarter of this year due to the refinancing of our unsecured notes in november moving now to our net debt reconciliation as detailed on slide 25 our net debt decreased by 107 million in the quarter reflecting positive sequential cash flow from operations and changes in non cash working capital in addition to a favorable exchange rate i would highlight that net debt does not include the acquisition cost of the case of the pose interests in our as this transaction closed in early january 2020 our net debt leverage ratio stood at 3 25 times at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 3 7 times at the end of q3 and 3 6 times at the end of last year this along with other financial ratios and information about maturities are detailed on slide 26 on slide 27 we provided details about our capital investments for the full year on a segment by segment basis our annual capex plan for 2020 will be approximately 250 million based on current conditions we are forecasting our annual sorry â our annual 2020 cash flows to exceed our capital expenditure requirements by over 100 million these funds will go towards debt repayment and about in projects once it is approved and finalized i will now pass the call back to mario who will wrap up the call with a brief conclusion before we begin the question period mario mario plourde thank you allan in summary we are pleased with our solid fourth quarter performance and with our record annual performance in 2019 on the strategic side we announced that we were exercising our option to purchase the case that they put 20 2 interest in our greenpac mill in mid december the transaction closed in january 3 2020 and our ownership in this facility now stands at 86 3 this strategic decision will improve our available cash flow levels and tissue we continue to advance the integration of the orchid activity in q4 and completed the conversion of the barnwell paper machine from qrt to conventional paper in mid january 2020 the machine is running very well and trending above our expectations on the slide 29 we provided an update on the integration which is going according to plan we continue to finalize plan for the bear island project and as such we do not add any update to provide at this time once the analysis and necessary steps have been completed and the project is approved we will provide the market with an update finally we successfully refinanced our senior note in november taking advantage of favorable market pricing condition and proactively managed our debt profile moving back to operation we can find our near term outlook for our business segment on slide 30 of our presentation sequentially we expect q1 performance in both tissue and containerboard to decrease slightly specialty product and boxboard europe are forecast to generate slightly higher result and all of our business segments are expected to generate stable year over year result with the exception of tissue which should benefit from recent tailwind our annual operation outlook is positive for 2020 we believe we are well positioned to deliver strong ebitda in 2020 primarily due to an expected positive contribution from the tissue segment looking ahead we will continue to monitor the potential impact of micro factor which may impact our outlook and as allan mentioned based on our current interpretation of the market condition we expect to both fund our capex plan with available cash flow and have an excess of 100 million to be allocated to our bear island conversion project and to reduce debt we will now be happy to answer all your questions operator question and answer session operator your first question comes from the line of hamir patel of cibc capital markets please go ahead your line is open hamir patel hi good morning mario plourde good morning hamir patel mario could you give us a sense as to how the coronavirus in italy how that might be affecting reynolds operation so far mario plourde so far it has not affected the plant so our plants are running with the exception of where we have another issue at the mills in terms of administration the office in milan shut down so we ask all our employees to work from home but we continue to do business you know plants are operating as usual so we re monitoring the situation quite closely but other than that we have nothing to present or to tell hamir patel okay thanks thatâ s helpful and just on bear island i know there s not much you can say but do you have a sense as to when you would expect to come to a decision mario plourde we hope let s say between the next two quarter hamir patel okay so should we assume then that the timing of the project if it does come on has then also been delayed and realistically if you do go forward then what does that suggest as the earliest that the machine would come up charles malo we still are planning to this is charles malo hamir we are still working on this project and this is for us long term this is a big big project for cascade we understand also all the market dynamics and so we want to make sure that we do it right and as mario mentioned when we have a bit more information we will be able to provide that for the group for the time being we still have access to the side so we re still using the time to clean up and to do all of this so our goal and to do all of this so our goal as we speak today with the time frame and timeline that now you talked about the goal would be to start in the first or second quarter of 2022 hamir patel okay great thanks charles and just another question i had on containerboard these new pulp paper week recycle benchmarks have been around now for a couple of months as you re box contracts renewals have played out with have you started to see customers want to switch the underlying index to away from kraftliner mario plourde i m not going to be as you know this a sensitive so i m not going to disclose how we vary our customerâ s prices with our contract but one thing i can mention is that the index is there so it s used to make price variation so the index is pretty new right now so the customer will have to look at what it does really so as we speak right now if a customer wants to have or use this mechanism we are open to look at both the options so but at this point it s too soon to give what would be a trend in the market or what customers would like to use as a mechanism hamir patel okay fair enough and just the final one from me for jean david in tissue with the barnwell qrt i mean you ve converted to conventional is the expectation down the line that you could run that on the higher grades and what s the thinking as to the flexibility of how you as that ramps up how you maybe move that up the quality curve jean jean david tardif yes we expect to continue to produce qrt so we will swing the machine back to qrt for a certain period of time in march so we already have good customer for the qrt products so the goal is to be able to get as many done as possible from that machine while working with strategic customer so that s why we are in need of conventional parent rolls so we re getting those roles as we speak from conventional and the machine is running well it s a nice well equipped machine so it s producing good quality product so eventually as the market will evolve and we will evolve with our customers we will be able to maximize the portfolio and get the most out of it either in qrt or in conventional hamir patel and where do you think the qrt sits in the quality spectrum when we think about tad and ntt and conventional jean david tardif it s difficult i would say it s pretty close to tad but it s not that tad so it s something similar with atmos we ve got the same same story or same experience with the hybrid technology where it doesn t match 100 a national brand but with certain specific customer we believe that there is there is a good opportunity especially on the sustainable product sites so qrt can develop really high quality product based on 100 recycled material which tad cannot so we believe there is a niche market for sustainable product with the qrt being really close to tad but with the more eco friendly materials hamir patel okay great thanks thatâ s all i had all iâ ll turn it over operator your next question comes from the line of sean stewart of td securities your line is open sean stewart thanks good morning a couple of questions i want to dig a bit more into the tissue results this quarter which were quite strong relative to our expectations and when you reported your q3 results in november there was a suggestion that you expected that point sequential pressure on tissue ebitda and i guess some of that variance is ongoing fiber cost relief through the quarter but i m wondering if you could give a little bit more context on what surprised you to the upside through the remainder of q4 and how those trends might be continuing into 2020 allan hogg alright sean that one is good so we ve got great results fruits from our oregon facilities you know last year 2018 that was really difficult for us until early 2019 but with good operational excellence there i think we ve been able to turn around that facility so we ve got a good positive contribution from oregon facilities in q4 which was not the case in q3 so it s going in the right direction we also got some positive contribution from the run that as you said from freight and orchids was also better than expected on q4 sean stewart okay thanks for that and maybe you can answer this maybe not but if bear island is approved at some point over the first half of the year how much capex this year could you envision adding on to the the guidance you ve given of 250 million ex bear island mario plourde sean honestly speaking it depends also how we structure this project so depending on the if we do a similar structure in greenpac obviously it may just be equity investment if not it will be on the full balance sheet so this is still to be decided and structure so it s difficult for us to answer but the total project you know we know it s a big amount over the next 24 months so that s what we can say at this time sean stewart okay and then last question for me you guys are not planning any market downtime and containerboard for 2020 and should i view that as recycled fiber costs are low enough that even if prices weaken and they are a little wobbly to start the year your margins are strong enough that you don t envision having to take downtime or is this something you ll play by ear quarter to quarter and can maybe as the year progresses charles malo this is charles the way that we see with the customer base that we have also the gv that we have and we do our forecasting we don t see any market trends or anything like that would tell us that market downtime would have to be made and we also have with the greenpac all the products that we are producing right now are well in demand so it s still a high value product low basis weight so we foresee that we re going to be able to compete and not have to take any downtime as we speak sean stewart okay thanks very much thatâ s all i have operator your next question comes from the line of paul quinn of rbc capital markets your line is open paul quinn yes thank you very much and just on containerboard and just your outlook for input prices on occ and pulp on the tissue side as well mario plourde this is to look back and i speak for that one more recently on the occ price we have seen over the last few weeks slightly tighter market but we need to understand that we are in the lower generation season and as i mentioned as charles just mentioned the demand the domestic demand is quite robust for the beginning of the year so this condition created i would say for a temporary tighter market conditions but we expect that with the generation of fibers that will start to increase again by the end of march that we will get back to a favorable market for occ for buyers with regards to the raw material on the tissue side it s very difficult to predict for the moment we all know that the price are quite low you we ve have seen the decrease over last year which are significant on both the virgin fibers and the white recycle right rates so on the softwood there has been an attempt to increase price obviously a few circumstances has helped this strike as mario mentioned that the strike in finland some fiber shortage in bc some drought conditions in south america and the closure of the fixed mill in nova scotia but this being said we have no challenge now getting supply with both hardwood and softwood so we are following this very closely we are also monitoring the situation in china with the coronavirus and how this will be impacting the global demand but for the time being we don t see any significant price increase in the market on both sides but again there are so many variables going on especially on the white grade and the virgin pulp that would be prudent for the long term paul quinn i guess maybe just on european boxboard you guys described it as slight market softness i m just wondering if that carry through 2020 i mean it looks like it s tightening up on the containerboard side and the number of people are expecting a price increase there just wondering whether that will move over to boxboard side allan hogg we think so with the beginning of the year the improvement in terms of recycle grade so the year end up being softer but the beginning of the year surprises in terms of order inflow and backlog both on virgin and recycled so we think it could move up there and we could see a good 2020 in europe as well paul quinn thanks for the extra color on but overall and orchids acquisition what are the main takeaways so far that you ve seen on especially on the integrations allan hogg it s positive it s going according to the plan that we made last year i think that we have positive response from the employees people are really engaged in achieving the plans with us so it s great to see this we don t have many surprises other than maintenance i would say for sure equipments were not well maintained over the last few years so this is mainly our issue right now but all in all it s great paul quinn okay and then just lastly on capex you guided that 250 let s say 45 million coming on the corporate side what is that for allan hogg there is a it and also there is a recycling activities there now that we present the refurbishing order maintenance capex in recovery paul quinn okay thatâ s all i have allan hogg and so and evaluate other services that we need to ask some transportation is in the corporate activities so few trucks it and our recovery operation that we are operating paul quinn great thatâ s all i have thanks allan hogg thanks paul operator your next question comes from the line of zachary evershed of national bank financial please go ahead your line is open zachary evershed good morning everyone congrats on the quarter allan hogg thank you zachary evershed so following the reclassification of the recovery segment is it fair to expect a lot more volatility in your corporate ebitda allan hogg for sure that for that portion as it was in specialty in the past yes it will now be in corporate but it s really bought them right now so we can expect that it will go higher but with the price being so low so yes volatility will be there for now yes zachary evershed thanks for that and with the remaining industrial packaging sub segment in specialty products can you give us an idea of what the seasonality is like for that allan hogg well typically our best quarter for our business has always been the q2 and q3 so this will not change but we do expect to a better q1 as we expected we ve been impacted last quarter by a fire in our model pulp which obviously impacted us in both on our fixed costs and on the amendments costs so it s not going to be different than it has been in the previous year so we should see better results for the next two to three quarters zachary evershed thanks that s helpful any update on the boxboard europe mill in villa santa lucia allan hogg we have no other news you probably saw the communication in europe so we are down now because of the subcontractor not being able to service us with the water treatment so we re waiting for our call on the judge to reopen so timing now for us would be probably another week but we don t know you know it s we have to follow the legal system and we are anxiously looking at it and hopefully we can restart the mill quite rapidly because this mill is a good mill for us but my guess is it fair to say that we are redeploying some volume side of the mills and yeah to a certain degree to a certain degree we are we have the capacity now to move that down to other mills but obviously we want this mill to go back in operation as soon as possible zachary evershed understood and then last one from me in terms of your capex budgets for the various segments are you able to further break that down into what is maintenance and what is efficiency improvements or perhaps capacity additions mario plourde well we always said in the past that minimum maintenance was in the 70 million range so we ll leave it at this but for sure the difference is always cost improvement and replacement and modernization with quick payback so that always has been our objective but you see that the biggest chunk of our capex is in tissue to finish what has been started the last two years and the modernization of the converting side of our tissue business so that s business so that s where we are it s according to our plan we were under we undertook in tissue the last few years yes zachary evershed and so fair to say that in that 250 million budget there is no real capacity increases allan hogg in terms of paper mills no it s mainly on the converting side zachary evershed okay thanks so much i ll turn it over operator there are no further questions at this time mr plourde please go ahead mario plourde thank you everyone for being on the call this quarter and we are looking forward to see you on the next quarter have a good day thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect

5 8 per year during obama s last two years in office before slowing to 2 7 from during trump s first two years in office according to a new analysis by the progressive think tank economic policy institute epi and investigative news outlet capital main the income data were adjusted for inflation all but two states saw real wages fall during that time period despite what we heard at the state of the union the truth is that this economy is not performing well for most americans said epi president thea lee at this point in the business cycle wage and income growth for working households should be accelerating not slowing the analysis based on the latest census data showed that nine of the 10 states where trump beat hillary clinton by less than four percentage points saw real wage growth decline and red states like alaska west virginia south dakota and wyoming also saw significant declines as well by comparison just one state saw its real wage growth decline during obama s last two years in office the only states that saw inflation adjusted wage growth increase during trump s first two years were arizona and louisiana though presidents often claim too much credit and take too much blame for economic performance senior epi analyst david cooper said obama saw higher wage growth as a result of a prolonged low rate of inflation but economists also said trump squandered opportunities to implement policies that would spur wage growth an infrastructure bill would clearly have a marked impact especially on middle level jobs mark muro a senior fellow at the brookings institute s metropolitan policy project told capital main manufacturing is going in the wrong direction i think there are all kinds of policy opportunities that have not been exploited muro added that the ongoing manufacturing recession the ongoing trade war and the coronavirus could result in additional economic fallout in 2020 lee added that the 2017 tax cuts and trump s deregulatory moves have also hurt the middle class the current administration s focus on cutting taxes for the wealthy expanding tax incentives for outsourcing and undercutting workers rights has left ordinary working households in most states barely gaining ground she said the report noted that trump frequently cites a disputed study from heritage foundation fellow stephen moore an adviser to trump who was briefly nominated to a federal reserve position before withdrawing from consideration to claim that wage growth has increased under his presidency but that data included fallout from the 2007 08 recession and used data from a private firm rather than the larger census data the time periods are especially misleading wrote washington post fact checker glenn kessler adding that the official census numbers do not show nearly this kind of gain under trump epi data also suggests that the wage trend did not improve in 2019 real median hourly wages grew just 1 percent during 2019 and in 24 states the median hourly wage grew 1 percent or less capital main reported stagnant median wage growth also plagued the obama recovery real hourly wage growth for the typical worker remained under 2 percent even in the final years of his presidency by contrast median hourly wages grew at a rate of 2 7 percent annually during the tight labor market of the late 1990s cooper who led the epi study blamed lower unionization rates the gutting of public safety net programs and trump s trade war as factors behind the slowed growth employers have greater leverage to hold down wages now than they did during previous periods he explained other researchers agreed daniel alpert a founding partner of westwood capital llc told capital main that the rate of high quality jobs was higher under obama than it has been under trump at least under obama we saw some improvement in job quality he said as a result of the funding of infrastructure and other things that can actually create high quality employment a wide ranging annual study published by epi earlier this month also showed that wage growth under trump has particularly favored the highest paid workers the biggest rewards from a strong economy are still skewed toward white people men and high earners bloomberg news reported despite some improvements in the economy the wage gap between white and black workers is now worse than it was in 2000 according to the data though local minimum wage increases have helped deliver at least some gains for lower income workers pay increased at twice the rate for the lowest income workers in states that increased the minimum wage over the last seven years compared to those that did not growth rates for the top earners continue to dwarf those for everyone else the top 5 of male earners saw a 37 wage increase since 2000 compared to a 3 4 median wage increase for the overall population it s no wonder then that the number of striking workers suddenly surged under trump after decades of decline in strikes indeed the number of striking workers surged in 2018 to a nearly twentyfold increase from 2017 according to epi data based on numbers from the bureau of labor statistics strike activity surged in 2018 with 485 200 workers involved in major work stoppages the report said the surge in strike activity continued in 2019 with 425 500 workers involved in major work stoppages the trend was fueled by teacher strikes in states like kentucky west virginia and north carolina and cities like los angeles and chicago as well as unionized workers at companies like at t general motors and stop shop the data did not include walkouts like the google worker protest of the company s handling of sexual harassment because those kinds of walkouts constituted less than one full work shift even though we are 10 years into an economic recovery and the unemployment rate is under 4 working people are still not seeing the kinds of robust wage growth that those at the top have seen for decades said senior epi economist heidi shierholz the increase in strike numbers shows that workers understand that joining together in collective action remains an effective way to raise wages and benefits and improve working conditions despite the dour forecasts it is certainly good news that low income workers are finally seeing their pay rise however that has little to do with trump or the federal government according to a study by the national employment law project nelp which showed low income workers wages were buoyed by local minimum wage increases states that did not raise the minimum wage saw stagnant rates many of those increases were sparked by strikes like the 2012 walkout by fast food employees and other workers the big increase in low wage workers pay nelp policy analyst irene tung told usa today is largely the result of the fight by low paid workers to raise the minimum wage across the country

over to mark brewer director of investor relations please go ahead mark brewer director of investor relations thank you gary good morning and thank you for taking the time to join our conference call with me this morning are joe gatto president and chief executive officer dr jeff balmer chief operating officer and jim ulm our chief financial officer during our prepared remarks we ll be referencing the earnings results presentation we posted yesterday afternoon to our website so i encourage everyone to download the presentation if you haven t already you can find the slides on our events and presentations page located within the investors section of our website at www callon com before we begin i d like to remind everyone to review our cautionary statements disclaimers and important disclosures included on slide 2 of today s presentation we will make some forward looking statements during today s call that refer to estimates and plans 10 stocks we like better than callon petroleum when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and callon petroleum wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 1 2019 actual results could differ materially due to the factors noted on these slides and in our periodic sec filings we ll also refer to some non gaap financial measures today which we believe help facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers for any non gaap measures we reference we provide a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding gaap measure you may find these reconciliations in the appendix to the presentation slides and in the earnings press release both of which are available on our website following prepared remarks today we will open the call for q a at this point i d like to turn the call over to joe gatto joe gatto president and chief executive officer thanks mark and as always we appreciate everyone joining us today yesterday afternoon we released our fourth quarter and full year results which highlighted the operational efficiency of our fourth quarter activity and continued focus on driving down our cost structure to create consistent value through commodity volatility as we discussed with the announcement of the transaction and now with formal 2020 guidance the acquisition of carrizo and integration of our development programs improves our capital efficiency lowers cash breakevens and provides more flexibility in capital allocation as a result we ve accelerated our time line to sustainable free cash flow building upon our established trajectory into the end of 2019 our integration efforts began on day one after the announcement of the combination have proven fruitful as we have captured savings in both operations and g a early in the year positioning us to be well above our previously stated targets for 2020 the structural changes in how we operate and develop our assets will create durable savings that support our growing free cash flow profile advance our absolute debt reduction and corporate return goals starting on slide 3 we had a very strong close to the year with stand alone full year production at the high end of increased guidance for the year and total 2019 stand alone capex of 501 million coming in at the bottom end of our guidance which was lowered earlier in the year in addition stand alone loe came in just above 5 50 per boe in the quarter representing a decrease of 15 from the first quarter at year end we held over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent proved reserves with a pv 10 value of 5 4 billion that compares to our current enterprise value of 4 4 billion based on average trading prices for february our 2020 capital budget has been set at 975 million which is well below previously communicated expectations and is a testament to the team s ability to identify opportunities to maximize operational and cost efficiencies and integrate our development plans into a more efficient scaled model ahead of schedule callon s program is forecasted to deliver 100 million of free cash flow at 55 per barrel from average daily production of over 115 000 boe per day supported by our leading cash margins you ll note that we are providing these figures on a three stream basis which is a new standard for callon and a significant accomplishment that our finance and accounting team was able to deliver in a very short amount of time hats off to jim greg and their respective teams for bringing that to fruition so early in the year flipping to slide 4 these four priorities were outlined over a year ago and have been advanced through our execution in the permian and furthered by the carrizo transaction to begin our return on capital invested is expected to meaningfully increase in 2020 with our new model of scale development driving synergy realizations and positioning callon with top industry performers a step change in free cash flow generation as our corporate breakeven cost of supply moves below 50 per barrel an improved trajectory for gain free leveraging from both absolute debt reduction and credit metric gains it will be complemented by asset monetizations that are in process and a consistent long term view for development of a substantial multi zone resource base of the combined company that can be now efficiently codeveloped as part of a larger entity improving near term returns while preserving longer term value our ongoing philosophy of blending near term returns and longer term value is a reflection of the responsible and proactive mindset ingrained in callon s culture before we jump into the 2020 outlook slide 5 provides a visual history of our growth in the permian it has been driven by strong execution and a demonstrated ability to consistently deliver value from acquisitions on the top of the page we ve highlighted the consistency of our margins and cost management through commodity cycles which has differentiated us from our peers with a strong track record we entered 2020 carrying a high level of confidence and our ability to meet and exceed our prior synergy targets as we identify additional areas for improvement throughout the organization and across all functions we now stand with the permian acreage position of almost 120 000 net acres and forecasted total production between 115 000 and 120 000 boe per day in the upcoming year the next page summarizes where we are today a self funded high margin oil growth company callon s high quality portfolio of assets can now be optimized through a balance of capital intensity cycle times and returns to unlock a substantial permian value proposition through thoughtful capital allocation and a consistent model for life of field development so let s move to the tactical elements of 2020 plan on slide 7 we entered the year with a drilled uncompleted inventory of over 60 wells as both companies reduced completion activity in the fourth quarter to prepare for larger projects we were able to take advantage of this dynamic and integrate our combined plan sooner than anticipated since there was a relatively less independent callon and carrizo activity in motion during the fourth quarter also allowing us to accelerate our dc e synergies and immediately move to larger projects we re off to a strong start in the deployment of the integrated larger scale development model with over 20 wells placed on production in the last half of february from a 16 well project in the eagle ford in a five well co development in the delaware after initiating completion operations on both projects in early january we are now building momentum in the delaware as we approach the second quarter the resulting impact will be strong double digit sequential growth in the second quarter which will carry through to the balance of the year as we move to more of a steady state of activity 2020 will also incorporate our collective learnings from selective spacing tests in both the midland and delaware basins with tailored up spacing in areas with previous development that jeff will elaborate on here shortly while we are focused on the tactics for just one discrete year on this page it represents the important initial step in executing our longer term development strategy one characterized by reduced rates of reinvestment to deliver growing free cash flow that will be sustained by thoughtful capital allocation and economies of scale let me be clear here our goal has been and will continue to be to maintain a long term strategy to sustainably generate free cash flow while preserving our inventory value we will continue to avoid the pitfalls of underinvestment in a high return resource base slide 8 summarizes the key operational and financial components of our 2020 outlook as a reminder all these data points are presented on a three stream basis and we ve also provided some comparative data in the appendix to put 2019 results on a comparable basis the collective teams worked hard to provide substantial reconciliation disclosure in the appendix as we understand the importance of transparency and communicating our achievements and forecasts to that end we are forecasting approximately 7 comparable annual oil growth at the midpoint after adjusting for the ranger divestiture on a capital budget that is was down approximately 10 from 2019 pro forma combined levels as highlighted in the top left hand chart our capital efficiency for barrels of oil production added for 1 million of investment increases by an impressive 70 including adjustments for our 2018 southern delaware bolt on and 2019 southern midland divestiture this outlook incorporates our updated estimates for operational capital and corporate cost synergies which compare favorably to our previous targets with year one operational capital synergies of over 45 million and g a savings of over 35 million for a combined 80 million versus initial estimates prior to closing of 60 million to 65 million which represents an increase of over 25 at this point i d like to hand the call over to our coo jeff balmer who will kick off with some more detail on our 2020 program jeff balmer chief operating officer great thanks joe slide 9 highlights some of the more important elements of our capital program for 2020 we ve set a capital budget for the year of 975 million and much like last year we will stick firmly to that number as joe just mentioned we re running nine rigs and four completion crews to kick start the integrated development plan and for the full year we expect to average between eight to nine rigs with three dedicated completion crews we re expecting production to ramp up quickly through the second quarter with an increasing number of larger projects placed online driving an estimated 45 of our total production in the first half of the year our average project size will double relative to last year and is an important component of our strategy to drive efficiencies and optimize our resource capture as our development model matures through this year the inventory of drilled uncompleted wells completed early this year will be replenished with an increased weighting to the permian basin providing flexibility and increasing our permian activity into 2021 here on slide 10 we ve put together an example of some of the critical elements of our plans to maximize the productivity and preserve value through our multizone co development program we ve talked extensively about the need to pair certain zones together to recover resource efficiently and reduce future development issues and that s something we ll continue to focus on this year after continuing to study well performance across the portfolio we re up spacing in certain areas and employing some customized spacing to reduce unnecessary communication and avoid overcapitalizing projects across the assets another important element that we are continuing to watch carefully is the timing element of our program we are keenly aware that allowing for too much time between completions can alter their recoverability in certain zones and ultimately result in less productive wells our program has accounted for this and seeks to manage that timing in the future in addition drilling more parent wells and larger project designs will structurally mitigate this consideration to a large extent so the implications of managing all these factors combined together is really fourfold first the obvious one is to reduce our well costs through co development the second is the compressed cycle times benefit us economically and it also allows our crews to be more efficient thirdly better planning and consolidation of activity reduces the offset impact to historical production both from a reach and timing perspective and finally fourth improved development timing can reduce the risk of poor well performance by managing the relationship between parent and child wells on the next slide slide 11 we have a clear picture of the benefits from a capital program that utilizes simultaneous operations or sim ops consistently throughout the delaware in the upper left hand portion of the slide we touch on some of the identified structural savings that became very durable in a program like this and drive significant capital reduction over time in the chart on the right we ve broken out the elements of what s helping to lower our delaware well costs significantly year over year our realized cost savings from deflationary pressures combined with drilling and completion efficiencies that we captured over the course of 2019 produced over 150 per lateral foot of savings entering 2020 which gave us the starting point for our synergy scorecard if you pair that with the synergy capture value that we have going forward it adds significant value above what we estimated earlier last year and you re rapidly getting down to some of the lowest cost per foot estimates for multi zone development in this portion of the delaware basin moving to slide 12 the benefits that we ve outlined are present across our entire asset base and you can see this in the year over year cost improvements going back to 2018 the delaware has witnessed the most dramatic changes but that s somewhat related to the maturity of our operations in that area and the learning curve impacts in addition to our synergies but looking across the board we ve continued to drive down costs in the more mature areas such as the eagle ford with an 8 increase from 2019 which further enhances the strong returns from this program which has also benefited from the impact of larger scale concepts over the recent quarters still we are confident that there are additional gains to be made better availability of local sand in that area moving forward should help and projects that are seeing additional timing benefits from an efficiency standpoint as project sizes continue to grow in the midland basin we continue to capture and swap for acreage in the howard county area and have been able to extend laterals across this asset leading to lower well costs in addition changes to our completion design have allowed for productivity enhancements while simultaneously lowering completion costs we also expect to see a slightly higher mix of activity in the howard county area as opposed to midland county this year as compared to 2019 at this point i m going to turn the call over to jim ulm our cfo jim ulm chief financial officer thanks jeff on slide 13 you can see one of the critical elements of the carrizo combination is the ability to drive meaningful free cash flow generation with a lower marginal cost of supply you can see in the chart on the left we forecast approximately 50 million of free cash flow at 50 a barrel with significant leverage to oil prices at 55 per barrel and above to drive additional cash for debt repayment with regard to our contingent payments and receipts 2020 marks the final year on an accrual basis that we may incur potential payments to third parties and this is limited to 25 million we also have exposure to potential receipts if oil is above 60 per barrel in 20 and 21 slide 14 shows that the business model we have built at callon is predicated on using our operational expertise to drive strong margins from oily acreage and creating a trajectory of improving corporate level return you can see how we compare across the board on these critical areas against our peers in the lower chart we continue to screen as the leader among the group and ebitda margins we generate and we sit very favorably from a capital efficiency standpoint something we would expect to continue to improve as our development program matures managing the risk with what have proven to be volatile commodity prices is paramount to protect our cash flow and our ability to meet the goals joe discussed earlier we have continued to focus not only on diversifying our physical markets but in tailoring our hedging program to protect our oil prices at these various points with over 70 of our first quarter oil volumes and 60 of the full year volumes hedged at a floor of 55 a barrel we feel very good about generating the level of cash flow and the types of returns that will advance our corporate goals while gas accounts for a very small portion of our revenue we have taken measures to protect realization in that area as well focusing most recently on waha basis swaps on slide 16 over the course of the past year we have taken numerous steps to bolster our financial position and optimize the value of our portfolio of assets we were able to monetize over 300 million in non core assets last year and we are actively progressing efforts to generate another 300 million to 400 million this year between non core asset sales and infrastructure monetizations we ve also talked a great deal about the benefits of our combination last year from a credit enhancement and liquidity standpoint with our new 2 5 billion credit facility in place we have ample liquidity especially with a program that is projected to generate free cash flow at 50 a barrel in addition upgrades by s p and moody s have placed us in a better position to opportunistically access the debt capital markets and further reduce our cost of financing as we have no maturities over the next three years we can be strategic and take advantage of market conditions to pursue these actions most importantly we are actively pursuing an overall reduction in our outstanding debt and targeting a near term debt metric of two times net debt to ebitda by year end 2020 at this point i would like to turn the call back over to joe joe gatto president and chief executive officer thanks jim and jeff some very helpful commentary there i ll pick back up on page 17 corporate sustainability is critical to our ability to compete among our industry peers and for investor interest across industries we ve incorporated this thinking into our operating approach as we have grown as a company over the last several years spanning from areas such as deep saltwater disposal wells water recycling electrification projects and significant reductions in flaring we are also very proud of our achievements in fostering a safe work environment for our employees and vendors as evidenced by steady improvements in our reportable incident rate over the last two years culminating with the 2019 rate at the top end of the industry in addition as managers of the business and stewards of investor capital we must hold ourselves responsible for achieving positive outcomes that translate into shareholder returns we ve been proactive in evolving our short term compensation metrics with the maturation of our business and introduce cash return on capital invested as one of the most highly weighted components last year in addition we recently added a tsr modifier for our long term incentive program that reduces performance payouts if annualized tsr is below 5 and pays out at achieved performance levels if absolute performance is in the range of 5 to 10 let me wrap up on page 18 with a quick glance at what we ve accomplished in just a few short years callon has evolved from a prudent acquirer of top tier acreage positions to a capital efficient operator that can effectively turn those top tier assets and sustainable cash flow competitive corporate level returns and per share growth across all key operational and financial metrics while we are all proud of the team s operational performance and track record of integrating several impactful acquisitions we remain focused on raising the bar of how we judge execution excellence to ensure continued differentiated performance for all of our stakeholders we are off to a great start on our integration efforts combining our operations into a singular development program to accelerate synergy value capture and importantly bringing together two organizations with united focus of delivering results in a safe and sustainable manner and to all of our employees on the call i would like to once again express my deep appreciation to the entire callon team for all of their hard work to achieve so much over the last two months since closing the transaction i m very excited to see what we can achieve together in 2020 and beyond on that note operator will you please open the line for questions questions answers operator our first question is from william thompson with barclays please go ahead william thompson barclays analyst hey god morning joe or jeff the slide deck mentioned expectations for a smoother production profile in 2021 i m just curious if the long term target is still 10 production growth with the eagle ford held flat more or less flat at maintenance capex just help us understand how we can transition from the steep ramp through 2020 into 2021 joe gatto president and chief executive officer yes we ve talked about obviously with the acquisition over the next couple of years a 10 type of headline growth rate yes in 2020 we are ramping up relatively quickly we did make the decision we could have put some single and two well pads on earlier in the year to push production growth but we obviously made the decision to do that in the most capital efficient manner right with larger scale developments we do have a bit of a ramp but what we ve talked about here over time is to get into a more ratable cadence of growth as we get to repeatable utilization of crews and deployment of frac crews and drilling rigs so that will produce an outcome of obviously free cash flow growth and production growth over a longer period of time and we are reducing our reinvestment rate in the business offsetting that and delivering production growth are going to be a function of a couple of things right it s going to be well productivity continued capital efficiencies and moderating decline curves now over time we can only push the limit so far on that so i would say in the longer term you will see overall production growth rates moderate a bit but that will be with growing free cash flow generation william thompson barclays analyst and i think the deck also mentioned about 35 base decline on a boe basis from january to january just understanding in terms of choke management and co development we ve heard some of your peers talk about slower production ramps or obviously shallower base declines i m just thinking about in terms of how the implications could impact the production profile for the next two years jeff balmer chief operating officer yes the whole system is integrated together so the way that we are putting wells online and going through our choke management process of course it s captured in the full year 2020 production profile and how it grows specifically to the wells that will be put online this year we have incorporated some modifications to the way that we flow them back and that whether we call it slow back or pressure management or choke management essentially it means that some of the initial ips that potentially have been seen throughout the industry we are generally going to avoid those because we see the longer term benefits of the wells are maximized basically about 180 days the cumulative production at 180 days a well that you take your time flowing it back the cumulative production at 180 days will be greater for a well that you take your time on a slow back versus a well that you open it wide open and allow it to maximize its production in the short term unfortunately you would sacrifice the longer term production by doing that so the whole system is integrated with all these different components to it but we are comfortable that we have the right flowback strategy in place william thompson barclays analyst good thank you very much operator the next question is from brian downey with citigroup please go ahead brian downey citi analyst morning thanks for taking the questions first perhaps i ll start with a higher level question for jeff so from slide 10 it s clear that you ve been thoughtful about the co development and parent child questions that are facing the industry i m curious given that you ve been in your role at callon for a little over a year now if you have any key observations from development data you ve seen in 2019 when you came out with the landing zone co development strategy you laid out there on the slide 20 were there any specific surprises compared to your prior expectations on either the zone mix or configuration of those wells jeff balmer chief operating officer yes that s a great question and this is probably one of my favorite slides i ve ever seen in an investor deck because it does really represent a lot of technical detail simplified into kind of a common sense thoughtful approach which i m very encouraged that when i landed with callon we had already established that as a focus area and then with the carrizo integration it was very similar in that there was not a lot of degradation of the quality of the inventory due to mistakes that have been made by trying to drill unbounded home run wells and sometimes you have to drill those two to retain acreage in those items so certainly everybody has those the discovery and the combination of the data when we looked at some of the information that was available now through the combined companies really gave us a tremendous amount of insights and accelerated our learnings on all of the components that come into play within the development system such as the distance between the wells both vertically and horizontally the timing aspects of how long the well has been on production or how much voidage has occurred to that system and how much of a detrimental effect will be realized when you put a well next door to it and then also there are some geological and geophysical properties that we were able to combine and take a look at that suggested some things that we weren t aware of such as potential frac barriers which might allow you to come back at a later time and drill more child wells that may not have such a negative implication if they re in completely different drainage systems so while the overall analysis remains kind of the same in the industry standards of it s better to get it all at once from a co development you don t want to wait too much have too much time before you come in and drill your child wells that s certainly something that i m 100 in agreement with the way that we re going about the program development out here is very thoughtful and we have a great inventory in hand to continue that for many many years brian downey citi analyst great i appreciate that and then joe you d mentioned the multiple asset monetization options to continue to progress could you just give us a reminder of where those currently stand both on the non core properties and then any updated thoughts around potential structure for the water infrastructure assets joe gatto president and chief executive officer sure some of these have been in process going back to last year a few we kicked off earlier this year so we have several things in various stages of progress as it relates to the water midstream as we ve talked about we re very much looking at that as a joint venture type of a partnership we re not looking to full fully monetize that and turn over the keys it s a critical asset for us and we re not looking for a sale leaseback that we monetize that asset and take back higher loe we are looking for more of a strategic partnership and we ve had some great dialogue not surprisingly given where our assets are people know that there s going to be a sustained development over time in that area so we see a lot of interest there the other buckets as we ve talked about the non core delaware and eagle ford packages also some non op accreage and royalty packages out there so the way we think about it is let s have a lot of ways to be right we have a target of 300 million to 400 million out there the projects i listed if you added them all up that would be in excess of that goal so it s not like we have to get four or five of these done if we can get a couple of them done we ll get to our goals and that s critical in an environment like this right some will some markets will get a little bit softer there ll be some parts of those packages that will have sustained interest just given the nature of their profile so that is proceeding along quite well brian downey citi analyst i appreciate the commentary operator the next question is from neal dingmann with suntrust please go ahead neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning joe and tim my first question is on your activity and i think you touched joe around this a little bit already in the release you all suggest and talk about the materials second quarter production growth i m just wondering could you remind us potentially some of the pads that will contribute to this as certainly a large climb and i m just trying to get a sense maybe a little bit of the earlier cadence this year to get a better idea jeff balmer chief operating officer sure and this is jeff the original kind of first quarter as we mentioned we re running four factories so you ll see a really nice ramp up toward the back end of the first quarter running into the second quarter the second quarter and into the third quarter you ll see the larger scale pad developments primarily in the delaware that will be coming online and so these are the four five six well development systems that will come on with a relatively large amounts of overall production and they re put into the ground again with the progression of all the knowledge capture that we ve made in 2019 relative to spacing and stacking and timing and those items so we feel very good about the production profile that we put forward neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it ok thanks jeff and then my second question really just on slide 10 around the development optimization and really what you d mentioned earlier about the parent child comment is this the driver i guess i m wondering now when you decide on the total wells in a multi zone pad or i know you kind of talked to the market in the past a lot of this is this just based on just returns again obviously you re in a lower oil environment today than we were a month ago and a month before that and i m just wondering i guess allowed is how this will change your thoughts about these multi zone larger developments now that we re in a lower environment jeff balmer chief operating officer sure and that s a great question but our company is planned on being successful at a low price environment and that s one way that we believe we re differentiating ourselves from other folks so the program that s in place does take that into account within a reasonable range of oil price outcomes the development program would remain as it is and there s two components of it obviously the first one that you mentioned is spot on which is driving value so each well or each dollar that we spend has to have a dedicated expected return on it but then the other one is maximizing the recovery of the systems and so we don t anticipate going through and having to come back multiple years from now and having to drill infill wells to recover stranded hydrocarbons so we try to combine both of those ideas in the overall program jim ulm chief financial officer this is jim i would put on top of that obviously is it will be coordinated in terms of how we think about risk management and hedging we ve obviously talked about diversifying our pricing points but we will be very robust in our hedging and making sure that we have the ability to help protect that cash flow and continue the development program you recall from my remarks earlier we re really closer to 70 for the first half of the year and 60 for 2020 we have followed a strategy in the past of layering in successive years and we will continue to do that this year is the plan neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks jim operator the next question is from asit sen with bank of america please go ahead asit sen bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning just coming back to the pdp decline rate of 35 and it looks like optically much better than some of your peers could you update us on your maintenance capital of the combined company relative to i think the 450 million that you guys have talked about for cp stand alone joe gatto president and chief executive officer yes asit this is joe yes as you point out the decline rate i think we pointed that out is a differentiator and will continue to be one and with the pressure management and strategy i think that will add to that over time especially if we get into more of a ratable pace of development it will help as well but in terms of a maintenance capital program this is always an interesting question because there s things that you can do if you wanted to high grade all of your activity and go away from what jeff had walked through right it s very central to our philosophy but maintaining our approach to developing the asset base for the long term you re probably looking at a maintenance mode capital program of about 825 million to hold production flat asit sen bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks joe and then entering the year you have about 60 roughly 60 ducs what s the split of these ducs between eagle ford and delaware and is this the normal level of duc i know you mentioned about shift over the next 12 months could you elaborate please jeff balmer chief operating officer it s kind of roughly 50 50 there was a large pad in the eagle ford that just came online 16 wells that joe had mentioned that looks very good so far but generally speaking that s kind of the overall distribution of them joe gatto president and chief executive officer yes i mean so as we go through the year we will replenish that inventory right as we get again back to repeatable development we will have a natural duc inventory to give us operational flexibility so exiting 20 you d be looking at a bit over 60 gross wells but the bias being a little bit more to the permian at that point asit sen bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks a lot operator the next question is from gabe daoud with cowen please go ahead gabe daoud cowen and company analyst hey good morning guys appreciate all the great detail so far joe was hoping if we can maybe start in the eagle ford that 16 well project was there anything special going on there and do you anticipate future projects in the eagle ford being of that size and then i guess second part would just be could you guys disclose i guess what the eagle ford did produce in 2019 or in 14 19 so we could get a sense of trajectory in 2020 on that asset jeff balmer chief operating officer the 16 well project i ll comment on that first was a project that essentially took finished up a development hole if you will that was an opportunity where we had wells all around it and we wanted to come in and kind of finish the cradle to grave program within that system so of course the eagle ford it s a single target so kind of moving left to right and right to left we put in a completion a dual completion crews so we could shorten the amount of time that some of the offset wells were impacted and so all those wells are now online and flowing back and we ve had the vast majority i think the final two wells that were parent wells that were shut in are also now back online and flowing so overall the system looks pretty good and that is a pretty good representation of the types of projects that you ll see in the eagle ford going forward joe gatto president and chief executive officer and in terms of the production in the eagle ford we talked about a maintenance level production so that s really what we re seeing last year in the fourth quarter it s got around 38 000 a day 40 000 for the year in 2019 on average so this year as we talk about we re looking at a similar 40 000 plus or minus for 2020 and after coming off of a lower point in the first quarter there really wasn t any wells placed on production in the fourth quarter so you had a decrease in the first quarter but with these types of projects coming on we ll get back to some higher levels and average around 40 000 for the year gabe daoud cowen and company analyst thanks guys that s helpful and just as a follow up i guess jeff in the midland basin you mentioned or i guess you just mentioned overall the tweaking spacing here and there but specifically in howard is the thinking that the wolfcamp a is still developed on 10 wells a section and as you think about midland county the lower spraberry maybe about 13 wells section which i think is historically how you guys were developing that zone just curious i guess if there s anything specific you could say to changes on spacing in the midland basin jeff balmer chief operating officer yes we re pretty consistent with our thinking in that that if you re only going to go for a single zone you could down space it relatively to the levels that you re seeing right now generally speaking you d see wider spacing prevalent across both howard county and midland county so if you re moving into the 660 range would probably be a little bit more accurate unless you have very good geology and you re doing all the wells at the same time across the system which we have done before and had some very good success with it the nice thing about the howard county acreage that we have is that it was relatively greenfield so there is a lot of opportunity to come in and put in the correct initial development program right away so that we don t have the negative parent child relationships or and we can kind of control our destiny through the proper density in that development program gabe daoud cowen and company analyst thanks jeff operator the next question is from jeff grampp with northland capital please go ahead jeff grampp northland capital markets analyst good morning guys another question on the asset sale front is it fair to think if you guys hit that 300 million to 400 million target along with the organic growth that you re expecting this year does that kind of bridge you to that sub two times leverage target in kind of a normalized let s call it 50 to 55 oil world is that a reasonable expectation jeff balmer chief operating officer yes jeff grampp northland capital markets analyst got it easy enough and then back on the pdp decline front that 35 number over the next 12 months given that the asset base is still growing does that moderate much if we roll that forward 12 months or how should we kind of think about that evolving given some of the development practices that you guys are incorporating jeff balmer chief operating officer i think it would be logical to assume it wouldn t change too too much when you re looking at a program that has a very solid foundation of over 100 000 boe a day the wedge program is certainly a strong component of that but the base decline should be pretty solid overall so i wouldn t anticipate major changes in that overall decline profile jeff grampp northland capital markets analyst understood perfect operator next question is from kashy harrison with simmons energy please go ahead kashy harrison simmons energy analyst good morning everyone and thank you for taking my questions so my first question is for joe i hate to be the guy that reminds everyone about how crappy this market is but clearly we re in a challenging commodity environment given fears running covid 19 the spots at 46 the hubs at 1 75 strips sub 50 through 2024 i appreciate that strategies are made in a week and you all have obviously been very hard at this for two quarters now but can you help us think through what it would take for you to consider reducing activity what would you need to see on the strip would we need to go sub 45 just want to know how you think about the impact of the forward strip toward your activity moving forward joe gatto president and chief executive officer yes kashy a big part of this transaction was to create a more scaled model to weather volatility that we re going to see like this right we ve seen this over the last couple of years obviously it s something that we manage not only with driving down our marginal cost of supply as well as what we do on the financial hedging front right so when you ask a question is there a magic number that things change when we get that question you re only giving me part of the question right and we have to think about what happens to our cost structure so when we have periods like this we do have hedging that bridges us between different commodity price environments but if there is a sustained shift in the commodity price environment that s going to be at 45 or below certainly we wouldn t be in a position to be generating meaningful free cash flow and at that point we would certainly look to change our plans and make sure that we were in a position where we were generating cash flow kashy harrison simmons energy analyst got you that makes ton of sense so ultimately just it s all about the cash that makes sense and then my next question sorry go ahead joe gatto president and chief executive officer yes and again just before you it s really hard to just say there s a magic number because we have to see where the cost structure could potentially go before you make a decision on how much to tailor the program but i think the key point which you picked up is we would modify things if we saw we were not generating free cash flow kashy harrison simmons energy analyst that s very helpful my next question is for jeff again i know it s obvious you guys are running extraordinarily hard to deliver on this plan just looking at the trajectory between q4 20 from q1 20 it does however seem that at least just looking at this industry over the last for the few years that i ve been doing which is not nearly as long as you but just looking at the industry anytime there s a huge activity shift it feels like there s generally challenges with cost control and so i was wondering if you could maybe talk us through just some of your thoughts or controls or processes you have in place to make sure that you do in fact hit these dc e targets that you ve laid out in the presentation and then maybe talk about any slack you ve given yourself in the system just to take larger scale development into consideration jeff balmer chief operating officer sure that s a great question the governance control on the cost structure is outstanding so i anticipate that we will give a full review on every dollar that goes in and comes out of our environment but the nice thing about the combination of the two companies is that it s our same partnerships from a rig and completion service providers as well as some of the cost structures that aren t quite as high dollar as the completion systems and the drilling side of things but the idea behind combining the two companies at the beginning was to take the best practices from both companies the best crews the best synergy opportunities and combine those and what we ve seen so far already is that we have we have confidence that we re not only going to achieve the synergies that we thought we were going to and i m speaking from an operational side the g a is also running right where we wanted it to be but the operational synergies we re going to overproduce what we had originally estimated and there are specific examples i could use such as our view of the chemical programs where we can save money we ve made some improvements on our completion design on our bit selection on how we do drill outs all those items you re already seeing some dollar savings at the bottom line that have been incorporated already within just the first two months of the combined company so i feel very good that what we are planning on achieving we will achieve which will put us in the absolutely top tier of the industry in a dollar per foot basis and from a capital efficiency basis i hope that that answers your question you had a comment on the back end of it that i m not sure i fully addressed but please let me know kashy harrison simmons energy analyst yes so the second part of my question was just you re moving that did answer my question the first part of my question the second part was just you re moving to larger scale development in this year relative to last year so i was just curious if there s maybe any slack in the forward guidance just to take potential bottlenecks into consideration just from a planning process jeff balmer chief operating officer yes a very fair question i don t anticipate any bottlenecks right now that the folks that we have working aren t just working with their heads down we try to anticipate bottlenecks or squeeze points that might slow us down or cost us additional capital and for the most part putting together the two companies has allowed a larger degree of flexibility so that if we do anticipate a bottleneck or we see something that s going to come up we can shift capital or activity into a different arena relatively quickly that will allow us to kind of take care of whatever the squeeze point is move past it with very modest or no implications to the bottom line operator the next question comes from sameer panjwani with tudor pickering holt please go ahead sameer panjwani tudor pickering and holt analyst guys good morning i guess sticking with the theme of the last question you talked about not anticipating any bottlenecks from a capital standpoint but i guess maybe on the production side of things can you maybe quantify how much risking you are kind of baking in on the production side of things for these larger projects as you kind of shift to this new development design jeff balmer chief operating officer absolutely the way that we look at every project that we put in place is to take into account all the different variables that we have in place so we take a look at the existing wells or the parent wells that we have what each of the historic zones has produced whether it s an unbounded well or a well that s had neighbors development programs that have been put in place historically all at the same time or had variances put through and then we apply an appropriate level of risk but really the best way to describe it is we make a prediction of what we think each individual well is going to produce and then combine that into what the entire system is going to produce so the forecast for each of the well systems or individual wells is accurate and that it takes into account all the different variables that each of the specific development programs needs to take into account for instance if you re going into a greenfield area that s not drilled up and we put a certain level of spacing and stacking in a certain number of wells with a certain set of targeting sequences that analysis would have a different level of outcomes than if you had to come into a system that had a series of parent wells already drilled into it and you were drilling offset into wells that were two years past the parent wells and were spaced at 660 feet or 800 feet away so each of the individual programs that we have has a specific process that we go through to allocate production sameer panjwani tudor pickering and holt analyst ok so it sounds like there s not necessarily maybe an increased level of risking that you re applying to 2020 program versus the 2019 it s just more i guess well specific or development project specific jeff balmer chief operating officer that s a very good way to put it that s correct sameer panjwani tudor pickering and holt analyst ok ok great and then i guess the other thing i wanted to touch on was i wanted to make sure i understood some of the 2021 commentary correctly i know you guys haven t put out guidance but i think when i kind of think about the 2020 program i m kind of backing into an exit rate of about 90 000 barrels a day of oil in order for you to hit your full year oil guidance and i think what you mentioned was about 10 year over year growth in 2021 which would imply about 85 000 barrels a day of oil so when i m putting that together it could imply exit to exit declines next year as the production profile smooths out so i just want to make sure i m not missing anything there and i m thinking about all that correctly joe gatto president and chief executive officer yes we ll probably talk about math offline but i think we ve been consistent in terms of what we ve put out there in terms of our expectations over the next couple of years obviously the plan is getting kicked off this year in a strong way and going into next year we get some more ratable activity get some more permian bias to the program and feel like things will line up as we ve talked about but we re not in a position to be talking about exit rates in 2021 as we sit here in february of 2020 sameer panjwani tudor pickering and holt analyst ok ok i guess would it be fair to assume kind of to your commentary that we shouldn t expect a similar kind of q1 to q2 that kind of a jump in production it should be more stable production in 2021 correct joe gatto president and chief executive officer that s correct yes that s the point that we hopefully get across as you get into that more ratable activity that things smooth out a bit as you have just sort of repeatable utilization of crews and completion fleets going forward kashy harrison simmons energy analyst got it thank you operator the next question is from brad heffern with rbc please go ahead brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning everyone i just have a sort of an administrative question you guys haven t historically reported this gp t line so i was wondering if you could walk through sort of the dynamics of what s going in there is legacy callon is the sort of pricing going to improve or is this just related to three stream and ngls or is it just related to the carrizo operations any color there would be great jim ulm chief financial officer well i ll start and then people can chime in obviously one of the changes that joe alluded to was that the three stream treatment begins january 1 of 20 we attempted to kind of break that out for everyone to see for the 2019 so again it does include we put kind of the straightforward loe in there and then we ve broken it out into the gp t category and guided a range is there a greater detail you re looking for or what exactly are you looking for in the question brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst yes and i was just wondering if there s a dynamic where pricing is improving at the same time that gp t line is getting added or if it s just something that s coming from carrizo jim ulm chief financial officer yes got it so you will see higher revenue and then a zero ebitda effect in the end operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to joe gatto for any closing remarks joe gatto president and chief executive officer thanks operator thanks everyone for joining us on our first call as a combined company as you can tell we re off to a great start

yemen s houthi rebels have blocked half of the united nations aid delivery programs in the war torn country a strong arm tactic to force the agency to give them greater control over the massive humanitarian campaign along with a cut of billions of dollars in foreign assistance according to aid officials and internal documents obtained by the associated press the rebel group has made granting access to areas under their control contingent on a flurry of conditions that aid agencies reject in part because it would give the houthis greater sway over who receives aid documents and interviews show the houthis obstruction has hindered several programs that feed the near starving population and help those displaced by the nearly 6 year civil war a senior u n official said speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation over 2 million beneficiaries are directly affected the official said the houthis have been pushing back against u n efforts to tighten monitoring of some 370 million a year that its agencies already give to government institutions controlled mostly by the rebel group documents show that money is supposed to pay salaries and other administration costs but more than a third of the money spent last year wasn t audited according to an internal document leaked to the ap the u n has largely kept quiet in public about the pressure but behind the scenes the agency and international donors are digging in against the houthi demands the ap spoke to seven workers and officials from u n and independent agencies about the situation all spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals the ap also saw dozens of documents including emails of aid officials in october the u n humanitarian coordinator for yemen lise grande sent a letter to the houthi appointed prime minister complaining about a long list of demands the overwhelming majority of them impede or delay delivery of aid and many violate humanitarian principles she said in the letter a copy of which was obtained by the ap for months the houthis demanded a 2 cut from the entire aid budget be given to them a condition the u n and donors rejected in an email to the ap a spokesperson for the u s agency for international development said houthi attempts to implement a tax on humanitarian assistance are unacceptable and directly contradict international humanitarian principles the united states donated 686 million to yemen in 2019 according to usaid last week the houthis appeared to back off the 2 demand but continue to press for other concessions according to aid officials during a meeting in brussels last thursday aid agencies and international donors threatened to reduce aid if houthis continue to impose restrictions on u n operations in yemen the situation has reached a breaking point they said in a statement at least one agency the world food program is currently considering cutting back the monthly food aid it delivers to 12 million yemenis every other month a u n official said it s unfortunate that people will suffer but this is on the houthis the official said they can t use people as hostages for too long on thursday both u n and american officials said they are continuing their efforts to deliver aid to yemenis despite the houthi roadblocks we want to help the long suffering people of yemen said usaid administrator mark green when asked about the ap investigation during a stop in munich the houthis are putting up restrictions that make it difficult to do that and that s something that we refuse to stand still for u n deputy spokesman farhan haq added we ve made clear to all parties the need to make sure that our aid can proceed and we have regularly reiterated the importance of sustaining the humanitarian operation which is being implemented in challenging conditions and is providing life saving assistance to millions of yemenis the houthis demands have stoked longtime concerns among aid agencies over the rebels diverting of humanitarian funds and supplies into their own or their supporters pockets or toward their war effort delivering aid in a war zone has always poseda problem for u n agencies but officials said the situation in yemen has been especially challenging the houthishave withheld visas and permissions for equipment and supplies and refused to grant clearances for u n missions to move through rebel controlled areas aid workers said agency leaders past willingness to concede to some of therebels demands has emboldened the houthi leaders to push for more nearly 300 000 pregnant and nursing mothers and children under age 5 haven t received nutrition supplements for more than six months because the houthis held beneficiaries hostage to the 2 demand another u n official said in another example houthi authorities for months delayed permission to distribute 2 000 tons of food enough to feed 160 000 people in the district of aslam where the ap previously found starving villagers reduced to eating boiled leaves when approval came in november the food had spoiled beyond the point of salvage another aid official said houthi leaders have remained defiant in the face of u n pushback yemen will survive if agencies suspend aid abdul mohsen tawoos secretary general of the houthi agency coordinating international aid told european donors during a jan 20 skype call minutes of the call were obtained by the ap he said the houthis wanted to reach an agreement with the u n and its donors but won t be bullied tawoos accused grande the top u n official in yemen of sending false reports abouthouthis restricting the movement of u n humanitarian operations houthi leaders have threatened to expel her from the country the u n s massive aid program totaling 8 35 billion since 2015 is vital to keeping many yemenis alive the u n calls the situation in yemen the world s worst humanitarian crisis ten million people in the country are on the brink of famine and80 of the population of 29 million in need of aid according to the u n more than 3 million people have been displaced cholera epidemics have killed hundreds and at least 2 2 million children under 5 suffer from severe malnutrition the agency said the iranian backed houthi rebels control the capital sanaa and much of the country s north where most of the population lives and the need for aid is greatest they are at war with a u s backed saudi led coalition fighting on behalf of the internationally recognized government with the economy in freefall the u n aid effort is a major source of foreign currency into the country the u n received around 3 billion in 2019 in international donations for its campaign short of its 4 2 billion goal the houthi demand for 2 of that budget would funnel 60 80 million into the coffers of their aid coordination agency the supreme council for management and coordination of humanitarian affairs and international cooperation known as scmcha qassim hussein al houthi the head of the international agencies department in thehouthi presidency said the money was necessary forscmcha s operating expenses it carries heavy financial burden it s in charge of facilitating distributing security and organizing the work of the agencies he said al houthi argued that it s the u n agenciesthat spend a much larger percentage of their budgets on administration without real oversight he said the u n aid delivery programs blocked by the houthis are not a priority for the yemen people harassment intimidation and suspected embezzling of funds by houthis have been going on for years aid workers said and have gotten worse since the rebels created their aid coordination agency in early 2018 since then houthi led security agencies have arrested local workers blocked aid missions or held up supplies according to internal emails and documents seen by the ap not even a simple project can be carried out in northern yemen without the consent and supervision of this body said a yemeni chief of a local aid organization the u n rarely pushed back calculating that aid had to be delivered at any cost u n agencies continued to put hundreds of millions of dollars into houthi accounts for capacity building a common practice in humanitarian programs to ensure government bodies function some of the money went to salaries for doctors teachers and other vital employees who have otherwise gone without pay amid the war millions more went to the houthi aid agency for administrative costs and salaries aid workers privately expressed concerns about the funds from u n aid agencies being diverted into the coffers of houthi leaders or their supporters unicef told the ap in a statement that its funds were strictly monitored and no instances of diversions were found the world health organization said all its spending was subject to internal and external audit as well as frequent internal reviews on multiple levels who also said it found no evidence that its funds have been diverted still last summer the u n requested all agencies report how much they were giving in direct cash transfers in 2019 the total reached 370 million around10 of the entire international aid budget for yemen according to a u n spreadsheet obtained by the ap around 133 million was marked in the spreadsheet as not audited some officials in the houthi aid body scmcha appear to be receiving multiple salaries the data shows for a time three u n agencies were each giving salaries to the body s president his deputy and general managers each of the officials received a total of 10 000 a month from the agencies the spreadsheet shows the u n refugee agency also gave scmcha 1 million every three months for office rental and administrative costs while the u n migration agency gave the office another 200 000 for furniture and fiber optics u n officials said grande was genuinely shocked when she learned about the arrangements she had no idea about the scale of it said one senior u n official her reaction after that was we have to fix the situation over the past year u n agencies lead by grande began pushing back against houthi demands first the world food program suspended aid for a couple of months in some areas around sanaa and demanded biometric registering of beneficiaries to ensure deliveries go to those truly in need the houthis initially agreed but later refused to follow through with the biometric registering the u n then moved to prevent double paying of salaries and its agencies tightened auditing of the funds it provided unicef for example said it decided in november to re assess all 243 partners it works with including government ones and cut down dramatically on funds put into houthi coffers the agency said it would start paying suppliers and contractors directly the moves by the u n have prompted the houthis to launch a media campaign denouncing the humanitarian agency as corrupt and wasteful further escalation came after the houthi aid body in november was put under the leadership of the houthi president s chief of staff making it more powerful several aid officials said an already difficult environment to work in became extremely suffocating with threats and directives one of the officials said scmcha s new leadership imposed more than 200 new directives on humanitarian agencies six aid officials told the ap some directives such as requiring agencies to disclose the identities of aid recipients and involving houthi authorities in assessments of need would give the rebels even greater power to steer aid to their supporters aid workers fear other demands seemed aimed at monitoring and intimidating such as ordering local yemeni staffers to get houthi permission to take u n training courses abroad and then to report back the content of those workshops houthis officials also require the segregation of women and men in u n run programs in some areas the houthis also demanded a new agreement giving them a hand in assigning u n contracts with suppliers and picking local partners to implement programs according to a draft of their proposal seen by the ap it also gives them the right to screen u n hires in yemen and take over the budget of monitoring programs aid agencies have refused to sign the agreement several humanitarian workers said the houthis are also trying to force the u n to work with ngos they favor particularly an organization known as bonyan which is filled with houthi affiliates the brother of houthi leader abdel malekal houthi ibrahim al houthi was a board member until his death last summer houthi leaders stopped the u n agencies from delivering food in yemen s hodeida province unless they used bonyan for the distribution despite the disputes between the houthis and the u n aid officials continue to appeal to international donors for money to address the crisis in yemen over the summer grande pleaded to donor countries for more funds to meet the 4 2 billion goal when money doesn t come people die she said but one international aid official said more money isn t the issue i don t want more funds i want the space to spend what i have he said ___ follow associated

the coronavirus outbreak began to look more like a worldwide economic crisis friday as anxiety about the disease emptied shops and amusement parks canceled events cut trade and travel and dragged already slumping financial markets even lower more employers told their workers to stay home and officials locked down neighborhoods and closed schools the wide ranging efforts to halt the spread of the illness threatened jobs paychecks and profits around the globe companies and governments are weighing tough measures from the closure of tokyo disneyland in japan to a ban on larger gatherings in switzerland amazon is discouraging its workers from traveling italy is weighing closing or reopening tourist spots a cathedral in germany is draining holy water prescription medicines manufactured in china are going into short supplies the cruise ship industry is taking on water stock markets around the world plunged again friday on wall street the dow jones index took yet another hit closing down nearly 360 points the index has dropped more than 14 since last week making this the market s worst week since 2008 during the global financial crisis all of this can appear nothing but foreboding to florida which as of late friday had no confirmed cases of the disease covid 19 or the coronavirus that causes it but which is as dependent on tourism travel and large gatherings as any place anywhere this is a case where in economic terms the cure is almost worse than the disease said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics when you quarantine cities you lose economic activity that you re not going to get back the list of countries touched by the illness climbed to nearly 60 on friday as mexico belarus lithuania new zealand nigeria azerbaijan iceland and the netherlands reported their first cases more than 83 000 people worldwide have contracted the illness with deaths topping 2 800 the head of the world health organization announced that

calabasas ca accesswire february 28 2020 unico american corporation nasdaq unam unico the company announced today its consolidated financial results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 for the three months ended december 31 2019 net loss was 2 380 419 0 45 diluted loss per share compared to net loss of 468 680 0 09 diluted loss per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 net loss was 3 115 703 0 59 diluted loss per share compared to net loss of 3 169 559 0 60 diluted loss per share for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 book value per share was 10 38 and 10 54 at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively results of operations the increase in direct written premium during the three months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to growth in the company s transportation vertical transacted by wholly owned subsidiaries crusader insurance company crusader and unifax insurance systems inc unifax that transportation vertical transacts insurance primarily for long haul trucking operations that are domiciled in california the decrease in net investment income during the three months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to a decrease in the average invested assets the decrease in gross commissions and fees during the three months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to decreases in property and casualty insurance policy fee income the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses during the three months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to higher incurred claims costs for insured events of prior years related to crusader s underwriting activities in the company s apartments commercial buildings vertical associated with higher habitability related claims severity in that vertical the decrease in policy acquisition costs during the three months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to relatively higher sales in the company s transportation vertical which pays a lower commission rate than the other verticals the increase in direct written premium during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to growth in the company s transportation vertical transacted by wholly owned subsidiaries crusader and unifax the increase in net investment income during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to an increase in the yield on average invested assets the decrease in gross commissions and fees during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to decreases in property and casualty insurance policy fee income the decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to lower claims costs related to crusader s underwriting activities in the company s food beverage entertainment vertical associated with a reduction in net earned premium for that vertical during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 and also associated with lower claims frequency and severity in that vertical the decrease in policy acquisition costs during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was due primarily to relatively higher sales in the company s transportation vertical which pays a lower commission rate than the other verticals management commentary the fact that our crusader insurance company subsidiary is one of the smallest insurance companies in the united states with a relatively high net retention of risk adds to the potential for volatility in our quarterly results but more significantly our 2019 fourth quarter loss reflects the sometimes volatile nature of the commercial niches that we serve for the past several years a significant majority of crusader s revenue came from the sales and underwriting of three market sector niches long haul trucking residential apartment buildings and bars taverns although historically profitable in more recent years we identified what turned out to be new adverse loss development patterns in those niches which resulted in adverse underwriting results at the same time we identified a new adverse trend pertaining to society s application of the law when an insurance company attempts to enforce its rights which also had a substantial negative impact on our underwriting of residential apartment buildings all of those adverse trends are attributable to what is now commonly referred to as social inflation said cary l cheldin unico s president and chief executive officer as previously reported our work of the past several years was focused to assure premium adequacy disciplined risk selection and prudent expense control so as to regain confidence in the ultimate profitability of our underwriting activity to address these concerns and improve the profitability of our underwriting we have adopted significant rate increases new coverage restrictions and modified risk selection techniques but until the impact of those changes becomes obvious we expect that our loss ratios might continue to reflect the adverse underwriting from prior years moving forward we are focusing on sales diversification and execution and we remain mindful however that due to the vagaries caused by social inflation there is a significant amount of uncertainty and risk of loss related to the hazard of habitability claims arising from the underwriting of residential apartment buildings and related to the hazard of assault battery claims arising from the underwriting of bars taverns definitions and non gaap financial measures written

this story about working moms was produced by the hechinger report a nonprofit independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education washington d c ameykay stocks a mail carrier and a mother of five has sent all her children to local public schools here from the year they turned 3 she and her husband a sign installer have been grateful to have free child care while they worked and she said she s thrilled with what her children now ages 5 to 16 have learned she s mastered puzzles on her own stocks said of her 5 year old she s not into electronics more into the whole fantasy land of kitchen and playing with pots and pans in her daughter s preschool classroom last year she had a whole pet center and was playing chef and taking orders stocks expects all five of her children to complete college something she never achieved and credits some of their academic success to having a highly qualified classroom teacher since the age of 3 most families in america lack such an option nationally only 68 percent of 4 year olds and 40 percent of 3 year olds were enrolled in preschool in 2017 according to the national center for education statistics hardly any children younger than 3 are enrolled in publicly funded child care of any kind but washington is one of a growing number of cities to offer public preschool and it s more generous than most all 4 year olds and most 3 year olds living here regardless of their family s income get a spot in a free public preschool program a handful of other cities along with a few states such as oklahoma and west virginia offer free preschool as well making public education available to children younger than 5 two students answer their teachers questions about apples during their preschool class at kimball elementary school in washington d c lillian mongeau the hechinger report led by sen elizabeth warren d mass some of the democratic presidential candidates have set their sights on an ambitious and costly national child care system that would constitute a vast expansion of these local programs in early 2019 warren proposed a policy that would provide working families with free child care this month sen bernie sanders i vt followed suit releasing his own universal child care plan warren sanders and sen amy klobuchar d minn all mentioned the importance of expanding child care during tuesday s south carolina debate instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires sanders said we re going to have high quality universal child care for every family in this country such a change would affect millions of families across the country two thirds of women with children younger than 6 work this means a lot of kids 21 3 million of them according to the national center for education statistics are cared for regularly by someone other than their mother related how cities are convincing voters to pay higher taxes for public preschool despite these overwhelming numbers the federal government does little to subsidize child care that hurts working moms who are more likely than working dads to quit their jobs when they can t find child care according to a survey conducted by the liberal center for american progress think tank and working moms were 40 percent more likely than working dads to say that child care issues had negatively affected their careers we don t have the supports that women need to stay in the workforce consistently if they want to said julie vogtman the director of job quality at the national women s law center if women work it s difficult to earn enough to afford child care but if they take time out of the workforce both their family s short and long term financial stability are harmed by that choice it relieved a lot of stress for stocks washington s public preschool program has meant that she could keep the jobs she needed to make ends meet for her family and also have the time to earn the certifications she needed to improve her work prospects when her oldest child justina was born stocks was working at macy s and kay jewelers and was having trouble affording the 68 a week she owed for child care after receiving city subsidies for low income families stocks needed multiple forms of public transportation to get to the child care facility then to her two jobs and then back in time to get justina some days she d end up spending 20 she could ill afford on a taxi to get back in time things became easier when justina turned 3 and became eligible for the preschool program at her neighborhood school garfield elementary the school was easier to reach the cost of child care dropped justina still went at 6 a m before school started at 8 a m and stocks was happier with the quality of care it relieved a lot of stress off of me she said since then stocks earned a certification at university of the district of columbia community college that allowed her to qualify for a job at the u s postal service where she s able to earn a higher and steadier salary she said without free full time child care she couldn t have made that switch related finding a good preschool isn t easy try it washington s publicly funded full day preschool program was responsible for increasing the city s maternal labor force by 10 percentage points from 2008 to 2017 according to research published in 2018 by the center for american progress researchers determined that the bump in employment affected women at both the upper and the lower ends of the pay scale those in the middle already a highly employed group did not see much change teacher irene taguian leads a 4 year old preschool class at lafayette elementary school in washington d c lillian mongeau the hechinger report nationally the american female workforce is shrinking and the birth rate is slowing neither of which are good for the country s bottom line just 57 percent of women work now compared to a high of 60 percent in 1990 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics women have been having fewer children year over year for about the same amount of time even though many report wanting more than they have mary charles and her husband who have one child live in washington she is an information technology manager at a government office and he is a government contractor they are firmly middle income earners in their city and say paying for child care in the years before their daughter could start preschool was a big stretch it was 20 000 a year and that s considered not expensive charles said for us that was a significant part of our budget related who should pay for preschool for the middle class to make more money they rented out their basement which meant sharing their kitchen and charles husband worked as a dj on the weekends for extra cash they were not eligible for income based child care subsidies charles said the availability of public preschool which has exceeded her expectations for quality was a large part of their decision to stay in the city rather than moving to the otherwise cheaper suburbs i think it should be available more places charles said an expensive proposal but for now most children with working parents are not eligible for subsidized child care on any significant scale until the school year following their fifth birthday the federal funding that does exist about 22 2 billion is meant to help poor families cover child care costs but only 1 in 6 eligible families get the aid because there is not enough money for all of them and that figure does not take into account the many families who earn more than 85 percent of their state s median income and are therefore ineligible for federal help but are still unable to cover the cost of child care now that middle class moms are facing many of the same challenges low income moms have faced for decades unaffordable unavailable or unsatisfactory care for their children while they must work to put food on the table the needs of the two groups may be aligning in ways that could drive real change this issue has come to a head in the last couple years because families can t make ends meet with one full time worker said elise gould a senior economist at the economic policy institute a think tank people are beginning to realize that it s not their fault or an inability to manage their own finances that is making the cost of child care unaffordable for them both warren s and sanders plans would offer subsidized care to a broader swath of the public on a smaller scale so would the child care for working families act of 2019 sponsored by sen patty murray of washington and rep bobby scott of virginia both democrats the bill boasted 209 co sponsors in the house and the senate including warren sanders and klobuchar but has not made it out of committee all of these plans depend on the federal government spending significantly more money president donald trump has presided over one of the most significant increases to subsidized child care funding more than 3 billion since fiscal year 2017 and though republicans in general are supportive of expanding child care subsidies the bolder of the democratic plans from warren and sanders count on a new wealth tax that is unlikely to gain conservative support the economic policy institute report that calculated current federal spending at 22 billion per year estimated that a national early childhood system that compensated caretakers in line with k 12 teachers and served all children from infancy to age 5 would cost 337 billion to 495 billion a year warren s plan at an estimated cost of 1 07 trillion over the coming decade would cost less on an annual basis in part because higher income families would pay a sliding scale fee sanders has said his plan would cost 1 5 trillion over 10 years but he hasn t provided a detailed breakdown while most politicians have proposed incremental less expensive solutions the child care for working families act has been priced at 40 billion a year some experts say that more comprehensive plans are what s needed to not only change the reality for working families but also to provide a needed jolt to the national economy offering subsidies to only the poorest families saves the government money gould said but it doesn t get at the workforce issues for the providers or the parents increasingly no one is left out of the delicate balance of how to

rolls at seoul s gwangjang market where crowds were thin as south korea counted 571 new cases more than in china where the virus emerged i am just hoping that the outbreak will come under control soon

england journal of medicine chinese health officials said the death rate from the illness known as covid 19 was 1 4 based on 1 099 patients at more than 500 hospitals throughout china assuming there are many more cases with no or very mild symptoms the rate may be considerably less than 1 u s health officials wrote in an editorial in the journal that would make the virus more like a severe seasonal flu than a disease similar to its genetic cousins sars severe acute respiratory syndrome or mers middle east respiratory syndrome given the ease of spread however the virus could gain footholds around the world and many could die it s not cholera or the black plague said simone venturini the city councillor for economic development in venice italy where tourism already hurt by

2 4 this year the slowest since the great recession in 2009 and down from earlier expectations closer to 3 for the united states estimates are falling to as low as 1 7 growth this year down from 2 3 in 2019 but if covid 19 becomes a global pandemic economists expect the impact could be much worse with the u s and other global economies falling into recession if we start to see more cases in the united states if we start to see people not travelling domestically if we start to see people stay home from work and from stores then i think the hit is going to get substantially worse said gus faucher an economist at pnc financial some saw dollar signs in the crisis twenty people were arrested in italy for selling masks they fraudulently claimed provided complete protection from covid 19

his political enemies china s manufacturing plunged in february by an even wider margin than expected after efforts to contain the virus shut down much of the world s second largest economy an

by howard schneider washington reuters a bernie sanders administration might logically start with a roughly 300 billion federal jobs guarantee a cornerstone of worker protection says a key adviser to the front runner in the u s democratic presidential nominating race some of the higher price tag items sanders has proposed such as the elimination of 1 7 trillion in student debt could be enacted and actually boost the economy while ambitious environment or healthcare programs would need to be rolled out more deliberately to match what the economy could absorb without inflation stephanie kelton a professor at stony brook university in new york state said earlier this week related stories i like very much the idea of getting a jobs safeguard in place right away because like most people i worry about what happens when the next downturn comes kelton said on the sidelines of a national association for business economics meeting kelton who has been sanders senior economic adviser since his unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid emphasized she was speaking on her own behalf about how some of her economic ideas might be implemented and not for the u s senator s campaign but sanders ideas have raised questions and criticisms about how his proposals would be financed though kelton s role in a possible sanders administration is uncertain her advocacy of the controversial modern monetary theory mmt brand of economics could offer clues about how that large an agenda might be implemented mmt hinges on the belief that nations like the united states that issue their own currencies and do not borrow in foreign denominations need not limit government spending based on tax revenues or annual budget deficits but rather by whether the spending produces inflation sanders a self described democratic socialist has promised a sweeping transformation of the u s economy if he wrests the keys to the white house from president donald trump in the november 2020 election kelton estimates the jobs guarantee would increase the federal deficit by about 1 5 of gross domestic product while ensuring the elusive goal of full employment the u s deficit currently stands at 4 5 of gdp such a proposal is not a novel idea in u s history or even the current presidential race government employment programs were used to ease the sting of the great depression and have been more recently proposed by democratic presidential candidates including senator elizabeth warren but sanders has made it a centerpiece of his agenda a jobs guarantee would kelton said form an ultimate economic backstop that ensures full employment even in a recession and would expand federal spending just as private sector incomes ebbed kelton said her research shows that cancelling the 1 7 trillion in federal student debt would be a net boost to the economy trillions of dollars would need to be allocated to pay for ambitious parts of the sanders agenda such as the medicare for all proposal to provide health insurance for all americans based on the existing government run program for those 65 and older a climate friendly green new deal or an infrastructure building program those programs would need to be rolled out more deliberately and designed by teams of experts across federal agencies to match what could be spent in any given year without causing a worrying jump in inflation she said the sanders campaign had no comment when asked about kelton s possible role in a sanders white house the campaign s website promises a stable job that pays a living wage to everyone in america who can work highlighting health care infrastructure and childhood education jobs sanders also does not overtly advocate mmt and some aspects of it clash with his progressive rhetoric as an intellectual notion for example higher deficits could be just as easily used to underwrite tax cuts as a green new deal a fact kelton has said makes trump seem perhaps an unwitting adherent critics including republicans as well as moderate democrats view mmt as a pie in the sky set of ideas that would require huge tax hikes and ultimately lead to higher interest rates that would damage the economy in a 2019 op ed in the washington post former u s treasury secretary lawrence summers said mmt was fallacious at multiple levels and was being pushed by fringe economists it is likely republicans who currently control the u s senate would reject most if not all of any mmt driven agenda in the wake of sanders recent victories in the new hampshire and nevada nominating contests and strong showing in the iowa caucuses some democrats have voiced concerns that independents and moderate republicans will be scared by the prospect of a sharp left turn jeopardizing democrats control of the u s house of representatives as well as their white house hopes sanders who has vowed to make the wealthy and corporations assume a greater financial burden has acknowledged that taxes will go up to pay for his proposals but he so far has refused to say by how much some of his rivals including former vice president joe biden and former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg have criticized sanders for failing to lay out the costs and brandished his proposals as a gift to republicans in november i can tell you exactly how it all adds up it adds up to four more years of donald trump buttigieg said during a democratic candidates debate on wednesday the next state nominating contest takes place on saturday in south carolina technocratic revolution in her appearance at the national association for business economics this week kelton outlined what would amount to a technocratic revolution if mmt were to inform federal spending lawmakers and officials would closely calibrate federal budgets to spend as much as possible while keeping inflation at bay attack bottlenecks in specific markets if needed and use interventions more akin to wartime to engineer the economy away from fossil fuels kelton envisions key changes to the budgeting for government programs so lawmakers no longer fight one battle over how much to spend on a program and another over how to fund it budgets should be aimed at solving problems she said summing up how an mmt approach could be put into practice write a budget with the intent of improving public well being for more ambitious programs operationalizing mmt would involve analyzing how large amounts of spending could be rolled out without causing prices to surge she said mmt does not worry about government deficits but it does see inflation as a constraint if money is spent so fast in an economy or market that it drives up prices kelton acknowledged the need for a dose of caution on that front given the low level of u s unemployment currently at 3 6 she cited the estimates of other economists that show there still might be perhaps 500 billion of immediate fiscal space available but if the aim is to spend a couple of trillion on a green new deal or infrastructure somebody better be getting this right especially when the margin of error is not big she said reporting by howard schneider editing by heather timmons

president donald trump claimed that his economic policies led to a blue collar boom and rising wages at the state of the union address earlier this month yet new data shows that inflation adjusted wage growth has fallen substantially during his first two years in office compared to the end of president barack obama s presidency middle class incomes grew about 5 8 per year during obama s last two years in office before slowing to 2 7 from during trump s first two years in office according to a new analysis by the progressive think tank economic policy institute epi and investigative news outlet capital main the income data were adjusted for inflation all but two states saw real wages fall during that time period despite what we heard at the state of the union the truth is that this economy is not performing well for most americans said epi president thea lee at this point in the business cycle wage and income growth for working households should be accelerating not slowing the analysis based on the latest census data showed that nine of the 10 states where trump beat hillary clinton by less than four percentage points saw real wage growth decline and red states like alaska west virginia south dakota and wyoming also saw significant declines as well by comparison just one state saw its real wage growth decline during obama s last two years in office the only states that saw inflation adjusted wage growth increase during trump s first two years were arizona and louisiana though presidents often claim too much credit and take too much blame for economic performance senior epi analyst david cooper said obama saw higher wage growth as a result of a prolonged low rate of inflation but economists also said trump squandered opportunities to implement policies that would spur wage growth an infrastructure bill would clearly have a marked impact especially on middle level jobs mark muro a senior fellow at the brookings institute s metropolitan policy project told capital main manufacturing is going in the wrong direction i think there are all kinds of policy opportunities that have not been exploited muro added that the ongoing manufacturing recession the ongoing trade war and the coronavirus could result in additional economic fallout in 2020 lee added that the 2017 tax cuts and trump s deregulatory moves have also hurt the middle class the current administration s focus on cutting taxes for the wealthy expanding tax incentives for outsourcing and undercutting workers rights has left ordinary working households in most states barely gaining ground she said the report noted that trump frequently cites a disputed study from heritage foundation fellow stephen moore an adviser to trump who was briefly nominated to a federal reserve position before withdrawing from consideration to claim that wage growth has increased under his presidency but that data included fallout from the 2007 08 recession and used data from a private firm rather than the larger census data the time periods are especially misleading wrote washington post fact checker glenn kessler adding that the official census numbers do not show nearly this kind of gain under trump epi data also suggests that the wage trend did not improve in 2019 real median hourly wages grew just 1 percent during 2019 and in 24 states the median hourly wage grew 1 percent or less capital main reported stagnant median wage growth also plagued the obama recovery real hourly wage growth for the typical worker remained under 2 percent even in the final years of his presidency by contrast median hourly wages grew at a rate of 2 7 percent annually during the tight labor market of the late 1990s cooper who led the epi study blamed lower unionization rates the gutting of public safety net programs and trump s trade war as factors behind the slowed growth employers have greater leverage to hold down wages now than they did during previous periods he explained other researchers agreed daniel alpert a founding partner of westwood capital llc told capital main that the rate of high quality jobs was higher under obama than it has been under trump at least under obama we saw some improvement in job quality he said as a result of the funding of infrastructure and other things that can actually create high quality employment a wide ranging annual study published by epi earlier this month also showed that wage growth under trump has particularly favored the highest paid workers the biggest rewards from a strong economy are still skewed toward white people men and high earners bloomberg news reported despite some improvements in the economy the wage gap between white and black workers is now worse than it was in 2000 according to the data though local minimum wage increases have helped deliver at least some gains for lower income workers pay increased at twice the rate for the lowest income workers in states that increased the minimum wage over the last seven years compared to those that did not growth rates for the top earners continue to dwarf those for everyone else the top 5 of male earners saw a 37 wage increase since 2000 compared to a 3 4 median wage increase for the overall population it s no wonder then that the number of striking workers suddenly surged under trump after decades of decline in strikes indeed the number of striking workers surged in 2018 to a nearly twentyfold increase from 2017 according to epi data based on numbers from the bureau of labor statistics strike activity surged in 2018 with 485 200 workers involved in major work stoppages the report said the surge in strike activity continued in 2019 with 425 500 workers involved in major work stoppages the trend was fueled by teacher strikes in states like kentucky west virginia and north carolina and cities like los angeles and chicago as well as unionized workers at companies like at t general motors and stop shop the data did not include walkouts like the google worker protest of the company s handling of sexual harassment because those kinds of walkouts constituted less than one full work shift even though we are 10 years into an economic recovery and the unemployment rate is under 4 working people are still not seeing the kinds of robust wage growth that those at the top have seen for decades said senior epi economist heidi shierholz the increase in strike numbers shows that workers understand that joining together in collective action remains an effective way to raise wages and benefits and improve working conditions despite the dour forecasts it is certainly good news that low income workers are finally seeing their pay rise however that has little to do with trump or the federal government according to a study by the national employment law project nelp which showed low income workers wages were buoyed by local minimum wage increases states that did not raise the minimum wage saw stagnant rates many of those increases were sparked by strikes like the 2012 walkout by fast food employees and other workers the big increase in low wage workers pay nelp policy analyst irene tung told usa today is largely the result of the fight by low paid workers to raise the minimum wage across the country
