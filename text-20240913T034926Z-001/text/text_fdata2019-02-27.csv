unknown the fragility of state finances why and how an inflationary collapse occurs a gold standard alone is insufficient which road will your government take it will take an extraordinary feat of leadership to succeed the us is a pivot of disaster the sco bloc this article makes the obvious point thatgiven the alternative is inflationist policies that can only lead to far higher interest rates and currency destruction the topic is timely given the self harm of american economic and geopolitical policies which are already leading america into a cyclical slump meanwhile the upcoming credit crisis is likely to kill off the welfare state model in the west by destroying their unbacked paper currencies while china russia and their asian allies have the means to prosper in my last goldmoney article i explained why the monetary policies of inflationist economists and policy makers would end up destroying fiat currencies the destruction will come from ordinary people who are forced by law to use the state s money for settling their day to day transactions they always have eventually this has been proved by experience and should be uncontroversial for the issuer of a currency the risk of this happening heightens when credit markets become destabilised and confidence in the full faith and credit which is the only backing a fiat currency has begins to be questioned either by its users or foreigners or both and when it does a currency starts to rapidly lose purchasing power and the whole interest rate structure moves higher the state s finances are then ruined becauseonly the public has yet to realise the consequences and the planners are not about to tell them the difficulty for nearly all governments is the deterioration in their finances will eventually wipe out their currencies unless a solution is found it could be modelled on steve hanke s of john hopkins university preferred solution ofhe recommends this solution to currency debasement and the evils that come with it for venezuela and the like linking a distressed emerging market currency to the dollar but here we are considering stabilising the dollar itself and all the other currencies linked to it which has always been the peoples money free of issuer risk in former times this was the basis of a gold exchange standard professor hanke s currency board is a rule based system designed to achieve the same thing once the system is in place every currency unit subsequently put into public circulation by the monetary authority must be physically backed by a defined weight of gold bullion this was the method of the gold exchange standard adopted by the bank of england under the terms of the bank charter act of 1844 a currency board system is not the best mechanism whereby currency is made exchangeable for gold its weakness is it relies on the state fulfilling its obligations soamerica reneged on its gold exchange standard in 1933 34 when it first banned gold ownership and then devalued the dollar that was simply theft by the state from its citizens therefore other safeguards for a gold exchange standard must be in place instead of nominal rates of 10 going on 20 and beyond a gold exchange standard will probably cap long term government borrowing rates in a two to five per cent range it also allows businesses with viable investment plans to progress as well not only is it an obvious solution but it is similar to that adopted in the uk following the napoleonic wars britain had government debt levels in 1815 greater than that of all advanced nations today relative to the size of her economy with the single exception of japan she introduced the gold sovereign coin in 1816 comprised of 0 2354 ounces of gold as circulating money with a face value of one pound this was achieved with sound money whose purchasing power rose significantly over those nine decades while the quality of life for everyone improved a sovereign was still one pound only it bought much more ordinary people were encouraged to work spend and save they aspired to make their families better off the vast majority succeeded and for those few unfortunates who fell by the wayside charitable institutions were set up by successful philanthropists to provide both housing and employment it was never the function of the state to support them it would be too much to claim that it was a perfect world or indeed that everyone behaved as gentlefolk with the best of victorian values but the difference between the successful laissez faire economy in britain with its relatively minor faults compared with the bureaucratic socialism that succeeded it is stark contrasting with socialist redistribution and wealth destruction which has steadily undermined formerly successful economies the manner of which is described in more detail in the following section for prescient politicians because the silent majority which just wants commercial stability in preference to state handouts if properly led will support a move away from destructive socialism it is not a simple task becausemonetarists are fully aware that if a government increases the quantity of money in circulation its purchasing power declines their theory is based on the days when gold was money and describes the effect of imports and exports of monetary gold on the general price level pure monetarists appear to assume the same is basically true of fiat currencies unbacked by gold but there is a fundamental difference when gold is used as money for settling cross border trade an arbitrage takes place correcting price differentials when prices are generally low in one country that country would achieve sales of commodities and goods in other countries where prices were higher gold then flows to the lower price centre raising its prices towards those of other countries with unbacked national currencies this does not happen instead national currencies earned through cross border trade are usually sold in the foreign exchanges and the determinant of trade flows is no longer an arbitrage based on a common form of money the pure link between money and trade has gone and whether foreigners retain or sell currency earned by exports depends mostly on their confidence in it that is a matter for speculation not trade domestic users of state issued currency are divorced from these issues because foreign currencies do not circulate domestically as a medium of exchange instead of being a form of money accepted beyond national boundaries as gold was formerly this is why monetarism which was based on gold as ubiquitous money is no longer the sole determinant of currency values it is true that an increase in the quantity of circulating money devalues the existing stock but if the population as a whole is prepared to increase its preference for money usually expressed as a savings ratio there need be no detrimental effect on its purchasing power with fiat currencies we enter a world where statistics reflect the quantity of money and never the confidence people have in it additionally we should observe thatas the following example illustrates imagine for a moment that modern statisticians and their methods existed at the time of the weimar republic government finances were covered by approximately ten per cent taxes and ninety per cent monetary inflation it was a government whose finances were run on the lines recommended by today s modern monetary theorists there can be no doubt the low level of taxation was an encouragement to business and permitted the redeployment of earnings for investment a falling exchange rate delivers excess profits for export businesses as well interest rates were attractive relative to the rate of price inflation and the economy statistically anyway was expanding rapidly this was certainly true measured in nominal gdp the basic measure of economic activity today which are always the latest gathered and indexed possibly two or even three which is the natural consequence of earlier debasement therefore even after an official price deflator is applied to nominal gdp real gdp growth in germany between 1918 and early 1923 would be judged by today s government economists to be booming interestingly and a raft of left leaning economists and politiciansfor venezuela s inflation ridden economy however instead of germany being deemed to be in an economic boom in 1920 economists in the classical and austrian traditions saw it for what it was even keynes wrote about it in his tract on monetary reform published coincidentally in late 1923 when the papiermark finally collapsed through the transfer of wealth and wages from private individuals to the state through monetary debasement as lenin is reputed to have said the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them down between the millstones of taxation and inflation in germany to finance a build up of armaments at the outbreak of war gold convertibility was suspended and the unbacked papiermark began its inflationary drift exploiting the facility to issue valueless pieces of paper as currency and for the people to circulate them as legal tender became the principal source of government funds this trick worked until approximately may 1923 by then the purchasing power of the mark had fallen consistently at a relatively even pace it was the katastrophenhausse or crack up boom the end of life for a state s unbacked currency firmly established in all fiat currency collapses which besides the currencies in existence today it is the familiar route along which the dollar and other paper currencies are travelling today in most major economies weimar style financing is set to return to centre stage the lesson from weimar and today s monetary inflation is that the period before the public cottons on to it can be prolonged in germany it was 1914 1923 followed by a swift seven month collapse but the final collapse could be as rapid as germany s between may and november 1923 doubtless we will see rising price inflation later this year but that statistic will continue to be suppressed with the gap between the effect of accelerating monetary inflation and the official rate of price inflation widening a major problem for governments when price inflation begins to rise isbecause markets alive to the decline in the currency s purchasing power will drive interest rates higher despite official attempts to suppress them so far the problem has been successfully covered up byand by government statisticiansin future efforts to keep a lid on reality will presumably intensify as a core feature of monetary and economic policy in light of another wave of monetary debasement if not the purchasing power of unbacked currencies will be visibly undermined by the erosion of public confidence in them we cannot know this outcome for sure until it is well on the way the lehman credit crisis led to a global explosion in the quantity of money as central banks worked in tandem to rescue the banks and the entire financial world that injection still circulates in the global blood stream a realistic assumption must be that this time the purchasing power of state currencies will be the victim of a severe monetary overdose this being the case there is bound to be an upward adjustment in nominal interest rates forced on central banks by the markets embarking on a modern equivalent of the papiermark route how else do you describe accelerated quantitative easing which by then should be heading considerably higher by becoming an alternative for people no longer content to retain bank deposits western governments are poorly equipped to make this decision there are a few people in the political establishment who might understand the choice the inflationists who form the overwhelming majority of experts and advisers these neo keynesians populate the central banks and government treasury departments almost to the exclusion of all other economic theorists spending ministers and secretaries of state will have to be told to reduce their power bases which goes against their personal ambitions and political instincts in favour of a brave statesman will be the free market instincts of the silent majority it is only at times of crisis that a statesman can muster this support in a different context churchill in 1940 comes to mind the public will not know the solution but with the right leadership they can be led along the path to economic and monetary salvation the message to the electorate must be the government owes you nothing and so that you can look after yourself the government must encourage individuals to accumulate personal wealth by removing taxation from savings the eurozone poses a particular challenge with one currency circulating between nineteen member states conventional opinion is that all the troubles visited on the pigs portugal italy greece and spain are due to an inflexible currency the us has a different but more worrying problem consequently the us government is taking destructive decisions since president trump was elected he accelerated inflationary financing late in the credit cycle in the belief it would lead to greater tax income in due course he has also replayed the smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 inmaga is a fateful combination of tax cuts and trade protectionism it is a curious form of self harm which backfires badly on american consumers and corporations and it does not help foster good relations with america s creditors who have allowed america to live beyond her means for decades for which interpret they are america s reluctant bankers as a consequence of a dollar glut in their hands combined with america s clumsy geopolitical manoeuvrings tic data for december showed foreigners sold a net 91 4bn the largest monthly outflow during trump s presidency and this only a few months after everyone believed foreigners were buying yet more dollars to service their own debts while ignoring its dependency on foreign finance america is trying to strangle china s economic and technical development but that horse has already bolted we were all warned this would happen in one form or another by halford mackinder over a hundred years ago america it appears is prepared to destroy herself rather than see mackinder s prophecy come true we can expect its economy along with all the others to decline significantly in the coming months it will be an encouragement for yet more inflationism the monetary expansion which is sure to follow is set to lead to an acceleration in the decline in the dollar s purchasing power asthis will lead to an increase in the value of time preference set by markets andunder current circumstances the 1980 81 volcker solution of raising interest rates to 20 to stabilise the currency does not appear to be available furthermore to reverse the nixon shock of 1971 andamerica which is very much the guilty party in destroying its own bretton woods monetary arrangements will find it very difficult to change its tack with such economic cluelessness at the top things are very different in asia the eight members of the shanghai cooperation organisation together with those seeking to join represent roughly half the world s population it is led by gold friendly china and russia a further two billion people can be said to be directly affected by the way the sco develops including the populous nations of south east asia the middle east and sub saharan africa that leaves america s questionable sphere of influence reduced to roughly one and a half billion souls out of a global population of seven it is proof of halford mackinder s foresight china and russia still have significant infrastructure plans which will stimulate eurasian economic activity for at least the next decade perhaps two if the formerly advanced national economies slump of course asia will be adversely affected but not as much as even china watchers fear the sco bloc could escape relatively lightly if it takes the right avoiding action she has sought to control the consequences of domestic monetary policy through strict exchange controls a strategy which has so far broadly succeeded the growing possibility of a dollar collapse will call for a radical change in china s monetary policy we know the direction this new policy will take from the actions of russia china and increasingly those of other sco members and that iswhile it is clear to us that china and russia understand the importance of gold as true money the russians seem to have a good grasp of the issues china had a good grasp therefore china is not wholly immune to the faults that are likely to destroy the dollar and other western currencies but the central message in china s successful cornering of the physical gold market is a switch will be made to sound money when it is strategically sensible despite the neo keynesians in it ranks it is therefore possible for them to contain government spending in an economic downturn not only can russia and china introduce a gold exchange standard and make it stick but fellow sco members and those nations tied to it can either introduce their own gold exchange standards or alternatively use gold backed roubles and yuan to anchor their currencies the economic and monetary direction taken by the sco in the coming years could turn out to be relatively successful at least compared with the difficulties faced by the welfare states such an outcome would be immensely positive for humanity as a whole and be a lifeline for those of us deluded into inflation funded socialism you never know it might even force spendthrift western governments to reform their ways and return to sound money policies the effect on the price of gold should be obvious it is said that foreign students in berlin in 1923 were able to buy houses with the spare change from their allowances sent to them by their parents usually in dollars or pounds dollars at that time were as good as gold today a currency board or gold exchange standard would have to be fixed at a rate significantly higher than current fiat currency prices mmt replicates the chartalist s state theory of money which became the end point of nineteenth century german socialism see table line 3 at the

china urged to avoid cautionary tale of japan and the plaza accord in currency deal with us amid reports that the united states will demand that china stop devaluing its currency as part of any trade agreement beijing has been urged to learn from the cautionary tale of japan which in 1985 agreed to a currency deal which has shouldered a good portion of the blame for its economy s disastrous lost decade the us demands that china limit the yuan s depreciation have been compared with the plaza accord under which japan france germany the united kingdom and the us agreed to push the value of the us dollar down against the japanese yen and german deutsche mark the five countries began selling large amounts of us dollars leading to a significant loss in dollar value the intervention resulted in the japanese yen doubling in value against the us dollar in under two and a half years japan was at the time an exporting powerhouse yen appreciation would have made its exports too expensive for many foreign buyers so the bank of japan aggressively intervened cutting interest rates five times in an effort to devalue the yen and keep exports competitive however low interest rates led to a boom in domestic lending a property bubble formed and stock market prices tripled even as asset quality nosedived japan s financial bubble inevitably burst pushing the country into a deflationary liquidity trap from which it is still trying to escape today china s modern trading relationship with the us has echoes of the us japan situation three decades ago japan ran a large trade surplus and was blamed for us job losses there were fears in washington that japan would overtake the us as the world s largest economy many of the same grievances exist today towards china indeed as well as currency intervention snapback tariffs were also used against japan these are currently being considered by us trade negotiators as they attempt to thrash out a deal that would curtail china s economic rise however analysts are reluctant to make too much of the comparison a lot of people are making comparisons of china s situation with japan s plaza accord but china is very alert about what happened to japan and would want to avoid repeating the same mistakes said gao qi currency strategist at scotiabank said nathan chow economist at dbs bank said that china may be reluctant to sign a new version of the plaza accord since it could lead to lower interest rates fuelling new bubbles in china s stock and property markets as japan experienced in the 1990s it would be difficult for chinese authorities to manage its economic cycle if it needed to control the currency in a way that created market distortions china may simply accept a framework of keeping the exchange value of the yuan stable without offering much operational detail chow said voices in the chinese media have been looking to a more recent currency deal as a potential blueprint for a china us currency agreement the us mexico canada agreement usmca the revamped north american free trade agreement signed last year contains a currency clause which could set a precedent of future us trade agreements according to a post by taoran biji a widely regarded government related wechat account the clause demands that currencies are market determined and that signatories avoid competitive devaluation as a means of gaining a competitive advantage in trade it is the first time such a clause had been included in a major trade agreement china has previously signed up to to commitments at the g20 and international monetary fund that bar it from competitive devaluation however critics claim that china has not upheld these commitments in an interview with the financial times last year us treasury secretary steven mnuchin noted that the yuan had fallen significantly over the course of 2018 as we look at trade issues there is no question that we want to make sure china is not doing competitive devaluations he said arthur kroeber co founder and research head at gavekal dragonomics said that a currency agreement would be aimed at satisfying the demands of mnuchin a more dovish presence in the us administration compared to hardliners such as us trade representative robert lighthizer an exchange rate agreement is just a way for beijing to collude with trump administration doves like stephen mnuchin to trumpet a non event as a big us victory kroeber wrote former us federal reserve chair janet yellen last week that it is difficult and treacherous to define when a country is manipulating its currency warning us trade negotiators to think twice about asking china to maintain a stable yuan exchange rate countries should be allowed to use monetary policy tools that would ultimately have a systematic effect on a country s exchange rate yellen said so we would want to be careful not to define domestic policy tools as currency manipulation she said the us treasury has so far refrained from formally labelling china currency manipulator ostensibly due to a lack of evidence source south china morning post
read today s mccrone articles the full report mr reid scottish economic planning department new st andrew s house st james centre edinburgh eh13ta telephone 031 556 840 ext 4017 j garlick esq cabinet office great george street london sw1 23 april 1975 at the meeting which you held last week on various aspects of north sea oil and devolution i suggested that i might send in the attached paper in the hope that it would serve as a starting point for any assessment the unit may wish to carry out on the economics of scottish independence the paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the february 1974 election this will be particularly apparent of page 5 where of course the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the conservative government i have not attempted to update any of the figures since although there would be differences these do not seem to me to be such as to alter the argument as you will realise the debate on scottish nationalism has been founded to a surprising extent on economic arguments ad the purpose of this paper was to examine how far this was affected by north sea oil the first part goes through most of the usual arguments which have been used against the nationalists in the past with fairly convincing effect the second part sets out the sort of economic strategy which an snp government might try to follow indicating both the dangers and the possibilities as i said at the meeting one can reach almost any conclusion depending upon the assumptions that are made about tariffs a common currency a scottish government s spending priorities and its success in controlling inflation my paper may give an snp government the benefit of too many doubts but i was anxious to see whether a credible economic strategy could be put together which would appear to be more convincing in terms of solving scotland s traditional economic problems than the regional policies of the unionist governments have been up until now i think the conclusion is that the most convincing way of taking the wind out of the snp s sails is by demonstrating that we now have policies which can make major in roads into these problems when my paper was written it was classified secret and given only a most restricted circulation in the scottish office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject i am copying it now to leo pliatzky dick ross jim hamilton john liverman and stuart scott whyte rgl mccrone secret the economics of nationalism re examined it is commonplace that the discovery of north sea oil and entry to the eec are factors of major economic significance for scotland already both issues especially the former feature widely in the snp s election material the purpose of this paper is to reassess the economic arguments for an independent scotland in the light of these developments especially the discovery of oil it will be shown that the whole framework within which the economic implications of nationalism were argued has indeed been altered the importance of this is probably greater than is recognised at present by the majority of the public and it may well be therefore that the discovery of north sea oil will come to be seen as something of a watershed in scotland s economic and political life the case for scottish nationalism is of course very much more than an economic issue this paper makes no attempt to examine the wider questions suffice it to say that scottish nationalism has been much more concerned with economic prosperity than nationalist movements in other countries unlike wales there is no great cultural movement attaching to the preservation of a language the main cause of discontent is the country s unsatisfactory economic performance over the last half century especially the persistent unemployment and net emigration above all in the west of scotland poor social and environmental conditions especially in and around the city of glasgow accompany this outdated economic framework and are as much a source discontent despite regional policy and the efforts of planners these problems have not been overcome nor do they look as if they will be in the foreseeable future the snp have therefore based their campaign on the assertion that scotland would be economically better off independent and it is for this reason that budgetary estimates have always featured so large in the controversy yet in spite of scotland s undoubtedly poor economic performance the snp case until recently lack credibility most people regarded both their statistics and arguments suspect and they continued to believe that scotland derived more economic advantage than disadvantage from the union the importance of north sea oil is that it raises just this issue in a more acute form than at any other time since the act of union was passed the case against nationalism the traditional economic case against nationalism has always been that a politically independent scotland would be unable to gain sufficient economic sovereignty to solve her problems successfully this is partly a question of the scale of the scottish economy but more of the extent to which it has become integrated with that of the rest of the uk over the last 270 years scotland needs a faster rate of economic growth than either she or the uk has had in recent years if she is to absorb her excess labour resources and thereby cut down both unemployment and migration there are three principal ways in which an independent government might seek to bring this about first it could seek to foster and protect scottish industry by means of tariffs and import controls but such measures would risk retaliation from england which given scotland s close trade ties with england could cause damage far in excess of any benefit that may be hoped for such policies would also be incompatible with continued membership of the eec and withdrawal especially with england wales and ireland remaining members would clearly have very damaging consequences secondly fiscal policies might be used to give especially large benefits to new industrial investment or tax relief and subsidies to existing industry this might involve the imposition of a tax frontier at the border as still exists between most eec countries but this need not to make it impractical such policies have been used with considerable success by the irish republic since the mid 1950s the main disadvantage is that england would probably feel obliged to match the scottish measures with equivalent in grants or tax allowances for industry in english and welsh development areas up to now england has always been in a position financially where if she wished she could have more than matched any measures which a scottish government would be able to afford it is here that the budgetary position of a scottish government becomes important various studies notably the treasury s scottish budget of 1967 68 and the work of the kilbrandon commission have shown that public expenditure per head in scotland is generally above the uk average whereas public revenue is scotland is slightly lower largely because scottish incomes are below the uk average the result is that budgetary estimates for scotland show a proportionately larger borrowing requirement than for the uk as a whole his position is confirmed in the most recent estimate of scotland s budgetary position carried out by the economic and statistics unit of sepd for 1971 72 this shows a scottish current account surplus of 24m but a net borrowing requirement of 447m overall there are of course various ways in which this could be tackled in the first place it is not necessary to balance the budget to finance loans and various items of capital investment particularly those which yield a return by borrowing is quite reasonable other items too may be covered by borrowing from time to time particularly if an expansionary budget is necessary to generate a higher level of economic activity in the economy for these various reasons the united kingdom budget normally involves a net borrowing requirement and whilst this will normally be fairly small this is not always so in the present year for example the borrowing requirement reached the record figure of 4 000m if allowance is made for the capital items that it would normally be reasonable to finance by loan this would still lave a scottish deficit of over 200m a very similar figure in 1971 72 to what it was in 1967 68 whilst such a figure could be covered if it arose only exceptionally it could not be tolerated as a regular feature of the budget it would involve a steadily increasing scottish debt and it would have serious implications both for interest rates and monetary policy unless a substantial part of it could be financed from abroad a scottish government would therefore have to take steps to reduce the deficit either by raising taxes or cutting expenditure such measures are perfectly possible and on the scale necessary need not provoke a intolerable situation especially if defence was one of the items cut but they would create a background of acute budgetary stringency against which it is hard to see it being possible to provide a major fiscal stimulus to encourage economic expansion the third possible course of action would be to devalue the scottish currency this would stimulate economic activity by increasing the demand for exports and making scottish goods more competitive against imports in their home market in many respects devaluation would be the obvious measure for an economy in scotland s condition with persistent unemployment a budgetary deficit and probably a serious adverse balance on the balance of payments indeed if the later was persistent it might be that devaluation would be inescapable exchange rate adjustment is of course the ultimate and most effective weapon by which an economically sovereign state maintains approximately full employment while at the same time avoiding balance of payments disequilibrium indeed if scotland could have devalued by a good thumping 2 percent and made the adjustment effective in terms of costs this would be by far the best way of solving scotland s economic problems of the last two decades it has been argued that the regional problem only arises because exchange rate adjustment the normal way of dealing with disequilibria between countries is not possible between regions however the economic case against scottish nationalism has always at bottom come down to the proposition that an independent scotland would not find it possible to carry out an effective devaluation to be effective devaluation involves a country in making a cut in its real living standards at least until such time as production is able to catch up but the scottish labour market is so closely linked with that of the rest of the uk that it is hard to see how real earnings could be adjusted downwards without giving rise to the most serious difficulties for such a small country heavily dependent of international trade devaluation would of course have serious inflationary consequences since all imports would rise in price trade unions are to a large extent on a great britain basis and it is hard to see them accepting a deliberate attempt to cut real wages in scotland compared with england whatever the reason for it may be furthermore even with independence freedom of labour movement between england and scotland would be likely to continue a common language and two and a half centuries of free movement make this easy changes in real wage levels would therefore be likely to be reflected in migration figures and could lead to a shortage of certain types of skilled labour in scotland even while a surplus among the less mobile unskilled persisted it is for these reasons that many economists have in the past concluded that scotland if she were independent would probably be unable to devalue effectively against the rest of the united kingdom lacking this ultimate weapon of economic sovereignty and limited by the budgetary situation in the use she could make of fiscal policy it did not seem that political independence would give scotland sufficient economic sovereignty to enable her to tackle her economic problems successfully at the same time whatever the constitutional set up the scottish economy would remain closely integrated with that of the rest of the uk and would be greatly affected by policy decisions taken in london though as an independent state her ability to influence those decisions would be greatly reduced the implications of north sea oil the analysis in the last section is based on the situation as it appeared before the discovery of north sea oil even after its discovery the full significance of north sea oil was not immediately apparent and it still remains in large measure disguised from the scottish public by the dti s failure to make provision for a proper government return when the fourth round of licences was issued so far all that ministers have said is that they expect north sea oil to be yielding 70 100m tons of oil per annum by 1980 and that on that basis the government revenue from rent and royalties from the whole of the continental shelf including the gas fields in the southern sector may be of the order of 100m per annum at that time it has been explained that this estimate does not include the yield from ordinary taxation on the oil companies and it has been stated that licensing policy is currently under review but the significance of this has probably not been fully appreciated by the public the snp countered these figures by claiming that north sea oil should by 1980 be yielding a government revenue of approximately 800m and have charged the government with giving scottish oil away to the international companies ridiculously cheap up to now much of the scottish public may have regarded the snp figures as pretty wild and they have been publicly condemned as such by ministers but authoritative support for the charge that the government has failed to do a satisfactory bargain with the companies is provided in the criticisms of the public accounts committee which so far remain unanswered the example of norwegian policy on government revenue from oil likewise shows up the failure of british the government s reveiw of licensing policy has been in progress since the early summer of 1973 this has confirmed the total inadequacy of arrangements to secure government revenue and shows that some of the most attractive measures to put this right would involve breaking the terms on which the licences were given it is partly for this reason that the government has so far failed to take a decision the choice lying between carried interest ie state participation which would provide the biggest revenue and also give some power of control but would go back on the terms of the licences and excess revenue tax from which the return in 1980 would be some 200m less but would be defensible in international law the dti estimates of last summer showed that total government revenue following adoption of these measures would have been between 800m and 1 200m a year in 1980 depending on the system used and the prices prevailing in 1980 today following the huge increase in international oil prices of recent months the corresponding figures are in the range of 1 500m to over 3 000m thus all that is wrong now with the snp estimate is that it is far too low there is a prospect of government oil revenues in 1980 which could greatly exceed the present government revenue in scotland from all sources and could even be comparable in size to the whole of the scottish national income in 1970 as well as the gain to the government revenue north sea oil will of course make a massive contribution to the balance of payments indeed these two aspects are closely linked at present world prices the expected output of 100m tons of oil in 1980 is worth approximately 3 000m assuming price rises from the present 33 a ton to 51 a ton as in the government revenue calculations the value could be as high as 5 000m part of this will of course be repatriated by the international companies in the form of profits distributed to their shareholders or reinvested in projects in other areas the balance of payments gain to scotland would therefore depend critically on the amount of government revenue secured from the profits indeed since none of the major companies operating in the north sea are predominantly scottish owned the government revenue would be the major element apart from the expenditure of the companies on goods and services produced in scotland which would accrue from the value of oil produced as a balance of payments gain thus assuming measures which would yield government revenue of the scale referred to in previous paragraphs plus some additional revenue to shareholders in scotland and to suppliers of equipment then the net balance of payments gain might be expected to lie very approximately in the range of 2 000m to 3 500m a year depending on prices and the share of the government take it is not possible to compare these figures with an accurate estimate of scotland s present balance of payments position from the state of scotland s economy one would expect a balance of payments deficit on current account and a rough comparison of income and expenditure estimates for gdp suggest that this could be of the order of 300m a year in 1970 71 plainly this is a most unreliable figure and it will vary from year to year but it is probably sufficient to suggest the orders of magnitude what is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from north sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus all the above figures are of course based on the estimated output of 100m tons of oil in 1980 this was the dti s revised estimate in the early summer of 1973 already it is beginning to look as if these estimates may be too conservative recent finds and the plans of companies appear to indicate that the shetland basin may prove very productive indeed zetland county council s consultants worked on the assumption that 70m tons a year might actually be piped ashore in the county it is now known that shell expect to land 50m tons a year through their own pipe alone and pipelines may also be expected from total s alwyn field conoco s hutton and the recent bp and burmah finds in addition to this there are of course substantial finds further south particularly bp s forties field and occidental s piner whether or not this plus any new finds that are made result in the 1980 estimate of 100m tons being exceeded largely depends on how quickly newly discovered fields are brought into production but it does now seem extremely likely that production during the 1980s will use well above 100m tons a year with consequent increases in revenue and gain to the balance of payments can one be certain that the oil is without doubt a scottish asset or even if it is that these substantial revenues and balance of payments advantages would indeed accrue to an independent scotland clearly these questions raise complicated issues in international law which could if allowed occupy the legal profession for many years two possible lines of argument may be expected either that scotland should pay england some compensation for appropriating the most productive part of the continental shelf or that the whole shelf should be regarded as the common property of the nations of the former united kingdom with revenue distributed in accordance with some population based formula irrespective of where oil is discovered as regards the first of the arguments the prospective return from oil revenue would at the very least be one of the factors taken into account in determining the financial settlement between the two countries when they become independent to argue the second would be directly counter to the line that the uk government has taken with the eec that the resources of the continental shelf are as much a national asset as are those on land like coal mines and that there is therefore no question of the europeanisation of north sea oil disputes on these matters might well occasion much bitterness between the two countries but it is hard to see any conclusion other than to allow scotland to have that part of the continental shelf which would have been hers if she had been independent all along there might be some argument about where the boundary between english and scottish waters would lie at present this is considered to be along the line of latitude which lies just north of berwick on tweed and it might perhaps be held that it should run ne sw as an extension of the border this could have the effect of transferring the small oilfields in the south auk and argyll to the english sector but would not affect the main finds it must be concluded therefore that large revenues and balance of payments gains would indeed accrue to a scottish government in the event of independence provided that steps were taken either by carried interest or by taxation to secure the government take undoubtedly this would banish any anxieties the government might have had about its budgetary position or its balance of payments the country would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree and its currency would become the hardest in europe with the exception perhaps of the norwegian kroner just as deposed monarchs and african leaders have in the past used the swiss franc as a haven of security so now would the scottish pound be seen as a good hedge against inflation and devaluation and the scottish banks could expect to find themselves inundated with a speculative inflow of foreign funds ii a policy for development the situation described in the first part of this paper is indeed an astounding reversal of the problems which are usually considered in a scottish or british context but it could nonetheless give rise to some serious difficulties and would require careful handling if scotland was really to derive maximum benefit from it it is of course perfectly possible that these difficulties would not be overcome and that an independent scotland despite its wealth would continue to have an unsatisfactory economic performance it takes more than money to eliminate the traditional problems of the scottish economy and nationalist movements dependent as they are on strong emotional pressures have not always been notable for their economic realism in this respect the example of ireland s poor economic performance between 1922 and 1956 comes immediately to mind and the snp is already showing signs of making promises which could be an embarrassment to its economic management nevertheless it is obvious that the surpluses from north sea oil would open up new opportunities for a nationalist government the purpose of this second part of the paper is therefore to consider in very brief outline some of the policies a nationalist government could follow to try to bring about the development and prosperity of the country as a whole scotland s central economic problem is to secure a faster rate of economic growth so that she can raise income levels and absorb the excess labour which presently appears as high unemployment and emigration as has been explained this is a situation which would normally point to devaluation as a possible remedy north sea oil however by giving the country a chronic balance of payments surplus would rule out any possibility of devaluation indeed it is hard to see how an upward valuation of the currency could be avoided obviously this pressure should be resisted as far as possible but unless there was a remarkable change in the strength of sterling it must be expected that the scots pound would rise in relation to it fairly soon after independence especially if the latter continues its downward slide a revaluation would give rise to none of the difficulties which were argued earlier to apply to a scottish devaluation since the effect would be to reduce prices and raise incomes there would not be the same resistance to making it effective in scotland an exchange rate of 1 scots to 120p sterling within two years of independence therefore seems quite probable this exchange rate movement would improve scottish real incomes imports would all become cheaper and gdp per head in scotland which would include the value of the oil produced would rise smartly the gap between scottish income per head and english would probably soon be eliminated and might well be reversed the danger is that with a rising currency scotland s traditional economy would find it more and more difficult to compete manufactured exports would be priced out of foreign markets and imports would become highly competitive at home tourists would find that the rate of exchange made scotland a very expensive country for holidays and scottish farmers would find that the eec s common agricultural policy gave them a much less satisfactory level of support than expected thus there would be grave risk that the economy would be driven more and more to depend on the oil industry and other activities would tend to wither but while oil would give scotland a good income it could never be an adequate source of employment with the rest of the economy in decline scotland therefore could face the danger of prosperity coupled with continuing or even worsening unemployment and emigration to counteract this situation it would be essential to try to keep the surpluses on the balance of payments down and thereby reduce the upward pressure on the exchange rate this could involve extensive lending abroad whether to england the eec or under developed countries such lending could well be in scotland s interest rather than face the prospect of an intolerably high exchange rate it might also do much to help cement relations with other eec countries and coupled with the supplies of oil for export would make scotland a highly desirable member of eec with a strong bargaining position the first priority however would be to spend the surpluses as far as possible in developing scotland s domestic economy and providing a modern infrastructure the following paragraphs suggest how this might be done a manufacturing industry output per head in most sectors of scottish industry is well below european levels this is largely because the british economy has invested much less than other european countries over the last 25 years a substantial increase in manufacturing investment is therefore necessary if this is to be put right only then will scottish industry be able to compete effectively with other members of eec at anything other than low exchange rates part of the reason for the low investment in scotland in the past has been the persistence of stop go in the uk economy every time investment has begun to rise satisfactorily as it was doing in 1973 the emergence of a balance of payments deficit has forced the government to take strong deflationary measures with the result that the investment boom has petered out again scotland made good progress in 1973 but ideally from her point of view the 5 per cent growth rate needed to go on for another couple of years as an independent state scotland s balance of payments position would enable her to break out of the stop go cycle and a sustained rate of growth could be planned on the basis that it could be carried on for at least a decade the strength of the currency coupled with the budgetary surplus would help to keep interest rates down and there would be no need for sudden increases in taxation or massive cuts in public expenditure admittedly since scotland is so closely tied to the english market her economy would continue to be affected by measures taken in london but this effect would diminish the more scotland expands trade with other eec countries furthermore it would be quite proper for a scottish government to take countervailing measures to stimulate the scottish economy at times when england was going through a recession such measures would help to keep scottish output up and would help the english economy by reducing the scottish balance of payments surplus it can be expected therefore that the prospect of sustained expansion and an end to stop go would do more than anything else could both to raise investment in domestic industry and to encourage foreign investment to come to scotland however this expansionary macroeconomic policy would need to be backed up by firm regional policy measures the position in west central scotland has deteriorated vis a vis the rest of scotland over the last decade and this is likely to be even more accentuated by north sea oil developments furthermore as an independent state it would seem to be quite inappropriate for scotland to regard the whole of the territory as subject for regional policy something along the lines of the following package of measures therefore seems to be most appropriate i for scotland as a whole the regional development grant would be abolished but to stimulate investment corporation tax would either be abolished or reduced to a purely nominal rate this would have the effect of more or less removing the tax from industry s retained profits while leaving distributed profits taxed roughly as they are at present as a national fiscal policy measure it would not come within the control of the eec s ceilings on regional aids the cost of abolishing corporation tax would be 120m ii west central scotland would be scheduled as scotland s development area and the definition could be extended to certain smaller areas in the highlands and islands if necessary within this area there would be a 20 per cent regional development grant paid as at present in addition to i above iii there would be a scottish development authority covering the whole of scotland but with instructions to give particular priority to west central scotland its budget would at least be on a scale equivalent to the funds which previously went into rep and sido it would be empowered to give discretionary grants and loans and would be equipped to provide advice to companies it would be responsible for working out a strategy for developing scotland s domestic industry as well as promoting foreign investment the hidb would continue to operate with its own much wider remit in the highlands iv steps would be taken to strengthen the shipbuilding industry by adopting a scheme for insurance against inflationary risk as operated in france and approved by eec the new sda would be especially charged with the preparation of proposals for the modernisation of the industry b construction the construction industry employs a substantial part of the labour force and its fluctuations have been a major factor in unemployment in 1971 no less than 25 000 of the 100 000 unemployed were registered as construction workers in times of boom the shortage of skilled labour in the industry becomes a serious bottleneck in the economy although coupled with continuing large numbers of unskilled unemployment the industry does not play as large a part in the british economy as in most other european countries and this coupled with the manifest need for urban rebuilding and house replacement suggest that with the proper policy the industry could play a much larger part in providing steady employment for the scottish labour force indeed if the scottish construction industry employed 10 per cent of the labour force the eec average this would mean employment for an additional 40 thousand with north sea oil revenues public expenditure on construction projects could be greatly stepped up and a major operation should be mounted to carry on the rebuilding of glasgow and do much more than has been done in the past for environmental recovery this would probably require a special environmental recovery agency to assist the local authorities rather in the way that ssha operates housing policy has been bedevilled in the past by the subsidisation of certain types of housing this has led to the colossal public housing sector in scotland with the emphasis on quantity rather than quality it seems desirable to subsidise housing for many years to come both to improve the living conditions of the scottish people and to keep up the demand on the construction industry instead of subsidising rents at one extreme and at the other giving tax relief on mortgages which is greater the larger the mortgage it would seem much more appropriate to give the assistance to individuals regardless of the type of house they occupy or whether they are tenants or owners this could probably be done under the new tax credit system and it would have the effect of providing a housing subsidy or negative tax to those with low incomes and a housing tax allowance to others in this way demand for housing as a whole could be encouraged while avoiding the distortion between different types of housing which has been such a feature of the past it would be likely that local authority housing would then gradually decline in importance and housing associations would assume greater prominence as competition between different forms of housing increased so the quality of housing would improve c service industry in the past service industry has received much less assistance from regional policy than manufacturing in part this is right because many service activities such as medical services education accountants distribution are governed simply by local demand but there are service activities notably major offices which have a choice of location and every effort should be made to attract them to areas where labour is available following independence the increased government activity would largely wipe out any spare labour resources in edinburgh but major efforts would be needed to promote commercial and office development in glasgow the scottish development authority should be empowered to offer assistance comparable in scale to that available to manufacturing industry to encourage such development in the glasgow conurbation and the system of property rating should be revised if not abolished to prevent high rates being a brake on commercial development as they have been in the past tourist development would obviously assume major importance for any independent scotland and the financial resources available to the tourist board could be increased d the pace of north sea oil development on the face of it the pace of development of north sea oil appropriate for scotland would be very different from that now being demanded by the uk apart from the need to avoid piling up excessive surpluses scotland would wish to extend her north sea oil revenue over a much longer period than the 30 or so years which seems likely at presently planned rates of extraction it is also desirable to avoid the frenzied peaks of activity which seem likely in shetland the moray firth and loch carron on present plans these will impose immense infrastructure demands lead to a substantial inflow of population and leave in their wake problems of readjustment and unemployment which it may take years of regional policy to overcome in addition the contribution of scottish industry to oil developments which is so far disappointing might be increased substantially if the whole programme is not required to go at the maximum possible speed from a purely scottish point of view this suggests that a production flow of say 50m tons a year might be ideal even this would be five times scotland s present consumption and yield and annual revenue of between 700m and 1 500m however one cannot look at the scottish position in isolation if because of action in the middle east there is a serious energy shortage in europe scotland would undoubtedly suffer severely from the resulting slump it would therefore be in scotland s interests to increase her oil production well beyond what would otherwise seem desirable if however there is no serious shortage in physical terms merely a crisis of price then action by scotland is not going to affect the international price of oil nor will it matter to the other countries what the source of their oil is e inflation income policy and training the strength of the scottish exchange rate and the low interest rates which would result from the budgetary and balance of payments position would do much to reduce inflationary pressure a major part of the british inflation has resulted from the downward drift of the currency and the consequent rise in import prices the absence of this relaxations in taxation and subsidies for housing would no doubt help to reduce the pressure of wage increases nevertheless as scotland moved nearer full employment serious shortages of certain types of skilled labour would occur and this would tend to produce acute inflationary pressure some form of incomes policy is clearly going to be a continuing feature of advanced economies and would be essential in scotland if the economy was not to price itself out of international markets it is important to recognise however that the labour shortages which give rise to the pressure could be avoided to a considerable degree if training schemes were more flexible and if a substantial increased effort was put into retraining a full scale examination of training is clearly an early priority the european community membership of the eec affects the economics of scottish independence in several important respects it guarantees access to english and continental markets in a way which would not be possible otherwise without eec scotland would always run the risk that england might find it expedient to impose an import surcharge a quantitative control or even a tariff on goods coming from scotland it was largely to eliminate this that scotland accepted the union of 1707 new eec rules would have the same effect and for all nine member states in the unlikely event of england leaving the eec scottish access to the other countries could in time largely compensate for any restrictions that might arise on english trade access to eec should also help to provide a major stimulus to scottish industrial investment the eec is not only a bigger market than the uk but its economy has been much more buoyant than that of britain there is no doubt that the exclusion of the united kingdom had a damaging effect on investment and that foreign firms in particular preferred development within eec to gain the full advantage of this stimulus from membership it will of course be necessary to have a stable domestic economy high rates of inflation and a declining currency such as the uk has had recently would do much to discourage foreign companies from coming to scotland north sea oil could have far reaching consequences for scottish membership of eec because of the tremendously increased political power it would confer without oil other members might pay little enough regard to scotland her voting power would not be large and it might indeed be argued that she could exert more leverage on the community as part of the united kingdom as the major producer of oil in western europe however scotland would be in a key position and other countries would be extremely foolish if they did not seek to do all they could to accommodate scottish interests for scotland the net cost of common agricultural policy which features so large in british discussions would be at most some 40m a year a small sum compared with the balance of payments gain from north sea oil the more common policies come to be decided in brussels in the years ahead the more scotland would benefit from having her own commissioner in the eec as of right and her own voice in the council of ministers instead of relying on the indirect and so far hardly satisfactory form of vicarious representation through uk departments conclusion this paper has shown that the advent of north sea oil has completely overturned the traditional economic arguments used against scottish nationalism an independent scotland could now expect to have massive surpluses both on its budget and on its balance of payments and with the proper husbanding of resources this situation could last for a very long time into the future wealth does not automatically mean full employment and the end of net emigration but provided sensible policies are pursued it is possible to see how this situation could be used to re equip scottish industry and renew outworn social capital thereby providing the expansion necessary to absorb scotland s excess labour and the increase in productivity required to raise incomes thus for the first time since the act of union was passed it can now be credibly argued that scotland s economic advantage lies in its repeal when this situation comes to be fully appreciated in the years ahead it is likely to have a major impact on scottish politics since it is on social and political grounds alone that the case for retention of the union will in future have to be based nationalist policy as outlined in this paper can of course be regarded as extremely selfish undoubtedly it is but it can be argued in reply that so long as scottish gdp per head is only 70 per cent of the european average the unemployment and emigration rates among the highest and the country regarded by the eec as one of its worst problem regions then scotland is justified in using her own resources to rectify these problems rather than relying on the generosity of others at least until she has managed to catch up yet undoubtedly the greatest weakness in the nationalist economic case is that scotland even with its oil cannot expect to prosper in isolation economic conditions in europe and above all in england with whom scotland will remain closely tied in trade are of particular importance even with greater diversification of scottish trade to europe and to north america an impoverished england or one perpetually suffering the rigours of demand restraint would have most serious consequences for the scottish economy britain is now counting so heavily on north sea oil to redress its balance of payments that it is easy to imagine england in dire straits without it the oil prices since the yom kippur war make this a much more serious matter than could have been imagined before and it is now likely that transfer of north sea oil to scottish ownership would occasion much bitterness in england if not an attempt to forcibly prevent it england would of course be no worse off than most of the continental eec countries in this respect indeed probably there are better chances of finding oil in the celtic sea or the english channel than are open to most of them if therefore the other countries can adjust to the new energy situation england should be able as well nevertheless it is now clear as perhaps never before that europe could bring about its economic ruin by disunity if supplies of oil become seriously restricted or the burden on the balance of payments of importing countries proves more than the international monetary system can cope with a serious breakdown in the economic system of western europe could well result this danger imposes serious international responsibilities on those european countries which are likely to be exporters of energy norway scotland if independent and ireland where oil is likely to be discovered a spirit of european co operation is not very evident yet either in discussions or plans for the development of energy and the rather nationalistic attitude so far followed by britain would hardly be a good example to an independent scotland yet the situation offers the energy producers a real opportunity to contribute to the economic strength of europe and in so doing to ensure their own prosperity if instead they retreat into narrow nationalism developing their energy resources with regard to their own interests alone they could undermine the whole european economy and seal their own fate in the process perhaps the most important conclusion is that time is now extremely limited british regional policy has been in operation for forty years and the annual cost of the measures applied to scotland is now about 100m a year but although there have been undoubtedly been notable achievements and the scottish economy would have been in a much worse state without such a policy there is still little prospect that it will solve the problems of west central scotland in the foreseeable future high hopes have been held out for european regional policy but any impact from this is likely to be very small for a long time to come in much the same way agitation for a workable form of political devolution has persisted amongst a substantial part of the scottish electorate for a considerable time but without any practical result so far and it is still far from clear whether anything will stem from the consideration of the kilbrandon report if in five years time north sea oil is contributing massively to the uk budget while the economic and social condition of west central scotland continues in the poor state that it is today it would be hard to imagine conditions more favourable to the growth of support for the nationalist movement very determined steps to urgently transform economic conditions in scotland will therefore be necessary and the scottish people will have to be persuaded that their problems really have received the attention and expenditure

www americantower com non gaap and defined financial measures in addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap provided throughout this press release the company has presented the following non gaap and defined financial measures gross margin operating profit operating profit margin adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nareit funds from operations ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated adjusted funds from operations affo affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated affo per share affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders per share free cash flow net debt net leverage ratio and indian carrier consolidation driven churn iccc in addition the company presents tenant billings tenant billings growth organic tenant billings growth and new site tenant billings growth these measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the company s core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group as outlined in detail below the company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods particularly where acquisitions or non operating factors including historical cost basis are involved the company s non gaap and defined financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies revenue components in addition to reporting total revenue the company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for and operating performance of its real estate portfolio accordingly the company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components i tenant billings ii new site tenant billings iii organic tenant billings iv international pass through revenue v straight line revenue vi pre paid amortization revenue vii foreign currency exchange impact and viii other revenue tenant billings the majority of the company s revenue is generated from non cancellable long term tenant leases revenue from tenant billings reflects several key aspects of the company s real estate business i colocations amendments reflects new tenant leases for space on existing towers and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment ii escalations reflects contractual increases in billing rates which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index iii cancellations reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non renewals or in limited circumstances when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced and iv new sites reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions new site tenant billings day one tenant billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior year period incremental colocations amendments escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in new site tenant billings the company believes providing new site tenant billings enhances an investor s ability to analyze the company s existing real estate portfolio growth as well as its development program growth as the company s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period organic tenant billings tenant billings on sites that the company has owned since the beginning of the prior year period as well as tenant billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the company s portfolio international pass through revenue a portion of the company s pass through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices as a result revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period which is not representative of the company s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs furthermore this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the company s markets as a result the company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass through revenue on certain revenue growth rates straight line revenue under gaap the company recognizes revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases due to the company s significant base of non cancellable long term tenant leases this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals typically increases when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred these signings and renewals are only a portion of the company s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our tenant billings growth as a result the company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures pre paid amortization revenue the company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants these upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on its real estate portfolio i e does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do the company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business foreign currency exchange impact the majority of the company s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country s local currency as a result foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from period to period depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the u s dollar the company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business other revenue other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue non gaap and defined financial measure definitions tenant billings growth the increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of tenant billings for a current period with tenant billings for the corresponding prior year period in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring tenant billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio organic tenant billings growth the portion of tenant billings growth attributable to organic tenant billings the company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness and therefore the value of the company s property assets new site tenant billings growth the portion of tenant billings growth attributable to new site tenant billings the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to tenant billings from recently acquired or constructed properties indian carrier consolidation driven churn iccc tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short term carrier consolidation in india includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation but excludes normal course churn the company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event gross margin revenues less operating expenses excluding stock based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations depreciation amortization and accretion selling general administrative and development expense and other operating expenses the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site level profitability of its assets operating profit gross margin less selling general administrative and development expense excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments for segment reporting purposes in periods through the third quarter of 2018 the latin america property segment operating profit and gross margin also include interest income expense tv azteca net operating profit and gross margin are before interest income interest expense gain loss on retirement of long term obligations other income expense net income loss attributable to

from equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of long term obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stock based compensation expense the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations in addition it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector adjusted ebitda margin the percentage that results from dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenue nareit funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interests the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above particularly depreciation expenses given the high initial up front capital intensity of the company s operating model in addition it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector consolidated adjusted funds from operations affo nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders before i straight line revenue and expense ii stock based compensation expense iii the deferred portion of income tax iv non real

income expense vii gain loss on retirement of long term obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interests less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above which if unadjusted may cause material fluctuations in nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of the company s property assets in those periods in addition it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector adjusted funds from operations affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated affo excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders and the other line

affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less total

of its ipo in september 1993 our company was valued at mxn1 billion today our company is valued at almost mxn13 billion 13 times its original market value for an annual total return to shareholders of over 19 2 in 1994 we took our first step abroad with the acquisition of coca cola buenos aires in argentina in 2003 we see the leadership position of the beverage industry with the transformational acquisition of panamco expanding our presence to nine of latin america s most important markets and multiplying our volumes six times from 2008 to 2016 we strengthened our company s leadership

philippines as the best course of action for our company s shareholders looking forward we will continually evaluate geographic and category opportunities maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation to maximize our shareholders returns with that in mind 2018 was a year of restructuring and transformation marked by first the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operation at the end of 2017 secondly the sale of the stake of the philippines at the end of 2018 thirdly the integration of three new franchises in guatemala and uruguay and fourth the adoption of hyperinflationary accounting in argentina moreover in the face of a complex volatile macroeconomic environment in some of our markets we put coca cola femsa on an extremely solid financial foundation we not only reduced our net leverage position but also affirmed our credit ratings by moody s and standard and poor s we reported solid comparable topline growth of close to 6 for 2018 our revenue management initiatives backed by analytics and deployed in an agile and assertive way directly in each point of sale allowed us to create comparable volumes 1 2 and growth of 1 2 while prices were ahead of or in line with inflation in most of our operations our comparable operating income increased 5 5 compared to last year as lower sweetener costs a favorable currency hedging position in south america and operating expenses expense efficiencies were offset by higher pet prices among our operations our comparable operating cash flow was flat year over year consequently our net controlling interest income was mxn5 541 billion for earnings per share of mxn2 64 per share additionally we reported quarterly earnings per share of mxn1 38 for our continuing operations as we consider the philippines

and uruguay were consolidated as of may 1 and july 1 2018 respectively third on august 16 2018 we announced to exercise a put option to sell our 51 stake in the coca cola femsa philippines to the coca cola company that transaction closed on december 13 2018 therefore according to ifrs 5 the philippines operation is presented as a discontinued operation as of january 1 2018 and our consolidated financial statements we represented as if the philippines had been discontinued from the beginning of 2017 consequently our company s consolidated financial results are not comparable to the financial statements published in 2017 number 4 as of july 1 2018 our argentina operation was reported as a hyperinflationary subsidiary this means that we have to reexpress the results of any given month in real terms to the end of the reporting period thus the results of our argentina operation in october and november were reexpressed in real terms as of december 31 also we have to use the end of period exchange rate to translate the reported results of our argentina operation to mexican pesos to better describe our business performance for certain information we present comparable figures excluding the effects of one mergers and acquisitions two translations effects resulting from exchange rate movements three the results of argentina because this operation has become hyperinflationary and number four the results of venezuela in 2017 as it had been deconsolidated guided by our clear strategy we navigated a very complex environment to deliver positive comparable results this year our comparable sales volume increased 0 9 to 972 million unit cases with transactions growing 1 4 comparable total revenues grew 7 8 to mxn50 2 billion comparable operating income grew 4 3 to mxn7 3 billion and comparable operating cash flow grew 4 1 to mxn10 2 billion now i would like to briefly discuss each of our operations highlights for the quarter in mexico we maintained a healthy market share delivering revenue growth of 4 4 in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility our mexico operations volume declined 0 9 as we experienced worse than expected weather conditions in november and december moreover we increased prices in november affecting our volume for the month but proactively preparing us for the beginning of this year 2019 also our portfolio mix impacted our average price for the quarter as multi serve and returnable presentations increased their share of our portfolio mix with regard to profitability our pricing aligned with inflation currency hedging declining sweetener prices and expense control strategies coupled with our digital initiatives partially mitigated higher pet and concentrate prices beginning july 1 2018 the price of concentrate increased another 1 of revenues for the next 12 months moving south into central america we leverage our portfolio of affordable presentations to continue our turnaround in costa rica and guatemala while improving panama s top line growth the consolidation of new territories our successful pre sale model roll out in guatemala and focus on execution enabled us to achieve double digit volume growth and improve our market share in such a competitive market increased prices across our four operations drove mid single digit organic revenue growth despite an organic volume decline of 3 5 our costa rica and panama operations reported low single digit volume contraction while nicaragua continued its low double digit contraction despite softening consumer dynamics resulting for a from a disruptive sociopolitical environment our nicaraguan operators have been able to contain the volume contraction however including our recent acquisitions in guatemala we reported 27 volume growth for the region guatemala continues to perform positively with low single digit organic volume growth and in our new franchises we re capturing synergies through portfolio alignment mainly on the still beverage category as we started implementing order portfolio and we launched our 2 liter multi serve returnable pet presentation which has been working very well in the market for the quarter where lower sweetener prices and expense control strategies were offset by higher pet prices and depreciation of the average exchange rate of the costa rican colon and nicaraguan cordoba as applied to our us denominated raw material costs moving on to south america emerging from a tough macroeconomic environment in brazil we delivered consistent volume growth for the year leveraging upon our affordability strategy our portfolio is very well positioned to satisfy brazil s recovering consumer environment we continue the positive volume trend in brazil marked by a fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth as volume grew 4 5 for the quarter with transactions outperforming volumes our cola s water and still beverage categories volume outperformed for the quarter thanks to our focus on execution and our digital capabilities which enabled us to launch more than 100 innovations in the back end of 2018 which is a great achievement for the team and an important reconfiguration of our portfolio in the market although we increased prices during the quarter to proactively prepare us for the first half of 2019 our price mix benefited from the performance of our single serve presentations however in mexican pesos our revenues were affected by a negative currency translation led by our affordability strategy we improved our volumes in the face of colombia s challenging gradually recovering consumer environment for the quarter we generated 3 1 volume growth with high single digit growth from our colas portfolio thanks to the performance of our returnable 2 liter pet presentation which has achieved double digit growth we also improved the water and still beverage category performance with a personal water portfolio having double digit growth and our launch of del valle frutal improving our share in these categories however after colombia s very positive performance for 2018 we re operating under a very different environment this year starting last january colombia s fiscal reform changed the way vat is applied to sugar beverages and beer from a mono phase to a multi phase scheme this impacts all of the product chain from our distributors to our final consumers while it is too early to tell to confirm the impact of our on our volumes we expect negative performance for the coming year accordingly we re reassessing our current business model to ensure we have a sustainable profitable operation confronting argentina s tough macroeconomic environment and marked by hyperinflation and deep currency devaluation our volume declined 27 for the quarter due to a tough year over year comparability at the year earlier period marked the earlier year period marked the last quarter of a positive currency environment nonetheless we were able to increase our prices ahead of inflation increasing prices by 59 on a local currency basis however due to a negative translation effect our revenues that were reported declined 47 45 moving forward we re much better prepared than ever for this market s challenges thanks to our growing mix of affordable packages and no sugar beverages digital initiatives currency hedging and cost and expense controls with respect to uruguay which we integrated in 2018 our integration process is proceeding according to plan we re countering the region s difficult macroeconomic environment through synergies and long term structural efficiencies we re also improving our market share particularly in the flavored sparkling beverage segments for the fourth quarter we reported sales volume of 13 3 million unit cases like argentina this operation s portfolio enjoys a higher mix of low and no sugar beverages reaching 67 this quarter in our south america division favorable sweetener and aluminum prices coupled with a positive currency hedging and expense control strategy enabled our operations to partially partially offset the higher pet prices and the depreciation of local currencies as applied to our unhedged u s dollar denominated raw material cost which impacted the division s profitability for the fourth quarter in venezuela we continuously adjust our business model to serve our consumers and clients in a very tough and difficult environment to operating finally as a result of the continuous analysis of our investments in joint ventures as of december 13 december 31 sorry 2018 we realized an impairment of our investment in estrella azul our dairy joint venture with the coca cola company in panama the outcome of this analysis let us to register an impairment of mxn432 million both coca cola femsa and the coca cola company are fully committed to continue focusing on this operation in a very profitable way now with regard to our financial results for 2018 we reduced our total debt by mxn1 6 billion compared with year end 2017 this reduction resulted mainly from the payment of 445 million for yankee bond due in 2018 which was partially offset by the new bank loans in mexico and uruguay additionally our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 8 2 including the effect of debt swapped to brazilian reals and mexican pesos this year over year increase was due mainly to our fixed exposure to brazilian reals denominated debt and the effect of the increase of the tiie rate on our bilateral loans in mexican pesos as we receive the proceeds for the sale of our 51 stake in the philippines in december our net leverage ratio ended at 1 61 times our comprehensive financial resort results recorded an expense of mxn2 1 billion resulting from two main factors first a foreign exchange loss in our u s dollar denominated cash exposure as the mexican peso appreciated in december and two in the loss or gain on monetary position line in 2017 we reported a gain for venezuela whereas in 2018 we reported a minor gain for our argentina operation as we are reporting our argentine operation as a hyperinflationary subsidiary we were required to reexpress the results for october and november in real terms as of december 2018 as we use the end of period exchange rate to translate the results to mexican pesos accordingly we recorded a monetary position gain in inflationary subsidiaries of mxn59 million as compared to a gain of mxn460 million in 2017 driven by our venezuela operation during the quarter we reported income tax as a percentage of income before taxes of 30 this result was driven mainly by the increase in the relative weight of brazil s profits in our consolidated results which have a higher tax rate finally as we announced on january 31 2019 and subject to the approval of mexican national banking and securities commission we propose to our shareholders a stock split and the issuance of series b shares to be listed together with series l shares in the form of units to allow our company to increase its capacity to issue new equity which maybe used as consideration in future share based acquisitions as well as for general corporate purposes we will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and we re confident that the listing of series l shares and series b shares in the form of units will help unlock value for shareholders and position coca cola femsa for new growth opportunities in the future obtaining the commission s authorization we will announce the record date and exchange date for all holders of series l shares and the conversion date for our holders of adss we expect that the announcement will happen during the first quarter of 2019 and with that i ll hand the call back

first hear from fernando olvera of bank of america merrill lynch fernando olvera bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for the call i have a couple of questions which are related to brazil i mean regarding volume you registered a really very solid volume growth this quarter and i think the strongest quarterly growth of the year so can you elaborate more on what was behind such growth and how does your market share behave during the quarter also how should we think about consumption this year and what is your outlook on volume grow this year that s all thanks constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you fernando this is constantino well yeah certainly brazil had another positive quarter we continue to be very encouraged by the positive performance we have in brazil it s the fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth as you mentioned volume growth increased 4 5 overall weather helped significantly especially during december in addition to that as i mentioned we have a very successful implementation of affordability initiatives additions to the portfolio as i said during the year we did around 100 launches in brazil across all categories and honestly there is a huge focus on execution at the point of sale by the team and also we have been driven by some digital initiatives across our omni channel strategy our market share remained steady we re gaining some traction in market share both in csds especially in colas but also in juices and nectars and water as well as isotonic and energy drinks overall we re seeing a very very positive beginning of the year the outlook in terms of macroeconomics and consumer optimism in brazil is starting to pick up again so we hope we continue with this trend and momentum in brazil thank you fernando olvera bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks operator next we ll hear from benjamin theurer of barclays benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst yeah good morning everyone and thank you very much for taking my question so two questions actually one on the outlook in mexico what do you expect how do you feel about the consumer environment demand scenario and obviously the fact that you had obviously a little bit of cost pressure from the concentrate what s your pricing strategy looking into 2019 on the mexican market that would be my first question hector trevino former chief financial officer yeah thank you it s constantino again well overall we re seeing positive trend as we start 2019 we have done very been very effective in price management above inflation i mean we re leveraging we re significantly leveraging our analytics platform for the last couple of years which as time goes by becomes more robust and more accurate and allows us to be much more effective not only on pricing and developing a pricing architecture but at the same time on being more efficient in the allocation of discounts and promotions across our different channels so that has been and will continue to be a driver for our performance in mexico next year coupled with significant improvements in our execution at the point of sale on top of that we re seeing a resilient consumer it s gradually recovering confidence january we saw positive volumes the start of the year which is good taking us in the right path although we had some weakness at the end of 2018 but january was pretty positive and at the same time weather has been favorable for us throughout the beginning of the year our portfolio affordability is increasing we are working very hard behind our returnable portfolio and our ncb portfolio also continues to gain traction on the profitability side as you mentioned we re seeing more stable raw materials environments sugar and pet prices significantly which were hard last year coupled with a significant amount of productivity initiatives to protect our bottom line in mexico so i think that probably provides you a little bit of an outlook of what we are seeing for the mexican market john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hi this is john i just think complementing on that just complementing on that i think what we re seeing also is the fact that we will have increased government spending so the short term consumption pattern for mexico on a consumer business specifically in our territories is going to be very favorable constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay and with that do you expect also transactions to somehow pickup because that has been somewhat weakish especially in the fourth quarter but if we take a look transactions throughout the year were slightly negative 2018 versus 2017 so i assume you re expecting a little bit of a recovery there as well because what we re basically seeing was no volume growth throughout the year with some minor transaction and everything came from price so the question is that transaction with less volume what can drive top line growth in 2019 john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer right good question i think one of the things that we we re going to start focusing on more much more heavily this year in mexico is single serve single serve in an affordable way and single serve returnables i think we have a good lesson from the philippines that we can bring into mexico where we can go into having very affordable entry price points ok in a very significant manner in many markets in mexico that requires it so between what we re doing in revenue growth management on multi serve along with the focus on retaking single serve i do think we ll have enhanced transaction growth and revenue growth behind our mexican operation benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay perfect and then just one last question this is really just more of an accounting one on the filing you ve submitted that the mexican stock exchange you basically reported at mxn51 8 billion in revenues to press release throughout the whole report states mxn50 2 billion what s the difference of that 3 because it literally runs throughout the whole income statement just your quick clarification so which number should we actually use constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer benjamin we had a problem with the platform benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst hello operator and just a moment technical difficulty and you may proceed constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer benjamin i don t know benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst yes constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer what you ve heard until we got cut off but again just to reiterate we have benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst inaudible last one and then it got cut off that was the last word plus constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes we had as we were loading the data to the mexican stock exchange platform last night we had very a lot of difficulties putting that data onto the platform and the correct data to focus on is the press release data benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer we ll be correcting the data on the mexican stock exchange during the course of the morning benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay perfect that was all thank you very much and i ll pass it on thanks constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from lucas ferreira of jpmorgan lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst hi first of all i d like to say actually see for hector too have a good look in his this new position actually new phase of his life and my first question is actually on the colombia if you guys can comment on the outlook for volumes how this first month has been and especially considering this change in the vat charge if this if volumes have been coming above expectations and what are the sort of impact that we should expect for volumes in the first quarter and for 2019 and my second question is regarding cost so if you guys can comment on the cost trends for the year if you already foresee some improvements in pet in the first half of the year and also the other main cost lines if we should expect already a better year in terms of front costs per hectoliter sold and if we should see some improvements in margins on the back of that thank you very much operator next question from alan alanis of ubs alan alanis ubs analyst i ll be very happy to ask my question but i don t know if they are on the line john are you on the line operator just a moment alan alanis ubs analyst thank you so much i think they have to reply to lucas question first questions first and then we ll go afterwards operator please hold the line while i reconnect our presenters yes one moment please technical difficulty john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hello operator you may proceed john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer okay thank you hello lucas hello lucas next question operator and we re on alan alan alanis ubs analyst yes i will i mean i ll ask my question but i guess we can circle back afterwards to lucas sorry operator yeah we ll go back we can go back to lucas alan alanis ubs analyst sure i m just trying to be a gentleman here well first of all hector congratulations i mean as a former boss mentor i mean you ve always been a great example and i certainly wish you the best at this new stage you will be missed john constatino my first question has to do with the criteria for transactions in m a post the approval of this split how does it how does it change the criteria if you could just update us on your thinking now that you will be able to issue more shares for m a and that would be the first question and then i have a follow up more regarding what i can you can put it on the table right away it has to do with the role of beer in your portfolio in brazil if our numbers are correct we saw very strong revenue growth for the beer category in your results in the fourth quarter i think that given that heineken said that there was that they reported low mid single digit in the fourth quarter it indicates that you had a lot of pricing in beer in brazil and i just want to see if you can confirm that and what is the overall role of beer in brazil and if you can give us any update in terms of the arbitration that is going on with heineken that will be highly appreciated those will be my two questions john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer well let me tackle the last question first first of all as you know we re in the middle of a i know everybody wants to know about beer in brazil but as you as you re aware we re in the middle of an arbitration process so there is very little we can say about it until the arbitration process finalizes which we expect it to happen between the first half of the year or maybe the beginning of the third quarter so just for those purposes i m not going to comment around our perspective on beer going forward in brazil and i hope you understand that that particular alan alanis ubs analyst i do constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer and in terms of performance you re right the beer category is going to in very positive momentum for us in our region or in the area of influence where operates in brazil i guess heineken has reported some of those numbers and i would rather have the guidance from the heineken relief and conversation that occurred a couple of years ago a couple of months weeks ago sorry but overall we re seeing strong growth the brands heineken and brand amstel have very good momentum and this particular element is something that we re seeing consistently happening in the market for a while and we foresee it happening so the premium segment of the beer category should continue strengthening from our perspective in the brazilian market so that s all i d like to comment around beer and i think the heineken release has a significant information that can provide you guidance in that regard on the m a piece and the stock split as you know the changes that we announced just aim to give us flexibility on our capital structure by increasing our capacity to issue equity that maybe used in as a consideration in future share based on mergers arrival acquisitions however there is no project or initiative or target in mind that drove that decision it has been something in the making for a while actually i have hector on my side who has been the architect of this particular initiative and i ll ask him if he wants to comment beyond that but there is no change in our focus on m a as you know we have been historically known by being very disciplined on our capital allocation and we ll do the investments that are right for our company and our shareholders at the proper value and at the proper time and the mechanism that we put behind those transactions is defined at the moment we see that the target and the initiative unfolding i don t know hector wants to comment something on the stock split to give you a little bit more guidance alan alanis ubs analyst thank you hector trevino former chief financial officer good morning as constantino mentioned this has been in the making for many years actually since the vonpar acquisition we started to define this need and if you remember we had this convertible that was issued with respect to that acquisition and that requires this structure to be in place it took a lot of time because we were looking for and in conversation with the authorities so that we can have a single unit trading as opposed to having series b and series l with a split trading that in our opinion will create some liquidity and issue pricing problem for us so we finally got the authorization at the end of last year we were caught with the christmas break and the change in the government and finally we got final approval in january but as constantino said it s basically talking of what we ll develop and plan for quite basically for 3 2 5 years the series b shares would now have some volume rise which i think that is very good for our for our shareholders and investors in this inaudible john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer alan this is john i think as you go through these three acquisitions of coca cola femsa sometimes you use the large component of debt and sometimes you use the a large component of equity but always trying to maintain our ratios within region and some and what we have here is incremental flexibility ok to make sure that as we see opportunities when they come up and sometimes are not necessarily projectable that we have the financial strength and flexibility to do something that is reasonable and conservative for our shareholders assuming that we did whatever transaction we have going forward is accretive and i think this allows us a broader spectrum to go out there and feel comfortable that we re in a great financial position and also in great capital position to continue down the path of doing further transactions alan alanis ubs analyst got it that s very useful thank you so much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you alan constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you alan operator and lucas your line is reopen you may pose your question again at this time lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst i think you i m not sure if you issue listen to the questions but the first one was related to the elasticity in colombia if this is coming better than expected what sort of impact you guys are expecting the volumes for the first quarter and full year if you can comment at least versus your expectations initial expectations and the second question was regarding the costs wanted to know and what part of the the curve we are in terms of pressures especially from pet which i think should be to remain the one of the lines pressuring your costs so can we expect already better cost base in the quarters to come and what about the full year 2019 thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer lucas how are you regarding colombia obviously the elimination of the tax benefit that we had in and our plant is a very very large impact for us and to change our short term strategy of want to going out there and restructuring our colombian operation in a lot of different fronts the first one was pricing which we took up immediately in january we took up over 6 pricing secondly we had a resize beginning to resize our operation we ve taken out 200 people in colombia basically staff people to resize that operation thirdly we re looking at redeveloping our route to market plus our supply chain distribution network because all of our benefits were stuck in the inaudible plant and we re looking to we reallocate those to the different plants that we have so i think the first four to five six months in colombia are going to be very focused on restructuring to make sure that we re facing the environment in the correct manner in sizing our company to that manner what we think about elasticity is we ve taken up the prices and we re better than what we thought so we have at the 6 rate we re not looking we re not seeing the same type of elasticity as we had before in the vat was taken across the whole country couple of years ago so we re much better off than what we thought and we re encouraged by what we re seeing in terms of savings and obviously it s a very challenging year for colombia but i think we re on the right track with the right portfolio and with the right management as well constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer now lucas and around and to your other questions regarding raw materials pet and sugar we are seeing a better curve going forward in 2019 compared to 2018 so overall our outlook in that particular element inline in our p l should be more favorable this year than in the previous year lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst thank you very much operator and next we ll hear from antonio gonzalez of credit suisse antonio gonzalez credit suisse analyst hi good morning everyone thank you for taking my question first similarly thank you for everything hector and congrats on a truly remarkable career and constantino best of luck on this new role i have two questions the first one on dividend you mentioned in today s press release that the board has proposed the dividend of mxn3 54 per share which is 5 7 growth versus last year and obviously there has been a debate recently up there you exited from the philippines on whether you could substantially increase the payout on the other hand obviously flexibility on the macro side in mexico i guess has diminished significantly so i just wanted to pick your brains as to what is the latest thinking with respect to the payout policy do you think we will remain at similar levels for the next couple of years or do you actually see a room for a substantial increase and if so in which time frame and then secondly i just wanted to ask very quickly what triggers is there any specific events that triggered their write off in panama and is there any long term learning here that would extrapolate your diary ventures elsewhere or is it more of a specific situation thank you so much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you thank you antonio let me address the dividend issue first we are taking back our dividend policy to about for the 2019 year in payout to the to about 20 21 those was historically we would have increased dividends further but we wanted to but we want to make sure that we have the cash on hand to pay off a 500 million yankee bond that comes due in february ok of 2020 okay so we didn t see any economic benefit of going out there and borrowing to report to go out there and do a such a short term transaction to bring down the yankee so we wanted to keep that cash on hand so going forward once we re over that hump we do have a possibility of increasing the dividend policy going forward for coca cola femsa and that would be our objective however we also would be very constrained we re very concerned with how market conditions continue to evolve and what we want to make sure that we have enough financial flexibility and strength on our balance sheet to be able to ensure that whatever future dividends that we re going to go out there and increase are sustainable secondly in terms of the write off of the panama operation the panama operation is the first real foray into value added dairy that we had and i think what we ve had is a lot of delays on the plant the law in terms of up bring up the plant into a and respect this was neither a remake nor a greenfield or around we have a what we saw a brownfield that we re just making the plant within a new plant within the existing plant so that if you have ever remodeled your home is a very difficult situation so we ve encountered delays and we are also learning a heck of a lot more about how to manage dairies because this is really the first time when we ve gone into cold and value added dairies with yogurts ok ice creams so it s been a very large learning process that we don t have anywhere else ok in mexico we are basically all uht or even in brazil where it is chilled but it is on a separate basis so i think it s a very specific thing to panama that you really cannot go out there and project any place to us now that being said we just came back from panama couple of days ago and i m very encouraged to see exactly how the project is coming along the momentum is gaining and how the our production platform is coming on stream nicely antonio gonzalez credit suisse analyst gracias john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer you re welcome operator and before we take our next caller i would like to remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question allowing others a chance to ask a question next we will hear from carlos laboy of hsbc carlos laboy hsbc analyst hector congratulations and thank you for 25 years of forthright honesty and straight shooting which has been i think very helpful for everybody john the catalog of achievements that you listed at the start of the call we all get it it s what makes you maybe the most valuable bottler coke s ever had anywhere in the world almost 25 years for driving next frontier execution but it all makes for a really great eulogy if you can exceed your cost of capital on a sustained basis when you look at the pressures you re facing in brazil and you look at the pressures that you re facing with non core profitability with the marketing maybe of effectiveness at driving growth for your core brand can you exceed your cost of capital without these things getting fixed and the follow up to that then is you said that you re going to evaluate geographic and category opportunities but you re also increasing the dividend so are you willing to consider geographic opportunities for asset sales not just for purchases if you re staring at situations where you can t get from your partner what you need for exceeding your cost of capital john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hello carlos laboy hsbc analyst yes john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer carlos a couple of things yes over the last couple of years we ve had a series of we ve had a series of years where we are not making our cost we are making or slightly under the cost of capital for coca cola femsa and i think that s a true reflection of the market in terms of how we ve gotten the value coca cola femsa we get it s just not been increasing shareholder value now there is a couple of reasons for that and i think there s the valuations there is incremental cost for raw materials and yes importantly there has been also incidence increases that had also been affecting us to the tune over the last three four years of about 154 million that continued to give us headwinds there has been consumer headwinds and there s been tax headwinds as well so i think overall being close to cost to capital has not been bad but it is not what we need ok the issue is how do we go out there and continue to grow cost achieve our cost of capital couple of things first in the general picture we need to go out there and amplify our portfolio well firstly we need to just to get our csd portfolio back on track and i think it was very encouraging to see during 2018 that coca cola brand coca cola grew almost 2 ok in terms of volume and i think we ve put also a lot more revenue into the coca cola system by growing both revenues and volume and transaction fees over the brand coca cola and secondly we need to go out there and fix on our non carb business or make it not fixed i would say let s make it more profitable okay right now where we are it is growing but it s not nearly as profitable as our growth business but it is as i would argue is marginal to the whole process so or to the whole structure so the more we go out there and grow the more margin we do enhance now when we bring down the coca cola the non carb business it is what non carb business you want to talk about because within the non carb business there s a series of large business of businesses that are very profitable energy key low constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer isotonic john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer isotonics and one we have to start i think getting better returns on just basic juices and nectars and there s two ways of doing that one is going out there getting better formulations ok and secondly there is also case is going up and doing a better portfolio by premiumizing it and i think brazil as the last time you were down there you saw how we premiumize the juice the juice portfolio making sure that we re going out there with higher premium category glass products and they re doing very well and there is a lot of margin involved in that so i think from that end we re starting to advance on the portfolio and getting it much more accretive for our coca cola femsa coca cola femsa shareholders secondly i think it s in water in water we have to go out there and figure out exactly what we just did in juices in terms of developing a portfolio of premium brands ok to be able to really develop the brands and to make sure that we have enhanced profitability over what we have today today in most most countries we play with a core brand which is cl in some places crystal in brazil that tries to play gamma across premium value and four mainstream and what we need to do is go out there and develop those brands differently we need we ve just launched smartwater in brazil we ve launched smartwater in argentina in the mississippian basis but those are the type of initiatives we need to continue to develop fully and aggressively to make sure that that portfolio becomes as profitable as carbonated soft drinks and in carbonated soft drinks and i just said this on another question we need to refocus on engaging on transactions on single serves and i think there we can do that by going back into glass and returnables ok in a way that i think our competitors can t ok both in brazil and mexico and elsewhere so i think there is a good story let s say that we re well poised to be able to go out and increase our profitability and our margins to cover our cost of capital and grow at the same time we turn to brazil you re saying whether brazil beer is something that we need to do and we don t need to do obviously we can t comment on the existing arbitration but the world is moving toward more and more integrated platforms and brazil is an example i think there s other countries that are also examples and i think it s more compelling in brazil than any place itself and for us it would be very important for us to be able to have a beer solution in brazil i don t know if that covers all your questions carlos carlos laboy hsbc analyst yes the final question is that you had mentioned that you re going to continue to evaluate geographic and category opportunities but everyone assumes that that means that you re going to consider more asset sales but more asset purchase but what you ve done mostly recently is sales the philippines or do you look at your existing portfolio of territories to sort out well maybe there s something in here that we shouldn t have john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer sure let me be clear about this i mean the thing with the philippines was a very specific transaction structure for the philippines and asia and the way it was set up the deal was set up and that s what we negotiated at the time is that we ll go out there and we are putting the call and we had to go out and exercise the call to be able to further acquire territories and in asia and given what s happened in the philippines with the tax on sugar we couldn t find a way that make whole of the prices that we had in the original transaction and so therefore we instead of going out and modifying the whole transaction but we what we landed up doing was just putting it back to the company that philosophy is not in coke femsa s dna ok we re not going we re not asset sellers ok i don t have it in vision to go out there and sell assets at this point any pesos and later on from in the philippines we just went out there and acquired two franchises in guatemala and one in uruguay that i would say gives you the pace of where we want to go in the future we will continue to look at opportunities both on a category basis and a territory basis carlos ok again just making sure that we re not going out there and destroying shareholder value carlos laboy hsbc analyst thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer well operator next we ll hear from alex robarts of citi alex robarts citigroup analyst yes hi everybody thank you and i did want to start out by saying to hector thank you very much for the financial stewardship through the years and i hope the best in your well deserved retirement two questions from my side one on the operating deleverage in south america and then the second on non carbs i guess we kind of came into the quarter thinking about lower sugar in south america but then higher pet but what seem to kind of really explain or at least impact a lot of the deleverage right you show us comparatively 12 top line in south america growth in the quarter with 2 ebitda growth and that difference seems to kind of go to the what you call the raw material hedge the unfavorable hedge there could you give us some more color as to what specifically was behind that raw material unfavorable hedge was it a particular input was it several and might we expect some relief in this seasonally strong summer here in the first quarter or might that continue to be unfavorable so that s the first question the second one relates to non carbs and interesting trend you talked about it with us in the fall in new york when you came up and now with the full year numbers we can kind of see how those non carb volumes fall then when you look at mexico and brazil it s kind of a tale of two cities flat non carb volume growth in mexico last year and i guess the kind of the impact there is bulk water coming down the question is is that going to continue to be a focus for you or is that something that you want deemphasized and should we continue that for to see that decline the other side is brazil where your mid teen non carb growth a lot of it is stills also waters but it strikes me that it s 20 of the volume of non carbs in mexico and so does m a become something that you would look at this year in non carbs in brazil to kind of perhaps more right size that kind of growing piece of your volume and the final piece on the non carbs last week coca cola company talks about in the conference that new products accounted for about 17 volume growth last year how does how do you think about just generally new products and the impact it can have on your growth this year would it be like coke s number of mid teens thanks very much a lot of kind of sub questions but i appreciate the time john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer and alex let me inaudible try to take the last ones first and then i ll let hector or constantino talk about the hedging question that you asked i think let me talk a little bit about bulk water because bulk water is a good place to start on this conversation we do have a very large bulk water business in mexico ok and that is it s profitable but it s not necessarily as profitable as we d like it to be and we ve been working on maintaining or growing our profitability on primarily the 19 20 liter jug business and there what you ll be seeing and what we re going to be emphasizing is obtaining better margins on that business in light of the sacrificing volume what we d like to do is continue to price up ok and continue to gain better margins and obviously also become much more efficient in our operation that we have and there and i would say the focus of this would probably be more southwest of mexico and then we have at any place else so the 20 liter jug business in mexico is a big deal and the profitability on bulk water 5 liter business is also something you re going to be looking at to make sure that we have the proper returns on that business so that s something we ll focus on in both mexico colombia is also an issue with that in terms of the 5 liter and 6 liter bottle 6 liter bag business and how do we start making our profitability a little bit better on those packs on the non carb business in brazil as you said and i think one of the things to understand is we restructured that whole business in a big way other than 100 skus that we launched the majority of those are non carbs and we re basically going toward two things first is competing first is putting ourselves in a competitive situation in our plants with cold fill products which were coming out of lao ph and now and we re resourcing them out of jundiai ok and that transition from the lao ph plant to the jundiai plant is giving us at least giving us an advantage to compete in low cold fill juices that is really the bottom part of the market and that will allow us at the same token to be able to increase prices ok on the core leader tetra juices and vectors ok which we were sacrificing before just to be able to maintain margins and also the increase in all the glass and hot fill capability is in terms of premium products that we re doing is also leading to better profitability and we should start seeing that continue to grow but profitably sell in brazil over the first six months to seven months of the year so i think where we are and in mexico what we re looking at is better formulations better cost structures and we have enormous opportunity to make these better both in mexico and brazil so i think that the focus is the right one and we re encouraged to see that we will be able to go out and increase our profitability and non carbs ok and bulk water businesses constantino do you want to take a look at the hedges constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer sure if i understand your question what you re asking was the biggest impact in south america regarding the cost for the quarter but i would tell you is that pet was the main driver in across all markets particularly in brazil and argentina we had significant price increases in dollar terms in brazil almost 30 increases in pet costs in brazil part of that was unhedged but if you couple that with devaluation in brazil there was a significant impact for us in that particular operation that considering the size of brazil in our south american region that has a an important impact for us we also had some some labor cost increases in a couple of markets argentina and brazil and that explains most of the impact in cost that we had in the fourth quarter for brazil i don t know if that tackles your question alex robarts citigroup analyst i guess sorry constantino specifically the raw material hedge i mean which you talk about in the press release was there it was the hedged it was the dollar hedged price for certain raw materials correct and that is something that will roll constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes alex robarts citigroup analyst okay and the question is will that roll off is that going to continue into the first quarter the question was sorry on the actual hedge yeah constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes actually we have a very say very disciplined approach toward hedging both on currency and on raw materials i don t know if you re aware of our routine but we have monthly routine with every single operation and probably crm process we redefine and we define bands and coverage levels for our critical raw materials sugar pet aluminum et cetera and we also look at the coverage from our currencies especially in such a volatile environment so yes the question is yes it will continue it s part of cost disciplined approach on the operation management and a way in which the finance function supports on our operations so yes it will continue i reiterate that answer for you operator luca cipiccia of goldman sachs luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for the time and taking my question hector congratulations and best wishes just two follow ups from my side one i think in your introduction remarks you made some reference on the investments you re making on digital capabilities and i was hoping maybe you could qualify a little bit better some of this or little bit more rather some of this initiatives how relevant are they for your operation for your partners and also how are these being rolled out across markets are you starting from mexico and then implementing them across the board or is this i m just trying to get a sense of how relevant are much of a step change how much of the incremental benefit there could be from some of this measure that you made reference to that s the first question and then secondly on the portfolio and on the dairy strategy also in light of your comments on panama do you think the system overall in dairy would could benefit from a more organic strategies across strategy across market or in other words do you think that there would be a rationale for a jugos del valle type of structure or transaction or addition given that the execution and the portfolio itself can appear not entirely consistent across all markets the dairy presence is stronger in certain markets weaker in other and in some there isn t any both of your franchises and other franchise so i don t know if you have any comment on that i d be interested in hearing your views thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer sure on the digital front first thing is that what we ve done in digital it has a lot of components to it and they have a commercial component it has a manufacturing distribution component and it has also an administrative and back office component or saas component let me just take you through what i think is probably the most valuable piece which is the cost commercial component there what we ve put out is a digital platform that starts with the analytics database ok for and let me just use mexico as an example for the detail but it goes out there in has per account we have about 7 000 pieces of information and we have all the detail on 800 000 accounts that we have in mexico and with few analytics and we also have this is not going to do the that model as well as purchase structure consumer purchase structures it gives us the insight as to how to go out there and manage down to the point of sale and making sure that we have the right pricing structure the right packaging structure ok and now we re also getting into the right demand structure but all those analytics connect to our marketing department and the marketing department goes right into the sales department and we have immediate work orders for each one of our point of sale with independent of or would be customized promotions for them and we have the ability to send out these work orders on a weekly basis and the feedback that we re getting obviously is weekly and we understand exactly what we re executing how we re executing and what is working for us and not we have the capability of launching in mexico 5 million consumer customer initiatives on a monthly basis and getting that information back and obviously that s a lot of data and a lot of change management well what has it given us it s given us first place execution in mexico brazil and argentina ok an incremental execution right now in colombia we ve rolled out this platform in our traditional trade throughout all our countries ok the marketing platform the analytics have rolled out in mexico and colombia and they will be rolling out in brazil this year as well ok and we ve postponed argentina given the hyperinflationary situation that we confront over there so that s going to be postponed so we get a more stable economic environment what s it given us besides better execution it s given us better price realization we d be now able to take pricing above inflation ok in these countries and it s also given us a better return on discount and so our roi on promotions have increased in mexico of by 9 points and in colombia by about 5 points so giving us real pricing power and is getting to be more effective now the second implication important to all this is that when we have all this information we re starting to look at it as a forecasting tool and we ve put together an artificial intelligence space so we can go out and predict demand ok from all the points of sale going forward and we are testing this right now in the mexico in one of our warehouses and we re getting up to 5 points of better accuracy on demand prediction and demand sensing which will allow us to become a much more efficient supply chain overall and so all that is done by outlook by the way so as we gain more experience we ll be going through this and opening it up into mexico in a bigger way and then rolling it out through all the country so if you look at the commercial platform we ve rolled it out in terms of the sap handheld and marketing analytics piece i mean the not the marketing analytics piece but the handheld to all our countries in the analytics are following this year now the second big bucket that we have that goes along with this is how do we become much more intertwined and digitized with our supply chain so we ve implemented what we have in mexico on a jda platform which is a logistics platform throughout all of our countries already and it s centralized in mexico and that s been providing us with about 25 million worth of savings ok we ve put also digital distributors we have all our routes in mexico are now on are digitized we know exactly where they are how they can deliver in brazil all of our routes and all of our trades are digitized and we re looking to roll that out into other places as well i think there is an enormous amount of value that we re creating there and obviously we ll continue to be leading forward in terms of the coca cola system the other question you had was on the portfolio strategy on milk or dairy luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst yeah john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer and if there is other acquisitions potential acquisitions out there that could make sense yes we d take a look at it ok and depending on the values that we think we can create for our shareholders we go out there and pursue it i think there are a lot of synergies to be had with those categories but there are also significant differences that you have to understand which we re understanding in panama which is called and also the short shelf life products that are totally different business than what we have in coca cola but they are something that we d be looking at continuously luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst hector just thank you very much for the answer for the details it s very interesting just on the dairy just to the angle of my question was also across the categories typically you have brands and brands or products that work across geographies there is a little bit of an exception where every country has got its own in a sense so is that something that you see should change could change or does it make sense to do it that way john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer no i don t think it makes a lot of sense to go out there and try to leverage dairy from one country with another unless its uht ok milk is a very regional business and so i don t think necessarily we have a large strategy going forward on that end i do think we have brands like ades that goes out there and plays in that space but on the feed base that is expandable and which we are expanding ok but dairy is more of a local business in the local with local credentials operator and our final question for today will come from alvaro garcia of btg alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst hi thanks for the call most of my questions have been answered maybe you could provide a road map so on the capital allocation front we think of the mxn700 million you received from the philippines perhaps you could provide a road map sort of including the yankee bond up in february next year of how much debt you expect to pay down over the next 12 months to 18 months thank you constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes hi this is constantino basically we ve analyzed the proceeds of that transaction that we did it in the philippines and very straightforward our intent is to use the the cash that we received to take our debt continue our deleveraging path and most importantly i think that in february of next year 2020 we have a yankee bond that is due and we ll be using the proceeds of that transaction to continue lowering our net debt ratio which is quite healthy right now at 1 6 so that gives us a very flexible profile balance sheet going forward so the answer is yes we ll use the proceeds to continue deleveraging and pay our debt alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst apart from that is it fair to assume that this year maybe we ll see a 200 million in some pay down of debt just sort to get to that 700 million or is that yankee bond really the only thing you have on your target hector trevino former chief financial officer we already used part of the proceed to repay some of the bilateral loans that we have john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer correct hector trevino former chief financial officer that were related to the uruguay and guatemala acquisition so that s basically that with that being the 200 million plus it was 500 million inaudible 240 million ph multiple speakers that we have in february 2020 that will basically cover 700 million and as john and constantino were explaining the board of directors that we have yesterday this decision was that to hold to give 500 million and wait given the good coupon that we have on bad inaudible versus the seniority of it impacting that both the sources on the secure manner the negative carries basically zero and the decision was to keep this tight on the 1 million on cash given the volatility we were seeing in the markets and just wait for 2020 and do that so we pay it alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst perfect that s very very clear all the best hector all the best going forward constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer hope you guys treat me as well as you treat hector hector trevino former chief financial officer inaudible operator and that does conclude the question and answer session i ll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you all for being here today and i d just like to take the opportunity again the bank hector for such a remarkable career and being such a great collaborator friend and leader of the coca cola femsa and now only the coca cola femsa company but also a coca cola company and also just a great trend and i trust him and maria they re going to have a lot of good times going forward but will always be counting on his advice and closeness as we go forward and to you all on the line thank you for your confidence and interest in coca cola femsa if there are interesting times but i m sure that will be coming out very positively during this very challenging 2019 and our team is always available to answer questions you might inaudible on our team and hope to talk to you very soon thank you very much for being with us today operator that does conclude today s conference thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect duration 88 minutes call participants john anthony santa maria otazua chief

yves here wray saves one of his best lines for late in the article as kelton puts it people like henwood think money grows on rich people but boy is it a hard slog to deal with people who refuse to deal with mmt in good faith by randy wray originally published at new economic perspectives doug henwood has posted up at jacobinan mmt critique that amounts to little more than a character assassination it is what i d expect of him in his reincarnation as a neoliberal critic of progressive thought it adopts all the usual troll methodology guilt by association taking statements out of context and paraphrasing wrongly without citation according to henwood mmt is tainted by warren mosler s experience as a hedge fund manager beardsley ruml father of tax withholding and chairman of the nyfed who argued correctly that taxes for revenue are obsolete is dismissed because he was chair of macy s and director of the nyfed macy s still has a director on the nyfed andbecause he argued that the corporate tax is a bad tax his main arguments were later advanced by musgrave musgrave thetextbookon public finance by hyman minsky and by me in the second edition of my primer oh ruml must not know anything about either taxes or central banking because he was a corporate stooge never mind that he was a new dealer who helped to organize the new deal plans for projects all over the country and a phd who authored several books and who was the dean of social sciences at the university of chicago he must be an ignoramus when it comes to taxes and central banking because he does not adopt henwood s belief that the sovereign government of the united states must rely on the taxes that come from corporations and rich folk such is the depth of henwood s argument against mmt it amounts to little more than a series of baseless ad hominemattacks i used to respect henwood in his earlier role as editor of the left business observerand indeed we enjoyed a good relationship often corresponding on progressive issues he disappeared from the scene some decades ago and i thought he had died however he reappeared recently as a troll arguing in blog commentary against mmt his rants were largely incoherent and as we say in economics orthogonal to anything mmt actually says he has apparently suffered the fate of many aging marxists after years of fighting the good fight against capitalism they realize they ve accomplished little and decide to instead engage the progressives on the argument that all is hopeless apparently jacobinassigned to him the task of destroying mmt my name is mentioned 17 times in henwood s article i think that is more than anyone else the magazine is publishing the attack without any offer of a response that is quite typical when it comes to diatribes against mmt dating all the way back to my first book in 1998 understanding modern money the first academic book on mmt the editor of the main post keynesian journal published a critique of the book by perry mehrling someone with no post keynesian credentials without giving me an opportunity to respond in the same issue and then declined to even let me have a response in a later issue this is the way academics has dealt with mmt from the beginning any critique no matter how groundless will be featured and no response will be allowed and so it goes as jacobindid not give me a chance to respond i m penning this for nep these are my responses and none of the other mmters henwood has trolled in his piece should be implicated i m sure that all of them kelton tcherneva mosler tymoigne fullwiler dantas galbraith and mitchell can defend themselves ably and with more nuance and respect than i can me i detest trolls and i cannot hide my distaste in any event here are some of the topics i would address if i had been given a chance to respond according to henwood wray does not discuss the role of private money and financial institutions in the private economy henwood claims absent from wray s work is any sense of what money means in the private economy in fact my 1990 book money and credit in capitalist economies is one of the foundational books in the endogenous money literature that henwood discusses favorably my work before and after that book has focused on the private financial sector and includes hundreds of articles chapters and books on the topic including a book co authored with tymoigne on the global financial crisis the rise and fall of money manager capitalism routledge 2014 and a recent book on minsky s approach to finance why minsky matters princeton 2015 i d wager that there are vanishingly few authors who have written more on the private banking system than me and along with bill black few who have taken such a critical perspective of private banking as practiced in one place henwood seems to backtrack a bit writing wray who once wrote a book on the topic now dismisses endogenous money as a trivial advance next to mmt yes i do argue that in retrospect the endogenous money literature is trivial for several reasons first the modern endogenous money research that began seriously around 1980 largely just recovered the pre friedmanian views that were common in the 1920s and that were never lost in the uk second the endogenous money approach was rather quickly adopted by heterodoxy and third all the central banks of the rich developed countries have also adopted the endogenous money approach the policy recommendation that comes out of it is to direct central banks to target interest rates not reserves or money supply central banks had usuallyadopted interest rates anyway outside of the relatively brief monetarist experiment that began under chairman volcker and although it is true that mainstream economists had taught that central banks could choose money targets they recognized that if both the is and lm curves are stable choosing a money target is formally equivalent to choosing an interest rate target by contrast we have been pushing the mmt approach to fiscal finance since the early 1990s and it still remains highly controversial and still attracts the same comments from trolls and others like bill gates and austin goolsby who both recently announced that s crazy why because the implications of understanding fiscal finance are huge by comparison the implications of endogenous money are trivial which is why it was relatively easy to get the theory adopted wray supposedly shies away from discussing use of tax increases to counter inflationary pressures while i am and mmt in general is skeptical of use of discretionary tax hikes to fight inflation we strongly support progressive income taxes that will automatically rise in a boom mmt also supports use of a jg to cause government spending to rise countercyclically rising in a downturn as workers are shed from the private sector and falling in an expansion together these can help to stabilize spending and income at the aggregate level we also argue that the countercyclical swings of employment in the jg pool can act as a bufferstock to help stabilize wages if there were a prolonged stretch of inflation we would of course recommend pro actively raising taxes and or reducing spending we ve been very clear on this our argument has always been that a jg and progressive tax system help to stabilize aggregate demand wages and prices but if that is not sufficient government still has at its disposal the usual methods of fighting inflation everything except using unemployment since austerity will not increase unemployment but will instead increase employment in the jg according to henwood wray has said mmt is compatible with a libertarian small government view of the world yes the descriptive part of mmt accurately describes how sovereign currency systems work and such knowledge can be used by austrians or marxists to better understand the world they want to change mmt proponents however are mostly progressives who are not content with merely explaining the world but more importantly want to radically change it hence we do have policy proposals proposals that i expect both austrians and marxist will hate such as the jg as i ve written before it is strange that the far right and far left come together in favoring unemployment over employment in a jg one of those strange but true alliances against progressive policy austrians oppose the jg on the basis that it expands the role of government some of the left opposes it because the jg ameliorates suffering presumably reducing recruits for the coming revolution henwood wray s explanation of the weimar hyperinflation one of the most dazzling of all time is odd the deficits wray explained in his book were caused by the inflation not the other way round yes that is true henwood adopts the monetarist explanation that too much money causes inflation he confuses causation and correlation severe supply constraints can push up prices increasing the amount of money that needs to be created both publicly and privately to finance purchases tax revenues fall behind spending so a deficit opens up as spending tries to keep pace with inflation the money stock is a residual and it will grow rapidly with hyperinflation that does not mean it is the cause mitchell has closely examined the hyperinflation cases from the mmt perspective the argument is not at all odd and has the advantage that it is fact based unlike henwood s monetarist linking of money and inflation that has been so thoroughly discredited that even central bankers have dropped it henwood proclaims mmters like mitchell and wray write as if borrowing abroad is just a bad choice and not something forced on subordinate economies and then goes on to argue that mosler is wrong when he says that turkey can buy capital equipment in its own currency lira henwood does not understand foreign exchange markets anyone including henwood can exchange turkish lira for either dollars or euros in foreign exchange markets including at airport counters around the world turkey can exchange lira for dollars to pay for imports of capital might that affect exchange rates possibly that is why floating the currency is important nor does mmt argue that borrowing abroad is a bad choice if that means issuing domestic currency debt held by foreigners what we argue is that issuing debt in a foreign currency is a bad choice for any country that can issue its own currency i d go even further and argue that any country with its own currency should prohibit its government from issuing debt in a foreign currency or from guaranteeing any such debt issued by its domestic firms however if private entities want to issue debt in foreign currencies i do not necessarily advocate preventing that what about the special case of a country that issues a currency that cannot be exchanged in forex markets remember henwood wrongly proclaimed that turkey is such a country here i m not talking about turkey or any of the other many countries which do have currencies listed in forex markets for a list of exchange rates of the 150 or so convertible currencies from the aruban florin to the zambian kwach go here i think it is most likely a mistake to issue debt in a foreign currency unless there is an identified source of the forex that will be needed to service the debt for example dedicated forex earned from exports if you cannot exchange your currency in forex markets and cannot earn forex your best bet is international charity indebtedness in foreign currency will be a disaster henwood claims mmters will sometimes say they want to tax the rich because they re too rich but wray said at a recent conference that he sees no point in framing the issue as taxing the rich to expand public services presumably because government doesn t need to tax to spend and has has written that taxing the rich is a fool s errand because of their political power the first part of that is correct we do not need to tax the rich in order to expand public services the second is dishonest reporting he does not include a citation but what i actually argued is that trying to reduce inequality using taxes is not likely to be successful because the rich influence the tax code and get exemptions like rick wolff i argue for predistribution prevent the growth of excessive income and wealth by controlling payments of high salaries in the first place eliminate the practices that lead to inequality such as huge compensation for top management of public companies i do like high taxes on high income and high wealth i have argued they should be set so high as to be confiscatory not at a marginal income tax rate of 70 but at 99 or even 125 or 1000 take it all i am not confident that the effective tax rate will ever be that high due to the exemptions the rich will write into the code but we that doesn t mean we shouldn t aspire for better it is amusing that henwood refers to the barriers of political power when it suits his purpose for example when he talks about the political infeasibility of the job guarantee but objects if i notice that it is politically difficult to tax rich folks all i m arguing is that a we don t need tax money to pay for the programs we want and b high tax rates on the rich alone will not be sufficient in our struggle to reduce inequality he writes tymoigne and wray s response to palley barely addressed any of his substantive points and henwood objects to our mention of a video where palley argued against the job guarantee because if poor people in south africa got jobs they d want food and that might increase imports and even cause inflation first we responded to palley s critiques in 43 different places in that paper including responding in detail to nine long quotes where we let him speak for himself unlike henwood who loosely often wrongly paraphrases our arguments often with no citations at all the video is not an outlier it is palley s often repeated position given a choice palley prefers low inflation over jobs and income for the poor he is perhaps the only post keynesian who still uses the islm framework augmented by a phillips curve for those who don t know what that framework is it is the bastardized version of keynesian economics that helped open the door to neoliberalism i have been at meetings where palley urged the afl cio to forget about arguing for full employment because of the danger of inflation that was not in 1974 or even in 1979 when there actually was some inflation no it was a generation later like the neoliberals palley is still fighting the inflation battle decades after the danger disappeared henwood is free to defend that neoliberal position if he likes but it is disingenuous to criticize us for linking to a video where palley makes his own case for the position he is well known to hold henwood and jacobin align themselves against the new wave of activists who have embraced mmt and the job guarantee as integral to the green new deal program these new progressives want to tax rich people too not because uncle sam needs the money but because the rich are too rich henwood wants us to believe that government needs inequality we ve got to cater to the rich they get to veto our progressive policies if there weren t rich folk we d never be able to afford a new deal we only get the policies they are willing to fund if we actually did tax away their riches government would go broke as kelton puts it people like henwood think money grows on rich people for far too long left leaning democrats have had a close symbiotic relationship with the rich they ve needed the good rich folk like george soros bill gates warren buffet bob rubin to fund their think tanks and political campaigns the centrist clinton wing has repaid the generosity of wall street s neoliberals with deregulation that allowed the ceos to shovel money to themselves vastly increasing inequality and their own power and they in turn rewarded hillary who by her own account accepted whatever money they would throw in her direction today s progressives won t fall into that trap how ya gonna pay for it through a budget authorization uncle sam can afford it without the help of the rich and by the way they re going to tax you anyway because you ve got too much too much income too much wealth too much power what will we do with the tax revenue burn it uncle sam doesn t need your money in reality taxes just lead to debits to bank accounts we ll just knock 3 or 5 zeros off the accounts of the rich of course double entry bookkeeping means we also need to knock zeros off the debts held by the rich so we ll wipe zeros off the student loan debts the mortgage debts the auto loan debts and the credit card debts of american households yes debt cancellation too the new breed of progressive politician represented by bernie and alexandria doesn t need corporate funding either and they certainly don t need henwood s scolding

and maria dyla castro are all with us today we completed a historic year for our company as we celebrated the 25th anniversary of coca cola femsa s incorporation and stock exchange listing at the time of its ipo in september 1993 our company was valued at mxn1 billion today our company is valued at almost mxn13 billion 13 times its original market value for an annual total return to shareholders of over 19 2 in 1994 we took our first step abroad with the acquisition of coca cola buenos aires in argentina in 2003 we see the leadership position of the beverage industry with the transformational acquisition of panamco expanding our presence to nine of latin america s most important markets and multiplying our volumes six times from 2008 to 2016 we strengthened our company s leadership position in brazil with the acquisition and integration of four significant franchises that expanded our presence to more than 50 of the coca cola system countrywide correspondingly we bolstered our footprint in mexico through our merger and integration of four bottling franchises from 2011 to 2013 moreover we remain at the forefront of the total beverage portfolio evolution first our joint acquisition of jugos del valle in 2007 captured the potential of a powerful brand that is now one of the coca cola system s a 1 billion brands second we established a partnership with inaudible in brazil to develop a broad portfolio of stills beverages third we began our journey into the value added dairy category through our joint ventures in with estrella azul in panama santa clara in mexico and verde campo in brazil more recently we entered a new plant based beverage category with our joint acquisition of ades in 2017 finally in 2018 we integrated two franchises in guatemala and expanded our geographic footprint to uruguay to continue capitalizing on strategic long term value creation opportunities for coca cola femsa over the past 25 years we have reinvested more than mxn20 billion in our business with mxn11 4 billion in accretive mergers and acquisitions and joined the privilege of integrating great bobbing franchises traditional families and great collaborators into this coca cola femsa new coca cola femsa business our entrepreneurial spirit and passion for customers and consumers have always powder our drive to innovate through the integration of transformative practices

evolution even further setting a new frontier with cutting edge digital technology tailored to create a new competitive advantage based on our demand driven coca cola femsa commercial digital platform advanced market analytics and cost digital distribution platforms integrated which integrate revolutionary capabilities to set the new standards for the way we serve our markets and consumers focused on our clear strategy we finished the year of continued transformation and growth after a successful inaudible fiber turnaround of the philippines operation we sold our 51 stake in coca cola femsa philippines as the best course of action for our company s shareholders looking forward we will continually evaluate geographic and category opportunities maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation to maximize our shareholders returns with that in mind 2018 was a year of restructuring and transformation marked by first the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operation at the end of 2017 secondly the sale of the stake of the philippines at the end of 2018 thirdly the integration of three new franchises in guatemala and uruguay and fourth the adoption of hyperinflationary accounting in argentina moreover in the face of a complex volatile macroeconomic environment in some of our markets we put coca cola femsa on an extremely solid financial foundation we not only reduced our net leverage position but also affirmed our credit ratings by moody s and standard and poor s we reported solid comparable topline growth of close to 6 for 2018 our revenue management initiatives backed by analytics and deployed in an agile and assertive way directly in each point of sale allowed us to create comparable volumes 1 2 and growth of 1 2 while prices were ahead of or in line with inflation in most of our operations our comparable operating income increased 5 5 compared to last year as lower sweetener costs a favorable currency hedging position in south america and operating expenses expense efficiencies were offset by higher pet prices among our operations our comparable operating cash flow was flat year over year consequently our net controlling interest income was mxn5 541 billion for earnings per share of mxn2 64 per share additionally we reported quarterly earnings per share of mxn1 38 for our continuing operations as we consider the philippines business a discontinued operation finally i would like to thank hector after more than 25 years as our chief financial officer and a distinguished career of more than 37 years at femsa for his

throughout this journey we sustain our company s strong capital structure and financial flexibility maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation while capitalizing on our operational

and has been very helpful for me and my transition into coca cola femsa i would like to share my five key priorities as i take the role number one ensure we maintain our solid financial foundation and a disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to continuously improve our return over invested capital number two continue evolving the finance function with a business partner mindset working collaboratively with our operations and other functions to ensure that they re fully equipped to drive our top and bottom line results and maximize shareholder value third guarantee that we continue attracting and developing our talent base in the finance function number four continuing with our approach of transparency fair disclosure and continuous communication with our stakeholders and finally support john and the senior leadership team in our continuous journey of cultural transformation reinforcing our dna elements number one our obsessive focus on customers and consumers number two our operational excellence focus three continue creating owners mentality across everyone who works at coca cola femsa number four putting people first in every decision we make and finally agile decision making and agile organization as something that is very critical in a volatile uncertain complex a environment that we face turning to our operational and financial highlights it is important to note that several factors affected the comparability of our year over year results for the fourth quarter number one as previously announced due to the change in the reporting method the result of coca cola femsa venezuela are no longer included in our consolidated financial statements as of january 1 2018 number two volume and financial results of our recently acquired territories in guatemala and uruguay were consolidated as of may 1 and july 1 2018 respectively third on august 16 2018 we announced to exercise a put option to sell our 51 stake in the coca cola femsa philippines to the coca cola company that transaction closed on december 13 2018 therefore according to ifrs 5 the philippines operation is presented as a discontinued operation as of january 1 2018 and our consolidated financial statements we represented as if the philippines had been discontinued from the beginning of 2017 consequently our company s consolidated financial results are not comparable to the financial statements published in 2017 number 4 as of july 1 2018 our argentina operation was reported as a hyperinflationary subsidiary this means that we have to reexpress the results of any given month in real terms to the end of the reporting period thus the results of our argentina operation in october and november were reexpressed in real terms as of december 31 also we have to use the end of period exchange rate to translate the reported results of our argentina operation to mexican pesos to better describe our business performance for certain information we present comparable figures excluding the effects of one mergers and acquisitions two translations effects resulting from exchange rate movements three the results of argentina because this operation has become hyperinflationary and number four the results of venezuela in 2017 as it had been deconsolidated guided by our clear strategy we navigated a very complex environment to deliver positive comparable results this year our comparable sales volume increased 0 9 to 972 million unit cases with transactions growing 1 4 comparable total revenues grew 7 8 to mxn50 2 billion comparable operating income grew 4 3 to mxn7 3 billion and comparable operating cash flow grew 4 1 to mxn10 2 billion now i would like to briefly discuss each of our operations highlights for the quarter in mexico we maintained a healthy market share delivering revenue growth of 4 4 in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility our mexico operations volume declined 0 9 as we experienced worse than expected weather conditions in november and december moreover we increased prices in november affecting our volume for the month but proactively preparing us for the beginning of this year 2019 also our portfolio mix impacted our average price for the quarter as multi serve and returnable presentations increased their share of our portfolio mix with regard to profitability our pricing aligned with inflation currency hedging declining sweetener prices and expense control strategies coupled with our digital initiatives partially mitigated higher pet and concentrate prices beginning july 1 2018 the price of concentrate increased another 1 of revenues for the next 12 months moving south into central america we leverage our portfolio of affordable presentations to continue our turnaround in costa rica and guatemala while improving panama s top line growth the consolidation of new territories our successful pre sale model roll out in guatemala and focus on execution enabled us to achieve double digit volume growth and improve our market share in such a competitive market increased prices across our four operations drove mid single digit organic revenue growth despite an organic volume decline of 3 5 our costa rica and panama operations reported low single digit volume contraction while nicaragua continued its low double digit contraction despite softening consumer dynamics resulting for a from a disruptive sociopolitical environment our nicaraguan operators have been able to contain the volume contraction however including our recent acquisitions in guatemala we reported 27 volume growth for the region guatemala continues to perform positively with low single digit organic volume growth and in our new franchises we re capturing synergies through portfolio alignment mainly on the still beverage category as we started implementing order portfolio and we launched our 2 liter multi serve returnable pet presentation which has been working very well in the market for the quarter where lower sweetener prices and expense control strategies were offset by higher pet prices and depreciation of the average exchange rate of the costa rican colon and nicaraguan cordoba as applied to our us denominated raw material costs moving on to south america emerging from a tough macroeconomic environment in brazil we delivered consistent volume growth for the year leveraging upon our affordability strategy our portfolio is very well positioned to satisfy brazil s recovering consumer environment we continue the positive volume trend in brazil marked by a fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth as volume grew 4 5 for the quarter with transactions outperforming volumes our cola s water and still beverage categories volume outperformed for the quarter thanks to our focus on execution and our digital capabilities which enabled us to launch more than 100 innovations in the back end of 2018 which is a great achievement for the team and an important reconfiguration of our portfolio in the market although we increased prices during the quarter to proactively prepare us for the first half of 2019 our price mix benefited from the performance of our single serve presentations however in mexican pesos our revenues were affected by a negative currency translation led by our affordability strategy we improved our volumes in the face of colombia s challenging gradually recovering consumer environment for the quarter we generated 3 1 volume growth with high single digit growth from our colas portfolio thanks to the performance of our returnable 2 liter pet presentation which has achieved double digit growth we also improved the water and still beverage category performance with a personal water portfolio having double digit growth and our launch of del valle frutal improving our share in these categories however after colombia s very positive performance for 2018 we re operating under a very different environment this year starting last january colombia s fiscal reform changed the way vat is applied to sugar beverages and beer from a mono phase to a multi phase scheme this impacts all of the product chain from our distributors to our final consumers while it is too early to tell to confirm the impact of our on our volumes we expect negative performance for the coming year accordingly we re reassessing our current business model to ensure we have a sustainable profitable operation confronting argentina s tough macroeconomic environment and marked by hyperinflation and deep currency devaluation our volume declined 27 for the quarter due to a tough year over year comparability at the year earlier period marked the earlier year period marked the last quarter of a positive currency environment nonetheless we were able to increase our prices ahead of inflation increasing prices by 59 on a local currency basis however due to a negative translation effect our revenues that were reported declined 47 45 moving forward we re much better prepared than ever for this market s challenges thanks to our growing mix of affordable packages and no sugar beverages digital initiatives currency hedging and cost and expense controls with respect to uruguay which we integrated in 2018 our integration process is proceeding according to plan we re countering the region s difficult macroeconomic environment through synergies and long term structural efficiencies we re also improving our market share particularly in the flavored sparkling beverage segments for the fourth quarter we reported sales volume of 13 3 million unit cases like argentina this operation s portfolio enjoys a higher mix of low and no sugar beverages reaching 67 this quarter in our south america division favorable sweetener and aluminum prices coupled with a positive currency hedging and expense control strategy enabled our operations to partially partially offset the higher pet prices and the depreciation of local currencies as applied to our unhedged u s dollar denominated raw material cost which impacted the division s profitability for the fourth quarter in venezuela we continuously adjust our business model to serve our consumers and clients in a very tough and difficult environment to operating finally as a result of the continuous analysis of our investments in joint ventures as of december 13 december 31 sorry 2018 we realized an impairment of our investment in estrella azul our dairy joint venture with the coca cola company in panama the outcome of this analysis let us to register an impairment of mxn432 million both coca cola femsa and the coca cola company are fully committed to continue focusing on this operation in a very profitable way now with regard to our financial results for 2018 we reduced our total debt by mxn1 6 billion compared with year end 2017 this reduction resulted mainly from the payment of 445 million for yankee bond due in 2018 which was partially offset by the new bank loans in mexico and uruguay additionally our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 8 2 including the effect of debt swapped to brazilian reals and mexican pesos this year over year increase was due mainly to our fixed exposure to brazilian reals denominated debt and the effect of the increase of the tiie rate on our bilateral loans in mexican pesos as we receive the proceeds for the sale of our 51 stake in the philippines in december our net leverage ratio ended at 1 61 times our comprehensive financial resort results recorded an expense of mxn2 1 billion resulting from two main factors first a foreign exchange loss in our u s dollar denominated cash exposure as the mexican peso appreciated in december and two in the loss or gain on monetary position line in 2017 we reported a gain for venezuela whereas in 2018 we reported a minor gain for our argentina operation as we are reporting our argentine operation as a hyperinflationary subsidiary we were required to reexpress the results for october and november in real terms as of december 2018 as we use the end of period exchange rate to translate the results to mexican pesos accordingly we recorded a monetary position gain in inflationary subsidiaries of mxn59 million as compared to a gain of mxn460 million in 2017 driven by our venezuela operation during the quarter we reported income tax as a percentage of income before taxes of 30 this result was driven mainly by the increase in the relative weight of brazil s profits in our consolidated results which have a higher tax rate finally as we announced on january 31 2019 and subject to the approval of mexican national banking and securities commission we propose to our shareholders a stock split and the issuance of series b shares to be listed together with series l shares in the form of units to allow our company to increase its capacity to issue new equity which maybe used as consideration in future share based acquisitions as well as for general corporate purposes we will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and we re confident that the listing of series l shares and series b shares in the form of units will help unlock value for shareholders and position coca cola femsa for new growth opportunities in the future obtaining the commission s authorization we will announce the record date and exchange date for all holders of series l shares and the conversion date for our holders of adss we expect that the announcement will happen during the first quarter of 2019 and with that i ll hand the call back over to john for his final remarks thank you very much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you technical difficulty our leadership talent starting this year we are pleased to

capabilities to remain as a beer market developer in the coca cola system operator i would like to open the call to questions thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions and we ll first hear from fernando olvera of bank of america merrill lynch fernando olvera bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for the call i have a couple of questions which are related to brazil i mean regarding volume you registered a really very solid volume growth this quarter and i think the strongest quarterly growth of the year so can you elaborate more on what was behind such growth and how does your market share behave during the quarter also how should we think about consumption this year and what is your outlook on volume grow this year that s all thanks constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you fernando this is constantino well yeah certainly brazil had another positive quarter we continue to be very encouraged by the positive performance we have in brazil it s the fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth as you mentioned volume growth increased 4 5 overall weather helped significantly especially during december in addition to that as i mentioned we have a very successful implementation of affordability initiatives additions to the portfolio as i said during the year we did around 100 launches in brazil across all categories and honestly there is a huge focus on execution at the point of sale by the team and also we have been driven by some digital initiatives across our omni channel strategy our market share remained steady we re gaining some traction in market share both in csds especially in colas but also in juices and nectars and water as well as isotonic and energy drinks overall we re seeing a very very positive beginning of the year the outlook in terms of macroeconomics and consumer optimism in brazil is starting to pick up again so we hope we continue with this trend and momentum in brazil thank you fernando olvera bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks operator next we ll hear from benjamin theurer of barclays benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst yeah good morning everyone and thank you very much for taking my question so two questions actually one on the outlook in mexico what do you expect how do you feel about the consumer environment demand scenario and obviously the fact that you had obviously a little bit of cost pressure from the concentrate what s your pricing strategy looking into 2019 on the mexican market that would be my first question hector trevino former chief financial officer yeah thank you it s constantino again well overall we re seeing positive trend as we start 2019 we have done very been very effective in price management above inflation i mean we re leveraging we re significantly leveraging our analytics platform for the last couple of years which as time goes by becomes more robust and more accurate and allows us to be much more effective not only on pricing and developing a pricing architecture but at the same time on being more efficient in the allocation of discounts and promotions across our different channels so that has been and will continue to be a driver for our performance in mexico next year coupled with significant improvements in our execution at the point of sale on top of that we re seeing a resilient consumer it s gradually recovering confidence january we saw positive volumes the start of the year which is good taking us in the right path although we had some weakness at the end of 2018 but january was pretty positive and at the same time weather has been favorable for us throughout the beginning of the year our portfolio affordability is increasing we are working very hard behind our returnable portfolio and our ncb portfolio also continues to gain traction on the profitability side as you mentioned we re seeing more stable raw materials environments sugar and pet prices significantly which were hard last year coupled with a significant amount of productivity initiatives to protect our bottom line in mexico so i think that probably provides you a little bit of an outlook of what we are seeing for the mexican market john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hi this is john i just think complementing on that just complementing on that i think what we re seeing also is the fact that we will have increased government spending so the short term consumption pattern for mexico on a consumer business specifically in our territories is going to be very favorable constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay and with that do you expect also transactions to somehow pickup because that has been somewhat weakish especially in the fourth quarter but if we take a look transactions throughout the year were slightly negative 2018 versus 2017 so i assume you re expecting a little bit of a recovery there as well because what we re basically seeing was no volume growth throughout the year with some minor transaction and everything came from price so the question is that transaction with less volume what can drive top line growth in 2019 john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer right good question i think one of the things that we we re going to start focusing on more much more heavily this year in mexico is single serve single serve in an affordable way and single serve returnables i think we have a good lesson from the philippines that we can bring into mexico where we can go into having very affordable entry price points ok in a very significant manner in many markets in mexico that requires it so between what we re doing in revenue growth management on multi serve along with the focus on retaking single serve i do think we ll have enhanced transaction growth and revenue growth behind our mexican operation benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay perfect and then just one last question this is really just more of an accounting one on the filing you ve submitted that the mexican stock exchange you basically reported at mxn51 8 billion in revenues to press release throughout the whole report states mxn50 2 billion what s the difference of that 3 because it literally runs throughout the whole income statement just your quick clarification so which number should we actually use constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer benjamin we had a problem with the platform benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst hello operator and just a moment technical difficulty and you may proceed constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer benjamin i don t know benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst yes constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer what you ve heard until we got cut off but again just to reiterate we have benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst inaudible last one and then it got cut off that was the last word plus constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes we had as we were loading the data to the mexican stock exchange platform last night we had very a lot of difficulties putting that data onto the platform and the correct data to focus on is the press release data benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer we ll be correcting the data on the mexican stock exchange during the course of the morning benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay perfect that was all thank you very much and i ll pass it on thanks constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from lucas ferreira of jpmorgan lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst hi first of all i d like to say actually see for hector too have a good look in his this new position actually new phase of his life and my first question is actually on the colombia if you guys can comment on the outlook for volumes how this first month has been and especially considering this change in the vat charge if this if volumes have been coming above expectations and what are the sort of impact that we should expect for volumes in the first quarter and for 2019 and my second question is regarding cost so if you guys can comment on the cost trends for the year if you already foresee some improvements in pet in the first half of the year and also the other main cost lines if we should expect already a better year in terms of front costs per hectoliter sold and if we should see some improvements in margins on the back of that thank you very much operator next question from alan alanis of ubs alan alanis ubs analyst i ll be very happy to ask my question but i don t know if they are on the line john are you on the line operator just a moment alan alanis ubs analyst thank you so much i think they have to reply to lucas question first questions first and then we ll go afterwards operator please hold the line while i reconnect our presenters yes one moment please technical difficulty john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hello operator you may proceed john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer okay thank you hello lucas hello lucas next question operator and we re on alan alan alanis ubs analyst yes i will i mean i ll ask my question but i guess we can circle back afterwards to lucas sorry operator yeah we ll go back we can go back to lucas alan alanis ubs analyst sure i m just trying to be a gentleman here well first of all hector congratulations i mean as a former boss mentor i mean you ve always been a great example and i certainly wish you the best at this new stage you will be missed john constatino my first question has to do with the criteria for transactions in m a post the approval of this split how does it how does it change the criteria if you could just update us on your thinking now that you will be able to issue more shares for m a and that would be the first question and then i have a follow up more regarding what i can you can put it on the table right away it has to do with the role of beer in your portfolio in brazil if our numbers are correct we saw very strong revenue growth for the beer category in your results in the fourth quarter i think that given that heineken said that there was that they reported low mid single digit in the fourth quarter it indicates that you had a lot of pricing in beer in brazil and i just want to see if you can confirm that and what is the overall role of beer in brazil and if you can give us any update in terms of the arbitration that is going on with heineken that will be highly appreciated those will be my two questions john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer well let me tackle the last question first first of all as you know we re in the middle of a i know everybody wants to know about beer in brazil but as you as you re aware we re in the middle of an arbitration process so there is very little we can say about it until the arbitration process finalizes which we expect it to happen between the first half of the year or maybe the beginning of the third quarter so just for those purposes i m not going to comment around our perspective on beer going forward in brazil and i hope you understand that that particular alan alanis ubs analyst i do constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer and in terms of performance you re right the beer category is going to in very positive momentum for us in our region or in the area of influence where operates in brazil i guess heineken has reported some of those numbers and i would rather have the guidance from the heineken relief and conversation that occurred a couple of years ago a couple of months weeks ago sorry but overall we re seeing strong growth the brands heineken and brand amstel have very good momentum and this particular element is something that we re seeing consistently happening in the market for a while and we foresee it happening so the premium segment of the beer category should continue strengthening from our perspective in the brazilian market so that s all i d like to comment around beer and i think the heineken release has a significant information that can provide you guidance in that regard on the m a piece and the stock split as you know the changes that we announced just aim to give us flexibility on our capital structure by increasing our capacity to issue equity that maybe used in as a consideration in future share based on mergers arrival acquisitions however there is no project or initiative or target in mind that drove that decision it has been something in the making for a while actually i have hector on my side who has been the architect of this particular initiative and i ll ask him if he wants to comment beyond that but there is no change in our focus on m a as you know we have been historically known by being very disciplined on our capital allocation and we ll do the investments that are right for our company and our shareholders at the proper value and at the proper time and the mechanism that we put behind those transactions is defined at the moment we see that the target and the initiative unfolding i don t know hector wants to comment something on the stock split to give you a little bit more guidance alan alanis ubs analyst thank you hector trevino former chief financial officer good morning as constantino mentioned this has been in the making for many years actually since the vonpar acquisition we started to define this need and if you remember we had this convertible that was issued with respect to that acquisition and that requires this structure to be in place it took a lot of time because we were looking for and in conversation with the authorities so that we can have a single unit trading as opposed to having series b and series l with a split trading that in our opinion will create some liquidity and issue pricing problem for us so we finally got the authorization at the end of last year we were caught with the christmas break and the change in the government and finally we got final approval in january but as constantino said it s basically talking of what we ll develop and plan for quite basically for 3 2 5 years the series b shares would now have some volume rise which i think that is very good for our for our shareholders and investors in this inaudible john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer alan this is john i think as you go through these three acquisitions of coca cola femsa sometimes you use the large component of debt and sometimes you use the a large component of equity but always trying to maintain our ratios within region and some and what we have here is incremental flexibility ok to make sure that as we see opportunities when they come up and sometimes are not necessarily projectable that we have the financial strength and flexibility to do something that is reasonable and conservative for our shareholders assuming that we did whatever transaction we have going forward is accretive and i think this allows us a broader spectrum to go out there and feel comfortable that we re in a great financial position and also in great capital position to continue down the path of doing further transactions alan alanis ubs analyst got it that s very useful thank you so much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you alan constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you alan operator and lucas your line is reopen you may pose your question again at this time lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst i think you i m not sure if you issue listen to the questions but the first one was related to the elasticity in colombia if this is coming better than expected what sort of impact you guys are expecting the volumes for the first quarter and full year if you can comment at least versus your expectations initial expectations and the second question was regarding the costs wanted to know and what part of the the curve we are in terms of pressures especially from pet which i think should be to remain the one of the lines pressuring your costs so can we expect already better cost base in the quarters to come and what about the full year 2019 thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer lucas how are you regarding colombia obviously the elimination of the tax benefit that we had in and our plant is a very very large impact for us and to change our short term strategy of want to going out there and restructuring our colombian operation in a lot of different fronts the first one was pricing which we took up immediately in january we took up over 6 pricing secondly we had a resize beginning to resize our operation we ve taken out 200 people in colombia basically staff people to resize that operation thirdly we re looking at redeveloping our route to market plus our supply chain distribution network because all of our benefits were stuck in the inaudible plant and we re looking to we reallocate those to the different plants that we have so i think the first four to five six months in colombia are going to be very focused on restructuring to make sure that we re facing the environment in the correct manner in sizing our company to that manner what we think about elasticity is we ve taken up the prices and we re better than what we thought so we have at the 6 rate we re not looking we re not seeing the same type of elasticity as we had before in the vat was taken across the whole country couple of years ago so we re much better off than what we thought and we re encouraged by what we re seeing in terms of savings and obviously it s a very challenging year for colombia but i think we re on the right track with the right portfolio and with the right management as well constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer now lucas and around and to your other questions regarding raw materials pet and sugar we are seeing a better curve going forward in 2019 compared to 2018 so overall our outlook in that particular element inline in our p l should be more favorable this year than in the previous year lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst thank you very much operator and next we ll hear from antonio gonzalez of credit suisse antonio gonzalez credit suisse analyst hi good morning everyone thank you for taking my question first similarly thank you for everything hector and congrats on a truly remarkable career and constantino best of luck on this new role i have two questions the first one on dividend you mentioned in today s press release that the board has proposed the dividend of mxn3 54 per share which is 5 7 growth versus last year and obviously there has been a debate recently up there you exited from the philippines on whether you could substantially increase the payout on the other hand obviously flexibility on the macro side in mexico i guess has diminished significantly so i just wanted to pick your brains as to what is the latest thinking with respect to the payout policy do you think we will remain at similar levels for the next couple of years or do you actually see a room for a substantial increase and if so in which time frame and then secondly i just wanted to ask very quickly what triggers is there any specific events that triggered their write off in panama and is there any long term learning here that would extrapolate your diary ventures elsewhere or is it more of a specific situation thank you so much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you thank you antonio let me address the dividend issue first we are taking back our dividend policy to about for the 2019 year in payout to the to about 20 21 those was historically we would have increased dividends further but we wanted to but we want to make sure that we have the cash on hand to pay off a 500 million yankee bond that comes due in february ok of 2020 okay so we didn t see any economic benefit of going out there and borrowing to report to go out there and do a such a short term transaction to bring down the yankee so we wanted to keep that cash on hand so going forward once we re over that hump we do have a possibility of increasing the dividend policy going forward for coca cola femsa and that would be our objective however we also would be very constrained we re very concerned with how market conditions continue to evolve and what we want to make sure that we have enough financial flexibility and strength on our balance sheet to be able to ensure that whatever future dividends that we re going to go out there and increase are sustainable secondly in terms of the write off of the panama operation the panama operation is the first real foray into value added dairy that we had and i think what we ve had is a lot of delays on the plant the law in terms of up bring up the plant into a and respect this was neither a remake nor a greenfield or around we have a what we saw a brownfield that we re just making the plant within a new plant within the existing plant so that if you have ever remodeled your home is a very difficult situation so we ve encountered delays and we are also learning a heck of a lot more about how to manage dairies because this is really the first time when we ve gone into cold and value added dairies with yogurts ok ice creams so it s been a very large learning process that we don t have anywhere else ok in mexico we are basically all uht or even in brazil where it is chilled but it is on a separate basis so i think it s a very specific thing to panama that you really cannot go out there and project any place to us now that being said we just came back from panama couple of days ago and i m very encouraged to see exactly how the project is coming along the momentum is gaining and how the our production platform is coming on stream nicely antonio gonzalez credit suisse analyst gracias john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer you re welcome operator and before we take our next caller i would like to remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question allowing others a chance to ask a question next we will hear from carlos laboy of hsbc carlos laboy hsbc analyst hector congratulations and thank you for 25 years of forthright honesty and straight shooting which has been i think very helpful for everybody john the catalog of achievements that you listed at the start of the call we all get it it s what makes you maybe the most valuable bottler coke s ever had anywhere in the world almost 25 years for driving next frontier execution but it all makes for a really great eulogy if you can exceed your cost of capital on a sustained basis when you look at the pressures you re facing in brazil and you look at the pressures that you re facing with non core profitability with the marketing maybe of effectiveness at driving growth for your core brand can you exceed your cost of capital without these things getting fixed and the follow up to that then is you said that you re going to evaluate geographic and category opportunities but you re also increasing the dividend so are you willing to consider geographic opportunities for asset sales not just for purchases if you re staring at situations where you can t get from your partner what you need for exceeding your cost of capital john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hello carlos laboy hsbc analyst yes john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer carlos a couple of things yes over the last couple of years we ve had a series of we ve had a series of years where we are not making our cost we are making or slightly under the cost of capital for coca cola femsa and i think that s a true reflection of the market in terms of how we ve gotten the value coca cola femsa we get it s just not been increasing shareholder value now there is a couple of reasons for that and i think there s the valuations there is incremental cost for raw materials and yes importantly there has been also incidence increases that had also been affecting us to the tune over the last three four years of about 154 million that continued to give us headwinds there has been consumer headwinds and there s been tax headwinds as well so i think overall being close to cost to capital has not been bad but it is not what we need ok the issue is how do we go out there and continue to grow cost achieve our cost of capital couple of things first in the general picture we need to go out there and amplify our portfolio well firstly we need to just to get our csd portfolio back on track and i think it was very encouraging to see during 2018 that coca cola brand coca cola grew almost 2 ok in terms of volume and i think we ve put also a lot more revenue into the coca cola system by growing both revenues and volume and transaction fees over the brand coca cola and secondly we need to go out there and fix on our non carb business or make it not fixed i would say let s make it more profitable okay right now where we are it is growing but it s not nearly as profitable as our growth business but it is as i would argue is marginal to the whole process so or to the whole structure so the more we go out there and grow the more margin we do enhance now when we bring down the coca cola the non carb business it is what non carb business you want to talk about because within the non carb business there s a series of large business of businesses that are very profitable energy key low constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer isotonic john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer isotonics and one we have to start i think getting better returns on just basic juices and nectars and there s two ways of doing that one is going out there getting better formulations ok and secondly there is also case is going up and doing a better portfolio by premiumizing it and i think brazil as the last time you were down there you saw how we premiumize the juice the juice portfolio making sure that we re going out there with higher premium category glass products and they re doing very well and there is a lot of margin involved in that so i think from that end we re starting to advance on the portfolio and getting it much more accretive for our coca cola femsa coca cola femsa shareholders secondly i think it s in water in water we have to go out there and figure out exactly what we just did in juices in terms of developing a portfolio of premium brands ok to be able to really develop the brands and to make sure that we have enhanced profitability over what we have today today in most most countries we play with a core brand which is cl in some places crystal in brazil that tries to play gamma across premium value and four mainstream and what we need to do is go out there and develop those brands differently we need we ve just launched smartwater in brazil we ve launched smartwater in argentina in the mississippian basis but those are the type of initiatives we need to continue to develop fully and aggressively to make sure that that portfolio becomes as profitable as carbonated soft drinks and in carbonated soft drinks and i just said this on another question we need to refocus on engaging on transactions on single serves and i think there we can do that by going back into glass and returnables ok in a way that i think our competitors can t ok both in brazil and mexico and elsewhere so i think there is a good story let s say that we re well poised to be able to go out and increase our profitability and our margins to cover our cost of capital and grow at the same time we turn to brazil you re saying whether brazil beer is something that we need to do and we don t need to do obviously we can t comment on the existing arbitration but the world is moving toward more and more integrated platforms and brazil is an example i think there s other countries that are also examples and i think it s more compelling in brazil than any place itself and for us it would be very important for us to be able to have a beer solution in brazil i don t know if that covers all your questions carlos carlos laboy hsbc analyst yes the final question is that you had mentioned that you re going to continue to evaluate geographic and category opportunities but everyone assumes that that means that you re going to consider more asset sales but more asset purchase but what you ve done mostly recently is sales the philippines or do you look at your existing portfolio of territories to sort out well maybe there s something in here that we shouldn t have john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer sure let me be clear about this i mean the thing with the philippines was a very specific transaction structure for the philippines and asia and the way it was set up the deal was set up and that s what we negotiated at the time is that we ll go out there and we are putting the call and we had to go out and exercise the call to be able to further acquire territories and in asia and given what s happened in the philippines with the tax on sugar we couldn t find a way that make whole of the prices that we had in the original transaction and so therefore we instead of going out and modifying the whole transaction but we what we landed up doing was just putting it back to the company that philosophy is not in coke femsa s dna ok we re not going we re not asset sellers ok i don t have it in vision to go out there and sell assets at this point any pesos and later on from in the philippines we just went out there and acquired two franchises in guatemala and one in uruguay that i would say gives you the pace of where we want to go in the future we will continue to look at opportunities both on a category basis and a territory basis carlos ok again just making sure that we re not going out there and destroying shareholder value carlos laboy hsbc analyst thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer well operator next we ll hear from alex robarts of citi alex robarts citigroup analyst yes hi everybody thank you and i did want to start out by saying to hector thank you very much for the financial stewardship through the years and i hope the best in your well deserved retirement two questions from my side one on the operating deleverage in south america and then the second on non carbs i guess we kind of came into the quarter thinking about lower sugar in south america but then higher pet but what seem to kind of really explain or at least impact a lot of the deleverage right you show us comparatively 12 top line in south america growth in the quarter with 2 ebitda growth and that difference seems to kind of go to the what you call the raw material hedge the unfavorable hedge there could you give us some more color as to what specifically was behind that raw material unfavorable hedge was it a particular input was it several and might we expect some relief in this seasonally strong summer here in the first quarter or might that continue to be unfavorable so that s the first question the second one relates to non carbs and interesting trend you talked about it with us in the fall in new york when you came up and now with the full year numbers we can kind of see how those non carb volumes fall then when you look at mexico and brazil it s kind of a tale of two cities flat non carb volume growth in mexico last year and i guess the kind of the impact there is bulk water coming down the question is is that going to continue to be a focus for you or is that something that you want deemphasized and should we continue that for to see that decline the other side is brazil where your mid teen non carb growth a lot of it is stills also waters but it strikes me that it s 20 of the volume of non carbs in mexico and so does m a become something that you would look at this year in non carbs in brazil to kind of perhaps more right size that kind of growing piece of your volume and the final piece on the non carbs last week coca cola company talks about in the conference that new products accounted for about 17 volume growth last year how does how do you think about just generally new products and the impact it can have on your growth this year would it be like coke s number of mid teens thanks very much a lot of kind of sub questions but i appreciate the time john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer and alex let me inaudible try to take the last ones first and then i ll let hector or constantino talk about the hedging question that you asked i think let me talk a little bit about bulk water because bulk water is a good place to start on this conversation we do have a very large bulk water business in mexico ok and that is it s profitable but it s not necessarily as profitable as we d like it to be and we ve been working on maintaining or growing our profitability on primarily the 19 20 liter jug business and there what you ll be seeing and what we re going to be emphasizing is obtaining better margins on that business in light of the sacrificing volume what we d like to do is continue to price up ok and continue to gain better margins and obviously also become much more efficient in our operation that we have and there and i would say the focus of this would probably be more southwest of mexico and then we have at any place else so the 20 liter jug business in mexico is a big deal and the profitability on bulk water 5 liter business is also something you re going to be looking at to make sure that we have the proper returns on that business so that s something we ll focus on in both mexico colombia is also an issue with that in terms of the 5 liter and 6 liter bottle 6 liter bag business and how do we start making our profitability a little bit better on those packs on the non carb business in brazil as you said and i think one of the things to understand is we restructured that whole business in a big way other than 100 skus that we launched the majority of those are non carbs and we re basically going toward two things first is competing first is putting ourselves in a competitive situation in our plants with cold fill products which were coming out of lao ph and now and we re resourcing them out of jundiai ok and that transition from the lao ph plant to the jundiai plant is giving us at least giving us an advantage to compete in low cold fill juices that is really the bottom part of the market and that will allow us at the same token to be able to increase prices ok on the core leader tetra juices and vectors ok which we were sacrificing before just to be able to maintain margins and also the increase in all the glass and hot fill capability is in terms of premium products that we re doing is also leading to better profitability and we should start seeing that continue to grow but profitably sell in brazil over the first six months to seven months of the year so i think where we are and in mexico what we re looking at is better formulations better cost structures and we have enormous opportunity to make these better both in mexico and brazil so i think that the focus is the right one and we re encouraged to see that we will be able to go out and increase our profitability and non carbs ok and bulk water businesses constantino do you want to take a look at the hedges constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer sure if i understand your question what you re asking was the biggest impact in south america regarding the cost for the quarter but i would tell you is that pet was the main driver in across all markets particularly in brazil and argentina we had significant price increases in dollar terms in brazil almost 30 increases in pet costs in brazil part of that was unhedged but if you couple that with devaluation in brazil there was a significant impact for us in that particular operation that considering the size of brazil in our south american region that has a an important impact for us we also had some some labor cost increases in a couple of markets argentina and brazil and that explains most of the impact in cost that we had in the fourth quarter for brazil i don t know if that tackles your question alex robarts citigroup analyst i guess sorry constantino specifically the raw material hedge i mean which you talk about in the press release was there it was the hedged it was the dollar hedged price for certain raw materials correct and that is something that will roll constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes alex robarts citigroup analyst okay and the question is will that roll off is that going to continue into the first quarter the question was sorry on the actual hedge yeah constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes actually we have a very say very disciplined approach toward hedging both on currency and on raw materials i don t know if you re aware of our routine but we have monthly routine with every single operation and probably crm process we redefine and we define bands and coverage levels for our critical raw materials sugar pet aluminum et cetera and we also look at the coverage from our currencies especially in such a volatile environment so yes the question is yes it will continue it s part of cost disciplined approach on the operation management and a way in which the finance function supports on our operations so yes it will continue i reiterate that answer for you operator luca cipiccia of goldman sachs luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for the time and taking my question hector congratulations and best wishes just two follow ups from my side one i think in your introduction remarks you made some reference on the investments you re making on digital capabilities and i was hoping maybe you could qualify a little bit better some of this or little bit more rather some of this initiatives how relevant are they for your operation for your partners and also how are these being rolled out across markets are you starting from mexico and then implementing them across the board or is this i m just trying to get a sense of how relevant are much of a step change how much of the incremental benefit there could be from some of this measure that you made reference to that s the first question and then secondly on the portfolio and on the dairy strategy also in light of your comments on panama do you think the system overall in dairy would could benefit from a more organic strategies across strategy across market or in other words do you think that there would be a rationale for a jugos del valle type of structure or transaction or addition given that the execution and the portfolio itself can appear not entirely consistent across all markets the dairy presence is stronger in certain markets weaker in other and in some there isn t any both of your franchises and other franchise so i don t know if you have any comment on that i d be interested in hearing your views thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer sure on the digital front first thing is that what we ve done in digital it has a lot of components to it and they have a commercial component it has a manufacturing distribution component and it has also an administrative and back office component or saas component let me just take you through what i think is probably the most valuable piece which is the cost commercial component there what we ve put out is a digital platform that starts with the analytics database ok for and let me just use mexico as an example for the detail but it goes out there in has per account we have about 7 000 pieces of information and we have all the detail on 800 000 accounts that we have in mexico and with few analytics and we also have this is not going to do the that model as well as purchase structure consumer purchase structures it gives us the insight as to how to go out there and manage down to the point of sale and making sure that we have the right pricing structure the right packaging structure ok and now we re also getting into the right demand structure but all those analytics connect to our marketing department and the marketing department goes right into the sales department and we have immediate work orders for each one of our point of sale with independent of or would be customized promotions for them and we have the ability to send out these work orders on a weekly basis and the feedback that we re getting obviously is weekly and we understand exactly what we re executing how we re executing and what is working for us and not we have the capability of launching in mexico 5 million consumer customer initiatives on a monthly basis and getting that information back and obviously that s a lot of data and a lot of change management well what has it given us it s given us first place execution in mexico brazil and argentina ok an incremental execution right now in colombia we ve rolled out this platform in our traditional trade throughout all our countries ok the marketing platform the analytics have rolled out in mexico and colombia and they will be rolling out in brazil this year as well ok and we ve postponed argentina given the hyperinflationary situation that we confront over there so that s going to be postponed so we get a more stable economic environment what s it given us besides better execution it s given us better price realization we d be now able to take pricing above inflation ok in these countries and it s also given us a better return on discount and so our roi on promotions have increased in mexico of by 9 points and in colombia by about 5 points so giving us real pricing power and is getting to be more effective now the second implication important to all this is that when we have all this information we re starting to look at it as a forecasting tool and we ve put together an artificial intelligence space so we can go out and predict demand ok from all the points of sale going forward and we are testing this right now in the mexico in one of our warehouses and we re getting up to 5 points of better accuracy on demand prediction and demand sensing which will allow us to become a much more efficient supply chain overall and so all that is done by outlook by the way so as we gain more experience we ll be going through this and opening it up into mexico in a bigger way and then rolling it out through all the country so if you look at the commercial platform we ve rolled it out in terms of the sap handheld and marketing analytics piece i mean the not the marketing analytics piece but the handheld to all our countries in the analytics are following this year now the second big bucket that we have that goes along with this is how do we become much more intertwined and digitized with our supply chain so we ve implemented what we have in mexico on a jda platform which is a logistics platform throughout all of our countries already and it s centralized in mexico and that s been providing us with about 25 million worth of savings ok we ve put also digital distributors we have all our routes in mexico are now on are digitized we know exactly where they are how they can deliver in brazil all of our routes and all of our trades are digitized and we re looking to roll that out into other places as well i think there is an enormous amount of value that we re creating there and obviously we ll continue to be leading forward in terms of the coca cola system the other question you had was on the portfolio strategy on milk or dairy luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst yeah john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer and if there is other acquisitions potential acquisitions out there that could make sense yes we d take a look at it ok and depending on the values that we think we can create for our shareholders we go out there and pursue it i think there are a lot of synergies to be had with those categories but there are also significant differences that you have to understand which we re understanding in panama which is called and also the short shelf life products that are totally different business than what we have in coca cola but they are something that we d be looking at continuously luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst hector just thank you very much for the answer for the details it s very interesting just on the dairy just to the angle of my question was also across the categories typically you have brands and brands or products that work across geographies there is a little bit of an exception where every country has got its own in a sense so is that something that you see should change could change or does it make sense to do it that way john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer no i don t think it makes a lot of sense to go out there and try to leverage dairy from one country with another unless its uht ok milk is a very regional business and so i don t think necessarily we have a large strategy going forward on that end i do think we have brands like ades that goes out there and plays in that space but on the feed base that is expandable and which we are expanding ok but dairy is more of a local business in the local with local credentials operator and our final question for today will come from alvaro garcia of btg alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst hi thanks for the call most of my questions have been answered maybe you could provide a road map so on the capital allocation front we think of the mxn700 million you received from the philippines perhaps you could provide a road map sort of including the yankee bond up in february next year of how much debt you expect to pay down over the next 12 months to 18 months thank you constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes hi this is constantino basically we ve analyzed the proceeds of that transaction that we did it in the philippines and very straightforward our intent is to use the the cash that we received to take our debt continue our deleveraging path and most importantly i think that in february of next year 2020 we have a yankee bond that is due and we ll be using the proceeds of that transaction to continue lowering our net debt ratio which is quite healthy right now at 1 6 so that gives us a very flexible profile balance sheet going forward so the answer is yes we ll use the proceeds to continue deleveraging and pay our debt alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst apart from that is it fair to assume that this year maybe we ll see a 200 million in some pay down of debt just sort to get to that 700 million or is that yankee bond really the only thing you have on your target hector trevino former chief financial officer we already used part of the proceed to repay some of the bilateral loans that we have john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer correct hector trevino former chief financial officer that were related to the uruguay and guatemala acquisition so that s basically that with that being the 200 million plus it was 500 million inaudible 240 million ph multiple speakers that we have in february 2020 that will basically cover 700 million and as john and

anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer good morning everyone thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 2018 results constantino spas hector trevino and maria dyla castro are all with us today we completed a historic year for our company as we celebrated the 25th anniversary of coca cola femsa s incorporation and stock exchange listing at the time of its ipo in september 1993 our company was valued at mxn1 billion today our company is valued at almost mxn13 billion 13 times its original market value for an annual total return to shareholders of over 19 2 in 1994 we took our first step abroad with the acquisition of coca cola buenos aires in argentina in 2003 we see the leadership position of the beverage industry with the transformational acquisition of panamco expanding our presence to nine of latin america s most important markets and multiplying our volumes six times from 2008 to 2016 we strengthened our company s leadership position in brazil with the acquisition and integration of four significant franchises that expanded our presence to more than 50 of the coca cola system countrywide correspondingly we bolstered our footprint in mexico through our merger and integration of four bottling franchises from 2011 to 2013 moreover we remain at the forefront of the total beverage portfolio evolution first our joint acquisition of jugos del valle in 2007 captured the potential of a powerful brand that is now one of the coca cola system s a 1 billion brands second we established a partnership with inaudible in brazil to develop a broad portfolio of stills beverages third we began our journey into the value added dairy category through our joint ventures in with estrella azul in panama santa clara in mexico and verde campo in brazil more recently we entered a new plant based beverage category with our joint acquisition of ades in 2017 finally in 2018 we integrated two franchises in guatemala and expanded our geographic footprint to uruguay to continue capitalizing on strategic long term value creation opportunities for coca cola femsa over the past 25 years we have reinvested more than mxn20 billion in our business with mxn11 4 billion in accretive mergers and acquisitions and joined the privilege of integrating great bobbing franchises traditional families and great collaborators into this coca cola femsa new coca cola femsa business our entrepreneurial spirit and passion for customers and consumers have always powder our drive to innovate through the integration of transformative practices that have been followed by bottlers around the world from revenue growth management to segmented point of sale execution and end to end supply chain integration now we are taking our continuous evolution even further setting a new frontier with cutting edge digital technology tailored to create a new competitive advantage based on our demand driven coca cola femsa commercial digital platform advanced market analytics and cost digital distribution platforms integrated which integrate revolutionary capabilities to set the new standards for the way we serve our markets and consumers focused on our clear strategy we finished the year of continued transformation and growth after a successful inaudible fiber turnaround of the philippines operation we sold our 51 stake in coca cola femsa philippines as the best course of action for our company s shareholders looking forward we will continually evaluate geographic and category opportunities maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation to maximize our shareholders returns with that in mind 2018 was a year of restructuring and transformation marked by first the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operation at the end of 2017 secondly the sale of the stake of the philippines at the end of 2018 thirdly the integration of three new franchises in guatemala and uruguay and fourth the adoption of hyperinflationary accounting in argentina moreover in the face of a complex volatile macroeconomic environment in some of our markets we put coca cola femsa on an extremely solid financial foundation we not only reduced our net leverage position but also affirmed our credit ratings by moody s and standard and poor s we reported solid comparable topline growth of close to 6 for 2018 our revenue management initiatives backed by analytics and deployed in an agile and assertive way directly in each point of sale allowed us to create comparable volumes 1 2 and growth of 1 2 while prices were ahead of or in line with inflation in most of our operations our comparable operating income increased 5 5 compared to last year as lower sweetener costs a favorable currency hedging position in south america and operating expenses expense efficiencies were offset by higher pet prices among our operations our comparable operating cash flow was flat year over year consequently our net controlling interest income was mxn5 541 billion for earnings per share of mxn2 64 per share additionally we reported quarterly earnings per share of mxn1 38 for our continuing operations as we consider the philippines business a discontinued operation finally i would like to thank hector after more than 25 years as our chief financial officer and a distinguished career of more than 37 years at femsa for his collaboration and his friendship hector decided to retire effective december 31 2018 over the years hector let our company s profitable growth through his strategic vision unwavering financial discipline and unmatched work effect hector s leaving a lasting legacy for constantino to build on and many many friendships deep freindships at coca cola femsa and the coca cola company with that let me turn this call over to hector hector trevino former chief financial officer thank you john and good morning everyone for me and for our company it has been a very impressive 25 years journey throughout this journey we sustain our company s strong capital structure and financial flexibility maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation while capitalizing on our operational excellence to smoothly and successfully integrating new territories and various categories into our company consequently we are now the largest non alcoholic beverage company in latin america creating value for our shareholders by multiplying the original value of coca cola femsa by 13 times coca cola femsa cross through a successful grown growth story and i am thankful for all the people with whom i interacted they play an important part in my career and with that i would hand the call over to constantino constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you hector and good morning everyone i m very honored to have the opportunity to continue with the legacy that hector has built for this organization hector is not only a phenomenal cfo but also a great mentor and friend and has been very helpful for me and my transition into coca cola femsa i would like to share my five key priorities as i take the role number one ensure we maintain our solid financial foundation and a disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to continuously improve our return over invested capital number two continue evolving the finance function with a business partner mindset working collaboratively with our operations and other functions to ensure that they re fully equipped to drive our top and bottom line results and maximize shareholder value third guarantee that we continue attracting and developing our talent base in the finance function number four continuing with our approach of transparency fair disclosure and continuous communication with our stakeholders and finally support john and the senior leadership team in our continuous journey of cultural transformation reinforcing our dna elements number one our obsessive focus on customers and consumers number two our operational excellence focus three continue creating owners mentality across everyone who works at coca cola femsa number four putting people first in every decision we make and finally agile decision making and agile organization as something that is very critical in a volatile uncertain complex a environment that we face turning to our operational and financial highlights it is important to note that several factors affected the comparability of our year over year results for the fourth quarter number one as previously announced due to the change in the reporting method the result of coca cola femsa venezuela are no longer included in our consolidated financial statements as of january 1 2018 number two volume and financial results of our recently acquired territories in guatemala and uruguay were consolidated as of may 1 and july 1 2018 respectively third on august 16 2018 we announced to exercise a put option to sell our 51 stake in the coca cola femsa philippines to the coca cola company that transaction closed on december 13 2018 therefore according to ifrs 5 the philippines operation is presented as a discontinued operation as of january 1 2018 and our consolidated financial statements we represented as if the philippines had been discontinued from the beginning of 2017 consequently our company s consolidated financial results are not comparable to the financial statements published in 2017 number 4 as of july 1 2018 our argentina operation was reported as a hyperinflationary subsidiary this means that we have to reexpress the results of any given month in real terms to the end of the reporting period thus the results of our argentina operation in october and november were reexpressed in real terms as of december 31 also we have to use the end of period exchange rate to translate the reported results of our argentina operation to mexican pesos to better describe our business performance for certain information we present comparable figures excluding the effects of one mergers and acquisitions two translations effects resulting from exchange rate movements three the results of argentina because this operation has become hyperinflationary and number four the results of venezuela in 2017 as it had been deconsolidated guided by our clear strategy we navigated a very complex environment to deliver positive comparable results this year our comparable sales volume increased 0 9 to 972 million unit cases with transactions growing 1 4 comparable total revenues grew 7 8 to mxn50 2 billion comparable operating income grew 4 3 to mxn7 3 billion and comparable operating cash flow grew 4 1 to mxn10 2 billion now i would like to briefly discuss each of our operations highlights for the quarter in mexico we maintained a healthy market share delivering revenue growth of 4 4 in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility our mexico operations volume declined 0 9 as we experienced worse than expected weather conditions in november and december moreover we increased prices in november affecting our volume for the month but proactively preparing us for the beginning of this year 2019 also our portfolio mix impacted our average price for the quarter as multi serve and returnable presentations increased their share of our portfolio mix with regard to profitability our pricing aligned with inflation currency hedging declining sweetener prices and expense control strategies coupled with our digital initiatives partially mitigated higher pet and concentrate prices beginning july 1 2018 the price of concentrate increased another 1 of revenues for the next 12 months moving south into central america we leverage our portfolio of affordable presentations to continue our turnaround in costa rica and guatemala while improving panama s top line growth the consolidation of new territories our successful pre sale model roll out in guatemala and focus on execution enabled us to achieve double digit volume growth and improve our market share in such a competitive market increased prices across our four operations drove mid single digit organic revenue growth despite an organic volume decline of 3 5 our costa rica and panama operations reported low single digit volume contraction while nicaragua continued its low double digit contraction despite softening consumer dynamics resulting for a from a disruptive sociopolitical environment our nicaraguan operators have been able to contain the volume contraction however including our recent acquisitions in guatemala we reported 27 volume growth for the region guatemala continues to perform positively with low single digit organic volume growth and in our new franchises we re capturing synergies through portfolio alignment mainly on the still beverage category as we started implementing order portfolio and we launched our 2 liter multi serve returnable pet presentation which has been working very well in the market for the quarter where lower sweetener prices and expense control strategies were offset by higher pet prices and depreciation of the average exchange rate of the costa rican colon and nicaraguan cordoba as applied to our us denominated raw material costs moving on to south america emerging from a tough macroeconomic environment in brazil we delivered consistent volume growth for the year leveraging upon our affordability strategy our portfolio is very well positioned to satisfy brazil s recovering consumer environment we continue the positive volume trend in brazil marked by a fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth as volume grew 4 5 for the quarter with transactions outperforming volumes our cola s water and still beverage categories volume outperformed for the quarter thanks to our focus on execution and our digital capabilities which enabled us to launch more than 100 innovations in the back end of 2018 which is a great achievement for the team and an important reconfiguration of our portfolio in the market although we increased prices during the quarter to proactively prepare us for the first half of 2019 our price mix benefited from the performance of our single serve presentations however in mexican pesos our revenues were affected by a negative currency translation led by our affordability strategy we improved our volumes in the face of colombia s challenging gradually recovering consumer environment for the quarter we generated 3 1 volume growth with high single digit growth from our colas portfolio thanks to the performance of our returnable 2 liter pet presentation which has achieved double digit growth we also improved the water and still beverage category performance with a personal water portfolio having double digit growth and our launch of del valle frutal improving our share in these categories however after colombia s very positive performance for 2018 we re operating under a very different environment this year starting last january colombia s fiscal reform changed the way vat is applied to sugar beverages and beer from a mono phase to a multi phase scheme this impacts all of the product chain from our distributors to our final consumers while it is too early to tell to confirm the impact of our on our volumes we expect negative performance for the coming year accordingly we re reassessing our current business model to ensure we have a sustainable profitable operation confronting argentina s tough macroeconomic environment and marked by hyperinflation and deep currency devaluation our volume declined 27 for the quarter due to a tough year over year comparability at the year earlier period marked the earlier year period marked the last quarter of a positive currency environment nonetheless we were able to increase our prices ahead of inflation increasing prices by 59 on a local currency basis however due to a negative translation effect our revenues that were reported declined 47 45 moving forward we re much better prepared than ever for this market s challenges thanks to our growing mix of affordable packages and no sugar beverages digital initiatives currency hedging and cost and expense controls with respect to uruguay which we integrated in 2018 our integration process is proceeding according to plan we re countering the region s difficult macroeconomic environment through synergies and long term structural efficiencies we re also improving our market share particularly in the flavored sparkling beverage segments for the fourth quarter we reported sales volume of 13 3 million unit cases like argentina this operation s portfolio enjoys a higher mix of low and no sugar beverages reaching 67 this quarter in our south america division favorable sweetener and aluminum prices coupled with a positive currency hedging and expense control strategy enabled our operations to partially partially offset the higher pet prices and the depreciation of local currencies as applied to our unhedged u s dollar denominated raw material cost which impacted the division s profitability for the fourth quarter in venezuela we continuously adjust our business model to serve our consumers and clients in a very tough and difficult environment to operating finally as a result of the continuous analysis of our investments in joint ventures as of december 13 december 31 sorry 2018 we realized an impairment of our investment in estrella azul our dairy joint venture with the coca cola company in panama the outcome of this analysis let us to register an impairment of mxn432 million both coca cola femsa and the coca cola company are fully committed to continue focusing on this operation in a very profitable way now with regard to our financial results for 2018 we reduced our total debt by mxn1 6 billion compared with year end 2017 this reduction resulted mainly from the payment of 445 million for yankee bond due in 2018 which was partially offset by the new bank loans in mexico and uruguay additionally our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 8 2 including the effect of debt swapped to brazilian reals and mexican pesos this year over year increase was due mainly to our fixed exposure to brazilian reals denominated debt and the effect of the increase of the tiie rate on our bilateral loans in mexican pesos as we receive the proceeds for the sale of our 51 stake in the philippines in december our net leverage ratio ended at 1 61 times our comprehensive financial resort results recorded an expense of mxn2 1 billion resulting from two main factors first a foreign exchange loss in our u s dollar denominated cash exposure as the mexican peso appreciated in december and two in the loss or gain on monetary position line in 2017 we reported a gain for venezuela whereas in 2018 we reported a minor gain for our argentina operation as we are reporting our argentine operation as a hyperinflationary subsidiary we were required to reexpress the results for october and november in real terms as of december 2018 as we use the end of period exchange rate to translate the results to mexican pesos accordingly we recorded a monetary position gain in inflationary subsidiaries of mxn59 million as compared to a gain of mxn460 million in 2017 driven by our venezuela operation during the quarter we reported income tax as a percentage of income before taxes of 30 this result was driven mainly by the increase in the relative weight of brazil s profits in our consolidated results which have a higher tax rate finally as we announced on january 31 2019 and subject to the approval of mexican national banking and securities commission we propose to our shareholders a stock split and the issuance of series b shares to be listed together with series l shares in the form of units to allow our company to increase its capacity to issue new equity which maybe used as consideration in future share based acquisitions as well as for general corporate purposes we will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and we re confident that the listing of series l shares and series b shares in the form of units will help unlock value for shareholders and position coca cola femsa for new growth opportunities in the future obtaining the commission s authorization we will announce the record date and exchange date for all holders of series l shares and the conversion date for our holders of adss we expect that the announcement will happen during the first quarter of 2019 and with that i ll hand the call back over to john for his final remarks thank you very much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you technical difficulty our leadership talent starting this year we are pleased to report the following organizational changes fabricio ponce former chief operating officer in the philippines is our new chief operating officer for our mexico operation prior to his assignment in the

capabilities to remain as a beer market developer in the coca cola system operator i would like to open the call to questions thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions and we ll first hear from fernando olvera of bank of america merrill lynch fernando olvera bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for the call i have a couple of questions which are related to brazil i mean regarding volume you registered a really very solid volume growth this quarter and i think the strongest quarterly growth of the year so can you elaborate more on what was behind such growth and how does your market share behave during the quarter also how should we think about consumption this year and what is your outlook on volume grow this year that s all thanks constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you fernando this is constantino well yeah certainly brazil had another positive quarter we continue to be very encouraged by the positive performance we have in brazil it s the fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth as you mentioned volume growth increased 4 5 overall weather helped significantly especially during december in addition to that as i mentioned we have a very successful implementation of affordability initiatives additions to the portfolio as i said during the year we did around 100 launches in brazil across all categories and honestly there is a huge focus on execution at the point of sale by the team and also we have been driven by some digital initiatives across our omni channel strategy our market share remained steady we re gaining some traction in market share both in csds especially in colas but also in juices and nectars and water as well as isotonic and energy drinks overall we re seeing a very very positive beginning of the year the outlook in terms of macroeconomics and consumer optimism in brazil is starting to pick up again so we hope we continue with this trend and momentum in brazil thank you fernando olvera bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks operator next we ll hear from benjamin theurer of barclays benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst yeah good morning everyone and thank you very much for taking my question so two questions actually one on the outlook in mexico what do you expect how do you feel about the consumer environment demand scenario and obviously the fact that you had obviously a little bit of cost pressure from the concentrate what s your pricing strategy looking into 2019 on the mexican market that would be my first question hector trevino former chief financial officer yeah thank you it s constantino again well overall we re seeing positive trend as we start 2019 we have done very been very effective in price management above inflation i mean we re leveraging we re significantly leveraging our analytics platform for the last couple of years which as time goes by becomes more robust and more accurate and allows us to be much more effective not only on pricing and developing a pricing architecture but at the same time on being more efficient in the allocation of discounts and promotions across our different channels so that has been and will continue to be a driver for our performance in mexico next year coupled with significant improvements in our execution at the point of sale on top of that we re seeing a resilient consumer it s gradually recovering confidence january we saw positive volumes the start of the year which is good taking us in the right path although we had some weakness at the end of 2018 but january was pretty positive and at the same time weather has been favorable for us throughout the beginning of the year our portfolio affordability is increasing we are working very hard behind our returnable portfolio and our ncb portfolio also continues to gain traction on the profitability side as you mentioned we re seeing more stable raw materials environments sugar and pet prices significantly which were hard last year coupled with a significant amount of productivity initiatives to protect our bottom line in mexico so i think that probably provides you a little bit of an outlook of what we are seeing for the mexican market john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hi this is john i just think complementing on that just complementing on that i think what we re seeing also is the fact that we will have increased government spending so the short term consumption pattern for mexico on a consumer business specifically in our territories is going to be very favorable constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay and with that do you expect also transactions to somehow pickup because that has been somewhat weakish especially in the fourth quarter but if we take a look transactions throughout the year were slightly negative 2018 versus 2017 so i assume you re expecting a little bit of a recovery there as well because what we re basically seeing was no volume growth throughout the year with some minor transaction and everything came from price so the question is that transaction with less volume what can drive top line growth in 2019 john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer right good question i think one of the things that we we re going to start focusing on more much more heavily this year in mexico is single serve single serve in an affordable way and single serve returnables i think we have a good lesson from the philippines that we can bring into mexico where we can go into having very affordable entry price points ok in a very significant manner in many markets in mexico that requires it so between what we re doing in revenue growth management on multi serve along with the focus on retaking single serve i do think we ll have enhanced transaction growth and revenue growth behind our mexican operation benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay perfect and then just one last question this is really just more of an accounting one on the filing you ve submitted that the mexican stock exchange you basically reported at mxn51 8 billion in revenues to press release throughout the whole report states mxn50 2 billion what s the difference of that 3 because it literally runs throughout the whole income statement just your quick clarification so which number should we actually use constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer benjamin we had a problem with the platform benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst hello operator and just a moment technical difficulty and you may proceed constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer benjamin i don t know benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst yes constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer what you ve heard until we got cut off but again just to reiterate we have benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst inaudible last one and then it got cut off that was the last word plus constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes we had as we were loading the data to the mexican stock exchange platform last night we had very a lot of difficulties putting that data onto the platform and the correct data to focus on is the press release data benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer we ll be correcting the data on the mexican stock exchange during the course of the morning benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc analyst okay perfect that was all thank you very much and i ll pass it on thanks constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from lucas ferreira of jpmorgan lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst hi first of all i d like to say actually see for hector too have a good look in his this new position actually new phase of his life and my first question is actually on the colombia if you guys can comment on the outlook for volumes how this first month has been and especially considering this change in the vat charge if this if volumes have been coming above expectations and what are the sort of impact that we should expect for volumes in the first quarter and for 2019 and my second question is regarding cost so if you guys can comment on the cost trends for the year if you already foresee some improvements in pet in the first half of the year and also the other main cost lines if we should expect already a better year in terms of front costs per hectoliter sold and if we should see some improvements in margins on the back of that thank you very much operator next question from alan alanis of ubs alan alanis ubs analyst i ll be very happy to ask my question but i don t know if they are on the line john are you on the line operator just a moment alan alanis ubs analyst thank you so much i think they have to reply to lucas question first questions first and then we ll go afterwards operator please hold the line while i reconnect our presenters yes one moment please technical difficulty john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hello operator you may proceed john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer okay thank you hello lucas hello lucas next question operator and we re on alan alan alanis ubs analyst yes i will i mean i ll ask my question but i guess we can circle back afterwards to lucas sorry operator yeah we ll go back we can go back to lucas alan alanis ubs analyst sure i m just trying to be a gentleman here well first of all hector congratulations i mean as a former boss mentor i mean you ve always been a great example and i certainly wish you the best at this new stage you will be missed john constatino my first question has to do with the criteria for transactions in m a post the approval of this split how does it how does it change the criteria if you could just update us on your thinking now that you will be able to issue more shares for m a and that would be the first question and then i have a follow up more regarding what i can you can put it on the table right away it has to do with the role of beer in your portfolio in brazil if our numbers are correct we saw very strong revenue growth for the beer category in your results in the fourth quarter i think that given that heineken said that there was that they reported low mid single digit in the fourth quarter it indicates that you had a lot of pricing in beer in brazil and i just want to see if you can confirm that and what is the overall role of beer in brazil and if you can give us any update in terms of the arbitration that is going on with heineken that will be highly appreciated those will be my two questions john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer well let me tackle the last question first first of all as you know we re in the middle of a i know everybody wants to know about beer in brazil but as you as you re aware we re in the middle of an arbitration process so there is very little we can say about it until the arbitration process finalizes which we expect it to happen between the first half of the year or maybe the beginning of the third quarter so just for those purposes i m not going to comment around our perspective on beer going forward in brazil and i hope you understand that that particular alan alanis ubs analyst i do constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer and in terms of performance you re right the beer category is going to in very positive momentum for us in our region or in the area of influence where operates in brazil i guess heineken has reported some of those numbers and i would rather have the guidance from the heineken relief and conversation that occurred a couple of years ago a couple of months weeks ago sorry but overall we re seeing strong growth the brands heineken and brand amstel have very good momentum and this particular element is something that we re seeing consistently happening in the market for a while and we foresee it happening so the premium segment of the beer category should continue strengthening from our perspective in the brazilian market so that s all i d like to comment around beer and i think the heineken release has a significant information that can provide you guidance in that regard on the m a piece and the stock split as you know the changes that we announced just aim to give us flexibility on our capital structure by increasing our capacity to issue equity that maybe used in as a consideration in future share based on mergers arrival acquisitions however there is no project or initiative or target in mind that drove that decision it has been something in the making for a while actually i have hector on my side who has been the architect of this particular initiative and i ll ask him if he wants to comment beyond that but there is no change in our focus on m a as you know we have been historically known by being very disciplined on our capital allocation and we ll do the investments that are right for our company and our shareholders at the proper value and at the proper time and the mechanism that we put behind those transactions is defined at the moment we see that the target and the initiative unfolding i don t know hector wants to comment something on the stock split to give you a little bit more guidance alan alanis ubs analyst thank you hector trevino former chief financial officer good morning as constantino mentioned this has been in the making for many years actually since the vonpar acquisition we started to define this need and if you remember we had this convertible that was issued with respect to that acquisition and that requires this structure to be in place it took a lot of time because we were looking for and in conversation with the authorities so that we can have a single unit trading as opposed to having series b and series l with a split trading that in our opinion will create some liquidity and issue pricing problem for us so we finally got the authorization at the end of last year we were caught with the christmas break and the change in the government and finally we got final approval in january but as constantino said it s basically talking of what we ll develop and plan for quite basically for 3 2 5 years the series b shares would now have some volume rise which i think that is very good for our for our shareholders and investors in this inaudible john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer alan this is john i think as you go through these three acquisitions of coca cola femsa sometimes you use the large component of debt and sometimes you use the a large component of equity but always trying to maintain our ratios within region and some and what we have here is incremental flexibility ok to make sure that as we see opportunities when they come up and sometimes are not necessarily projectable that we have the financial strength and flexibility to do something that is reasonable and conservative for our shareholders assuming that we did whatever transaction we have going forward is accretive and i think this allows us a broader spectrum to go out there and feel comfortable that we re in a great financial position and also in great capital position to continue down the path of doing further transactions alan alanis ubs analyst got it that s very useful thank you so much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you alan constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer thank you alan operator and lucas your line is reopen you may pose your question again at this time lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst i think you i m not sure if you issue listen to the questions but the first one was related to the elasticity in colombia if this is coming better than expected what sort of impact you guys are expecting the volumes for the first quarter and full year if you can comment at least versus your expectations initial expectations and the second question was regarding the costs wanted to know and what part of the the curve we are in terms of pressures especially from pet which i think should be to remain the one of the lines pressuring your costs so can we expect already better cost base in the quarters to come and what about the full year 2019 thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer lucas how are you regarding colombia obviously the elimination of the tax benefit that we had in and our plant is a very very large impact for us and to change our short term strategy of want to going out there and restructuring our colombian operation in a lot of different fronts the first one was pricing which we took up immediately in january we took up over 6 pricing secondly we had a resize beginning to resize our operation we ve taken out 200 people in colombia basically staff people to resize that operation thirdly we re looking at redeveloping our route to market plus our supply chain distribution network because all of our benefits were stuck in the inaudible plant and we re looking to we reallocate those to the different plants that we have so i think the first four to five six months in colombia are going to be very focused on restructuring to make sure that we re facing the environment in the correct manner in sizing our company to that manner what we think about elasticity is we ve taken up the prices and we re better than what we thought so we have at the 6 rate we re not looking we re not seeing the same type of elasticity as we had before in the vat was taken across the whole country couple of years ago so we re much better off than what we thought and we re encouraged by what we re seeing in terms of savings and obviously it s a very challenging year for colombia but i think we re on the right track with the right portfolio and with the right management as well constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer now lucas and around and to your other questions regarding raw materials pet and sugar we are seeing a better curve going forward in 2019 compared to 2018 so overall our outlook in that particular element inline in our p l should be more favorable this year than in the previous year lucas ferreira jpmorgan analyst thank you very much operator and next we ll hear from antonio gonzalez of credit suisse antonio gonzalez credit suisse analyst hi good morning everyone thank you for taking my question first similarly thank you for everything hector and congrats on a truly remarkable career and constantino best of luck on this new role i have two questions the first one on dividend you mentioned in today s press release that the board has proposed the dividend of mxn3 54 per share which is 5 7 growth versus last year and obviously there has been a debate recently up there you exited from the philippines on whether you could substantially increase the payout on the other hand obviously flexibility on the macro side in mexico i guess has diminished significantly so i just wanted to pick your brains as to what is the latest thinking with respect to the payout policy do you think we will remain at similar levels for the next couple of years or do you actually see a room for a substantial increase and if so in which time frame and then secondly i just wanted to ask very quickly what triggers is there any specific events that triggered their write off in panama and is there any long term learning here that would extrapolate your diary ventures elsewhere or is it more of a specific situation thank you so much john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you thank you antonio let me address the dividend issue first we are taking back our dividend policy to about for the 2019 year in payout to the to about 20 21 those was historically we would have increased dividends further but we wanted to but we want to make sure that we have the cash on hand to pay off a 500 million yankee bond that comes due in february ok of 2020 okay so we didn t see any economic benefit of going out there and borrowing to report to go out there and do a such a short term transaction to bring down the yankee so we wanted to keep that cash on hand so going forward once we re over that hump we do have a possibility of increasing the dividend policy going forward for coca cola femsa and that would be our objective however we also would be very constrained we re very concerned with how market conditions continue to evolve and what we want to make sure that we have enough financial flexibility and strength on our balance sheet to be able to ensure that whatever future dividends that we re going to go out there and increase are sustainable secondly in terms of the write off of the panama operation the panama operation is the first real foray into value added dairy that we had and i think what we ve had is a lot of delays on the plant the law in terms of up bring up the plant into a and respect this was neither a remake nor a greenfield or around we have a what we saw a brownfield that we re just making the plant within a new plant within the existing plant so that if you have ever remodeled your home is a very difficult situation so we ve encountered delays and we are also learning a heck of a lot more about how to manage dairies because this is really the first time when we ve gone into cold and value added dairies with yogurts ok ice creams so it s been a very large learning process that we don t have anywhere else ok in mexico we are basically all uht or even in brazil where it is chilled but it is on a separate basis so i think it s a very specific thing to panama that you really cannot go out there and project any place to us now that being said we just came back from panama couple of days ago and i m very encouraged to see exactly how the project is coming along the momentum is gaining and how the our production platform is coming on stream nicely antonio gonzalez credit suisse analyst gracias john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer you re welcome operator and before we take our next caller i would like to remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question allowing others a chance to ask a question next we will hear from carlos laboy of hsbc carlos laboy hsbc analyst hector congratulations and thank you for 25 years of forthright honesty and straight shooting which has been i think very helpful for everybody john the catalog of achievements that you listed at the start of the call we all get it it s what makes you maybe the most valuable bottler coke s ever had anywhere in the world almost 25 years for driving next frontier execution but it all makes for a really great eulogy if you can exceed your cost of capital on a sustained basis when you look at the pressures you re facing in brazil and you look at the pressures that you re facing with non core profitability with the marketing maybe of effectiveness at driving growth for your core brand can you exceed your cost of capital without these things getting fixed and the follow up to that then is you said that you re going to evaluate geographic and category opportunities but you re also increasing the dividend so are you willing to consider geographic opportunities for asset sales not just for purchases if you re staring at situations where you can t get from your partner what you need for exceeding your cost of capital john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer hello carlos laboy hsbc analyst yes john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer carlos a couple of things yes over the last couple of years we ve had a series of we ve had a series of years where we are not making our cost we are making or slightly under the cost of capital for coca cola femsa and i think that s a true reflection of the market in terms of how we ve gotten the value coca cola femsa we get it s just not been increasing shareholder value now there is a couple of reasons for that and i think there s the valuations there is incremental cost for raw materials and yes importantly there has been also incidence increases that had also been affecting us to the tune over the last three four years of about 154 million that continued to give us headwinds there has been consumer headwinds and there s been tax headwinds as well so i think overall being close to cost to capital has not been bad but it is not what we need ok the issue is how do we go out there and continue to grow cost achieve our cost of capital couple of things first in the general picture we need to go out there and amplify our portfolio well firstly we need to just to get our csd portfolio back on track and i think it was very encouraging to see during 2018 that coca cola brand coca cola grew almost 2 ok in terms of volume and i think we ve put also a lot more revenue into the coca cola system by growing both revenues and volume and transaction fees over the brand coca cola and secondly we need to go out there and fix on our non carb business or make it not fixed i would say let s make it more profitable okay right now where we are it is growing but it s not nearly as profitable as our growth business but it is as i would argue is marginal to the whole process so or to the whole structure so the more we go out there and grow the more margin we do enhance now when we bring down the coca cola the non carb business it is what non carb business you want to talk about because within the non carb business there s a series of large business of businesses that are very profitable energy key low constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer isotonic john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer isotonics and one we have to start i think getting better returns on just basic juices and nectars and there s two ways of doing that one is going out there getting better formulations ok and secondly there is also case is going up and doing a better portfolio by premiumizing it and i think brazil as the last time you were down there you saw how we premiumize the juice the juice portfolio making sure that we re going out there with higher premium category glass products and they re doing very well and there is a lot of margin involved in that so i think from that end we re starting to advance on the portfolio and getting it much more accretive for our coca cola femsa coca cola femsa shareholders secondly i think it s in water in water we have to go out there and figure out exactly what we just did in juices in terms of developing a portfolio of premium brands ok to be able to really develop the brands and to make sure that we have enhanced profitability over what we have today today in most most countries we play with a core brand which is cl in some places crystal in brazil that tries to play gamma across premium value and four mainstream and what we need to do is go out there and develop those brands differently we need we ve just launched smartwater in brazil we ve launched smartwater in argentina in the mississippian basis but those are the type of initiatives we need to continue to develop fully and aggressively to make sure that that portfolio becomes as profitable as carbonated soft drinks and in carbonated soft drinks and i just said this on another question we need to refocus on engaging on transactions on single serves and i think there we can do that by going back into glass and returnables ok in a way that i think our competitors can t ok both in brazil and mexico and elsewhere so i think there is a good story let s say that we re well poised to be able to go out and increase our profitability and our margins to cover our cost of capital and grow at the same time we turn to brazil you re saying whether brazil beer is something that we need to do and we don t need to do obviously we can t comment on the existing arbitration but the world is moving toward more and more integrated platforms and brazil is an example i think there s other countries that are also examples and i think it s more compelling in brazil than any place itself and for us it would be very important for us to be able to have a beer solution in brazil i don t know if that covers all your questions carlos carlos laboy hsbc analyst yes the final question is that you had mentioned that you re going to continue to evaluate geographic and category opportunities but everyone assumes that that means that you re going to consider more asset sales but more asset purchase but what you ve done mostly recently is sales the philippines or do you look at your existing portfolio of territories to sort out well maybe there s something in here that we shouldn t have john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer sure let me be clear about this i mean the thing with the philippines was a very specific transaction structure for the philippines and asia and the way it was set up the deal was set up and that s what we negotiated at the time is that we ll go out there and we are putting the call and we had to go out and exercise the call to be able to further acquire territories and in asia and given what s happened in the philippines with the tax on sugar we couldn t find a way that make whole of the prices that we had in the original transaction and so therefore we instead of going out and modifying the whole transaction but we what we landed up doing was just putting it back to the company that philosophy is not in coke femsa s dna ok we re not going we re not asset sellers ok i don t have it in vision to go out there and sell assets at this point any pesos and later on from in the philippines we just went out there and acquired two franchises in guatemala and one in uruguay that i would say gives you the pace of where we want to go in the future we will continue to look at opportunities both on a category basis and a territory basis carlos ok again just making sure that we re not going out there and destroying shareholder value carlos laboy hsbc analyst thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer well operator next we ll hear from alex robarts of citi alex robarts citigroup analyst yes hi everybody thank you and i did want to start out by saying to hector thank you very much for the financial stewardship through the years and i hope the best in your well deserved retirement two questions from my side one on the operating deleverage in south america and then the second on non carbs i guess we kind of came into the quarter thinking about lower sugar in south america but then higher pet but what seem to kind of really explain or at least impact a lot of the deleverage right you show us comparatively 12 top line in south america growth in the quarter with 2 ebitda growth and that difference seems to kind of go to the what you call the raw material hedge the unfavorable hedge there could you give us some more color as to what specifically was behind that raw material unfavorable hedge was it a particular input was it several and might we expect some relief in this seasonally strong summer here in the first quarter or might that continue to be unfavorable so that s the first question the second one relates to non carbs and interesting trend you talked about it with us in the fall in new york when you came up and now with the full year numbers we can kind of see how those non carb volumes fall then when you look at mexico and brazil it s kind of a tale of two cities flat non carb volume growth in mexico last year and i guess the kind of the impact there is bulk water coming down the question is is that going to continue to be a focus for you or is that something that you want deemphasized and should we continue that for to see that decline the other side is brazil where your mid teen non carb growth a lot of it is stills also waters but it strikes me that it s 20 of the volume of non carbs in mexico and so does m a become something that you would look at this year in non carbs in brazil to kind of perhaps more right size that kind of growing piece of your volume and the final piece on the non carbs last week coca cola company talks about in the conference that new products accounted for about 17 volume growth last year how does how do you think about just generally new products and the impact it can have on your growth this year would it be like coke s number of mid teens thanks very much a lot of kind of sub questions but i appreciate the time john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer and alex let me inaudible try to take the last ones first and then i ll let hector or constantino talk about the hedging question that you asked i think let me talk a little bit about bulk water because bulk water is a good place to start on this conversation we do have a very large bulk water business in mexico ok and that is it s profitable but it s not necessarily as profitable as we d like it to be and we ve been working on maintaining or growing our profitability on primarily the 19 20 liter jug business and there what you ll be seeing and what we re going to be emphasizing is obtaining better margins on that business in light of the sacrificing volume what we d like to do is continue to price up ok and continue to gain better margins and obviously also become much more efficient in our operation that we have and there and i would say the focus of this would probably be more southwest of mexico and then we have at any place else so the 20 liter jug business in mexico is a big deal and the profitability on bulk water 5 liter business is also something you re going to be looking at to make sure that we have the proper returns on that business so that s something we ll focus on in both mexico colombia is also an issue with that in terms of the 5 liter and 6 liter bottle 6 liter bag business and how do we start making our profitability a little bit better on those packs on the non carb business in brazil as you said and i think one of the things to understand is we restructured that whole business in a big way other than 100 skus that we launched the majority of those are non carbs and we re basically going toward two things first is competing first is putting ourselves in a competitive situation in our plants with cold fill products which were coming out of lao ph and now and we re resourcing them out of jundiai ok and that transition from the lao ph plant to the jundiai plant is giving us at least giving us an advantage to compete in low cold fill juices that is really the bottom part of the market and that will allow us at the same token to be able to increase prices ok on the core leader tetra juices and vectors ok which we were sacrificing before just to be able to maintain margins and also the increase in all the glass and hot fill capability is in terms of premium products that we re doing is also leading to better profitability and we should start seeing that continue to grow but profitably sell in brazil over the first six months to seven months of the year so i think where we are and in mexico what we re looking at is better formulations better cost structures and we have enormous opportunity to make these better both in mexico and brazil so i think that the focus is the right one and we re encouraged to see that we will be able to go out and increase our profitability and non carbs ok and bulk water businesses constantino do you want to take a look at the hedges constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer sure if i understand your question what you re asking was the biggest impact in south america regarding the cost for the quarter but i would tell you is that pet was the main driver in across all markets particularly in brazil and argentina we had significant price increases in dollar terms in brazil almost 30 increases in pet costs in brazil part of that was unhedged but if you couple that with devaluation in brazil there was a significant impact for us in that particular operation that considering the size of brazil in our south american region that has a an important impact for us we also had some some labor cost increases in a couple of markets argentina and brazil and that explains most of the impact in cost that we had in the fourth quarter for brazil i don t know if that tackles your question alex robarts citigroup analyst i guess sorry constantino specifically the raw material hedge i mean which you talk about in the press release was there it was the hedged it was the dollar hedged price for certain raw materials correct and that is something that will roll constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes alex robarts citigroup analyst okay and the question is will that roll off is that going to continue into the first quarter the question was sorry on the actual hedge yeah constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes actually we have a very say very disciplined approach toward hedging both on currency and on raw materials i don t know if you re aware of our routine but we have monthly routine with every single operation and probably crm process we redefine and we define bands and coverage levels for our critical raw materials sugar pet aluminum et cetera and we also look at the coverage from our currencies especially in such a volatile environment so yes the question is yes it will continue it s part of cost disciplined approach on the operation management and a way in which the finance function supports on our operations so yes it will continue i reiterate that answer for you operator luca cipiccia of goldman sachs luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for the time and taking my question hector congratulations and best wishes just two follow ups from my side one i think in your introduction remarks you made some reference on the investments you re making on digital capabilities and i was hoping maybe you could qualify a little bit better some of this or little bit more rather some of this initiatives how relevant are they for your operation for your partners and also how are these being rolled out across markets are you starting from mexico and then implementing them across the board or is this i m just trying to get a sense of how relevant are much of a step change how much of the incremental benefit there could be from some of this measure that you made reference to that s the first question and then secondly on the portfolio and on the dairy strategy also in light of your comments on panama do you think the system overall in dairy would could benefit from a more organic strategies across strategy across market or in other words do you think that there would be a rationale for a jugos del valle type of structure or transaction or addition given that the execution and the portfolio itself can appear not entirely consistent across all markets the dairy presence is stronger in certain markets weaker in other and in some there isn t any both of your franchises and other franchise so i don t know if you have any comment on that i d be interested in hearing your views thank you john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer sure on the digital front first thing is that what we ve done in digital it has a lot of components to it and they have a commercial component it has a manufacturing distribution component and it has also an administrative and back office component or saas component let me just take you through what i think is probably the most valuable piece which is the cost commercial component there what we ve put out is a digital platform that starts with the analytics database ok for and let me just use mexico as an example for the detail but it goes out there in has per account we have about 7 000 pieces of information and we have all the detail on 800 000 accounts that we have in mexico and with few analytics and we also have this is not going to do the that model as well as purchase structure consumer purchase structures it gives us the insight as to how to go out there and manage down to the point of sale and making sure that we have the right pricing structure the right packaging structure ok and now we re also getting into the right demand structure but all those analytics connect to our marketing department and the marketing department goes right into the sales department and we have immediate work orders for each one of our point of sale with independent of or would be customized promotions for them and we have the ability to send out these work orders on a weekly basis and the feedback that we re getting obviously is weekly and we understand exactly what we re executing how we re executing and what is working for us and not we have the capability of launching in mexico 5 million consumer customer initiatives on a monthly basis and getting that information back and obviously that s a lot of data and a lot of change management well what has it given us it s given us first place execution in mexico brazil and argentina ok an incremental execution right now in colombia we ve rolled out this platform in our traditional trade throughout all our countries ok the marketing platform the analytics have rolled out in mexico and colombia and they will be rolling out in brazil this year as well ok and we ve postponed argentina given the hyperinflationary situation that we confront over there so that s going to be postponed so we get a more stable economic environment what s it given us besides better execution it s given us better price realization we d be now able to take pricing above inflation ok in these countries and it s also given us a better return on discount and so our roi on promotions have increased in mexico of by 9 points and in colombia by about 5 points so giving us real pricing power and is getting to be more effective now the second implication important to all this is that when we have all this information we re starting to look at it as a forecasting tool and we ve put together an artificial intelligence space so we can go out and predict demand ok from all the points of sale going forward and we are testing this right now in the mexico in one of our warehouses and we re getting up to 5 points of better accuracy on demand prediction and demand sensing which will allow us to become a much more efficient supply chain overall and so all that is done by outlook by the way so as we gain more experience we ll be going through this and opening it up into mexico in a bigger way and then rolling it out through all the country so if you look at the commercial platform we ve rolled it out in terms of the sap handheld and marketing analytics piece i mean the not the marketing analytics piece but the handheld to all our countries in the analytics are following this year now the second big bucket that we have that goes along with this is how do we become much more intertwined and digitized with our supply chain so we ve implemented what we have in mexico on a jda platform which is a logistics platform throughout all of our countries already and it s centralized in mexico and that s been providing us with about 25 million worth of savings ok we ve put also digital distributors we have all our routes in mexico are now on are digitized we know exactly where they are how they can deliver in brazil all of our routes and all of our trades are digitized and we re looking to roll that out into other places as well i think there is an enormous amount of value that we re creating there and obviously we ll continue to be leading forward in terms of the coca cola system the other question you had was on the portfolio strategy on milk or dairy luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst yeah john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer and if there is other acquisitions potential acquisitions out there that could make sense yes we d take a look at it ok and depending on the values that we think we can create for our shareholders we go out there and pursue it i think there are a lot of synergies to be had with those categories but there are also significant differences that you have to understand which we re understanding in panama which is called and also the short shelf life products that are totally different business than what we have in coca cola but they are something that we d be looking at continuously luca cipiccia goldman sachs analyst hector just thank you very much for the answer for the details it s very interesting just on the dairy just to the angle of my question was also across the categories typically you have brands and brands or products that work across geographies there is a little bit of an exception where every country has got its own in a sense so is that something that you see should change could change or does it make sense to do it that way john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer no i don t think it makes a lot of sense to go out there and try to leverage dairy from one country with another unless its uht ok milk is a very regional business and so i don t think necessarily we have a large strategy going forward on that end i do think we have brands like ades that goes out there and plays in that space but on the feed base that is expandable and which we are expanding ok but dairy is more of a local business in the local with local credentials operator and our final question for today will come from alvaro garcia of btg alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst hi thanks for the call most of my questions have been answered maybe you could provide a road map so on the capital allocation front we think of the mxn700 million you received from the philippines perhaps you could provide a road map sort of including the yankee bond up in february next year of how much debt you expect to pay down over the next 12 months to 18 months thank you constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer yes hi this is constantino basically we ve analyzed the proceeds of that transaction that we did it in the philippines and very straightforward our intent is to use the the cash that we received to take our debt continue our deleveraging path and most importantly i think that in february of next year 2020 we have a yankee bond that is due and we ll be using the proceeds of that transaction to continue lowering our net debt ratio which is quite healthy right now at 1 6 so that gives us a very flexible profile balance sheet going forward so the answer is yes we ll use the proceeds to continue deleveraging and pay our debt alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst apart from that is it fair to assume that this year maybe we ll see a 200 million in some pay down of debt just sort to get to that 700 million or is that yankee bond really the only thing you have on your target hector trevino former chief financial officer we already used part of the proceed to repay some of the bilateral loans that we have john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer correct hector trevino former chief financial officer that were related to the uruguay and guatemala acquisition so that s basically that with that being the 200 million plus it was 500 million inaudible 240 million ph multiple speakers that we have in february 2020 that will basically cover 700 million and as john and constantino were explaining the board of directors that we have yesterday this decision was that to hold to give 500 million and wait given the good coupon that we have on bad inaudible versus the seniority of it impacting that both the sources on the secure manner the negative carries basically zero and the decision was to keep this tight on the 1 million on cash given the volatility we were seeing in the markets and just wait for 2020 and do that so we pay it alvaro garcia banco btg pactual analyst perfect that s very very clear all the best hector all the best going forward constantino spas chief financial and administrative officer hope you guys treat me as well as you treat hector hector trevino former chief financial officer inaudible operator and that does conclude the question and answer session i ll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments john anthony santa maria otazua chief executive officer thank you all for being here today and i d just like to take the opportunity again the bank hector for such a remarkable career and being such a great collaborator friend and leader of the coca cola femsa and now only the coca cola femsa company but also a coca cola company and also just a great trend and i trust him and maria they re going to have a lot of good times going forward but will always be counting on his advice and closeness as we go forward and to you all on the line thank you for your confidence and interest in coca cola femsa if there are interesting times but i m sure that will be coming out very positively during this very challenging 2019 and our team is always available to answer questions you might inaudible on our team and hope to talk to you very soon thank you very much for being with us today operator that does conclude today s conference thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect duration 88 minutes call participants john anthony santa maria otazua chief

washington as democrats swing left it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for america the presidential candidates endorse a variety of far reaching proposals that if adopted would represent the largest expansion of government since lyndon johnson s great society the added spending taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions are these sound economic policies or partisan pipedreams let s review the main proposals for context remember the following the u s economy gross domestic product is about 20 trillion so a federal program costing 200 billion would be 1 percent of gdp it would also be about 5 percent of the 4 trillion federal budget here s the rundown guaranteed job program several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn t find one economists at bard college estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at 15 an hour health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent the initial cost would be around 300 billion annually medicare for all bernie sanders proposed this and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage its cost is unclear in 2017 there were an estimated 27 million uninsured says a report from politifact of the poynter institute sanders thinks replacing private insurance with medicare could cut expenses other experts disagree there would be pressures to sweeten benefits in a recent new york times column economist paul krugman wrote that we d need a lot more revenue to implement for medicare for all advertisement the green new deal rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and sen edward j markey d mass propose putting the country on a war footing to purge u s greenhouse gas emissions over a decade the costs aren t known because the new deal manifesto contains no concrete proposals however it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize clean energy and suppress fossil fuels everything else there are smaller proposals that in other years would seem large sen elizabeth warren d mass backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of 70 billion sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students that s perhaps another 50 billion then there s infrastructure spending more billions and a proposal to raise social security benefits counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit 779 billion in 2018 the actual amount could be more or less no one really knows how would democrats pay for this some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy krugman doubts these would suffice adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in payroll taxes and or a value added tax that hit the middle class he writes of course there is another choice more deficit spending last week i tried to educate myself on so called modern monetary theory embraced by some democrats its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we ve been led to believe here s the case for that view as best i can determine the biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household that has to repay its debt says stephanie kelton an economist at stony brook university and an adviser in 2016 to sanders advertisement the united states won t default on its governmental debts because it can always create more dollars through the federal reserve to honor u s treasury bonds and bills she says she rejects the argument that the fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money to prevent that inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates just as occurs today the obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment she

loans use of non gaap financial measures to supplement the company s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap which are filed with the securities and exchange commission sec as part of the company s annual report on form 10 k and interim reports on form 10 q management analyzes the operating performance of the company on the basis of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is the measure used by the company s management team to assess the operating performance of the company s businesses adjusted ebitda is also presented on a consolidated basis because management believes it helps our investors evaluate the company s profitability on a basis consistent with that of its operating segments adjusted ebitda is also a financial performance measure commonly used in the hotel and leisure industry although the company s ebitda may not be comparable in all instances to that disclosed by other companies adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to earnings from operations or net earnings under u s gaap for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance as presented in the company s consolidated financial statements filed with the sec adjusted ebitda when presented on a consolidated basis including the items set forth in the company s reconciliations tables and adjusted net earnings losses of the company are non gaap financial measures and do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by u s gaap adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors about the company because it is not affected by non operating factors such as leverage affecting interest expense tax positions affecting income tax expense the historical cost of assets affecting depreciation expense and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable affecting amortization expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings losses are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies which may be calculated differently and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other measure of performance prescribed by u s gaap management considers adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings losses to be meaningful indicators of operations and uses them as measures to assess operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings losses are also used by investors analysts and lenders as measures of financial performance because as adjusted in the described manner the measures provide a consistent basis on which the performance of the company can be assessed from period to period however these measures are not intended to substitute for u s gaap measures of company performance as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements filed with the sec ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings losses have limitations as analytical tools some of these limitations are they do not reflect the company s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs they do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company s debt although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and they are not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in the company s statements of cash flows cautionary statements this news release and related oral presentations by management contain in addition to

an economic postcard from malaysia not so long ago malaysia was set to lose years of economic progress today following the re imposition of economic discipline the country is almost back on track a new era dawned in malaysia in may 2018 when the opposition coalition led by dr mahathir mohamad and anwar ibrahim secured a simple majority in a historical election when mahathir will return to retirement opposition leader anwar is expected to replace him in about two years in the 2018 election their coalition pakatan harapan ph won 113 seats against the ruling coalition united malays national organization umno and its allies that had not lost an election since 1957 last year malaysia s economy grew 4 7 year on year despite fiscal consolidation and challenging international conditions the country is set to sustain its growth path in 2019 it is an extraordinary achievement after years of political turmoil the najib regression as the sixth prime minister of malaysia najib razak ruled the country from 2009 to 2018 his early tenure was marked by economic liberalization measures including cuts to government subsidies loosening of foreign investment restrictions and reductions in preferential measures for ethnic malays in business after the 2013 election the neoliberal economic policies gave way to greater efforts at political consolidation including the pursuit of critics on sedition charges the imprisonment of opposition leader anwar ibrahim the implementation of a consumption tax gst and the embarrassing scandal involving state investment firm 1malaysia development berhad 1mdb that s when malaysia lost its economic discipline the changing fortunes can be illustrated by the fluctuations of malaysian ringgit between 2009 and 2013 us dollar was still about 3 3 60 myr as economic prospects weakened so did the ringgit between 2013 and 2018 us dollar amounted to 4 40 myr figure figure malaysian ringgit 2009 2019 eventually the massive 1mdb corruption debacle led to rallies calling for najib s resignation spearheaded by the grassroots movement bersih following his release in 2004 anwar ibrahim became the leading figure in the opposition and helped coalesce the opposition parties into the pakatan rakyat which contested the 2008 and 2013 general elections these protests culminated in the malaysian citizens declaration by mahathir the rise of pakatan harapan and ngos to oust najib the 2018 election triumph paved the way to mahathir to become the world s oldest elected leader at 93 he said his coalition would not seek revenge but would restore the rule of law recently anwar ibrahim seconded those views he said malaysia will not compromise in its talks with goldman sachs over the 1mdb corruption scandal and the bank must bear responsibility the nation has a responsibility to uncover any crimes the investment bank may have committed fiscal consolidation between 1974 and 2004 mahathir s malaysia experienced a period of rapid modernization and economic growth as his government initiated a series of bold infrastructure projects during his reign malaysia was transformed into an asean tiger politically mahathir was dominant winning five consecutive general elections and fending off a series of rivals for the leadership of umno the final test came with the aftermath of the asian financial crisis in 1998 while much of asia succumbed to imf imposed austerity malaysia did not instead mahathir pursued a heterodox model of economic policies including currency and capital controls while deterring george soros s speculative efforts to derail the economy in the west mahathir was demonized as an authoritarian dictator who was intent on undermining his own economy in reality his mix of policies ultimately helped malaysia endure a shallower gdp loss than crisis afflicted indonesia south korea and thailand now mahathir s objective is fiscal consolidation to surpass the policy mistakes of the najib years while stabilizing a more robust growth path it is a challenging task that must be implemented amid america s new protectionism and u s tariff wars moreover mahathir has had to suspend several multibillion dollar projects including china backed initiatives in a bid to target malaysia s estimated 250 billion national debt and other liabilities early signs are promising in 2019 economic growth is likely to be around 4 5 in 2020 4 2 private consumption is the key contributor as consumers have loosened their purse strings amid an improving labor market and lower consumption tax however investment growth is lingering as several high profile projects have been put on the back burner following the new government s fiscal rationalization preparing for 2020 contingencies as the new government s first budget suggests the focus is on institutional reforms improving the standards of living particularly for the lower income groups as well as encouraging entrepreneurship the fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 3 0 of gdp by 2020 and to 2 0 in the medium term it is a typical mahathir mix people first good governance self sufficiency but openness to international trade and investment yet there are two key risks to the fiscal target forecast on the one hand growth could be less than anticipated thanks to the challenging external environment on the other hand revenue flows could prove more volatile than expected given the higher dependence on oil related revenues which account for almost a third of total while the government s expansionary efforts are limited by the ongoing fiscal consolidation malaysia can still rely on more accommodative monetary policy in 2019 monetary policy is expected to be stable as international headwinds are likely to escalate in 2020 the central bank could opt for a more dovish stance until recently neoliberal policies have often been portrayed as natural for post industrializing asia in reality such policies tend to boost oligarchs and shun the rule of law led by dr mahathir mohamad and anwar ibrahim malaysia s political reset shows that neoliberal trajectory and corruption are not an inevitable destiny malaysians deserve a

via mises we can t take it anymore proclaims the economist and media sensation javier milei from his twitter account he is not alone it all started a few weeks ago with a twittazo inviting people to protest against the high taxes and the huge public spending the hashtag bajenlosimpuestos lower taxes quickly became a trending topic on march 21 what began as a virtual protest is moving to the real world organized by prestigious economists foundations and think tanks members of the press student organizations and taxpayers groups the first argentine anti tax protest will have its epicenter in buenos aires at the gates of the parliament however there are groups all across the country working to organize similar events in cities like rosario córdoba corrientes and many others when he campaigned for office in 2015 president mauricio macri seemed aware of the heavy tax burden of the country however most of his promises about reducing taxes have never come true the only concrete step taken by his administration the progressive elimination of the export taxes on agricultural products was put on hold due to budgetary constraints moreover mr macri has not only failed to reduce public spending but he has also created some taxes of his own the most pathetic example is a tax on financial investments in late 2017 which many signal as one of the major reasons for the financial crisis of 2018 which hit macri s administration to the point of having to negotiate a rescue package with the international monetary fund imf to avoid a default of argentina s sovereign debt argentina s fiscal situation is appalling the paying taxes 2018 a report issued by the world bank and pwc showed a horrific scenario the taxpayers face up to one hundred taxes and in the item of total tax and contribution rate the percentage is an impossible 106 in the same category latin america as a whole scores a 52 6 per cent europe 39 6 per cent and north america 38 9 per cent argentina posses another shameful record it is the country with more fiscal auditing and tax raids than any other place in the world what is more according to the report argentina is the country with the most taxes in the world and the fifth regarding tax evasion needless to say when fiscal pressure is of 106 per cent there are no other ways to survive at least we can t get worse than this one may think but as it turns out it can a recent report issued by the non partisan local think tank iaraf their tax vademecum claims that individuals and companies may face the grotesque figure of 163 different taxes 40 of them are raised by the national government 40 by the different provincial authorities and a staggering 82 by the municipal administrations it seems there is no lack of fiscal creativity particularly on the city level we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as a consequence of this über feudal tax policy per every 10 pesos an argentinian spends between 3 to 8 can end up in the pockets of the government perhaps a very telling example are purchases of new cars when someone buys a new car at the dealership he or she will pay 54 8 percent of the car s value in taxes that is it is literally more taxes than the car itself a similar ratio can be observed in textile products fundación atlas 1853 s director martín simonetta once said about this situation since i am poor i have to buy all my clothing in miami for a long time argentina was under what i called unproductive economic freedom the tax policies were completely out of hand but the state was too big and too clumsy to collect its dues the result was a situation in which a sort of economic freedom came into being from the informality that allowed for survival but not for real economic growth this is because the market economy seems to thrive in environments where people pay their taxes because they can afford to pay their taxes governments and states are a reality as long as they exist taxes will be something we have to deal with therefore it is key that they are low and simple the alternative is regime uncertainty and illegality this scenario has been proven again and again incompatible with sustainable economic growth however the weaponization of the income tax carried out by néstor and cristina kirchner in the early 2000s has put many individuals under the reach of the tax collectors thus a worker who earns 38 301 pesos a meager 994 us dollars at the current exchange pays 9 per cent of it as income tax incidentally the income tax is progressive and the highest rate is 35 per cent on top of this according to tax experts argentinians have to work 60 per cent of the year for the state nonetheless the head of national revenue agency afip mr leandro cucclioli recently expressed that there is no end in sight for this tax torture we need more people to pay what they have to pay the more we formalize the economy the better for everyone said the taxman in chief it seems that not everybody agrees with him though and the events of march 21 may very well shake the foundations of an extractive political class which has been testing the levels of toleration of the society for too long originally published by the austrian economics center
the british pound rallied tuesday as the odds of a hard no deal brexit receded while us stocks edged lower following dovish commentary from federal reserve chair jerome powell british prime minister theresa may promised to allow parliament to delay brexit by up to three months if her own divorce proposals fail to win the support of lawmakers by march 12 the dramatic reversal in may s steadfast strategy came after threats of mass resignations from her own ministers and calls for a second referendum on britain s eu membership from the main opposition labor party but the change in course angered brexit hardliners in may s own conservative party influential mp jacob rees mogg warned that any delay to brexit is a plot to stop brexit the pound gained 1 2 percent against the dollar and also advanced against the euro as investors bet the country would avoid a hard brexit that economists fear could crash the economy sterling was home to all the action as the uk currency soared to four month highs said a note from western union business solutions analyst joe manimbo while britain s road out of the eu remains winding and uncertain the pound shot higher as fears of a no deal exit abated but the strength of sterling weighed on london equities which finished lower on a day when both paris and frankfurt advanced earlier asian markets retreated amid doubts over whether beijing and washington can resolve their bitter trade war us stocks finished a choppy session slightly lower after powell reiterated a cautious approach to further interest rate hikes dovish fed powell avoided any major surprises in his first of two days of congressional testimony telling the senate banking committee that inflation would fall further below the fed s two percent target in spite of solid growth and job gains and that the central bank would be patient before adjusting interest rates the market heard what it wanted to hear said nate thooft a senior portfolio manager at manulife asset management he remains dovish and data dependent consumer confidence rebounded strongly in february as shoppers put the wall street rout and extended government shutdown of recent months behind them according a conference board survey after a nearly 20 percent jump in us stocks since late december some analysts think the market will find it hard to rise much further absent a positive catalyst such as a final trade deal between the us and china negotiators from beijing and washington have reported progress on the talks and the next round of tariffs has been delayed but there is still no final deal key figures around 2200 gmt new york dow down 0 1 percent at 26 057 98 close new york s p 500 down 0 1 percent at 2 793 90 close new york nasdaq down 0 1 percent at 7 549 30 close london ftse 100 down 0 5 percent at 7 151 12 close frankfurt dax 30 up 0 3 percent at 11 540 79 close paris cac 40 up 0 1 percent at 5 238 72 close euro stoxx 50 up 0 3 percent at 3 289 32 close tokyo nikkei 225 down 0 4 percent at 21 449 39 close shanghai composite down 0 7 percent at 2 941 52 close hong kong hang seng down 0 7 percent at 28 772 06 close pound dollar up at 1 3254 from 1 3097 at 2200 gmt euro pound down at 85 93 pence from 86 72 pence euro dollar up at 1 1389 from 1 1358 dollar yen down at 110 58 yen from 111 06 yen oil brent crude up 45 cents at 65 21 per barrel oil west texas intermediate up 2 cents at 55 50 per barrel burs jmb dg

economists are in the midst of one of the periodic debate flare ups over modern monetary theory on the pro mmt side we have economists like stephanie kelton and randall wray while on the other we have the odd bedfellows of the new york times paul krugman and the people s policy project s matt bruenig this intricate debate is about the main merits of mmt an economic school of thought which has received wide attention for its dismissal of the need for taxes to pay for new spending however there is an important question which has to this point not been raised the mmt advocates say that inflation should be controlled through fiscal policy instead of monetary policy conducted by the central bank as is current practice in other words if prices start rising we can keep them in line by raising taxes but does that actually work subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives subscribe save sign up for the week s

newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up first a quick bit of background as economists arjun jayadev and j w mason write at bottom mmt isn t all that different from traditional lefty keynesianism when it comes to macroeconomic management during times of recession and economic slack a state borrowing in its own currency has unlimited capacity to spend because printing money or borrowing backed if necessary by the central bank printing and buying government debt to spend on public works and so on will not cause inflation so long as there are unemployed workers and idle capital stock that is factories and such that s how to solve recessions either as a keynesian or an mmter but if there is full employment both sides agree taxes are needed for new programs to fund them for the former or to stave off inflation for the latter now it should be noted that mmt s style of argumentation seems to have dented the brainless pro austerity mindset that dominates much of elite discourse which is very much to its credit however that doesn t bear on the theoretical issues at hand with that covered on to taxes and inflation one important perspective is that of institutionalist economist john kenneth galbraith who argued that taxes alone were insufficient for controlling inflation based on his personal experience as the head of the u s office of price administration an agency that regulated american prices from 1941 47 in the second world war by 1941 42 war spending had stoked the american economy red hot yet the roosevelt administration badly wanted to avoid the unpopular high inflation of the first world war which was unfair and may have even damaged the war economy high taxes were imposed but so were strict rationing and price controls so the absolute maximum of war materiel could be wrung out of the economy in an egalitarian and efficient manner galbraith explained his wartime experience which convinced him to drop his previous contrary conviction in an episode of his documentary series the age of uncertainty long before all workers had jobs firms could raise prices and they did and wages could and did rise this led in turn to the price wage or the wage price spiral we also learned that taxes could not be made to keep pace with wartime spending and that the excess of purchasing power could not as keynes had proposed be mopped up one firm s prices were another firm s costs and you could not hold one man s prices if his costs went up so some general action was imperative the great lesson of the war was here the keynesian remedy was asymmetrical it would work against unemployment and depression it did not work in reverse against inflation after some experimenting galbraith s office of price administration worked extremely well production exploded from 1939 to 1943 by 131 percent but price increases were held to a modest rise of 21 percent this was practically the inverse of world war i when production rose only 25 percent but prices accelerated by 77 percent galbraith later developed his price views in his book a theory of price control his basic argument was that with large firms and high unionization big swathes of the economy had partly escaped from market competition the way tax side inflation control is supposed to work is through supply and demand since taxation will leave buyers with less money in their pockets to spend market competition will force suppliers to cut prices and workers to accept lower wages but if markets have become dominated by a few big firms then business can resist this pressure because buyers have nowhere else to go and if labor markets have been heavily unionized not the case now but it was from the 1930s 70s then big unions will be able to resist wage cuts as well on the other hand big firms and big unions are much more amenable to government price regulations in a market with thousands of sellers and buyers it is nearly impossible for the regulator to keep an eye on everything a family farmer selling eggs to a willing individual at an illegally high price will almost certainly get away with it but big companies and big unions are much easier to monitor because of their centralized structure effectively administering the price regulation themselves across a big chunk of the economy now galbraith would not argue that taxes can never cut inflation after all during the great depression prices fell steadily but instead that it would require a lot of unemployment and take a long time a good test of this prediction came in the late 1970s when inflation was at its postwar peak galbraith argued for a return to price controls but conservative monetarists like milton friedman argued that the problem could be solved by resetting expectations a credible signal from the central bank in the form of a steep hike in interest rates and inflation would come down quickly and easily the fed tried friedman s policy but it turned out galbraith was right the fed hiked interest rates to an eyewatering 20 percent creating the worst recession since the great depression up to that time but inflation only came down very slowly partly through keynesian style spending effects but partly by badly damaging the labor movement which cut unionization in effect inflation control came at the expense of full employment and organized labor more broadly there are also institutional factors to consider one reason inflation control is delegated to the central bank is that it can work quickly adjusting interest rates in response to economic conditions several times per year congress works extremely slowly at the best of times and control is usually split between the two parties the fed may have performed poorly over the last decade but do we really want mitch mcconnell having to sign off on inflation policy of course today things are very different than they were in the 1970s we no longer have big unions in most of the economy and with the persistent economic weakness of the great recession which still has not been totally fixed either in the u s or in europe inflation seems like a distant concern on the contrary the major inflation problem since 2008 has been that it is too low on the other hand markets have become much more monopolized than they were in the 1970s and if democrats take power in 2020 and push through a stimulative green new deal and lots of pro union policy it s not out of the question that inflation control again will again be a live policy concern soon it s worth straightening out how that should happen before prices start coming up

2019 and beyond we executed on that plan through the work of our talented team as we focused on investing better our goals were largely accomplished through the selling of 220 million of older less strategically valuable properties throughout the year those proceeds were reinvested in the four highest quality properties in the country occupied by high quality health system clients in existing relationships no property better represents this focus on quality than the north side medical midtown medical office building located in the midtown neighborhood of atlanta this 165 000 square foot facility is fully leased through and occupied by northside physicians outpatient services and affiliated medical professionals this property was nationally recognized by healthcare real estate

mentality we ended the year with a high quality portfolio of medical office facilities as of december 31 2018 approximately 96 of our 13 6 million square feet is leased with 90 of our space on campus or affiliated with a healthcare system and an average lease term of 7 9 years this focus on quality extends to our tenants with 57 of our leases being signed by investment grade quality entities or their affiliates a metric that leads the medical office space it s these tenant relationships that are the catalyst for physicians realty trust growth by working with the best health systems in the best markets our opportunity for organic growth is second to none in the past we had funded new development conservatively moving forward we believe we can generate higher returns by increasing capital allocations to new developments this strategy includes backing the best healthcare developers who have projects pre leased at high rates to high quality health systems projects like northside medical midtown in atlanta is a prime example of this hospital driven self development model we support these efforts as well today we mentioned the closure of the el paso surgical hospital in december we learned that the operator of the hospital announced they were closing at the end of the year the hospital was very successful for many years and while the facility had challenges in 2018 the ownership including physicians invested millions of dollars to recruit and employ new physicians in the market open new services and upgrade the facility over the last few years the facility never missed a rent payment but surprisingly closed with three weeks notice and has not yet paid its december rent most of the key physicians were both owners of the tenant and employees fortunately the physician tenants were quickly reemployed by a wholly owned subsidiary of sierra providence tenet healthcare s wholly owned subsidiary in el paso and we executed a new 10 year lease on the facility at terms better than the existing lease we have a number of national healthcare systems actively evaluating and interested in either leasing or purchasing the now vacant hospital we have received and are evaluating offers to purchase and or lease the facility and are confident we will have a new tenant in the facility in the near term while a disappointing surprise the strength of this location in the healthcare market and the physicians historically aligned with the facility we believe will allow us to quickly address the situation also as noted in our press release this morning we are proud to announce three promotions our board of trustees has promoted mark theine to executive vice president of asset management recognizing his strong leadership and growth as a leader in the company mark s

financial officer thank you john in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company generated funds from operations of 49 9 million or 0 27 per share our normalized funds from operations were also 49 9 million and 0 27 per share our normalized funds available for distribution were 44 7 million or 0 24 per share representing an increase of 1 2 million after adjusting for last quarter s one time benefit from the lease termination fee for the full year of 2018 the company generated funds from operations of 1 08 per share an increase of 0 04 over 2017 and funds available for distribution of 0 94 per share an increase of 0 01 over 2017 this represents the fifth consecutive year of per share fad growth a 38 increase overall from 2014 s 0 68 per share return our fourth quarter investments were limited to 9 8 million of funded mezzanine loans which will generate a weighted average yield of 8 3 the company s full year acquisitions were largely funded by the disposition of 34 non core assets with 220 million of proceeds used to acquire 252 million of class a real estate highlighted by the 82 million northside medical midtown mob it s common knowledge that 2018 was a very difficult year for external growth for medical office building reits our cost of capital was constrained by our share price which was much lower than warranted for the entire year in addition we faced very aggressive bidders for medical office buildings in the private market both from private equity buyers who have recognized medical office as a core asset class and therefore have lowered their required returns for owning it and by the large diversified public healthcare reits who are rapidly diversifying away from the ever worsening senior housing industry against this backdrop doc focused on making significant operational improvements in asset management by directly hiring property managers in ohio and kentucky and positioning itself with premier health systems and development groups to partner on their most important facilities going forward it was because of this work in 2018 that we can now predict 200 million to 400 million of off market transactions at cap rates between 5 5 and 6 25 assuming our cost of capital remains favorable importantly the pricing on these transactions does not reflect lower asset quality but rather a recommitment to the off market and partner driven growth strategy that has cemented doc as the mob owner of choice during the past five years this proven strategy will enable doc to build concentration with key health systems and widen our existing lead in investment grade tenancy while we reward our shareholders with earnings accretion we still maintain six assets in our slated for disposition bucket with a net book value of 98 million these assets are 78 leased and are performing well but we have determined that they no longer fit our core strategy so we will dispose of them if and when we can get to the right price two of these assets were classified as held for sale last quarter because of a signed purchase contract but the buyer was unable to secure the necessary financing so they have been removed from that category this quarter we had very little capital markets activity in the fourth quarter with just a small amount 2 4 million issued on the atm our balance sheet remains strong with less than 77 million of debt maturing over the next four years all of which are existing mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4 1 our net debt to adjusted ebitda re is 5 6 times and our debt to total capitalization is less than 34 providing lots of flexibility our portfolio remains highly leased at 96 of total doa and 53 of the space is leased to investment grade rated health systems or their subsidiaries each of these metrics lead the mob reit universe northside hospital our third largest tenant at 3 5 of portfolio doa does not currently issue public debt but would most certainly be investment grade rated if they did our 96 leased same store portfolio generated cash noi growth of 1 3 excluding the six properties slated for disposition if we included these properties the noi growth would be 1 9 g a expense was 6 7 million for the quarter bringing our total 2018 g a to 28 8 million within the expected range announced at the end of last year connected in our earnings release and john s address in his prepared remarks the tenant transition that we are working through at our el paso specialty hospital and mob we have already released the mob at comparable lease rates and have been working with many interested parties for the hospital asset but until we are able to finalize a new lease we will experience a drag on ffo and fad of approximately 800 000 00 per quarter in terms of 2019 projections we ve already mentioned the 200 million to 400 million of off market investments at cap rates of 5 5 to 6 25 although the timing of those investments is uncertain we also anticipate g a expense of 31 million to 33 million which like 2018 will be temporarily elevated in q1 due to expensing of stock bonuses and then tail back down we anticipate capex will be less than 10 of noi again as we seek to maximize the amount of rent that flows through to the bottom line for our shareholders we don t utilize a repositioning bucket for underperforming assets so it is difficult to predict our overall same store noi growth for 2019 as that number will be influenced by the speed at which we finalize a tenant replacement in el paso but we continue to expect 2 to 3 of cash noi growth on a long term basis i will now turn the call over to mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail mark mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management thanks jeff we started 2018 with key objectives for the operations team including driving organic growth through proactive asset management improving the quality of our portfolio and expanding our property management platform as we look back at last year we have achieved these key goals in 2018 same store noi growth for the full year was 3 1 or 1 9 if the one time termination fee at the fox valley mob is excluded as jeff mentioned fourth quarter same store noi growth was 1 3 driven by a 1 8 increase in rental revenues 20 increase in operating expense recoveries and offset by an 18 increase in operating expenses this larger than usual year over year increase in operating expenses is attributable to the rise in real estate taxes at the baylor cancer center as well as mobs in austin and houston the increase in operating expense recoveries to offset this rise in taxes demonstrates the inflated nature of our cash flow from triple net leases in 2018 we significantly improved the long term quality of our portfolio by selling 34 older and smaller assets these properties averaged 31 000 square feet each were 82 leased 25 years old and only had 27 investment grade rated tenants we recycled the capital from the sale of these assets into four new properties totaling 620 000 square feet these new acquisitions averaged 155 000 square feet each were 96 leased and only 5 years old with limited capex needed in the future three of the four 2018 acquisitions were with existing tenants in the portfolio demonstrating doc s position as their preferred real estate owner stepping back and reviewing our progress over the last few years we have improved the quality of our portfolio substantially through both acquisitions and dispositions including the disposition of nearly half of the legacy ipo portfolio simply stated doc s portfolio transformation is real three years ago 26 of our tenants were investment grade rated compared with 53 today and 84 of our top 10 tenancy is investment grade rated we believe these new investments will provide outstanding returns for years to come and reflect the standard of exceptional quality for our acquisitions in the future speaking of our top 10 tenants we would like to congratulate catholic health initiatives and dignity health on completing their merger and rebranding under the new name common spirit health effective february 1st turning to our portfolio in 2018 we completed over 1 million square feet of leasing activity in the fourth quarter specifically we completed 270 000 square feet of leasing activity with positive leasing spreads of 3 9 in total we completed 146 000 square feet of lease renewals with an average lease term of 8 8 years resulting in a tenant retention rate of 53 the retention rate however was 77 in q4 if you exclude the el paso specialty hospital that john previously mentioned we also completed almost 125 000 square feet of new leases with an average lease term of 11 8 years we continue to see strong leasing momentum from our hospital partners for new space and the ability to push rent and annual rent escalators in lease renewals in fact 90 of our leasing activity in 2018 contained an average rent escalator of 2 5 or greater we are proud to report that fourth quarter rent concessions were low with no free rent and very little ti required to renew our existing healthcare provider partners approximately 60 of the leases renewed in the quarter did not require any ti and the remaining 40 averaged 1 57 per square foot per year tenant improvements for new leases were approximately 2 29 per square foot per year during the quarter in 2018 we invested a total of 19 8 million in tenant improvements recurring capex and leasing commissions or just 7 of the portfolio s cash noi the low investment capital expenditures relative to our peers is driven primarily by the physical quality of our buildings we have bought attention to deferred maintenance and our low lease expirations scheduled during the year in 2019 we expect capital investment to continue to trend on course at approximately 4 million to 5 million per quarter as we begin 2019 we have built a high quality portfolio operated by exceptional asset management and leasing teams that continue to deliver bottom line results we successfully expanded these teams recently by replacing third party property managers and directly hiring managers to the doc team in kentucky and ohio markets representing approximately 1 1 million square feet or 15 of our multitenant portfolio as always our commitment to relationships and service excellence for our healthcare partners nationwide is the trademark of the doc difference ultimately driving tenant retention cost efficiencies and profitable consistent growth for our shareholders with that i ll turn the call back to john john t thomas chief executive officer thank you mark we ll now take your questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing one moment please while we poll for questions our first question comes from michael carroll with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks first i want to talk a little bit about the el paso move out and why did the system decide to shut down its operations and is that normal versus trying to sell the practice i m assuming that they were just not very profitable in 2018 john t thomas chief executive officer yeah mike it s hard to explain it was a surprise to us as we said in my comments we had about three weeks notice and as i said they had never missed a rent payment and the hospital had been very successful for a very long time so the physicians that were employed there and were also part owners were as surprised as we were so can t explain the decision but it was made and like i said working with the physicians quickly moved both their employment and the lease to the medical office facility that they occupied to tenet healthcare and have a lot of interest in the facility so not a great situation but we think it s short term michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah so it s encouraging that you got the mob released so quickly i guess can you talk a little bit about the interest in the property i know you mentioned that you may sell or release it why do you think you can do it so quickly and do you think you ll be able to get this done at similar value and or rate as the prior lease john t thomas chief executive officer yeah we do believe that and three national healthcare operators are actively touring it evaluating it looking at data and due diligence from us and building a business pro forma around it el paso is still a growing community it s fairly tightly bedded on any kind of bed to population standard and more importantly this facility has 10 ors it was primarily a surgical hospital and the orthopedic surgeons who were part owners and employees who are still there in the community want to come back and start practicing in it again so it s a very desirable location and place particularly for physicians and efficiency for both inpatient and outpatient surgery michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst is the hospital physically opened right now and if it s not open is that an issue in terms of trying to sell it or release it john t thomas chief executive officer no it s secured and locked up and we re taking care of it obviously but whoever if one of the other hospitals in the community opens it they can open it under their license and do it pretty quickly if somebody wanted to come in on a de novo basis it would take a little more time but still wouldn t take too much time so the hospital could be up and operating within days depending on which hospital operator decides to lease it from us michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and finally i guess john can you provide some comments on the new reimbursement change that was enacted on january 1st related to the section 603 assets i know that doc has been pretty optimistic on those properties over the past few years does that new payment schedule alter your view on those properties john t thomas chief executive officer no we still are attracted to off campus outpatient care facilities particularly if they are leased to a credit quality health system which is what 603 is all about the aha the number of hospitals that are suing cms over the payment cut because it s directly contrary to the plain language of section 603 there s a bipartisan letter that came out of the senate with i think 70 or 80 signatures i don t think they have any problem addressing the situation if they have to do it legislatively but bottom line is we underwrite every facility based on what its current revenue and what its current reimbursement rates look like we re not dependent upon just the statute and the regulatory protection as the basis for our decision it s really about what are the services there how much revenue are they generating as you said physicians in non hospitals can be successful in locations like that so it s a nice addition with the grandfathered status and we think it s particularly valuable for the long term renewal rates of the hospitals in those locations to protect that grandfathered status so bottom line is we still underwrite every facility and monitor every facility on our current basis based upon what cms is paying them michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from jonathan hughes with raymond james please proceed with your question jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning so it sounds like el paso tenant clearly wasn t on the watch list and that was unexpected are there any other tenants on the watch list that lease large spaces with expirations over the next few years john t thomas chief executive officer jonathan i think our watch list and issues that we ve had to deal with in the past is healthier than ever and stronger than ever we certainly evaluate when we brought in and created the credit watch group and underwriting team that reports to jeff one of the things that they went back and did is went through all our leases and started tracking down financials and monitoring that and have visibility on the vast majority of all of our tenants particularly all of our large tenants of any size so that s been a very helpful team to build and they re doing a great job so again still working through the sale of the hospital in el paso and probably a change of ownership in san antonio which will be an enhancement overall but those issues have been largely taking care of themselves jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay and then on the g a guidance maybe a question for jeff i think that includes some vesting of maybe restricted shares in the first quarter and that goes back down through the rest of the year i think we saw the same thing last year is this going to be a recurring item that we should be modeling in 2020 and beyond jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer jonathan yeah that s a great question and you should be modeling that each year i think you ll see a very similar pattern jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay all right and now on the acquisition guidance expected pricing there is in the high 5 to 6 cap rate range a little higher from deals in this past year and you mentioned that s a reflection of your relationship network but maybe on the marketed deals that i assume you still evaluate have you seen any change in seller pricing there on the mobs over the past 6 9 months as interest rates have stabilized higher john t thomas chief executive officer i d say we haven t seen a meaningful change jonathan i think the four that have traded haven t measured up on a quality basis to say the duke portfolio and there are some high quality portfolios floating around right now we ll see what those print at but for the most part i think jeff s dead on we re seeing lots of great opportunities with our relationships at the cap rates that you suggested jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay any interest in large portfolios out there john t thomas chief executive officer you know jonathan we look at everything and evaluate everything that s on the market but we tend to stay off market and that s where we find the best value and have the best opportunities with our relationships jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay fair enough and then just one more so you used the atm during the fourth quarter do you plan to utilize that in addition to capital recycling from the slated for disposition bucket to fund the external growth guidance jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer hey jonathan it s jeff certainly we re going to look at both of those sources as we look to fund the pipeline we re probably pretty near target leverage right now so it s going to depend a little bit on how fast we can generate these acquisitions and the interest that we can get in selling our properties slated for disposition as we talked about these are good properties and so we are looking for good pricing on them so that s going to factor into what sources of capital we re able to tap jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay that s it for me appreciate the color jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer thanks jonathan operator our next question comes from drew babin with robert w baird please proceed with your question drew babin robert w baird and company analyst hey good morning quick follow up on the g a front for jeff i know that the changes in lease accounting you re expensing more property management type costs that you might have capitalized last year i guess can you quantify that impact to g a and kind of confirm that that s sort of an affo neutral change jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah drew i mean so that is an affo neutral change as a practical matter we didn t have a ton of g a that we were capitalizing in that manner we started to try to work toward this guidance implementation earlier so most of the g a that you see is kind of an increase in the cost of running the company increase in salaries and benefits for the best in class staff that we have so there s some benefit from capitalization but it s not a lot drew babin robert w baird and company analyst okay and i guess a related question as well on the capex front i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it would remain i think less than 10 of noi looking at your 2018 results it looked like it was maybe 7 so i guess throwing the 10 out there is that just sort of a general range do you expect the per square foot cost to rise significantly in 2019 or should they stay relatively consistent mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management hey drew this is mark theine jeff threw out the 10 number but we re really working to manage our capex efficiently and be in the 4 million to 5 million per quarter in 2019 drew babin robert w baird and company analyst okay that s helpful and just one more from me on the 200 million to 400 million of investment guidance does that include any mezzanine or development type fixed income investments or is that just pure property acquisitions jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah so that s going to be i guess that would be inclusive of acquisitions some take out type deals and limited development if we do mezzanine loans you re going to see interest rates that are well above that range typically our mezzanine rates of return are kind of in the 8 to 9 range drew babin robert w baird and company analyst okay that s all helpful thank you john t thomas chief executive officer thanks drew operator our next question comes from jordan sadler with keybank capital markets please proceed with your question jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst good morning first question regarding the acquisition guidance here just drilling down is there line of sight to the 200 million to 400 million that you offered up a specific range john t thomas chief executive officer yeah jordan we ve got a pretty good pipeline we re working on so line of sight to the midpoint of that number and expect that to appear pretty quickly jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst so for modeling purposes mid year timing kind of works jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah i think that s right jordan jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay and jeff while i have you the funding you touched on it here but what s embedded in the guidance in terms of funding and leverage for 2019 jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah so embedded in the leverage i guess or as i mentioned we re at or near our target leverage right so you consider that to be 65 equity 35 debt or so so for modeling purposes that might be an easy way to do it 65 equity the wild card is whether or not we re able to reach agreement on some of these assets slated for disposition that will obviously affect the amount of equity issued jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst the dispos are they solely related to the six assets in that bucket and does that bucket include el paso jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer so the assets slated for disposition include the foundation el paso asset not the el paso specialty hospital that s not in there right now we don t think it will be so those are assets they ve been in there for a few quarters now and we just determined they re non core and are looking to sell them but again as you heard in our same store remarks i mean they re performing well so there s not a huge we re not willing to take any price we re willing to sell them at the right price jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay they ve been hanging out here for a while so i m just curious is there an expectation this is a 2019 event or it s just we ll see what happens jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer i mean we thought we had we were close to selling two of them we think we ll be close to selling two of them again probably sooner rather than later but again we re evaluating all prices that come in jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay and just to clarify on the el paso specialty hospital did you i thought you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you may sell the asset is that right or did i mishear that john t thomas chief executive officer yeah at least three of the suitors if you will who are interested in the facility have inquired about a purchase or a lease so we re evaluating those options we ve received written offers that we re evaluating but our primary desire is to lease the facility again the operators that are evaluating and interested in it are high quality tenants that we would like to have a relationship with jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst and how should we think about the timing of the releasing and the two different pieces john t thomas chief executive officer yeah i mean we think it s quick but it s hard to predict but we think it s quick jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst first half or second john t thomas chief executive officer i think we ll have it resolved first half it s just a matter of how quickly we can get them back in there and get it open and operating it can be quick just depending upon which one of the operators we end working a deal out with jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay lastly on this term loan in columbus that you ve done in the first quarter the 15 million can you shed a little bit of light on that one of your other investments here you provided more color on this development loan i m just curious about the one that s in columbus it seems to have a little bit less detail in the release john t thomas chief executive officer yeah it s one of our large healthcare developer client relationships who took down some land and is in the process of finalizing the plans has a lease with an investment grade tenant so at this point you can view it as a short term bridge to the bigger development project but we re evaluating whether or not we ll participate or work that deal out with him on the second project but in the near term it s a good investment and well secured jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst is it an mob john t thomas chief executive officer it s a large healthcare tenant jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay all right thank you operator our next question comes from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks for taking the questions in your prepared remarks you referenced taking some of the management internal to the doc team just wondering some of your peers have focused or emphasized the internal management and they outlined some savings and margin growth opportunities i m just wondering does this signal or is this something you re looking to expand in terms of doing more internal management john t thomas chief executive officer yeah vikram this is j t we re gonna continue to in markets where it makes sense and where we have scale and we can gain those efficiencies and there are some other markets where we re planning to head in that direction in the near term i don t think we ll ever find it in some markets it s better to work with our third party partners like we already do they re the ones with the existing health system relationships and have brought us into those relationships with them and they re great partners they do a great job and in markets where we have scale and otherwise it s our relationships that we re primarily working through we re going to continue to in house where we can vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay just post the merger the chi dignity merger can you maybe update us and provide your thoughts on is there potential rationalization post merger are there candidates for disposition as you ve now gone through the portfolio for a while something i guess you may have thought about post the acquisition of chi portfolio john t thomas chief executive officer yeah great question the short answer is no they don t overlap in any markets today and we had lots of dialogue with them throughout their process of merging and getting their thoughts on which markets are going to support the best and where there might be some markets that they want to exit so as of today we don t have any knowledge of any particular market that they plan to exit and we had pretty detailed conversations with them about this as you know chi started the process of selling kentucky one before they completed the merger with dignity so they are continuing to process that sale it s kind of unrelated to the dignity merger we ve got great relationships with dignity and the combined c suite there has a heavy component of the dignity health team but a lot of our chi leadership that we work directly with are continuing on in critical roles in the organization so we re really excited about it we think it s going to strengthen their balance sheet and strengthen their operations and strengthen the overall coverage of our facilities across the country vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just on the development side given the capabilities some of your peers maybe the more diversified ones have outlined pipelines and partnerships with various systems some of them stretching a couple of years i m just sort of wondering can you kind of lay out opportunities over the next call it two years and what we can think of in terms of development contribution john t thomas chief executive officer yeah i won t put a dollar value on it but the clients that we have where we ve done this consistently over the last couple of years and now that we re funding some development projects more directly with developers we think the pipeline is pretty significant i think we announced the one project today that s with an existing developer relationship and an existing national credit rated tenant and we think there s a pipeline with that development company and that particular tenant but there s also others from phoenix to texas and other markets where we re actively working with the health systems and we ll continue to invest in georgia where we have fantastic relationships and see more economic growth and opportunity there vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just last one just to get a sense of the closure that you announced and then you re back obviously pretty quickly but just given the surprise in terms of you mentioned they were paying rent never missed a payment and suddenly decided to close what does this mean for both underwriting but more importantly just monitoring you have a new team a credit team in place and just what sort of information do you get describe some of the interactions that you have with the tenants just to sort of have some sort of heads up that it s not just going to shut down one fine day john t thomas chief executive officer yeah it s a great question vikram we always evaluate that kind of situation we ve only had a small handful over the five year life of the company but in all candor we d been working with that tenant evaluating and monitoring them and had been given every assurance that they were kind of continuing on and committed to the facility and the market and then they did a 180 within weeks and closed so it s hard to explain how to change that result in that particular situation but like i said the upside opportunity with the other operators that are interested in that facility are better vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and this was in december i believe correct john t thomas chief executive officer yes vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great thanks guys john t thomas chief executive officer thanks vikram operator our next question comes from john kim with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john kim bmo capital markets analyst good morning i m just going to follow up on the el paso discussion i know you said you were surprised when they decided to close but now that you ve had some time to examine it what do you think happened i know they had recent new ownership at the hospital but i m wondering if there was also new competition in the area or there were reimbursement challenges or maybe something else john t thomas chief executive officer john if i had a rational explanation for the decision i would share it with you i mean best way to summarize it is that it s a national operator who had one facility in the market and decided to exit the market and do it on a moment s notice we really had three weeks of notice before they closed the doors so it was no expectation at all the physicians who were employed there and were part owners of the hospital had no notice either and like i said it was a quick turnaround that is a very strong healthcare market and there are two large national operators that are there and they re very strong and tough competition for anybody so it may have been that they didn t think they could compete with them but they had for a long time and had been very successful for a long time we really can t explain the situation but like i said we ve got four good operators that we think will step in there john kim bmo capital markets analyst and on the 800 000 00 per quarter impact should we not assume there s a termination fee you can collect and then is it realistic that this would translate into an annualized impact because even if you do lease it it may take some time for a new hospital to come in and take physical occupancy john t thomas chief executive officer yeah i think we wouldn t anticipate a termination fee we are pursuing in their liquidation process claims but they re liquidating so we ll have to see how that plays out but the reason we did quantify it by quarter in particular is we think it could be a quick turnaround resolution but it depends upon which operator we end up working an arrangement out with and it could be temporary it could bleed into the year depending upon the ability to get the facility relicensed or brought under one of the existing licenses in town and we think that s a strong likelihood john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay and then jeff on your prepared remarks you mentioned on the dispositions they no longer fit your strategy and i was wondering if you could provide some color on what those characteristics are jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah so the disposition bucket includes one small building in florida that it s just kind of away from the rest of our operations and it s a little bit isolated so that s the reason that one is in there the other ones are in the foundation assets certainly they are some of the first assets that we bought in the history of the company and we ve been diversifying away from these surgical hospitals and then there s an associated mob with each surgical hospital so it kind of makes sense to sell those as a group so those are the reasons that they don t meet our strategy any more john kim bmo capital markets analyst got it okay thank you jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer thanks operator our next question comes from chad vanacore with stifel please proceed with your question chad vanacore stifel nicolaus analyst all right thanks so just one quick clarification on the retenanting of the el paso assets and so it looks like tenet healthcare but they re only renting about a third of the space what was the makeup of the former tenants and why are we leasing only a third of this space or is there more to come john t thomas chief executive officer yeah chad so it s two buildings one s a surgical hospital and one s a medical office building and to be clear the medical office building is not on the campus it s an off campus building that primarily the orthopedic surgeons who were employed by the hospital and were part owners of that hospital occupied at the time this occurred so we just turned around they stayed right where they were and changed their employment to tenet and then tenet signed a new lease on that building so the impact of this decision about one third of it was the mob and that s what s been released so now we re working through with hospital operators who are interested in leasing and or buying the hospital facility it s a surgical hospital so not a huge building chad vanacore stifel nicolaus analyst i understand got it yeah just needed that clarification and then just one other question from me sequential occupancy dropped in the fourth quarter a little bit were there any other vacancies that came up in 4q that haven t been retenanted mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management chad this is mark we actually had a positive net absorption for the fourth quarter a small number if you exclude that el paso hospital but the drop in occupancy that you re referencing is a direct correlation to the el paso facility chad vanacore stifel nicolaus analyst okay perfect that s it for me thanks mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management thanks chad operator our next question comes from daniel bernstein with capital one please proceed with your question daniel bernstein capital one analyst hi good morning not to ask another question on el paso but i feel like i have to you said you weren t going to pursue a lease termination fee and i just wanted to understand did you not have something in there that was contractual and typically in your leases what s the typical length that somebody has to go ahead and give you notification john t thomas chief executive officer yeah so to be clear they didn t honor their lease the terms or the financial terms once they decided to close so we will pursue claims and i said i wouldn t expect a lease termination fee this has been a long term facility been well operated this operator bought the operator who built it and ran it for a very long time with the physicians there and we owned it before they were involved so the relationship with that operator we didn t have anything extraordinary credit enhancements or guarantees from that operator standing behind that lease that they purchased from another party we typically do and we typically get particularly if we re making a new investment with a new operator we would get those kind of credit enhancements it s a case by case basis you don t have it with every facility daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay you didn t have any escrows or money you could tap to that lease termination fee then john t thomas chief executive officer the tenant is liquidating so as they collect receivables we re making claims against those receivables like their other creditors daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and then you made a comment earlier about escalators at 2 5 or greater i just wanted to maybe if you could remind us how much of that is cpi versus fixed rate john t thomas chief executive officer a very small percentage of cpi we ve been working those into some leases in this environment but the vast majority are fixed and even if there s a cpi there would be a floor and probably a ceiling banding around that cpi adjustment daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay that s all i have thanks operator ladies and gentlemen we ve reached the end of the

expected 2018 would be a year to recycle capital to place an extraordinary focus on operations and to position physicians realty trust for 2019 and beyond we executed on that plan through the work of our talented team as we focused on investing better our goals were largely accomplished through the selling of 220 million of older less strategically valuable properties throughout the year those proceeds were reinvested in the four highest quality properties in the country occupied by high quality health system clients in existing relationships no property better represents this focus on quality than the north side medical midtown medical office building located in the midtown neighborhood of atlanta this 165 000 square foot facility is fully leased through and occupied by northside physicians outpatient services and affiliated medical professionals this property was nationally recognized by healthcare real estate insights our industry s leading trade publication with a 2018 hrei insights award for the best new medical office building of the year this achievement marks the fourth such hrei award winner in our portfolio and we are proud northside hospital selected doc to own that building advertisement advertisement in 2018 we evaluated every facet of our organization with a goal to increase revenue and decrease expenses and we accomplished our specific financial goals by 150 away from the income statement our team worked together to define the doc difference through our mission vision and value statements these efforts illustrate who we are and how we deliver results to our people our shareholders our providers and our clients doc s on a mission to help medical providers developers and shareholders provide better healthcare better communities and better returns we are dedicated to making a difference in the lives of our team members investors healthcare partners and those who visit our properties we do this by offering broader and deeper healthcare expertise than any other reit by crafting solutions that benefit all parties and by leveraging our long standing industry connections to source and sustain the highest quality facilities and tenants in the industry we articulated our core values with the acronym care we collaborate and communicate with internal and external stakeholders we act with integrity we respect the client relationship and we execute consistently by driving our organization to make decisions and manage our investments with care we will fulfill our mission and achieve our vision we d also like to share more about physicians realty trust s commitment to sustainability and the esg we have developed a g2 sustainability philosophy a practical approach in which being green through our capital initiatives equates to a green cash result with cost savings over time this outlook ensures the integrity and the economic viability operational efficiency natural resource conservation and social responsibility within our network nationwide portfolio advertisement advertisement in 2018 doc spend approximately 2 8 million on sustainability driven capital expenditure projects within the portfolio these efforts include led retrofits building automation system upgrades and façade replacements resulting in both immediate and long term energy savings the company also consolidated telecommunication bills which reduced cost and created cash management efficiencies in 2018 physicians realty trust was certified by the independent analysts at great places to work we also earned a spot on the milwaukee journal sentinel s 2018 list of wisconsin s top workplaces the diversity of our employee base remains a top priority for our company i m proud to share that women and minorities comprise 23 of our leadership team and 57 of our larger team on our board of trustees 29 of the independent trustees are a woman or a minority because of our commitment to our care core values the company provided over 180 000 00 in philanthropic support to charitable causes nationwide while participating in meaningful volunteer opportunities with our team advertisement advertisement we are proud of our esg progress in 2018 but understand that we can always do more we will continue to invest in initiatives that improve our overall sustainability performance and support our long term goals with this attention to detail and invest in better mentality we ended the year with a high quality portfolio of medical office facilities as of december 31 2018 approximately 96 of our 13 6 million square feet is leased with 90 of our space on campus or affiliated with a healthcare system and an average lease term of 7 9 years this focus on quality extends to our tenants with 57 of our leases being signed by investment grade quality entities or their affiliates a metric that leads the medical office space it s these tenant relationships that are the catalyst for physicians realty trust growth by working with the best health systems in the best markets our opportunity for organic growth is second to none in the past we had funded new development conservatively moving forward we believe we can generate higher returns by increasing capital allocations to new developments this strategy includes backing the best healthcare developers who have projects pre leased at high rates to high quality health systems projects like northside medical midtown in atlanta is a prime example of this hospital driven self development model we support these efforts as well today we mentioned the closure of the el paso surgical hospital in december we learned that the operator of the hospital announced they were closing at the end of the year the hospital was very successful for many years and while the facility had challenges in 2018 the ownership including physicians invested millions of dollars to recruit and employ new physicians in the market open new services and upgrade the facility over the last few years the facility never missed a rent payment but surprisingly closed with three weeks notice and has not yet paid its december rent advertisement advertisement most of the key physicians were both owners of the tenant and employees fortunately the physician tenants were quickly reemployed by a wholly owned subsidiary of sierra providence tenet healthcare s wholly owned subsidiary in el paso and we executed a new 10 year lease on the facility at terms better than the existing lease we have a number of national healthcare systems actively evaluating and interested in either leasing or purchasing the now vacant hospital we have received and are evaluating offers to purchase and or lease the facility and are confident we will have a new tenant in the facility in the near term while a disappointing surprise the strength of this location in the healthcare market and the physicians historically aligned with the facility we believe will allow us to quickly address the situation also as noted in our press release this morning we are proud to announce three promotions our board of trustees has promoted mark theine to executive vice president of asset management recognizing his strong leadership and growth as a leader in the company mark s career began when he was hired by our founder john sweet to help build and run the private company that is the predecessor company to doc and became an original officer of doc as a senior vice president upon completion of our ipo mark is responsible for managing the daily operations of our portfolio which has grown from 19 buildings and 500 000 square feet at the time of the ipo to over 250 buildings and almost 14 million square feet today in the beginning he managed a handful of internal employees and third party property managers and today due to our growth directly or indirectly manages over 100 people advertisement advertisement in addition the board promoted and expanded the responsibilities of john lucey recognizing his contributions as our chief accounting and administrative officer john joined our organization immediately following our ipo as our principal accounting officer and his leadership and ability to scale our team as we have experienced significant growth has been critical to our success john leads our accounting sec and public company reporting human resources information technology professionals and oversees other administrative responsibilities as well among many of john s accomplishments was his decision to hire mentor and develop laurie p becker who rose quickly through the organization we are pleased to announce laurie has been promoted to senior vice president and controller laurie will continue to report to john lucey across his many responsibilities with a direct focus on accounting and sec reporting with that i ll turn it over to jeff jeff theiler chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you john in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company generated funds from operations of 49 9 million or 0 27 per share our normalized funds from operations were also 49 9 million and 0 27 per share our normalized funds available for distribution were 44 7 million or 0 24 per share representing an increase of 1 2 million after adjusting for last quarter s one time benefit from the lease termination fee for the full year of 2018 the company generated funds from operations of 1 08 per share an increase of 0 04 over 2017 and funds available for distribution of 0 94 per share an increase of 0 01 over 2017 this represents the fifth consecutive year of per share fad growth a 38 increase overall from 2014 s 0 68 per share return our fourth quarter investments were limited to 9 8 million of funded mezzanine loans which will generate a weighted average yield of 8 3 the company s full year acquisitions were largely funded by the disposition of 34 non core assets with 220 million of proceeds used to acquire 252 million of class a real estate highlighted by the 82 million northside medical midtown mob it s common knowledge that 2018 was a very difficult year for external growth for medical office building reits our cost of capital was constrained by our share price which was much lower than warranted for the entire year in addition we faced very aggressive bidders for medical office buildings in the private market both from private equity buyers who have recognized medical office as a core asset class and therefore have lowered their required returns for owning it and by the large diversified public healthcare reits who are rapidly diversifying away from the ever worsening senior housing industry against this backdrop doc focused on making significant operational improvements in asset management by directly hiring property managers in ohio and kentucky and positioning itself with premier health systems and development groups to partner on their most important facilities going forward it was because of this work in 2018 that we can now predict 200 million to 400 million of off market transactions at cap rates between 5 5 and 6 25 assuming our cost of capital remains favorable importantly the pricing on these transactions does not reflect lower asset quality but rather a recommitment to the off market and partner driven growth strategy that has cemented doc as the mob owner of choice during the past five years this proven strategy will enable doc to build concentration with key health systems and widen our existing lead in investment grade tenancy while we reward our shareholders with earnings accretion we still maintain six assets in our slated for disposition bucket with a net book value of 98 million these assets are 78 leased and are performing well but we have determined that they no longer fit our core strategy so we will dispose of them if and when we can get to the right price two of these assets were classified as held for sale last quarter because of a signed purchase contract but the buyer was unable to secure the necessary financing so they have been removed from that category this quarter we had very little capital markets activity in the fourth quarter with just a small amount 2 4 million issued on the atm our balance sheet remains strong with less than 77 million of debt maturing over the next four years all of which are existing mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4 1 our net debt to adjusted ebitda re is 5 6 times and our debt to total capitalization is less than 34 providing lots of flexibility our portfolio remains highly leased at 96 of total doa and 53 of the space is leased to investment grade rated health systems or their subsidiaries each of these metrics lead the mob reit universe northside hospital our third largest tenant at 3 5 of portfolio doa does not currently issue public debt but would most certainly be investment grade rated if they did our 96 leased same store portfolio generated cash noi growth of 1 3 excluding the six properties slated for disposition if we included these properties the noi growth would be 1 9 g a expense was 6 7 million for the quarter bringing our total 2018 g a to 28 8 million within the expected range announced at the end of last year connected in our earnings release and john s address in his prepared remarks the tenant transition that we are working through at our el paso specialty hospital and mob we have already released the mob at comparable lease rates and have been working with many interested parties for the hospital asset but until we are able to finalize a new lease we will experience a drag on ffo and fad of approximately 800 000 00 per quarter in terms of 2019 projections we ve already mentioned the 200 million to 400 million of off market investments at cap rates of 5 5 to 6 25 although the timing of those investments is uncertain we also anticipate g a expense of 31 million to 33 million which like 2018 will be temporarily elevated in q1 due to expensing of stock bonuses and then tail back down we anticipate capex will be less than 10 of noi again as we seek to maximize the amount of rent that flows through to the bottom line for our shareholders we don t utilize a repositioning bucket for underperforming assets so it is difficult to predict our overall same store noi growth for 2019 as that number will be influenced by the speed at which we finalize a tenant replacement in el paso but we continue to expect 2 to 3 of cash noi growth on a long term basis i will now turn the call over to mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail mark mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management thanks jeff we started 2018 with key objectives for the operations team including driving organic growth through proactive asset management improving the quality of our portfolio and expanding our property management platform as we look back at last year we have achieved these key goals in 2018 same store noi growth for the full year was 3 1 or 1 9 if the one time termination fee at the fox valley mob is excluded as jeff mentioned fourth quarter same store noi growth was 1 3 driven by a 1 8 increase in rental revenues 20 increase in operating expense recoveries and offset by an 18 increase in operating expenses this larger than usual year over year increase in operating expenses is attributable to the rise in real estate taxes at the baylor cancer center as well as mobs in austin and houston the increase in operating expense recoveries to offset this rise in taxes demonstrates the inflated nature of our cash flow from triple net leases in 2018 we significantly improved the long term quality of our portfolio by selling 34 older and smaller assets these properties averaged 31 000 square feet each were 82 leased 25 years old and only had 27 investment grade rated tenants we recycled the capital from the sale of these assets into four new properties totaling 620 000 square feet these new acquisitions averaged 155 000 square feet each were 96 leased and only 5 years old with limited capex needed in the future three of the four 2018 acquisitions were with existing tenants in the portfolio demonstrating doc s position as their preferred real estate owner stepping back and reviewing our progress over the last few years we have improved the quality of our portfolio substantially through both acquisitions and dispositions including the disposition of nearly half of the legacy ipo portfolio simply stated doc s portfolio transformation is real three years ago 26 of our tenants were investment grade rated compared with 53 today and 84 of our top 10 tenancy is investment grade rated we believe these new investments will provide outstanding returns for years to come and reflect the standard of exceptional quality for our acquisitions in the future speaking of our top 10 tenants we would like to congratulate catholic health initiatives and dignity health on completing their merger and rebranding under the new name common spirit health effective february 1st turning to our portfolio in 2018 we completed over 1 million square feet of leasing activity in the fourth quarter specifically we completed 270 000 square feet of leasing activity with positive leasing spreads of 3 9 in total we completed 146 000 square feet of lease renewals with an average lease term of 8 8 years resulting in a tenant retention rate of 53 the retention rate however was 77 in q4 if you exclude the el paso specialty hospital that john previously mentioned we also completed almost 125 000 square feet of new leases with an average lease term of 11 8 years we continue to see strong leasing momentum from our hospital partners for new space and the ability to push rent and annual rent escalators in lease renewals in fact 90 of our leasing activity in 2018 contained an average rent escalator of 2 5 or greater we are proud to report that fourth quarter rent concessions were low with no free rent and very little ti required to renew our existing healthcare provider partners approximately 60 of the leases renewed in the quarter did not require any ti and the remaining 40 averaged 1 57 per square foot per year tenant improvements for new leases were approximately 2 29 per square foot per year during the quarter in 2018 we invested a total of 19 8 million in tenant improvements recurring capex and leasing commissions or just 7 of the portfolio s cash noi the low investment capital expenditures relative to our peers is driven primarily by the physical quality of our buildings we have bought attention to deferred maintenance and our low lease expirations scheduled during the year in 2019 we expect capital investment to continue to trend on course at approximately 4 million to 5 million per quarter as we begin 2019 we have built a high quality portfolio operated by exceptional asset management and leasing teams that continue to deliver bottom line results we successfully expanded these teams recently by replacing third party property managers and directly hiring managers to the doc team in kentucky and ohio markets representing approximately 1 1 million square feet or 15 of our multitenant portfolio as always our commitment to relationships and service excellence for our healthcare partners nationwide is the trademark of the doc difference ultimately driving tenant retention cost efficiencies and profitable consistent growth for our shareholders with that i ll turn the call back to john john t thomas chief executive officer thank you mark we ll now take your questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing one moment please while we poll for questions our first question comes from michael carroll with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks first i want to talk a little bit about the el paso move out and why did the system decide to shut down its operations and is that normal versus trying to sell the practice i m assuming that they were just not very profitable in 2018 john t thomas chief executive officer yeah mike it s hard to explain it was a surprise to us as we said in my comments we had about three weeks notice and as i said they had never missed a rent payment and the hospital had been very successful for a very long time so the physicians that were employed there and were also part owners were as surprised as we were so can t explain the decision but it was made and like i said working with the physicians quickly moved both their employment and the lease to the medical office facility that they occupied to tenet healthcare and have a lot of interest in the facility so not a great situation but we think it s short term michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah so it s encouraging that you got the mob released so quickly i guess can you talk a little bit about the interest in the property i know you mentioned that you may sell or release it why do you think you can do it so quickly and do you think you ll be able to get this done at similar value and or rate as the prior lease john t thomas chief executive officer yeah we do believe that and three national healthcare operators are actively touring it evaluating it looking at data and due diligence from us and building a business pro forma around it el paso is still a growing community it s fairly tightly bedded on any kind of bed to population standard and more importantly this facility has 10 ors it was primarily a surgical hospital and the orthopedic surgeons who were part owners and employees who are still there in the community want to come back and start practicing in it again so it s a very desirable location and place particularly for physicians and efficiency for both inpatient and outpatient surgery michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst is the hospital physically opened right now and if it s not open is that an issue in terms of trying to sell it or release it john t thomas chief executive officer no it s secured and locked up and we re taking care of it obviously but whoever if one of the other hospitals in the community opens it they can open it under their license and do it pretty quickly if somebody wanted to come in on a de novo basis it would take a little more time but still wouldn t take too much time so the hospital could be up and operating within days depending on which hospital operator decides to lease it from us michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and finally i guess john can you provide some comments on the new reimbursement change that was enacted on january 1st related to the section 603 assets i know that doc has been pretty optimistic on those properties over the past few years does that new payment schedule alter your view on those properties john t thomas chief executive officer no we still are attracted to off campus outpatient care facilities particularly if they are leased to a credit quality health system which is what 603 is all about the aha the number of hospitals that are suing cms over the payment cut because it s directly contrary to the plain language of section 603 there s a bipartisan letter that came out of the senate with i think 70 or 80 signatures i don t think they have any problem addressing the situation if they have to do it legislatively but bottom line is we underwrite every facility based on what its current revenue and what its current reimbursement rates look like we re not dependent upon just the statute and the regulatory protection as the basis for our decision it s really about what are the services there how much revenue are they generating as you said physicians in non hospitals can be successful in locations like that so it s a nice addition with the grandfathered status and we think it s particularly valuable for the long term renewal rates of the hospitals in those locations to protect that grandfathered status so bottom line is we still underwrite every facility and monitor every facility on our current basis based upon what cms is paying them michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from jonathan hughes with raymond james please proceed with your question jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning so it sounds like el paso tenant clearly wasn t on the watch list and that was unexpected are there any other tenants on the watch list that lease large spaces with expirations over the next few years john t thomas chief executive officer jonathan i think our watch list and issues that we ve had to deal with in the past is healthier than ever and stronger than ever we certainly evaluate when we brought in and created the credit watch group and underwriting team that reports to jeff one of the things that they went back and did is went through all our leases and started tracking down financials and monitoring that and have visibility on the vast majority of all of our tenants particularly all of our large tenants of any size so that s been a very helpful team to build and they re doing a great job so again still working through the sale of the hospital in el paso and probably a change of ownership in san antonio which will be an enhancement overall but those issues have been largely taking care of themselves jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay and then on the g a guidance maybe a question for jeff i think that includes some vesting of maybe restricted shares in the first quarter and that goes back down through the rest of the year i think we saw the same thing last year is this going to be a recurring item that we should be modeling in 2020 and beyond jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer jonathan yeah that s a great question and you should be modeling that each year i think you ll see a very similar pattern jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay all right and now on the acquisition guidance expected pricing there is in the high 5 to 6 cap rate range a little higher from deals in this past year and you mentioned that s a reflection of your relationship network but maybe on the marketed deals that i assume you still evaluate have you seen any change in seller pricing there on the mobs over the past 6 9 months as interest rates have stabilized higher john t thomas chief executive officer i d say we haven t seen a meaningful change jonathan i think the four that have traded haven t measured up on a quality basis to say the duke portfolio and there are some high quality portfolios floating around right now we ll see what those print at but for the most part i think jeff s dead on we re seeing lots of great opportunities with our relationships at the cap rates that you suggested jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay any interest in large portfolios out there john t thomas chief executive officer you know jonathan we look at everything and evaluate everything that s on the market but we tend to stay off market and that s where we find the best value and have the best opportunities with our relationships jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay fair enough and then just one more so you used the atm during the fourth quarter do you plan to utilize that in addition to capital recycling from the slated for disposition bucket to fund the external growth guidance jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer hey jonathan it s jeff certainly we re going to look at both of those sources as we look to fund the pipeline we re probably pretty near target leverage right now so it s going to depend a little bit on how fast we can generate these acquisitions and the interest that we can get in selling our properties slated for disposition as we talked about these are good properties and so we are looking for good pricing on them so that s going to factor into what sources of capital we re able to tap jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay that s it for me appreciate the color jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer thanks jonathan operator our next question comes from drew babin with robert w baird please proceed with your question drew babin robert w baird and company analyst hey good morning quick follow up on the g a front for jeff i know that the changes in lease accounting you re expensing more property management type costs that you might have capitalized last year i guess can you quantify that impact to g a and kind of confirm that that s sort of an affo neutral change jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah drew i mean so that is an affo neutral change as a practical matter we didn t have a ton of g a that we were capitalizing in that manner we started to try to work toward this guidance implementation earlier so most of the g a that you see is kind of an increase in the cost of running the company increase in salaries and benefits for the best in class staff that we have so there s some benefit from capitalization but it s not a lot drew babin robert w baird and company analyst okay and i guess a related question as well on the capex front i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it would remain i think less than 10 of noi looking at your 2018 results it looked like it was maybe 7 so i guess throwing the 10 out there is that just sort of a general range do you expect the per square foot cost to rise significantly in 2019 or should they stay relatively consistent mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management hey drew this is mark theine jeff threw out the 10 number but we re really working to manage our capex efficiently and be in the 4 million to 5 million per quarter in 2019 drew babin robert w baird and company analyst okay that s helpful and just one more from me on the 200 million to 400 million of investment guidance does that include any mezzanine or development type fixed income investments or is that just pure property acquisitions jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah so that s going to be i guess that would be inclusive of acquisitions some take out type deals and limited development if we do mezzanine loans you re going to see interest rates that are well above that range typically our mezzanine rates of return are kind of in the 8 to 9 range drew babin robert w baird and company analyst okay that s all helpful thank you john t thomas chief executive officer thanks drew operator our next question comes from jordan sadler with keybank capital markets please proceed with your question jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst good morning first question regarding the acquisition guidance here just drilling down is there line of sight to the 200 million to 400 million that you offered up a specific range john t thomas chief executive officer yeah jordan we ve got a pretty good pipeline we re working on so line of sight to the midpoint of that number and expect that to appear pretty quickly jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst so for modeling purposes mid year timing kind of works jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah i think that s right jordan jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay and jeff while i have you the funding you touched on it here but what s embedded in the guidance in terms of funding and leverage for 2019 jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah so embedded in the leverage i guess or as i mentioned we re at or near our target leverage right so you consider that to be 65 equity 35 debt or so so for modeling purposes that might be an easy way to do it 65 equity the wild card is whether or not we re able to reach agreement on some of these assets slated for disposition that will obviously affect the amount of equity issued jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst the dispos are they solely related to the six assets in that bucket and does that bucket include el paso jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer so the assets slated for disposition include the foundation el paso asset not the el paso specialty hospital that s not in there right now we don t think it will be so those are assets they ve been in there for a few quarters now and we just determined they re non core and are looking to sell them but again as you heard in our same store remarks i mean they re performing well so there s not a huge we re not willing to take any price we re willing to sell them at the right price jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay they ve been hanging out here for a while so i m just curious is there an expectation this is a 2019 event or it s just we ll see what happens jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer i mean we thought we had we were close to selling two of them we think we ll be close to selling two of them again probably sooner rather than later but again we re evaluating all prices that come in jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay and just to clarify on the el paso specialty hospital did you i thought you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you may sell the asset is that right or did i mishear that john t thomas chief executive officer yeah at least three of the suitors if you will who are interested in the facility have inquired about a purchase or a lease so we re evaluating those options we ve received written offers that we re evaluating but our primary desire is to lease the facility again the operators that are evaluating and interested in it are high quality tenants that we would like to have a relationship with jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst and how should we think about the timing of the releasing and the two different pieces john t thomas chief executive officer yeah i mean we think it s quick but it s hard to predict but we think it s quick jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst first half or second john t thomas chief executive officer i think we ll have it resolved first half it s just a matter of how quickly we can get them back in there and get it open and operating it can be quick just depending upon which one of the operators we end working a deal out with jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay lastly on this term loan in columbus that you ve done in the first quarter the 15 million can you shed a little bit of light on that one of your other investments here you provided more color on this development loan i m just curious about the one that s in columbus it seems to have a little bit less detail in the release john t thomas chief executive officer yeah it s one of our large healthcare developer client relationships who took down some land and is in the process of finalizing the plans has a lease with an investment grade tenant so at this point you can view it as a short term bridge to the bigger development project but we re evaluating whether or not we ll participate or work that deal out with him on the second project but in the near term it s a good investment and well secured jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst is it an mob john t thomas chief executive officer it s a large healthcare tenant jordan sadler keybank capital markets analyst okay all right thank you operator our next question comes from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks for taking the questions in your prepared remarks you referenced taking some of the management internal to the doc team just wondering some of your peers have focused or emphasized the internal management and they outlined some savings and margin growth opportunities i m just wondering does this signal or is this something you re looking to expand in terms of doing more internal management john t thomas chief executive officer yeah vikram this is j t we re gonna continue to in markets where it makes sense and where we have scale and we can gain those efficiencies and there are some other markets where we re planning to head in that direction in the near term i don t think we ll ever find it in some markets it s better to work with our third party partners like we already do they re the ones with the existing health system relationships and have brought us into those relationships with them and they re great partners they do a great job and in markets where we have scale and otherwise it s our relationships that we re primarily working through we re going to continue to in house where we can vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay just post the merger the chi dignity merger can you maybe update us and provide your thoughts on is there potential rationalization post merger are there candidates for disposition as you ve now gone through the portfolio for a while something i guess you may have thought about post the acquisition of chi portfolio john t thomas chief executive officer yeah great question the short answer is no they don t overlap in any markets today and we had lots of dialogue with them throughout their process of merging and getting their thoughts on which markets are going to support the best and where there might be some markets that they want to exit so as of today we don t have any knowledge of any particular market that they plan to exit and we had pretty detailed conversations with them about this as you know chi started the process of selling kentucky one before they completed the merger with dignity so they are continuing to process that sale it s kind of unrelated to the dignity merger we ve got great relationships with dignity and the combined c suite there has a heavy component of the dignity health team but a lot of our chi leadership that we work directly with are continuing on in critical roles in the organization so we re really excited about it we think it s going to strengthen their balance sheet and strengthen their operations and strengthen the overall coverage of our facilities across the country vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just on the development side given the capabilities some of your peers maybe the more diversified ones have outlined pipelines and partnerships with various systems some of them stretching a couple of years i m just sort of wondering can you kind of lay out opportunities over the next call it two years and what we can think of in terms of development contribution john t thomas chief executive officer yeah i won t put a dollar value on it but the clients that we have where we ve done this consistently over the last couple of years and now that we re funding some development projects more directly with developers we think the pipeline is pretty significant i think we announced the one project today that s with an existing developer relationship and an existing national credit rated tenant and we think there s a pipeline with that development company and that particular tenant but there s also others from phoenix to texas and other markets where we re actively working with the health systems and we ll continue to invest in georgia where we have fantastic relationships and see more economic growth and opportunity there vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just last one just to get a sense of the closure that you announced and then you re back obviously pretty quickly but just given the surprise in terms of you mentioned they were paying rent never missed a payment and suddenly decided to close what does this mean for both underwriting but more importantly just monitoring you have a new team a credit team in place and just what sort of information do you get describe some of the interactions that you have with the tenants just to sort of have some sort of heads up that it s not just going to shut down one fine day john t thomas chief executive officer yeah it s a great question vikram we always evaluate that kind of situation we ve only had a small handful over the five year life of the company but in all candor we d been working with that tenant evaluating and monitoring them and had been given every assurance that they were kind of continuing on and committed to the facility and the market and then they did a 180 within weeks and closed so it s hard to explain how to change that result in that particular situation but like i said the upside opportunity with the other operators that are interested in that facility are better vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and this was in december i believe correct john t thomas chief executive officer yes vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great thanks guys john t thomas chief executive officer thanks vikram operator our next question comes from john kim with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john kim bmo capital markets analyst good morning i m just going to follow up on the el paso discussion i know you said you were surprised when they decided to close but now that you ve had some time to examine it what do you think happened i know they had recent new ownership at the hospital but i m wondering if there was also new competition in the area or there were reimbursement challenges or maybe something else john t thomas chief executive officer john if i had a rational explanation for the decision i would share it with you i mean best way to summarize it is that it s a national operator who had one facility in the market and decided to exit the market and do it on a moment s notice we really had three weeks of notice before they closed the doors so it was no expectation at all the physicians who were employed there and were part owners of the hospital had no notice either and like i said it was a quick turnaround that is a very strong healthcare market and there are two large national operators that are there and they re very strong and tough competition for anybody so it may have been that they didn t think they could compete with them but they had for a long time and had been very successful for a long time we really can t explain the situation but like i said we ve got four good operators that we think will step in there john kim bmo capital markets analyst and on the 800 000 00 per quarter impact should we not assume there s a termination fee you can collect and then is it realistic that this would translate into an annualized impact because even if you do lease it it may take some time for a new hospital to come in and take physical occupancy john t thomas chief executive officer yeah i think we wouldn t anticipate a termination fee we are pursuing in their liquidation process claims but they re liquidating so we ll have to see how that plays out but the reason we did quantify it by quarter in particular is we think it could be a quick turnaround resolution but it depends upon which operator we end up working an arrangement out with and it could be temporary it could bleed into the year depending upon the ability to get the facility relicensed or brought under one of the existing licenses in town and we think that s a strong likelihood john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay and then jeff on your prepared remarks you mentioned on the dispositions they no longer fit your strategy and i was wondering if you could provide some color on what those characteristics are jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer yeah so the disposition bucket includes one small building in florida that it s just kind of away from the rest of our operations and it s a little bit isolated so that s the reason that one is in there the other ones are in the foundation assets certainly they are some of the first assets that we bought in the history of the company and we ve been diversifying away from these surgical hospitals and then there s an associated mob with each surgical hospital so it kind of makes sense to sell those as a group so those are the reasons that they don t meet our strategy any more john kim bmo capital markets analyst got it okay thank you jeffrey n theiler chief financial officer thanks operator our next question comes from chad vanacore with stifel please proceed with your question chad vanacore stifel nicolaus analyst all right thanks so just one quick clarification on the retenanting of the el paso assets and so it looks like tenet healthcare but they re only renting about a third of the space what was the makeup of the former tenants and why are we leasing only a third of this space or is there more to come john t thomas chief executive officer yeah chad so it s two buildings one s a surgical hospital and one s a medical office building and to be clear the medical office building is not on the campus it s an off campus building that primarily the orthopedic surgeons who were employed by the hospital and were part owners of that hospital occupied at the time this occurred so we just turned around they stayed right where they were and changed their employment to tenet and then tenet signed a new lease on that building so the impact of this decision about one third of it was the mob and that s what s been released so now we re working through with hospital operators who are interested in leasing and or buying the hospital facility it s a surgical hospital so not a huge building chad vanacore stifel nicolaus analyst i understand got it yeah just needed that clarification and then just one other question from me sequential occupancy dropped in the fourth quarter a little bit were there any other vacancies that came up in 4q that haven t been retenanted mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management chad this is mark we actually had a positive net absorption for the fourth quarter a small number if you exclude that el paso hospital but the drop in occupancy that you re referencing is a direct correlation to the el paso facility chad vanacore stifel nicolaus analyst okay perfect that s it for me thanks mark d theine senior vice president asset and investment management thanks chad operator our next question comes from daniel bernstein with capital one please proceed with your question daniel bernstein capital one analyst hi good morning not to ask another question on el paso but i feel like i have to you said you weren t going to pursue a lease termination fee and i just wanted to understand did you not have something in there that was contractual and typically in your leases what s the typical length that somebody has to go ahead and give you notification john t thomas chief executive officer yeah so to be clear they didn t honor their lease the terms or the financial terms once they decided to close so we will pursue claims and i said i wouldn t expect a lease termination fee this has been a long term facility been well operated this operator bought the operator who built it and ran it for a very long time with the physicians there and we owned it before they were involved so the relationship with that operator we didn t have anything extraordinary credit enhancements or guarantees from that operator standing behind that lease that they purchased from another party we typically do and we typically get particularly if we re making a new investment with a new operator we would get those kind of credit enhancements it s a case by case basis you don t have it with every facility daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay you didn t have any escrows or money you could tap to that lease termination fee then john t thomas chief executive officer the tenant is liquidating so as they collect receivables we re making claims against those receivables like their other creditors daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and then you made a comment earlier about escalators at 2 5 or greater i just wanted to maybe if you could remind us how much of that is cpi versus fixed rate john t thomas chief executive officer a very small percentage of cpi we ve been working those into some leases in this environment but the vast majority are fixed and even if there s a cpi there would be a floor and probably a ceiling banding around that cpi adjustment daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay that s all i have thanks operator ladies and gentlemen we ve reached the end of the question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the call back to john thomas for closing comments john t thomas chief executive officer yeah thank you very much for joining us today i know there are a number of investor conferences over the next few weeks we look forward to seeing you at those meetings thank you for your time operator this concludes today s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation duration 55 minutes call

homo economicus guided solely by the rituals of consumption and shorn of the animating virtues and heroic drives that propelled history forward the reason that i originally said that i did not expect the fed to raise rates again was because i knew that raising rates was the first step in a journey that they could not finish that in their attempt to normalize rates the stock market bubble would burst and the economy would re enter recession normalizing interest rates when you ve created an abnormal amount of debt is impossible i knew all along that at some point that would be it you know the straw that breaks the camel s back i didn t know how many rate hikes the bubble economy could take but i knew there was a limit and i still knew that there s no way they were ever going to get back up to normal or neutral rate of interest whatever that number is it ain t 2 everything that the federal reserve built up based on cheap money was starting to implode as the cheap money was being withdrawn the us economy is built for zero it s not working at 2 and you re starting to see that schiff was speaking at the vancouver investment conference and that is that for the last several years i have predicted a dramatic increase in populism social unrest and violence and a lot of people thought we were conspiracy theory nutcases now paris is on fire there is the old joke about the difference between a recession and a depression it s a recession when your neighbor loses his job and it s a depression when you lose yours that s what i fear i think that you ll find that after 08 people understand a lot more about finance than they did before 08 they may not realize it but i think they now understand bailouts they understand how unfair bailouts are when they re targeted at wall street as opposed to main street and i think that what you re going to see sadly is the fed and the government will do what they ve always tried to do which is bail out wall street to save the system if you have a bad economy and you have people feeling like they re disenfranchised and you tell them you know what we need to do this to save the system well suddenly the reaction changes and the reaction is to hell with it let s burn the system to the ground and if we re in that place which again it feels like we are when you have this chasm between left and right in politics you have an economy that is running on fumes you have a stock market that is potentially at all time highs and you have a moment in time where things like the national debt start to matter i worry like you do that the only way people are going to be able to express this is the way they are doing it in france now and that is going to be a very very bad outcome for one and all macron is interesting macron came out of nowhere here we have an ex rothschild banker who was put up as the alternative to the very unpalatable to the establishment anyway marine le pen well guess what the establishment pulled macron out of nowhere young handsome erudite very much in the obama mold who spoke well he looked great he was very presentable he was stylish and macron was that in spades the fact that he was an ex rothschild banker seemed to pass by most of the people voting for him and he got it and the establishment breathed a huge sigh of relief but guess what he s turned out again to be an appalling president his approval ratings are i don t know if i m right in saying they re below hollande but they re down there with hollande which i thought would be a remarkably difficult thing to do but he s achieved it with some ease so i think macron to me represented the establishment s last roll of the dice you know here s a guy we re going to put him in there we re going to get him to say all of the things we need him to say and he s going to calm things down and he s going to help this whole thing blow over and nothing of the sort has happened i think that this populist movement is not going to just go away and be placated i think what s happened to macron in france is the absolute embodiment of that so the fact that he is struggling the fact that he is looking as though i mean in years gone by he would have already stepped down back when politicians had some shame he would have already stepped down and taken responsibility for the state of the country but they don t do that anymore so a failure of the eu is everybody has their own currency and everybody has a border again now the key to this is going to be the euro because it is the monetary union that is creating the problems now it worked great when interest rates were going in the right direction it worked great for everybody now they ve started to go in the other direction and the debts have started to matter and the pressure is on these countries people don t understand what the euro represents they know that they can t make ends meet and they know that an answer to this from a political standpoint is to go back to i ll use italy as an example is to go back to the lira pay off all of your debts in lira a massively devalued lira and not be forced to maintain a budget deficit that is dictated by brussels and to be able to spend and help your country come out of a recession that s what s going to happen it was always going to happen but the way the bureaucrats in brussels treat everybody because they have to toe a hard line they have to use the stick and not the carrot to keep this thing together is we re going to be all brexit francis fukuyama in his end of history essay gavin jacobson writes in the tls is ordinarily read as the apologia for rampant capitalism and anglo american interventions in the middle east yet little redemption is to be found in his liberal end state indeed effectively since the great wars but more particularly electorates have leaped into unknown futures jacobson concludes linking this to fukuyama s prediction that homo economicus ennui ultimately would lead them to revolt well orthodoxies have indeed fallen into doubt and for good reason the prevailing liberal construct with its grand theory about bringing peace and economic prosperity to the world by pulling down borders and uniting mankind into a new universal order is in serious disarray it has lost its credibility let us not tarry too long over its recent history deemed essential to whittle down the overhang of government debt precisely incurred in order to bailout the financial system with all austerity s substantial hurts justified in the name of restoring european competitivity but as former us budget director david stockman has noted the idea to restore competitivity in this way always was nonsense central bank policies of quantitative easing qe the loose credit tsunami unleashed at no cost interest rates over the last couple of decades landed the 60 with a high cost economy which exactly precluded competition the fed drove up costs prices and wages at 2 come hell or high water you do that for two or three decades and all of a sudden you are totally uncompetitive you have the highest cost structure in the world economy and the jobs and production migrate to where companies can find lower costs and better profits so here we are after all the talking up of recovery with german factory orders posted in december 2018 their biggest year on year slump since 2012 evidently the grand theory has not worked so what does all this spell for the future of europe the idle vassalage into which the majority would sink which fukuyama foresaw and lamented was already in evidence well before 2008 in european states including britain slavoj žižek wrote in the ticklish subject the absent centre of political ontology 1999 that in the guise of a more or less universal consensus tony blair s notion of the radical centre was žižek notes a perfect illustration of this shift and infatuated with the clarity and intellectual rigor of their vision centred on the unification of europe the liberal élites have come to view it not as one legitimate political option among others but as the only legitimate option the moral illegitimacy of britain s brexit thus became the unrelenting theme for decrying the brexit vote adherents of the grand theory now find it increasingly difficult to see any need for the kind of toleration for national cultural self determination they once permitted tolerance like nationalism is out anger is in where now if europe is stalling economically what might be the political repercussions recall what occurred in japan some years ago japan was also over indebted the stock market bubble had popped in 1989 and financial experts had forecast a massive collapse of jgbs japanese government debt what happened then was thatis the whole world about to turn japanese where having so much debt we cannot somehow return to historical normal yields historically around 5 the japanese it seems just accepted the tedium does europe too just move to a very low yield low growth stagnation within a global paradigm of stasis that persists until we get to the point where there is either some populist uprising or some event that resets the system maybe not japan was always a special case its debt was held almost entirely domestically and growth was occurring elsewhere in the world albeit not in japan nonetheless japan serves as a canary in the coal mine of the deadening consequences of excessive debt loads were we however to enter into a period whereas people thought it would then perhaps this time japan may not be such a good guide the point here is that we are at the crux of our dilemma the enlightened technocrats not only have got it wrong but they have painted themselves into the corner of yet more austerity for the 60 and of throwing fiat money perhaps even helicopter money at economies already zombified by debt overload one expert peter schiff always expected this europe it seems then indeed is hovering at the cusp of debt induced recession and the central bankers have no response but to speak about the first recession in 26 years is also to speak about a europe where the youngest generation has no experience no concept of what a recession is really like what does that imply grant williams founder of the influential financial real vision television gives one answer here williams discourse intersects with fukuyama s attenuated homo economicus what happens when the latter guided now solely by the rituals of consumption in a world of civic putrefaction and cultural torpor williams responds simply europe fails
extreme weather variations and increasingly dire scientific reports have spurred surprisingly robust policy proposals for a green new deal rather admirably the resolution sponsored by sen ed markey d ma and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny marks a significant break from the usual small ball incrementalist approach to politics adopted in d c reflecting the increasingly prevailing view that the next decade or two is make or break for planet earth the sheer scale of the ambitious proposal net zero greenhouse gas emissions clean air and water married to traditional bread and butter progressive issues such as a job guarantee and universal health care have led to two predictable lines of attack the first is that the program represents full on socialism a grab bag of the left s favorite policies with everything from universal health care to a job guarantee draped under the mantle of environmentalism as a recent new york times opinion piece explains the second issue is how we are going to pay for it given that the proposed green new deal resolution envisages costs that will run into the trillions to undertake this whole restructuring of the u s economy shorn of ideological rhetoric the answer to the second question is actually quite simple we pay for these specific proposals much as we do with any government initiative congress appropriates the funds and the government literally spends the money into existence the key point here is that when a government issues a currency that is not backed by any metal or pegged to another currency i e the currency is created via government order or fiat hence the term fiat currency then there is no reason why it should be constrained in its ability to finance its spending by issuing currency in the way it was say under a gold standard in which the supply of gold held by each nation literally controlled its capacity to spend by extension taxes don t actually fund the government so much as they constrain overall expenditures in the economy in essence government spending adds new money to the economy whereas the imposition of taxes takes some of that money out again the constant addition and subtraction of these spending and taxing activities is how fiscal policy actually works and the sequencing is actually the opposite of what is traditionally taught in most economics textbooks likewise as the monopoly issuer of the currency the u s government via the federal reserve establishes the rates at which we borrow not the market it therefore follows that a sovereign currency issuing government unlike a private company does not have market based costs of capital that set the opportunity cost of their activities this is important to remember when you hear politicians outlining how certain policy goals are somehow constrained by borrowing costs or a particular discount rate this is also why private sector concepts such as internal rates of return irr or return on equity roe are only relevant in macroeconomic policy terms to the extent that the appropriated capital is used as productively as possible to mitigate possible inflationary pressures as opposed to whether this spending ultimately generates a profit or loss for the government to put it another way even if the government s balance sheet is adversely affected by poorly conceived and executed policy choices these mistakes have no bearing on whether the united states as the currency issuer has the fiscal capacity to meet any future crisis in contrast to a private firm which can t afford to misuse its finite capital resources lest cumulative losses drive it out of business as such costs and benefits must be measured largely in social terms rather than financial terms even as we acknowledge that the damage to gdp from the negative effects of climate change can be substantial note that although there is no financial constraint on the ability of a sovereign nation to deficit spend this does not mean that there are no real resource constraints on government spending this is the real concern that should guide policy not financial constraints if government spending pushes the economy beyond full capacity inflation will result a government can create all of the currency it likes but there are finite supplies of natural resources labor and other productive assets that form the backbone of an economy put another way money is not scarce but real resources can be so if government spending does not add to the economy s productive capacity then excessive expenditures will almost certainly become inflationary and that does represent a legitimate constraint that is why the main focus of the green new deal should be on how the money is spent rather than how the program is to be funded so in assessing how appropriated funds under a green new deal are spent the decarbonization of the u s economy must be constructed with a view toward other broad social goals which is why the markey ocasio cortez resolution incorporates so many additional features that at first glance do not deal solely with environmental issues a complaint recently made by speaker nancy pelosi a job guarantee for example must be a germane consideration in contemplating a substantial reduction and ultimately a full on elimination of the fossil fuels industry this not only means the hundreds of thousands of workers actually involved in the extraction production and distribution of oil gas coal etc but also the administrative and support jobs connected to these industries and the communities adversely impacted by the resultant job losses to give some idea of the scale of potential jobs at risk here a recent u s energy and employment report from 2017 estimates that there are about 2 3 million jobs in transmission distribution and storage with approximately 982 000 working in retail trade gasoline stations and fuel dealers and another 830 000 working across utilities and construction it is virtually impossible to contemplate the implementation of a green new deal if it is not accompanied holistically by policies that address the potential job disruption we don t want to have this debate framed yet again within the sterile paradigm of jobs vs environment which is a political non starter the canadian labor congress among others has enumerated a number of possible jobs to which the displaced workers could transition these jobs would include the retrofitting of buildings for energy conservation the retraining of workers to become energy auditors developing renewable energy sources promoting sustainable transport systems supporting community based sustainable industries community revitalization projects moving towards a complete waste recycling program and creating a publicly owned infrastructure that will manage in the public good there s no question that a properly revived manufacturing sector would also lead to a revived working and middle class because as the economist seymour melman explained high skill manufacturing leads to a process of economic growth that gives workers more power economically and within the firm even with mechanization and automation to be sure historically manufacturing has often been associated with dirty industries according to jon rynn a fellow at the cuny institute of urban systems emissions from manufacturing account for about 28 percent of greenhouse gas emissions once the electrical system is renewable however a substantial amount of these emissions is eliminated because almost all industrial machinery uses electricity so if the electricity is clean manufacturing can expand without worsening the climate problem needless to say this will require significant investments in energy efficiency alongside rapid decarbonization of power sources for as much of the economy as possible the broader question of inequality must also be tackled we live in a world where things are interdependent hence the whole concept of a just transition to an environmentally sustainable economy can only be adequately addressed when it is wrapped in a broader set of policies designed to help most americans which raises distributional questions that are part of the broader problem of today s highly unequal economy as the economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman have documented tax data in the united states illustrates that top 0 1 percent now hold 22 percent of the total wealth in the united states the same amount as the bottom 90 percent this takes us back to levels of economic distribution that existed more than 100 years ago when we barely had cars unions were virtually non existent and social welfare provision was minuscule simply believing that creating a whole bunch of clean tech jobs in and of itself will resolve this problem is disingenuous which is why the markey ocasio cortez resolution specifically addresses the broader issue of economic inequality failure to address the inequality question exacerbates the inflationary problem because when increasing amounts of gdp are directed toward those with the highest savings propensities i e the 1 percent it means that the economy doesn t grow as efficiently this matters when we are addressing a genuine national emergency such as climate change as opposed to the faux national emergency related to trump s southern border wall the scale of the spending shouldn t scare people at 2 trillion a year that s around 10 percent of a 20 trillion economy put another way the american government has spent greater sums in its afghanistan and iraq wars with no lasting productive benefit accruing to the u s economy to say nothing of the social costs and global environmental degradation by way of comparison as jon rynn writes the federal government paid for most of the machinery used to create the military equipment during world war ii and the corporations bought the factories for pennies on the dollar after the war ended to put it another way the federal government did not record a profit on the sale of these assets but the return came in the form of much of the industrial machinery that was the basis for the shared prosperity of the post wwii boom a period of unparalleled shared prosperity emphasis added for the united states we have to make choices but the idea that we can t make the right choices based on funding concerns is ridiculous however the policy goal embodied in the green new deal must be part of a broader policy framework much as franklin delano roosevelt ultimately conceived of his economic bill of rights which featured a government funded health care provision as an extension of the original new deal after all the green new deal is as much about enhancing human capital that is increasing the wealth generating capability of people as it is about physical capital the machinery and systems that are physical in nature speaking about one without the other is as misconceived as speaking about a tree outside the context of the forest in which it grows remember that the next time someone dismisses the green new deal as a grab bag of policies designed to ensure a communist style capture of the commanding heights of the economy

performance anaconda produced an annual record of 20 149 ounces of gold in 2018 exceeding original production guidance of 18 000 ounces by 12 as a result of higher grades from mining at the bottom of the pine cove pit higher ore production than planned from the higher grade stog er tight mine and record mill throughput and recovery rates the pine cove mill processing facility remains a cornerstone asset of the company achieving a record annual throughput of 461 439 tonnes and also achieving a record quarterly throughput in q2 2018 of 121 299 tonnes representing a rate of 1 350 tonnes per day tpd the company continues to invest in the pine cove mill making upgrades to the regrind motor and jaw and cone crushers while continuing to maintain consistent throughput from its crushed ore stockpiles average grade during 2018 was 1 56 g t an increase of 18 over the previous fiscal year ended december 31 2017 due to a greater proportion of mill feed from stog er tight relative to ore stockpiled from the pine cove pit the mill achieved an annual record average recovery rate of 86 7 during the 2018 year reflecting the impact of the higher grade feed from stog er tight the combination of higher throughput grade and recoveries led to record quarterly and annual gold production financial performance during 2018 anaconda sold 19 290 ounces at an average realized gold price of c 1 638 to generate total revenue of 31 7 million which included 100 092 from the sale of waste rock as aggregate as at december 31 2018 the company also had over 860 ounces of gold doré which were sold in early january operating expenses for 2018 which include mining processing and mine support costs were 18 626 974 compared to 9 516 731 for the seven month period ended december 31 2017 and 17 525 386 for the year ended may 31 2017 on a per ounce sold basis operating cash costs were 978 us 755 achieving the company s annual 2018 guidance of under 1 000 operating cash costs for the seven months ended december 31 2017 were 914 per ounce sold which was positively impacted by higher by product aggregate sales during the period operating expenses in 2018 also included a royalty expense of 366 248 on production from stog er tight which carries a 3 net smelter return royalty depletion and depreciation was 6 832 877 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 4 248 742 for the seven month period ended december 31 2017 and 7 262 083 for the year ended may 31 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 the company reviewed the residual values of certain buildings machinery and equipment at the pine cove mill the updated estimated residual values reduced the depreciation charges by approximately 413 000 for the year ended december 31 2018 on an annualized basis the depletion and depreciation was consistent given the updated estimated residual values with generally higher depletion and depreciation over the past three fiscal periods as a result of the higher gold ounces sold which drove higher units of production depreciation mine operating income for the year ended december 31 2018 was 5 905 037 compared to 2 404 303 for the seven months ended december 31 2017 and 1 844 297 for the year ended may 31 2017 the comparative higher mine operating income was attributable to higher gold sales combined with higher productivity in both the mine and mill operations resulting in higher throughput grades and recovery at similar or lower unit costs corporate administration costs in 2018 were 4 025 435 with higher comparative expenditures reflecting the expanded senior management team to execute the company s growth plans and greater market presence and investor relations activity particularly since the acquisition of goldboro the company also incurred research and development costs of 514 609 in the year ended december 31 2018 relating to the narrow vein mining project announced in june 2017 and other research and development projects share based compensation was 544 560 during the year compared to 131 676 and 181 225 in the comparative fiscal years reflecting the stock options granted during 2018 as well as the impact of the share consolidation on the fair value of the options as determined by the black scholes option pricing model the drawdown of the deferred premium on flow through shares resulted in a recovery of 253 535 in the year ended december 31 2018 as the remaining exploration commitments from the october 31 2017 flow through financing were incurred in the first half of 2018 the company also recognized a write down of exploration and evaluation costs of 240 836 relating to the anaroc prospect which did not encounter significant assays to justify further exploration work at this time net loss for the year ended december 31 2018 was 1 693 413 or 0 01 per share compared to net income for the seven month period ended december 31 2017 of 904 635 or 0 01 per share the comparative period was positively impacted by a deferred income tax recovery of 1 569 000 while net loss for the year ended december 31 2018 reflected a deferred income tax expense of 617 000 relating to the use of tax loss pools and the inclusion of 854 131 in transaction costs related to the takeover bid of maritime the company also recognized a current income tax expense of 1 007 445 at december 31 2018 reflecting the company s estimate of newfoundland and labrador mining taxes payable based on results for the year review of fourth quarter results operational performance anaconda produced 6 125 ounces of gold during the fourth quarter of 2018 and had 860 ounces of gold doré in finished goods at year end the pine cove mill processed 110 547 tonnes of ore during the quarter at a throughput rate of 1 282 tonnes per operating day compared to 1 299 tonnes per day during the four months ended december 31 2017 mill recovery of 89 1 was a 5 improvement over the comparative period while average grade of 1 93 g t for the three months ended december 31 2018 was 50 higher than the four months ended december 31 2017 reflecting the higher grade ore being mined from stog er tight relative to the pine cove pit which was the main ore feed in the comparative period mine production of 99 998 tonnes of ore was significantly lower than the 223 254 tonnes of ore mined during the four months ended december 31 2017 notwithstanding the shorter period due to the lower tonnage profile of the stog er tight mine and the higher relative strip ratio during q4 2018 compared to the comparative period when ore was being sourced from the lower levels of the pine cove mine financial performance during q4 2018 the company generated 9 754 517 in metal revenue at an average gold sales price of approximately 1 594 per ounce gold revenue was 26 higher compared to the four months ended december 31 2017 despite a shorter period due to 28 higher gold ounces sold operating expenses were 6 215 098 during q4 2018 equivalent to 1 063 per ounce sold us 805 compared to operating expenses of 4 479 599 for the four months ended december 31 2017 the significant change is due to the inventory adjustment of 1 029 382 during q4 2018 as the company drew down on its stockpiles and gold in circuit inventory during the quarter compared to a negative inventory adjustment of 1 679 826 in the comparative period when the company was building a stockpile from the pine cove mine mine operating income for q4 2018 was 1 268 409 compared to 1 586 721 for the four months ended december 31 2017 the comparatively lower mine operating income in the most recent period besides being a shorter period reflects a royalty expense of 295 803 relating to a 3 net smelter return royalty on stog er tight production there was no royalty expense in the comparative period when the company was still processing ore from the pine cove pit net loss for the three months ended december 31 2018 was 356 333 or 0 00 per share compared to net income for the four months ended december 31 2017 of 1 228 668 or 0 01 per share the comparative period reflected higher relative revenue from the sale of waste rock and a deferred tax recovery of 1 243 000 which was partially offset by lower comparative corporate administration costs net income in q4 2018 also reflects a 240 839 write down of exploration and evaluation assets non ifrs measures anaconda has included in this press release certain non ifrs performance measures as detailed below in the gold mining industry these are common performance measures but may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs certain investors use this information to evaluate the company s performance and ability to generate cash flow accordingly it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs operating cash costs per ounce of gold anaconda calculates operating cash costs per ounce by dividing operating expenses per the consolidated statement of operations net of silver sales by product revenue by the gold ounces sold during the applicable period operating expenses include mine site operating costs such as mining processing and administration as well as royalties however excludes depletion and depreciation and rehabilitation costs all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold anaconda has adopted an all in sustaining cost performance measure that reflects all of the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from current operations while there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry the company s definition conforms to the all in sustaining cost definition as set out by the world gold council in its guidance dated june 27 2013 the world gold council is a non regulatory non profit organization established in 1987 whose members include global senior mining companies the company believes that this measure will be useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the ability to generate free cash flow from current operations the company defines all in sustaining costs as the sum of operating cash costs per above sustaining capital capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels corporate administration costs sustaining exploration and rehabilitation accretion and amortization related to current operations all in sustaining costs excludes capital expenditures for significant improvements at existing operations deemed to be expansionary in nature exploration and evaluation related to growth projects financing costs debt repayments and taxes canadian and us dollars are noted for realized gold price operating cash costs per ounce of gold and all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold both currencies are considered relevant and the company uses the average foreign exchange rate for the period average realized gold price per ounce sold in the gold mining industry average realized gold price per ounce sold is a common performance measure that does not have any standardized meaning the most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with ifrs is gold revenue the measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the revenue

at first glance it would appear that federal reserve chairman jerome powell stuck to the script in prepared testimony to the senate banking committee by saying a healthy u s economy has faced some crosscurrents and conflicting signals although that s nothing he hasn t said before there was still something potentially significant for markets in powell s delivery in describing those crosscurrents the first thing powell highlighted was how financial markets became more volatile at the end of last year and how financial conditions are now less supportive of growth he then talked about economic fundamentals and how growth has slowed in some major foreign economies particularly china and europe mentioning financial markets before the economy is as clear a signal as any that the fed s top priority is preventing another plunge in the stock market like the one in december which many suspected was the real reason the fed officially pivoted toward a more dovish stance in january keeping asset prices elevated is officially the 3 mandate of the federal reserve bleakley financial group chief investment officer peter boockvar wrote in a note to clients the fed s first two mandates are full employment and stable consumer prices in that context powell s testimony should only further cement the idea of a fed put that underpins riskier assets in that context it s little wonder that the s p 500 index which was down as much as 0 24 percent rebounded to rise as much as 0 25 percent before ending the day little changed in the face of lower earnings and growth forecasts
u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey are calling for a green new deal that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as us 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment program s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what a green new deal may cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments like the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp to me seems about right as the best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the u s would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually how to pay for the green new deal as for paying for it the first thing to bear in mind is that in my view a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the u s borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 21 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises consumers do not spend and private investment is down when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the u s would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the u s roughly in the middle among countries that currently impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an additional 72 billion a year cost savings but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms would also help lower the costs in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs a good illustration is purchases of electric vehicles which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by ocasio cortez and markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it

but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it could ultimately determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it edward b barbier is a professor in the department of economics

that forecast added weight to powell s repetition that the fed will be patient before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the longer run goal of 2 percent for a time he said in semi annual testimony before the us senate banking committee the us central bank increased the key policy interest rate four times last year but rising uncertainty especially around the us trade confrontation with china amplified concerns about slowing global growth and fears the fed was moving too aggressively that prompted the fed to signal clearly for the past several weeks that it would tread carefully and many economists now do not expect any increase this year while a few say the next move could be a cut if the economy slows further noting the fed s preferred annual inflation measure sits at 1 7 percent powell said the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook he remained upbeat about the economic outlook saying fed officials generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market to remain strong mmt ish but not really fiscal policy gross spending taxes their residual net deficits shd be pushing us toward into inflation territory but not too far where resources r fully employed mon policy should b responsible for pushing back against excessive inflation steve roth asymptosis february 26 2019 however he acknowledged that over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals including slower growth in major economies especially china and europe and uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues including brexit and ongoing trade negotiations he cautioned we will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve the united states and china have hammered each other with punitive tariffs on more than 360 billion in two way trade raising prices to producers and consumers and undercutting economic growth the international monetary fund cites the trade war between the world s two largest economies as a major risk to global growth and cut their growth forecast for this year but president donald trump on monday said he expected to hold a signing summit soon with china s leader xi jinping to resolve the issue and he pushed back the march 1 deadline which would have triggered tariffs to more than double on 200 billion in chinese exports in the us economy low inflation and sluggish wage growth despite net job gains that averaged 223 000 last year and gdp gaining just under three percent has continued to baffle economists and the fed powell noted some signs of stronger wage growth particularly in lower skilled jobs but also said to disparities persist in the labor market along racial and ethnic lines and also between rural and urban workers longer run trends such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes also remain important challenges he said and he once again noted that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path us government debt has reached a record 22 trillion more stories

another solid quarter of performance q4 net revenue increased 10 6 we opened 16 stores in q4 which resulted in 74 new stores opened for the year we ended the year with 1 082 stores or 6 8 growth q4 represented our 68th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales growth this streak has continued for 17 years we are quite proud of the consistency of this track record adjusted comparable store growth in q4 was up 2 9 the growth was led by our growth brands with a 5 9 increase at america s best and 2 3 at eyeglass world for the year comps at america s best and eyeglass world were up 7 2 and 6 8 respectively adjusted ebitda increased 16 3 and adjusted net income improved 4 4 million swinging to a positive 1 million another sign of customer satisfaction and ambassadorship is our net promoter scores which we track closely the annual nps at all our brands increased to record levels this year since year end we ve also had two noteworthy achievements that occurred in january first we opened our fourth domestic optical lab this one in plano texas this state of the art lens manufacturing facility further positions national vision to meet the expanding optical needs of consumers second s p upgraded the debt credit rating on national vision to double b minus turning to slide five 2018 was again filled with a number of highlights at national vision we expanded our footprint increased market share and continue to reinvest in our business for future growth the optical retail market remains highly fragmented and we continue to see a large opportunity in front of us we re pleased to be driving profitable current growth while at the same time reinvesting for sustainable long term growth and market share gains our partnerships grew stronger as we signed a multi year lens supply agreement with essilor and expanded our contact lens distribution relationship with walmart the first expansion of our overall walmart relationship since 2013 america s best celebrated its 40th anniversary of delivering excellent value to cost conscious american patients and customers our advertising progressed forward with continued positive response to the owl campaign at america s best and the successful new mr world campaign at eyeglass world our merchandising team continued to deliver assortments that exceed customer expectations yet at great values another example of this was our rollout of the oakley brand to america s best stores we re proud of the service that we provide patients and customers in our stores in addition to our record nps scores eyeglass world received well deserved notice for america s best customer service in an independent newsweek survey of consumers we continue to enhance our balance sheet as we refinanced 200 million worth of our credit agreement moody s acknowledged our progress with a credit rating upgrade we strengthened our board of directors with the addition of two independent board members virginia hepner and tom taylor who have provided valuable insights during 2018 we also made large strides in our social mission with advancements in america s best our boys girls clubs partnership and a successful pilot of a new program for eyeglass world turning to slide six it was another quarter of positive comps further demonstrating the consistency in store performance and comp store sales gains this graph highlights our 68 quarters of comparable store sales growth across the economic cycle during both strong and weak economic times as you can see our comps can fluctuate quarter to quarter but it s been consistent over longer periods of time which we believe is one of the nice benefits of our purchase tied to a medical necessity this quarter comps were primarily driven by an increase in average ticket as well as a slight increase in transaction as we ve stated on past calls our comps have historically been driven by increases in customer transaction we believe that the unique calendar in the fourth quarter impacted transaction count more specifically the fourth quarter of 2018 had one less selling day in the high volume final week when customer traffic related to vision insurance is typically quite strong this had a significantly negative impact on the number of customer transactions compared to last year also our transaction count was negatively impacted by five stores that were closed for most of the quarter as a result of severe weather importantly comps at america s best were more evenly driven by increases in transactions and average ticket with eyeglass comps driven primarily by increases in transactions as we prefer we were less pleased with the performance of our legacy and host brands these brands faced difficult comp comparisons from last year s robust performance having said that we re working hard to deliver improvement in 2019 overall our consistent positive comp results highlight the benefits of operating in a growing segment of an attractive industry having the leadership team of optical experts new store growth as well as comparable store sales growth in our more mature stores as customers keep coming back with our double digit sales growth in 2018 we continue to believe that we are gaining share in this attractive 35 billion optical retail market with our value oriented business model our highly experienced management team continues to focus on execution every day one patient and one customer at a time turning to slide seven we see a path to continued growth and market share gains at the end of 2018 we believe that we were the third largest optical retailer in the us and among the fastest growing in 2019 we look to continue to execute on our core drivers of growth first new stores our primary focus as we continue to see a sizable wide space opportunity given the size of our current footprint we plan to open about 75 stores again this year following the formula based approach that has worked well for us we have a solid pipeline of locations for this year and into 2020 the majority of our openings will continue to be in the america s best brand with the remainder in eyeglass world a key to our ongoing success is our ability to attract and retain optometrists we are an optometrist centric company and want to be the place of choice for optometrists whether it be new graduates paying off their student loans or experienced optometrists looking for the ability to focus on pure optometry without the many burdens of running their own stores this means having programs in place to help optometrists succeed such as enhanced onboarding mentorships and start strong training for optometric technician and receptionists our efforts are paying off as we experience an improved optometrist retention rate in 2018 in fact our optometrist retention rate was the best since we began tracking it six years ago second we look to continue to focus on driving comparable store sales growth in 2019 our key comp drivers are the comp waterfall for maturing new stores as well as our marketing and vision insurance initiative our new stores gain traction as customer awareness grows over the first few years we believe that our low prices and excellent customer service are important to our core customers and drive traffic to our stores we want to be known as the low cost provider of this medical necessity we strive to ensure that our customer gets the best value around and we believe that our growth brands deliver extreme value two pairs of eyeglasses for 69 95 including a free comprehensive eye exam at america s best or two pairs of glasses for 78 at eyeglass world we believe that this leaves the satisfied repeat customers and positive word of mouth as customers tell their friends how little they spent and the great service they received at our store existing customers represented 64 of total customers at mature stores in 2018 we continue to invest in television advertising and digital marketing to attract new customers as well as remind existing customers to come back for another great experience our owl tv campaign for america s best and the mr world campaign for eyeglass world are helping to drive traffic to our stores our marketing team and external advertising agency continue to come up with catchy new versions of our advertising campaign our owl campaign has played for years and continues to resonate and remind consumers that they pay too much if they didn t shop at america s best the awareness and effectiveness of our owl advertising continued to increase in 2018 we frequently hear our customers say how much they like the owl and our ad we believe that our investments in marketing are paying off and a factor in our market share gains participation in vision insurance programs remains a positive comp driver net revenue growth tied to these partnerships continue to advance in the fourth quarter and 2018 we remain underpenetrated relative to the industry for the percentage of our business coming from vision insurance net revenue tied to vision insurance while fast growing remains a minority of our revenue operationally we continue to progress key initiatives to support our growth and drive operating efficiencies we re pleased with the opening of our new state of the art eyeglass lab in texas last month this new facility allows us to better support all of our brands in meeting the ever expanding optical needs of our customers both today and into the future we believe our centralized lab network is a world class manufacturing operation that provides a true competitive cost advantage toward being a low cost provider we can t be everyday low price without being everyday low cost and our labs are a key reason we re everyday low cost we continue to progress our omni channel efforts to improve the customer experience and operating efficiency one of our key initiatives has been the online and mobile scheduling of eye exam which continues to trend higher as we ve noted on past calls we continue to closely monitor the tariff situation our exposure to tariffs on imports from china that have already been imposed which is limited to eyeglass cases is not expected to have a material impact on our overall product cost we estimate that less than 15 of our total cost applicable to revenue are related to products imported from china and potentially subject to future tariffs we continue to review our contingency options to mitigate the impact in the event that additional tariffs are enacted i d like to comment briefly on the management realignment that took place earlier this quarter in january we had announced that jeff mcallister was transitioning from his position as coo and is continuing his relationship with the company in a new position as special advisor to the board the change in jeff s position was prompted by jeff and the company reorganizing in a way that modified the current role and responsibilities of the coo jeff has agreed to serve in the special advisory capacity through the end of 2020 and i have assumed many of the coo responsibilities separately in q4 we eliminated our svp position by consolidating our brand leadership which streamlines our operations let me hand the call now over to pat patrick r moore chief financial officer thanks reade and good morning everyone my remarks begin on slide nine as reade noted our business continues to perform well in the fourth quarter the two fundamental revenue drivers of our business are new store growth and comparable store sales growth during the quarter we opened 16 new stores and closed one store for the year we opened 74 stores and closed five locations or a 6 8 year over year increase in unit growth with the openings entirely in our america s best and eyeglass world brands for these two growth brands combined unit growth increased 10 1 in the quarter our 2018 openings were balanced between newer and existing markets in our newer markets we continue to expand our store base and invest where our new stores are still ramping and building awareness we note that the majority of our new stores have historically taken approximately three years to five years to mature and pay back invested capital we re excited about these newer markets and see a lot of our potential competitors there the chart of adjusted comparable store sales growth presents our comps calculated on a cash basis same store sales increased 2 9 versus the 10 4 increase in the fourth quarter last year as reade mentioned five stores were closed for much of the fourth quarter due to weather events which hurt comparable store sales growth by about 40 basis points as of today two of the stores remain closed the comp growth was driven primarily by an increase in average ticket with a slight increase in transactions customer transactions were negatively impacted by the one less selling day in the final week of the year as well as the impact from closed stores importantly comps for america s best were driven by increases in customer transactions and average ticket and eyeglass comps were primarily driven by increases in transactions during the fourth quarter we generated solid comps in our growth brands compared to strong comparisons in last year s fourth quarter america s best and eyeglass world generated gains of 5 9 and 2 3 respectively legacy comps declined 5 6 in the fourth quarter the brand faced a robust 5 5 comp comparison for the fourth quarter of 2017 which was its strongest comp in almost three years on a two year stack legacy comps were relatively flat turning to income statement highlights on slide 10 as a result of the sold comp and unit growth net revenue increased 10 6 to 355 9 million revenue growth was positively impacted by about 70 basis points due to the timing of unearned revenue net revenue included over 9 million from the expanded contact lens distribution relationship with walmart which benefited revenue growth by approximately 290 basis points but had a minimal contribution to profitability this line of business is one element of our larger 29 year walmart relationship cost applicable to revenue increased 13 8 or an increase of 130 basis points as a percentage of net revenue versus last year the increase was driven by the impact from this expanded contact lens distribution relationship with walmart cost app cost to pick applicable to revenue before the impact of the newer walmart business was unchanged as a percentage of net revenue versus last year in the quarter we experienced higher optometrist costs that were partially offset by a higher mix of eye exam sales as a result of our growing managed care business optometrist related expenses reflect expanded coverage as well as wage inflation in certain geographic markets for our doctors we pay competitive salaries for the good work that they do as reade noted we work very hard to attract and retain optometrists and compensation is an important part of this equation and our approved improved retention rate sg a expenses increased 8 8 or a decrease of 80 basis points from a percentage of net revenue versus last year this decrease was driven by the impact of the expanded contact lens distribution relationship which benefited sg a expenses by 120 basis points as a percentage of net revenue higher stock compensation and long term incentive expenses as well as the support of the citizens initiative in oklahoma were partially offset by ipo related sponsor fees paid last year and lower write offs with managed care receivables this year adjusted ebitda increased 16 3 and adjusted ebitda margin rose 40 basis points to 8 1 in the quarter adjusted ebitda growth benefited by 660 basis points from the net change in margin on unearned revenue we expect that this timing benefit would reverse to some extent in the first quarter depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 4 compared to the fourth quarter last year the growth primarily reflects our ongoing investments in new stores including the impact of capital leases our network of optical laboratories and our omni channel related investments interest expense decreased 5 4 million versus the fourth quarter of last year primarily due to a decrease in deferred debt cost amortization as well as lower debt levels both of which resulted from the 360 million ipo debt pay down in the fourth quarter of 2017 in terms of taxes we recorded a 10 million income tax benefit this quarter compared to a 47 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 this reflected a 7 5 benefit from stock option exercises this year and a one time 42 million benefit last year associated with the new tax legislation we project our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 26 excluding the impact of stock option exercises adjusted net income increased 4 4 million to a profit of 1 million and excluded the income tax benefit from the option exercises adjusted diluted eps of 0 01 swung to a profit compared to the adjusted diluted loss of 0 05 per share last year turning to slide 11 and our full year results our adjusted comparable store sales growth was 5 7 net revenues were up almost 12 and adjusted ebitda increased over 10 this performance highlights the consistency of our business over time adjusted ebitda margin decreased 20 basis points to 11 3 this reduction reflects the impact of the expanded walmart contact lens business and higher public company expenses partially offset by the benefit from the net change in margin on unearned revenue we re pleased to have delivered relatively stable margins in 2018 as we have continued to reinvest some margin gains into the business we believe these investments such as advertising optometrists related programs and omni channel capabilities will help drive continued consistent top line growth and market share gains over the longer term on slide 12 at the end of the fourth quarter our total debt was 578 million and our cash balance was 17 million net debt to adjusted ebitda was 3 2 times we were pleased to receive the corporate credit rating upgrade to ba3 from moody s in september which lowered the interest rate on our term loan debt by 25 basis points in addition during the quarter we completed a 200 million term loan a loan refinancing which lowered the interest rate on that tranche by 75 basis points from the existing loan rate in january of 2019 s p raised our corporate credit rating to double b minus which triggered a provision that lowered interest rate on our new term loan a loan by an additional 25 basis points we re very pleased with the improvements to our borrowing costs for the year we invested 104 million in capital expenditures in line with our outlook with the majority of the capex focused on growth initiatives including our new texas lab turning to slide 13 now i ll conclude with some commentary regarding our 2019 outlook which we included in today s earnings release our 2019 outlook is as follows net revenues of 1 675 billion to 1 705 billion adjusted comparable store sales growth in the range of 3 to 5 opening approximately 75 new stores adjusted ebitda between 186 million and 191 million and adjusted net income between 53 5 million and 56 5 million we project another year our 18th consecutive year of positive same store sales growth in 2019 it s important to remember that while we expect our growth brands to continue to perform well we will be facing challenging comparisons from the strong comp trend for the last four years especially at our america s best brand as a result we believe it is responsible to plan a business in the 3 to 5 comp range as reflected in our 2019 outlook store opening this year will continue to be predominantly america s best locations with the remainder being eyeglass world stores most of our store growth will be in existing markets and openings are expected to be skewed toward the first half of the year we project that these store closings as is typical each year we expect to generate 20 million to 25 million in incremental revenue from the expanded walmart contact lens distribution relationship which as noted would dampen our adjusted ebitda margin due to the minimal contribution to profitability for this line of business we estimate that our adjusted ebitda margin before the impact of this incremental walmart business to be relatively stable despite approximately 4 million in planned incremental investment in cyber security this year specifically the cyber security investment is estimated to have a negative impact of 20 basis points to adjusted ebitda margin as well as over 200 basis points to adjusted ebitda growth we re pleased to be delivering stable margins while making smart investment decisions that will drive future growth we expect depreciation and amortization of 88 million to 90 million or about 20 growth at the midpoint and similar to our growth rate in 2018 since 2015 we ve been investing at a high rate and increased new store growth labs and system improvements to support that growth and more recently enhanced omni channel capabilities given the depreciable lives of these investments g a growth should continue to outpace revenue growth over the next few years finally we estimate annual interest expense of 36 million to 37 million and capex between 100 million and 105 million or very similar to the 2018 level of investment as you can see from our guidance we expect another year of consistent growth driven by the underlying momentum in our business let me highlight a few other factors that will affect the p l in 2019 first the incremental contact lens distribution business with walmart will increase our cost applicable to revenue as a percentage of revenue and reduce our sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue before the impact of this walmart business we would expect generally stable margins in 2019 as a percentage of revenue we would expect cost applicable to revenue to trend flat to down and sg a to be flat to up slightly second cyber security is an enhanced focus this plan 4 million investment is a near term grow over pressure but it s an important investment to support the forward momentum of our business finally our new texas lab is a prime example of growth investments we re making today that we believe will drive future performance over time we expect to see benefits for our unit cost from this lab in 2019 as this lab ramps up we expect to see a modest drag to adjusted ebitda in the range of 1 million to 1 5 million and a similar amount of depreciation so the overall impact is a little heavier to adjusted net income in the range of 1 5 million to 2 million as we have indicated on prior calls we do not provide specific quarterly guidance however we do want to make sure that you take into account the expected impact of these items on quarter to quarter comparisons in 2019 we expect that certain items will impact adjusted ebitda in the first quarter collectively in the range of 7 million to 8 million the majority of the estimated impact of these items is timing related and tied to the net change in margin on unearned revenue as well as the timing of vendor rebates additionally we expect the impact from our investments in cyber security and our continued support of managed care growth but as you can see from our outlook we would expect solid adjusted ebitda growth over the remainder of the year as a reminder as we enter our peak selling season the timing of tax refunds is a variable that can affect our performance between our first and second quarters while our business can experience fluctuations quarter to quarter due to timing and other factors our business has delivered very consistent results on a semi annual to annual basis as of january 1 2019 we are adopting new lease accounting standards this new standard alters our accounting for operating leases as we are required to record a right to use asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet we estimate that adoption will result in additional assets and liabilities in the range of 325 million to 345 million with no material impact on our cash flows or profitability finally as noted in today s release and 10 k filing we made immaterial revisions to prior period financial statements related to lease accounting these revisions were non cash in nature and not related to business operation as you think about our 2019 outlook and how the impact of these revisions roll forward we would note that the projected impact to adjusted ebitda is in the vicinity of 2 million in summary we re very pleased with our consistent performance in 2018 we re focused on executing our 2019 growth initiatives and look forward to delivering another year of consistent growth at this point i will turn the call back over to reade reade fahs chief executive officer thank you patrick for our closing moment of mission i d like to share the work of the clear vision collective we have in the past shared that we partner with an ecosystem of businesses non governmental organizations social enterprises and governments the groups that impress us with their dedication and approaches to sustainably solving the problem of the lack of available affordable glasses for the world s poor starting a year and a half ago many of these groups began to form into something we call the clear vision collective and chose bangladesh as the ideal place for a variety of reasons for all of us to test working together in a coordinated manner in january we collectively launched a pilot project in the sherpur district of northern bangladesh with the hopes of proving a program that can someday expand to bangladesh s 165 million people we are working in partnership with visionspring essilor onesight which up until recently was luxottica s internal philanthropic arm restoring vision orbit frac ph and other and local governments and others we look forward to the possibility of sharing successful news of this collective action in the future i want to thank our entire team for their dedication to patient and customer happiness and their execution of our store formulas we strive to be the best business wise at providing low priced exam glasses and contact lenses while at home and abroad we work to bring glasses and consequently sight to those who would be unable to see well otherwise this concludes our prepared remarks i will turn the call back to the operator to start our q a session questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from paul lejuez with citigroup paul lejuez citigroup analyst hey thanks guys just curious if you can talk about gross margin and the core ab and eg business with just the moving parts on the walmart lens business so i m curious what s happening on the core and related to that have you seen the drag from optometrists cost get any less severe in the fourth quarter relative to prior quarters what do you assume for fy19 as it relates optometrists costs and i m just curious patrick free cash flow assumption for fy19 if you can provide that thanks reade fahs chief executive officer i missed the last paul i missed that last question say that in the third part paul lejuez citigroup analyst free cash flow for 2019 reade fahs chief executive officer okay so unpacking the gross margin if we take the new ac lens walmart contract contact lens distribution and put that to aside gross margins were generally flat in the core business if i look at kind of combined owned and host and legacy so most of the impact in the quarter was the new business mix inside of those two lines of business so a little better performance in owned and host and in general we ve got a higher od compensation from the for wage inflations we ve discussed and that is being offset to a degree by more paid eye exams as we continue to increase our managed care penetration so fairly stable margins in the core business mostly a function of mix in terms of od inflation pressures really that s trending about the same paul i haven t seen that really spike up or improve significantly so that s a little bit that s similar in terms of free cash flow will be i mean you have seen our ebitda guidance you have seen our capex guidance the bulk of that will go into new stores and continued growth and we ll be improving cash balances a little bit during the year paul lejuez citigroup analyst what should we expect on the inventory side just sort of a bit of a tick up in this quarter just curious how that might impact free cash flow reade fahs chief executive officer yeah that was a little out of the norm and it was very intentional as you re aware we ve kind of talked about the potential for china tariffs and that s very fluid we took some opportunistic forward buys in december in the event that could help us if those tariffs were to come into play if in this year so that was a little out of guardrails and it was a little bit of a defensive move so i would say that i wouldn t expect to see inventory levels be out of any normal ranges other than that forward buy as we think about 2019 david mann vice president investor relations nice benefit of a product that isn t a perishable you can buy ahead if you want to operator thank you our next question comes from robby ohmes with bank of america robby ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst hello hey guys good morning thanks for taking my question i was hoping reade and patrick maybe you could talk a little bit more about the comps i understand the tough comparisons but the comp guidance is below the long term average that you guys have been doing do you expect to sort of run a 3 to 5 this year and then maybe get back more in line with the mid single digit range and maybe more thoughts on how to think about that or are you just being conservative are there things you re doing that could drive some upside to that 3 to 5 forecast for this year and maybe roll into that you did launch those advertising campaigns it did so well are there is that going to grow this year or there are there a lot of initiatives that could drive upside there thanks reade fahs chief executive officer robbie i ll start and talk a little bit about our guidance philosophy on comps we used the 3 to 5 range this past year in 2018 you have again in 2019 we think that we think it s responsible for the business to be set up to perform well and profitably in that range that we exceed that range we get obviously flow through benefits to that but i don t know if i d call it conservative we think that you never quite know what degree of weather or hurricanes or events we re going to see and we like to provide a guidance range that we feel very confident in meeting and hopefully beating as we did in 2018 robby ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just a follow up question on the walmart on the legacy stores there any strategies to improve the performance there that you can call out reade fahs chief executive officer yeah we first of all in those brands in our host brands we had sort of a tough year of year over year comparisons last year our legacy business was up 5 5 comp points and that was our best comp since early 2015 and of course we did have that one less selling day that hurt us in 2018 but i think that there s opportunities to make the execution sharper in those areas and we ve put some adjustments in place to ensure that happens so and yeah so we ve made some changes and i think we re just going to be crisper than we were and of course it s also nice that we have such strong growth in our comp in our growth brands to offset that but robby ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks so much guys operator thank you our next question comes from simeon gutman with morgan stanley simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst hey guys good morning my first question is on margin expansion i d say more broadly thinking about 2019 and then maybe beyond curious if the business model should allow for it i m thinking big picture and should we just focus on dollar growth or have there been investments post ipo technology investments public company costs that roll off that do allow this business model to look to get leverage over time patrick r moore chief financial officer good morning simeon i ll take that question so as i think about 2018 and 2019 combined the company has maintained relatively stable core margins while continuing to make good investments to drive future growth as you mentioned this kind of puts the new capital grow over aside and the business mix implications of walmart so as we drill into the own and host and legacy where the bulk of the profit dollars where our margins have been relatively stable we ve done that while investing we ve increased our degree of advertising spend to drive traffic and build new market awareness we are rolling out a new better recruiting retention programs for our optometrists we ve met market wage levels for managed care we discussed last year supporting this important component of growth and as i ve remarked in my comments earlier we ve just built a very new state of the art domestic lab so those stable margins have been in place as we ve been investing relatively heavily we ve also managed through some degree of general wage inflation then i think most retailers have seen we re focused on smart ways to reduce costs without affecting our track record of strong consistent comp growth i do think that each time we invest in a lab we get unit cost efficiencies out of that i would continue to expect to see those i would expect to see us leverage corporate costs and even advertising where we earn national advertising for ab so i m not ready to define this as a specific margin expansion story as i ve said before that i do feel like spending relating the right foundation for that simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst okay that s helpful my next question my follow up is for reade i wanted to ask about the coo position can you talk about the rationale when it was created what was the role envisioned how will those responsibilities get done and look i think we all know it shouldn t be a commentary on walmart so rather than answer that maybe can you talk about anything new with regard to expanding that relationship reade fahs chief executive officer good i ll well ph i ll take the second part first again we have that expansion of the contact lens distribution business last year with walmart we re always focused on being a great partner with them and we re in touch with them frequently on a variety of topics and we feel the relationship remains quite strong there s been no change in that relationship recently nor did the change in the coo position reflect anything about our walmart relationship the change was prompted by jeff and the company sort of reorganizing in a way that modified the role and jeff has agreed to serve in an advisory capacity through the end of next year and i m taking many of his roles and dividing up other pieces within the group we are a very highly experienced team of folks who have been here consistently for a long time all sort of optical folks so we re not expecting sort of a big business interruption there and i m not going anywhere but i ll have my 17th anniversary with the company so yeah simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst okay thanks reade good luck next year reade fahs chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matthew mcclintock with barclays matthew mcclintock barclays analyst hi yes good morning everyone reade i was wondering with all the noise out there in the press regarding a delay in tax refunds are you seeing any issues or any challenges that your business is facing right now or do you expect to have any near term pressure from that thanks that s my first question reade fahs chief executive officer yeah okay and so we don t talk about an intra quarter events and we don t like to talk about that what you re talking about q4 not about q1 where we are in optics is we are currently entering sort of our key selling season this is this for optics is like the middle of december for most other retailers and tax refunds are an important part to the q1 q2 selling season it is early our core customer is just now starting to get their tax refund dollars so it s really hard to comment in any way on that but were a purchase tied to a medical necessity your eyes go bad you need to fix it to be able to get by in life and we provide great values out there so we re still sort of seeing how the cards play in q1 and q2 on the tax refund a bit but not much i can really share now matthew mcclintock barclays analyst i appreciate the color that you did that you could provide so thank you for that my second question is just patrick in terms of the d a elevated d a spend over the next couple of years i think is the comment that you said i think this year did the increase in d a accounts for most if not all of your adjusted ebitda growth should we expect that relationship to stay over the next couple of years as well patrick r moore chief financial officer in terms of d a as i remarked on the phone back in 2015 the company moved from building 40 to 50 stores per year to about 75 per year and we re still in the process and flow of those build out that have capital lives depreciation lives that stretch out longer than five years so we are seeing d a growth outpace revenue growth and we expect to see that for a bit we re pleased with the investments we re making we re pleased with kind of new store acceleration we re pleased with the market share that we re getting out of that we re getting the right returns that we are in somewhat of an investment cycle that should normalize in the next couple of years as those depreciation rates fall off matthew mcclintock barclays analyst thank you very much for the color reade fahs chief executive officer sure operator thank you our next question comes from stephanie wissink with jefferies ashley elizabeth helgans jefferies llc analyst hi this is ashley helgans on for steph wissink thanks for taking our question when we reconciled your net income guidance to ebit and imply something distinct is going on with the tax rate is that related to stock comp any clarity around that would be appreciated thanks patrick r moore chief financial officer yes we ve seen some pretty substantial swings in stock comp in 2017 and then in 2018 i think the number i used earlier was about 7 5 million of impact so the go forward tax rate is expected to be right there on top of 26 excluding any future noise around stock compensation and happy to unpack that in more detail if that would be helpful a little later as well ashley elizabeth helgans jefferies llc analyst all right yeah we will follow up after thank you reade fahs chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from bob drbul with guggenheim bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst hi good morning just a couple of questions on as you continue to invest in advertising can you talk about an updated view on where you are in terms like household income levels and your customer base and are you getting a newer higher income customer into your stores do you think and i guess the second piece of that is you mentioned the addition of the oakley brand can you just give us an update on the good better best mix in terms of the product on the glasses on the frames and sort of where that s trending as well thank you reade fahs chief executive officer yeah so i d say the summary to both those is things are staying pretty consistent so we are not seeing a significant change in the demographics of our customers we re still going to it s still a big target that cost conscious budget conscious american consumer but we re not seeing a change in that but we do like to advertise and keep our message fresh in their heads for when they re entering our category and similarly on oakley so yeah as we we aren t seeing a large increase or many changes in the mix overall we do like to have brand names at the high end of our range at this stage some consumers are excited by that and certainly a minority of our consumers are buying the fancy names like that but there s a nice sort of halo effect that comes sort of having those names there gives a nice halo to everything else we have in the store so it s sort of a balance the thing it s been that way for a long time so it s nice to have the ugly name in there there s a consumer that really loves that at a great value but no change in product mix of significance from that no change in customer base just steady as she goes bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst okay great thank you very much reade fahs chief executive officer thanks bob operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from zach fadem with wells fargo zach fadem wells fargo analyst hey good morning guys on the omni channel front you talked about online exam scheduling curious if you could talk about additional digital offerings that you re testing like online try on curious what else you re considering on that front reade fahs chief executive officer yeah we sort of looked at and trial in various ways all sorts of things we i am confident we re sort of in touch with every innovation that is out there and sort of see them in sort of sequencing mode we like sort of things like online scheduling of exams and chat and sort of text to confirm your appointment and those sorts of communications now we are trialing virtual try on and have an investment in what i think is considered the leading virtual try on company and so we are we track and trial almost everything that we think is going to impact and any innovation is going to impact us in the near term zach fadem wells fargo analyst got it and also with respect to cannibalization of your stores could you comment on the impact in 2018 and then with your openings trending toward existing markets this year do you expect cannibalization to weigh on your results as we move over the next 12 months to 18 months reade fahs chief executive officer we always factor in cannibalization to our models when we do a pro forma we are it all depends on how near the store is but that is always something we calculate before deciding whether we re going to select a location but i m not feeling you re going to be hearing us talk a lot about cannibalization in 2019 zach fadem wells fargo analyst got it and one more quick one any changes in the trend of managed care penetration reade fahs chief executive officer managed care continues to grow nicely for us it has for the past several years it will continue to i believe continue to grow nicely in 2019 nothing dramatic i would say consistent growth over the years but i ll say that it s still a minority of our business and we re under penetrated relative to the industry overall and that comes about for two reasons one is because we re over penetrated in non managed care business we believe that s because when it s your money and your decision is not influenced by insurance related things you seek out true value and therefore you come to us so that s why we re over penetrated in non insurance business and why we re under penetrated and still growing so much in insurance business is sort of when we bought america s best it had it didn t even take insurance it didn t participate at all so the story of the year since we bought america s best has been ph 5120 one that s steadily adding more plans and relationships with insurance companies that have helped us and that will continue zach fadem wells fargo analyst that s helpful reade thanks so much appreciate the time reade fahs chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from michael lasser with ubs michael lasser ubs analyst my question what s been driving the increase in the average ticket and have these stores been incentivized any differently to drive the average ticket increase reade fahs chief executive officer all right thank you michael no the stores have not been incentivized any differently to drive the average ticket that s not how we generally play that we saw a modest increase most of that was product mix shift driven by customer behavior especially related to contact lenses where people were just sort of choosing fancier and better and added value contact lenses traffic continues to be the main driver of comps for eyeglasses there s a difference between eyeglasses and contacts we d like to say we sell glasses but people buy contacts and but there is no incentive difference in that way michael lasser ubs analyst so the comp in the fourth quarter was more sort of driven by the dynamic with contacts rather than eyeglasses and is that a change from where the trend has been over the longer term patrick r moore chief financial officer hey it s patrick michael one of the other big factors in q4 was the what we think was the loss selling day in that last week of the year that last week is a huge sales year that can be one of our top one or two weeks of the year so as we think about the overall quarter we lost heavy days so i don t want to put a factor on and call it put a two day factor or whatever on it but we lost a really big day our average ticket due to that day loss it didn t really move in the quarter so you had a big selling day out out of the overall denominator of selling days and that had a pretty decent impact on comps in terms of traffic reade fahs chief executive officer also the five patrick r moore chief financial officer and additionally the five stores that were closed so as we kind of zeroed in and looked at the quarter excluding that last week we saw trends that were a little more consistent with what we ve been seeing michael lasser ubs analyst okay and my follow up question patrick is the amount of aggregate adjustments in 2018 were up about 6 year over year how should we think about that number looking toward 2019 patrick r moore chief financial officer yeah there were a couple areas of large and just add backs that were abnormal one was all the stock comp and we can certainly unpack that on our after call if you d like we obviously disclosed it in the k the second area was any other incentive compensation and then finally we have some goodwill impairment we impaired the fred and military brands and so between stock comp and military you saw some out of the guardrails degrees of figures there what i would call kind of the normal add backs we re still in the upper mid single digit million range michael lasser ubs analyst okay thank you very much patrick r moore chief financial officer and the purpose on all of that is to get the non cash items out of the momentum adjusted ebitda michael lasser ubs analyst got you thanks again operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today s question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks reade fahs chief executive officer

brexit negotiating strategy will be voted on in the commons today analyst preview marshall gittler chief strategist head of education acls global yesterday s statement by uk pm may kind of takes the wind out of the sails for today s parliamentary votes there may be a vote on one or more amendments that would put pm may s promise of a vote in writing the more important one of these the spelman dromey amendment would set a deadline of 18 march to have either passed a deal passed no deal or requested an extension there s also an amendment up for a vote calling for a second referendum and one ruling out a no deal brexit but as european commission president jean claude juncker said recently in the british parliament every time they are voting there is a majority against something there is no majority in favor of something elsewhere there is plenty to get ready for particularly for those interested in the canadian dollar or inflation trends generally in north america as canada releases

delayed after all this is clearly a reversal of what she has said in the past and markets were encouraged by the news that should parliament reject the pms deal and a no deal brexit in march then they could be given the option to deal brexit of course all of this is pending eu approval but with gbp eur also rising sharply it is clear that this was viewed as a sterling positive analyst view lloyds bank the pound rallied to the highest levels this year against both the us dollar and the euro following the pm s statement yesterday gbpusd and gbpeur increased to highs of 1 3288 and 1 1678 the pm

official 29 march deadline this should push opposition labour party leader jeremy corbyn to request a second referendum on brexit analysts at ing released their view on what the two different outcomes might be noting first on the shorter schedule a shorter extension might have short term political and practical advantages but it would likely be more damaging for the economy and could easily write off a bank of england rate hike until much later in the year or beyond on a longer time frame ing believe that should the delay be more substantial then there could be a pick up in growth in the uk a longer extension while potentially more politically awkward for the uk government could see growth recover a touch in the near term as the imminent no deal threat recedes the outlook for sterling would definitely improve if growth was to pick up but a longer delay also means prolonging the agony the most interesting development to consider is whether the independent group gather any further momentum for their second referendum vote now that labour is behind the deal latest exchange rates 27 02 2019
critics say the u s can t afford a green new deal ap photo susan walsh u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey are calling for a green new deal that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as us 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment program s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what a green new deal may cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments like the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp to me seems about right as the best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the u s would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually how to pay for the green new deal as for paying for it the first thing to bear in mind is that in my view a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the u s borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 21 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises consumers do not spend and private investment is down when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the u s would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the u s roughly in the middle among countries that currently impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an addtional 72 billion a year cost savings but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms would also help lower the costs in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs a good illustration is purchases of electric vehicles which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by ocasio cortez and markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it could ultimately determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it this article is republished from the

invest at favorable risk adjusted returns the fourth quarter of 2018 was volatile as agency mbs spreads widened and risk assets underperformed benchmarks in response to a reversal in sentiment around the path of the economy in 2019 said chief investment officer t j durkin the risk off sentiment was driven by uncertainties surrounding fed policies softening of select manufacturing data the absence of optimism on trade negotiations with china and the government shutdown since year end there has been a modest recovery in the market for risk assets and in the agency basis against this backdrop

presentation of core earnings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies who may use different calculations this non gaap measure should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap our gaap financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated during the three months ended december 31 2018 we determined that we should modify our definition and calculation of core earnings a non gaap financial measure to exclude realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of arc home s net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights held at arc home our subsidiary licensed mortgage originator the modification to our definition and calculation of core earnings is consistent with our treatment of excluding realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of excess msrs held directly by us we define core earnings a non gaap financial measure as net income loss available to common stockholders excluding i unrealized gains losses on securities loans derivatives and other investments and realized gains losses on the sale or termination of such instruments ii beginning with q2 2018 as a policy change any transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of our investments iii beginning with q3 2018 concurrent with a change in the company s business any depreciation or amortization expense related to the company s sfr portfolio iv beginning with q3 2018 as a policy change accrued deal related performance fees payable to arc home and third party

retrospectively as a policy change realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of arc home s net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights items i through v above include any amounts related to those items held in affiliated entities management considers the transaction related expenses referenced in ii above to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition or disposition and does not view them as being part of its core operations management views the exclusion described in v above to be consistent with how it calculates core earnings on the remainder of its portfolio as defined core earnings include the net interest income and other income earned on the company s investments on a yield adjusted basis including tba dollar roll income or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent one of the company s objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio and management uses core earnings to help measure this objective management believes that this non gaap measure when considered with its gaap financials provides supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate the company s current core performance using the same measure that management uses to operate the business this metric in conjunction with related gaap measures provides greater transparency into the information used by the company s management team in its financial and operational decision making a reconciliation of gaap net income loss available to common stockholders to core earnings for the three months ended

same securities duration does not include our equity interest in ag arc llc or our investment in sfr 9 the yield on our debt investments represents an effective interest rate which utilizes all

divided by its carrying value gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization net operating income on our sfr portfolio is comprised of rental income and other sfr related income less property operating and maintenance expenses and property management fees our yield calculation excludes cash held by the company and excludes any net tba position the calculation of weighted average yield is weighted based on net carrying value 10 the cost of funds at quarter end is calculated as the sum of i the weighted average funding costs on total financing outstanding at quarter end and ii the weighted average of the net pay rate on our interest rate swaps the net receive rate on our treasury long positions the net pay rate on our treasury short positions and the net receivable rate on our io index derivatives if any both elements of the cost of funds at quarter end are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements and securitized debt outstanding at quarter end excluding financing arrangements associated with u s treasury positions the cost of funds excludes any net tba position 11 the management fee percentage at quarter end is calculated by annualizing management fees recorded during the quarter and dividing by quarter end stockholders equity 12 the other operating expenses percentage at quarter end is calculated by annualizing other operating expenses recorded during the quarter and dividing by our quarter end stockholders equity 13 this estimate of undistributed taxable income per share represents the total estimated undistributed taxable income as of

shipments decreased by approximately 600 units from the prior year fourth quarter driven by fewer shipments of higher priced class 2 electric trucks and class 5 big trucks in the north america market partly offset by an increase in shipments in brazil as that market continues to recover backlog in the americas increased 6 700 units over the prior year fourth quarter and 2 000 units over the 2018 third quarter as a result of supplier issues prudent production scheduling and higher bookings and backlog in brazil despite an increase in revenues operating profit in the americas which includes corporate headquarters results decreased to 4 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 23 7 million in the prior year quarter operating profit decreased due to both lower gross profit and an increase in operating expenses the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of material and freight cost inflation including import tariffs net of price increases manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supplier parts shortages and an increase in warranty expense the americas implemented price increases during the first half of the year and a tariff surcharge in november 2018 to offset material cost inflation and aluminum and steel tariffs but the fourth quarter operating results continued to reflect a 5 7 million shortfall resulting from the lag between the implementation of the price increases and when those price increases are fully realized in unit revenues operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from an adjustment for the net impact of tariffs on full year 2018 results additional investments in the expansion of hyster yale group s industry focused sales and marketing teams and increased product development costs to support a planned major upgrade to one of the company s core product platforms emea results revenues for the emea segment which includes operations in the europe middle east and africa markets decreased to 207 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 215 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 despite an increase in unit volumes revenues declined because an increase in revenues on lower priced class 3 units did not offset the effect of lower sales volumes of higher priced class 1 class 2 and class 5 trucks including big trucks compared with the prior year backlog in emea increased approximately 2 000 units over the 2017 fourth quarter and 200 units over the 2018 third quarter unfavorable currency movements from the translation of sales into u s dollars partly offset by higher parts sales and price increases also contributed to the revenue decline emea had operating profit of 4 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 5 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the impact of favorable currency movements of 2 8 million and price increases net of material cost inflation were more than offset by decreased volumes of higher value lift trucks specifically big trucks because of ongoing parts shortages as well as manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supplier constraints and national labor related strike days at the company s nijmegen plant a modest increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher incentive compensation also contributed to the decline in operating profit japic results revenues in the japic segment which includes operations in the asia and pacific markets including china as well as results from hyster yale maximal since it was acquired in june 2018 increased to 70 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 49 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was driven by the acquisition of hyster yale maximal which contributed revenues of 22 7 million generated by shipments of approximately 1 600 units japic generated an operating loss of 4 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with an operating loss of 0 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 included in the 2018 results was an operating loss at hyster yale maximal of 0 8 million which included 1 0 of amortization expense for the write up of acquired assets to fair market value excluding the impact of hyster yale maximal japic s operating results declined primarily as a result of increased costs to expand japic s sales and marketing teams and higher product development costs to support the company s growth initiatives as well as a product mix shift and an increase in material and freight costs bolzoni results during the fourth quarter of 2018 bolzoni s revenue increased to 50 6 million from 49 4 million in 2017 primarily due to higher volumes in the emea market partly offset by unfavorable currency movements bolzoni s operating profit increased from the prior year quarter mainly as a result of improved margins on products sold partially offset by higher operating expenses from the continued implementation of strategic programs to increase bolzoni s presence in north america nuvera results during the fourth quarter of 2018 nuvera recognized revenues that had previously been deferred on fuel cell bbrs sold to hyster yale group which are eliminated in consolidation revenue on these units had been deferred due to the inability to estimate future warranty costs because the bbrs are new technology and the design of the product continues to evolve the company determined that sufficient data was available in the 2018 fourth quarter to reasonably estimate all of the future costs related to the sale of bbr units including warranty costs nuvera s 2018 fourth quarter operating loss decreased compared with the prior year quarter mainly as a result of the absence of a 4 9 million asset impairment charge taken in 2017 and product development funding received from third party customers this improvement was partially offset by the recognition of higher warranty expense higher employee related costs and an increase in product development and production start up costs related to nuvera s third party development agreements investor perspective hyster yale is currently undertaking the largest set of transformational programs in the company s history these programs are expected to have a very significant impact on hyster yale s competitiveness market position and economic performance over the next three to five years for some time the company has been focused on six strategic initiatives provide the lowest cost of ownership while enhancing productivity for customers be the leader in the delivery of industry and customer focused solutions be the leader in independent distribution grow in emerging markets be the leader in the attachments business be a leader in fuel cells and their applications the projects required to execute fully on these initiatives have been in general initiated over the last several years and many are now moving toward completion further many of the projects supporting these strategic initiatives are inter related and succeeding in one will foster success in others in total these projects have required significant up front expense and capital expenditure investment the projects cover a very broad range of hyster yale activities including product development supply chain it manufacturing sales and marketing for each of the company s three major businesses hyster yale group bolzoni and nuvera over the course of 2017 and 2018 these investments both expense and capital increased significantly further investment will continue to be made in 2019 and then generally remain at those levels for the next several years the return from these investments has started to be realized and is expected to increase over the course of hyster yale s five year planning period in this context hyster yale group income is expected to improve in 2019 over 2018 but results in the first half of the year are expected to be lower than the first half of 2018 and then improve in the second half beginning in 2020 further improved results are expected with significant increases through 2023 hyster yale group s objective is to meet its target of 7 operating profit in this period assuming reasonable market conditions continue likewise bolzoni s results are expected to improve in 2019 and in the following years with a target of 7 operating profit nuvera s results are expected to improve moderately in the first three quarters of 2019 with a break even target for both the fourth quarter and for the 2020 full year further significantly improved earnings are expected at nuvera in the 2021 to 2023 time period at each of these three businesses the investments being undertaken are expected to lead to increased operating profit through higher volume decreased product costs and improved pricing partially offset by a higher level of operating expense overall 2019 consolidated operating profit is expected to increase significantly with the improvement coming in the second half of the year at hyster yale group product programs are expected to lay the groundwork for enhanced market position by providing lower cost of ownership and enhanced productivity for the company s customers at the core of these programs is a new set of modular and scalable product families covering both internal combustion engine and electric trucks which will provide customers with enhanced flexibility for meeting their application needs combined with the benefit of lowest total cost of ownership implementation of these programs are expected to begin in 2020 with the introduction of a new range of counterbalanced trucks with this range being expanded comprehensively through 2025 to include larger counterbalanced capacities big trucks and warehouse trucks a further major initiative in product offerings will come from the introduction of trucks manufactured by hyster yale maximal hyster yale group s new majority owned joint venture in china a line of trucks from hyster yale maximal has been engineered to provide high quality and reliable utility trucks for global markets and standard trucks for the chinese market in addition hyster yale maximal and hyster yale group s partner in india is expected to expand local production of larger trucks further in early 2019 a new end rider was launched in the north america market and a new reach truck for north america as well as lower cost class 3 walkie and stacker global products are expected to be introduced later in the year rough terrain and electrified big truck products are being added to the product line up to further enhance productivity for customers hyster yale group is developing automation solutions for warehouse trucks initially in combination with industry partners some of these products are already in the market today but new solutions and customers are expected to be developed progressively over the next several years hyster yale group continues to expand sales of telemetry products and new generations of lift trucks will offer a fully integrated telematics solution finally hyster yale group anticipates introducing new fuel cell bbrs for class 1 2 and 3 forklift trucks over the next two years that are expected to move the fuel cell bbr business to break even in 2020 the introduction of these new products will lead to significant changes in supply chain sourcing and in the company s various manufacturing facilities around the world consolidated component volume sourced globally from reliable partners is expected to reduce costs and improve quality as these new products are brought to market over the next two to three years hyster yale group s largest manufacturing facilities in berea craigavon and greenville are expected to be structured to reduce costs and improve productivity while most other plants will see more modest changes china production activities are expected to be consolidated at hyster yale maximal over the course of 2019 hyster yale group currently has over 290 different forklift models in its range which are supported by the ability to customize these trucks to meet specific customer needs the modular nature of the new products being introduced will enhance the ability to meet exact customer needs at lowest cost both at the industry level and at the individual customer level to ensure the full benefit from these programs hyster yale group has made a substantial expense investment in its sales and marketing organizations to realign teams around industry groupings within marketing industry focused resources have been added to develop industry strategies the higher priority industry strategies have been completed for north america and europe all of the strategies are expected to be completed for all countries or groups of countries around the world by the end of 2019 but will mature and be enhanced over future years to support execution of these industry strategies hyster yale group has invested in additional industry focused sales capabilities to support its dealers this industry focused structure has been in place and highly successful in the national account direct sales program and is now being deployed with the new dealer support teams these investments are largely in place in north america and to a lesser degree in emea additional sales capabilities are expected to be added in other areas around the world over the next two years in total the company believes that these projects will put it in a position to be a leader in the delivery of industry and customer focused solutions worldwide while the new sales teams will support dealers sales efforts the company will also continue to upgrade its global dealer capabilities a core objective is to have dealers that are fully capable of maximizing the potential of the hyster and yale brands in their territories these dealers will be supported by a commitment to helping dealers strengthen the excellence of their activities in all areas of their business including leadership sales parts service rental leasing and remarketing to help these programs have maximum impact the company will be investing over the next few years in enhanced digital customer experience systems taken together these initiatives amount to a new uniquely competitive way of serving the markets around the world bolzoni is also pursuing very aggressive projects to expand its global market position this includes strengthening bolzoni s ability to serve the north america market by taking responsibility for hyster yale group s sulligent plant where it will manufacture attachments and also continue the plant s support of hyster yale group through the sale of cylinders and various other components bolzoni will phase out production at its current homewood illinois facility but intends to maintain a distribution center and certain other operations in that area there is a large opportunity for growth in the north america market to help capture this bolzoni plans to introduce a broader range of locally produced attachments available with shorter lead times to serve its customer base bolzoni also has plans to increase its sales marketing and product support capabilities in north america in addition it has developed a standard product line sourced from one of its factories in china which will continue to be expanded bolzoni s current outstanding premium line of products coupled with these standard products and an industry focused strategy are expected to give bolzoni the ability to increase its sales significantly in the americas japic and emea regions bolzoni s results have been improving on a progressive basis since its acquisition three years ago these new programs are expected to increase the company s market position and profitability especially over the next three to four years nuvera is approaching the point where it will move from being a venture business focused on commercializing leading technology to a mature product based company serving not only the forklift truck market but also heavy duty applications such as buses trucks and applications in the automotive sector with an expanding line of developed products nuvera expects its core technology to move to a new generation of fuel cell stack design over the next year with broad application in each of these markets quality and cost of fuel cell engines have been improving and are expected to reach target objectives over the next two years with the transfer of the responsibility for development of non fuel cell engine components and the overall assembly of bbrs to hyster yale group nuvera will focus entirely on fuel cell stacks and engines to enhance its cost base nuvera continues to work on standardizing its products developing lower cost suppliers and automating various elements of stack production to help sharpen its focus on fuel cell stacks and engines nuvera sold its hydrogen generating powertap business to a third party oneh2 inc in exchange for a note and a minority ownership interest in oneh2 oneh2 has developed an important option for hydrogen fuel supply for forklift truck fuel cell users in overview nuvera s objective is to reach break even in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year of 2020 with a move toward target profitability over the following three years in summary hyster yale believes it is approaching an inflection point in its business while the early part of 2019 is expected to reflect continued investment in all of these programs the second half of 2019 is expected to be significantly improved in comparison to the second half of 2018 hyster yale group s efforts to find offsets to the tariff driven unprecedented material cost inflation witnessed in 2018 will mature during 2019 and efforts to abate the most critical supplier issues which are still having an impact on production are underway with most expected to be resolved by mid year the current lift truck backlog contains certain deal specific pricing agreements at less than target margins to gain targeted accounts and for which margin improvement efforts will take some time to mature these deals will have an impact on profitability mainly in the first half of the year generally margins are expected to recover fully from the 2018 material cost inflation and the heavily discounted deals by the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in 2020 and 2021 a considerable portion of the new projects outlined above will have reached completion for all three companies and the company believes the full impact of these programs can lead to profitability improvements for a number of years to come finally the remainder of the programs are expected to come to fruition in 2022 and 2023 with a few particularly those involving dealer structure and excellence being more in the nature of continuous improvement rather than projects which reach maturity at a given time of course the absolute level of profitability will reflect actual market demand levels the company is currently forecasting strong but moderating forklift market levels and a resolution to brexit in a way which does not significantly harm hyster yale s business prospects the company believes that investors who are focused on mid term business improvement in market position and profitability will find that hyster yale s focus is consistent with those investment objectives conference call in conjunction with

michael good morning everyone thank you all for joining us starting on slide 3 we concluded 2018 with a strong performance that enabled us to exceed our guidance both our segments delivered profitable growth in the quarter environmental services achieved better than expected results from a combination of higher margin waste streams pricing gains and a solid contribution from industrial services which includes the veolia acquisition as was the case throughout 2018 adjusted ebitda outpaced revenue growth in q4 resulting in a 60 basis point margin improvement our full year results were also strong credit for that goes to our entire team which consistently drove profitable growth and did so safely all year i m extremely proud to report that 2018 was the best safety year in clean harbors history with our trir and other key metrics at record lows nothing is more important to our leadership team that ensuring that each employee goes home uninjured every day financially our revenues grew 12 and adjusted ebitda increased 15 while our adjusted free cash flow for the year was a record 195 3 million turning to environmental services on slide 4 our top line grew nearly a 100 million in the quarter with veolia accounting for about 45 million of that amount the remainder was driven by organic growth adjusted ebitda in the segment was up 35 with a 210 basis point margin improvement incinerator utilization committed 86 in q4 our average price per pound grew by 17 year over year as we continue to focus on gathering more high value waste streams and optimizing our mix with the addition of our el dorado incinerator we are drawing more waste streams from the ongoing expansion in the chemical sector and regularly setting new records for drum volumes coming from both safety kleen and our legacy clean harbors business for the full year our el dorado location ran at 95 utilization up from 85 a year ago demonstrating how well the new plant is running in year two of its operation landfill tonnage in the quarter was down 6 from a year ago as a result of the timing of some projects however our average price per ton was up 18 due to our focus on bringing in more high value waste streams and greater base work for the full year landfill volumes were up slightly from 2017 we also generated profitable growth in q4 within our tsdf network our wastewater treatment plants and our other recycling centers moving to slide 5 safety kleen grew revenue 6 in q4 due to a higher production volumes our closed loop initiative and pricing and growth within the branch network s core lines of business parts washer revenues were up slightly in the quarter due to pricing while waste oil collection volumes were 56 million gallons giving us a record of 234 million gallons collected in 2018 similar to the past several quarters our rerefineries ran well with production levels above a year ago safety kleen s adjusted ebitda increased 1 due to pricing in its core branch offerings which offset the short term spread compression we experienced when base oil prices declined during the quarter the safety kleen team did a great job throughout 2018 capitalizing on positive pricing trends as well as managing the spread between our used motor oil and base oil in terms of the sales mix direct lube sales accounted for 6 of safety kleen s total volume sold similar to the past two quarters and up from 4 a year ago total blended product sales were 22 compared to 23 a year ago and as we move into 2019 our focus is on increasing blended sales not only our direct sales our lube sales but growing volumes with our key distributors after selling less than 40 million gallons of total blended products in 2018 we aim to expand that to 50 million gallons to 2019 with about half of the increase coming from our closed loop and the remainder from distributors i want to take a moment to highlight the increasingly complementary relationship between our safety kleen and our environmental service segment since acquiring safety kleen we ve grown adjusted ebitda in that business by 112 million or 66 more importantly adjusted ebitda margins has increased 900 basis points from 15 3 in 2013 to 24 3 in 2018 during the same period we ve also made considerable progress integrating safety kleen with our legacy business last year safety kleen gathered a record level of drums for our disposal network our environmental service on the other hand generated 100 million of revenue from safety kleen s customers within its total project management business and we ve also now co located 35 legacy clean harbors locations within the existing safety kleen branch network the alignment between our segments continues to strengthen and our results underscore the financial benefits that we can achieve together here on slide 6 we wanted to share with you a quick snapshot of the top 10 verticals that we serve and as you can see from the chart manufacturing and chemical are our largest verticals and those two industries accounted for nearly a third of our revenues last year asset that we are well diversified across a variety of markets that we serve i should point out that upstream oil and gas is becoming considerably smaller part of our revenue base in recent years and today only represents about 4 of our total sales moving to our corporate update on slide 7 a high quality workforce is integral to our strategy to ensure we are operating efficiently as possible while servicing our customers needs in 2018 we invested an additional 30 million into our people in the form of higher average wages greater incentive compensation the reinstatement of our 401k match program and other expanded benefits our investments in our people will continue to increase in 2019 as we more than double our 401k contribution and absorb all healthcare cost increases and we are also pursuing a broad array of cost savings initiatives again this year that we believe will offset these workforce investments profitable growth remains the focus for us in 2019 we took a significant step forward in 2018 but there s more we can do to extend our momentum and improve our margins we saw early success from the strategic realignment of our sales and service organization within our environmental services segment at the beginning of 2018 this structure should generate growth for us again this year expanding cross selling opportunities and enabling more efficient sharing of people and assets going forward with the impending changes expected from imo 2020 regulations we continue to review every contract and sale on a short term basis really to look for opportunities to capitalize on market conditions turning to our capital allocation strategy on slide 8 in 2018 we executed on all four elements of our capital allocation strategy we invested nearly 180 million in net capex in the business we acquired veolia s industrial business and cyn environmental for approximately 150 million in total we brought back more than 45 million worth of our shares and we also reduced our debt obligation by more than 55 million based on the timing and market conditions we plan to be opportunistic across all four categories again in 2019 so in summary the underlying dynamics of our business are real positive and we anticipate a strong 2019 so with that let me turn it over to mike battles mike michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you alan and good morning everyone turning to slide 10 and our income statement we closed out a strong 2018 with excellent profitable growth in q4 we increased revenue by more than 110 million from the prior year for the year we grew more than 355 million or 12 with the majority coming from organic growth the 120 basis point improvement in gross margin in q4 reflect the mix of business in the quarter the impact of our pricing initiatives in a favorable comp with the year ago when some of our customers and locations were still being affected by the remnants of the hurricane season on a full year basis we saw a slight increase in gross margin that number would have been much higher except for the addition of veolia which generates gross margins lower than our company average q4 sg a expenses were up on both an absolute dollar basis and on a percentage basis primarily reflecting the increase of incentive compensation given the outstanding results that the team delivered on a full year basis sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 20 basis points this result was driven by higher revenue improved leverage from our new regional structure and the ongoing integration of veolia into our existing sg a structure for 2019 using the midpoint of our guidance range we would expect our sg a to be slightly down in absolute dollars depreciation and amortization for the full year was up a little over 10 million due to the addition of the veolia assets for 2019 we expect depreciation and amortization to decrease to a range of 285 million to 295 million as some existing assets become fully depreciated income from operations for the quarter increased 49 to 41 5 million reflecting higher revenue and operating margin for the full year that increase was 43 to 182 6 million higher margin waste streams pricing improvements in multiple businesses and a solid contribution from veolia drove a 20 increase in adjusted ebitda for the quarter looking at the full year our adjusted ebitda grew 15 on a gaap basis eps was 0 29 per diluted share versus 1 48 a year ago when we had a large benefit due the changes in corporate tax law on an adjusted basis our eps was 0 24 compared with a loss of 0 06 a year ago for the full year our adjusted eps was 1 26 compared with 0 20 for 2017 our full year tax rate in 2018 was 30 5 looking at 2019 we would anticipate that our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to be in the 28 to 31 range turning to the balance sheet on slide 11 cash and short term marketable securities totaled 279 4 million at year end up more than 26 million from q3 our dso calculation came in at 76 days 4 days higher than a year ago that is directly related to the addition of veolia the team actually did a nice job on collections down the stretch and in combination with our working capital management we were able to generate strong free cash flows our long term debt balance declined to 1 57 billion as we elected to repay the 50 million that we had drawn on our revolver when we refinanced our 2020 senior notes back in june given our cash on hand and the current loan environment we thought it was prudent to delever a bit at this time ultimately we can redraw on that revolver at a later date if needed overall we believe our balance sheet is very strong our weighted average cost of debt is about 4 7 we ended 2018 with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 2 6 times and if you use the midpoint of our 2019 guidance with today s net debt balance it would take us below 2 5 times turning to our cash flows on slide 12 cash from operations was 126 million in q4 nearly double a year ago capex net of disposals was 33 3 million included in that number were net proceeds of 7 4 million related to the sale of assets associated with our lodging manufacturing operation in western canada this divestiture is consistent with our strategy of exiting non core businesses and selling off non core assets the combination of our strong cash from operations and lower net capex spend led to an impressive 92 7 million of adjusted free cash flow for the quarter for the full year we delivered a higher than expected 195 3 million as alan mentioned that s a record for the company and is reflective of our ability to deliver strong cash conversion as we continue to profitably grow the business and control capital spending for the full year our net capex came in at 177 9 million which is right in line with our capex guidance for 2019 we currently expect net capex in the 190 million to 210 million range the midpoint of that range is up about 12 for 2018 as a result of growth in our business the timing of landfill so construction and some incremental capital investments to enhance our rerefinery capacity during the quarter we repurchased 11 5 million of stock for the full year we bought back approximately 814 000 shares at an average cost of just over 55 per share we bought back close to 5 6 million shares and an average price of just under 53 since the program began a few years ago we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program moving to guidance on slide 13 based on our 2018 results and current market conditions we expect 2019 adjusted ebitda in the range of 500 million to 540 million the midpoint of that range represents a 6 increase from 2018 and the top end of the range equates to 10 growth looking at our guidance from a quarterly perspective we expect normal seasonality during 2019 with the back half of the year being slightly higher than the first half and q1 remaining our weakest quarter that said we expect q1 adjusted ebitda this year to be up about 10 year over year due to growth in the business continued better pricing and a favorable comp with the prior year here s how our current full year 2019 guidance translates from a segment perspective in environmental services we expect adjusted ebitda to increase in the mid to high single digit range in 2019 this growth will again be driven by pricing higher value waste streams and margin improvement in this segment for safety kleen we anticipate adjusted ebitda growth in the low single digit range due to the continued effective spread management increased production volumes in our plants and growth in key lines of business in our branch network including direct lube sales in our corporate segment negative adjusted ebitda should be flat to slightly higher in 2018 as increases in areas like healthcare and benefits including 401k are mostly offset by cost saving initiatives based on our current guidance and working capital assumptions we expect 2019 adjusted free cash flow in the range of 190 million to 220 million as incremental ebitda is partially offset by higher capex in summary 2018 was an outstanding year as we met or exceeded our guidance in all four quarters our goal is to consistently deliver on our promises overall we expect another year of profitable growth in 2019 with that rob please open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions the first question today comes from the line of luke junk with baird please proceed with your questions luke junk robert w baird co analyst good morning everyone alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer good morning michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer hi luke luke junk robert w baird co analyst first question i had just in terms of the first quarter ebitda up 10 just wondering if there is any seasonal impacts we should be aware of in the quarter i was inaudible to those quarter seasonally but anything we should be aware of in terms of shutdowns or similar michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer so we did struggle a bit in january in our rerefinery in chicago that was shutdown for a bit because of the polar vortex that kind of affected that part of the country but outside of that luke there is not a lot that was that s not a big number per se luke junk robert w baird co analyst okay that s helpful and then in terms of safety kleen mike you d recently made some references to your spread management system at safety kleen specifically how much they ve improved over the last few years can you speak to some of those changes more specifically and maybe give us some updated guardrails as well in that area michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure so this system that we re talking about was put in place a year or two ago and i think it continues to do very well and you kind of saw it in the results here in q4 i mean although in oil prices kind of collapsed in november and december that the sk team continued to drive kind of profitable growth and still for the tenth consecutive quarter had a year over year growth in their ebitda so i m really pleased with the team and how they did down the stretch of managing their input costs as well as managing the output costs so that that system continues to do well and i m hopeful that the regardless of what how oil prices go in 2019 we ll be able to manage that spread and drive profitable growth luke junk robert w baird co analyst and then i guess speak alan just the outlook for incinerator pricing in 2019 obviously steady economic backdrop good utilization high barriers to entry in that business of course it seems like a good backdrop to take price alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer we had a number of pricing initiatives across the business last year and we would expect the benefit of those increases to flow through here in 2019 so you will see an improvement in pricing on incineration this year for that reason for sure i think more importantly will be the mix the team really has been able to line out that new plant and we ve been able to really increase our feed grades and the type of waste the high value of feeds into the plant and that s really come online at a really opportune time for us because we ve got a number of key customers that have been expanding and generating those kind of high difficult high cost difficult streams to treat so that team s really done a nice job of getting that plant up online luke junk robert w baird co analyst okay perfect i will leave it there thank you so much alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer okay michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks luke operator the next question is from the line of hamzah mazari with macquarie please proceed with your questions hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst hey good morning my question is on pricing as well how much of the pricing ramp alan is just sort of a catch up because you sort of didn t price earlier i am just thinking about long term pricing in your business is the pricing ramp in 19 much higher and then we go to sort of a cpi based pricing just any thoughts on sort of pricing i know you ve been strategic around that and i know we ve had capacity ramp and you had to fill volume any thoughts on pricing longer term alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer well we certainly have been doing a little bit of catch up as you know because there were a reluctancy on us raising pricing as we were bringing on new capacity but at the same time more waste is entering the market we re seeing more captives looking to outsource more material direct to our facilities and with some of the consolidation that took place within the chemical industry there are a number of facilities right now that are beginning to outsource waste that otherwise may have internalized those materials so all in all i think we are pleased with our utilization rates we have been doing a little catch up as you mentioned we have increased pricing and quite frankly as we ve approached a lot of our large key customers i think many of them appreciate the fact that we ve made a substantial investment into these plants to increase more capacity and also to meet the new regulation so all in all i think the pricing are justified and being received pretty well hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good that s great i know you touched on the synergies between safety kleen and environmental and obviously it s been a number of years since we did that deal but any thoughts as you look at m a longer term i know we got involved in energy after the bp oil spill and sort of your in the sort of two segments but there s a number of different verticals in those two segments as we think about m a longer term as leverage comes off is the portfolio going to remain sort of similar or are you looking at other avenues that sort of you re not in right now just sort of thoughts on longer term m a alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think there are a lot of opportunities in the two segments that we re in today we see a lot of deal flow through our m a group here and we continue to look at opportunities but we re trying to be optimistic as well we are somewhat competing with a number of pe firms out there that in some cases pay a much higher multiple than they re willing to pay so we ve only did a couple of deals last year i think they worked out extremely well for us we continue to see opportunities so to grow just in the two segments quite frankly hamzah that we re in right now hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good got it last question i ll turn it over just at the imo 2020 could you remind us is that all hype or do you think that that really generates ebitda in your business thank you alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer certainly we re watching that very closely and we think there are going to be some impacts on both outlets for oils that are being collected today that is not being refined so we think there could be impacts to the outlets for them we also think there s going to be changes to the pricing on marine diesel oil and fuel oil and subsequently potential positive implications on base oil pricing so we think on both the collection side as well as on the sales side imo 2020 could have an impact on us but i think only time will tell that kind of see just how it all shakes out hamzah hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst great thanks so much operator the next question is coming from the line of michael hoffman with stifel please proceed with your question michael hoffman stifel analyst hi thanks mike jim close the loop on imo 2020 it s not in your guidance but the more important point michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer that s true michael alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes michael hoffman stifel analyst okay so it s all upside whatever happens whether it has a benefit or not and you don t have to spend any capital to benefit from it you basically are in the right place at the right time michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we are going to spend a couple of million bucks probably incremental capital in our rerefineries we run them a little more efficiently but inaudible nothing to your point michael hoffman stifel analyst yes but you don t have to spend money for imo 2020 that s just a business decision about michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer it s fair enough michael hoffman stifel analyst right ok in 2018 you enjoyed a recovery in refining turnarounds you as a service provider and at the time we chatted about having been a prolonged lengthening of the cycle that it looked like we were back to some normal level of maintenance cycling again how do you frame 2019 in the context you had a good 18 in refining is 19 setting up to be it looks like we re doing maintenance again alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer i think western canada had a really good year on turnaround both are in the specialty side as well as our base industrial cleaning business so they will have a much lower year this year because of the schedule the u s should be stronger this year although i think probably not significantly more than what we saw last year so i think on a net basis we re probably flat michael for right now michael hoffman stifel analyst but would you say that we re back into a cycle again where it looks like you couldn t predict it for the prior five years alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes i definitely think it s much more of a cycle and we are looking at the book out there of the turnarounds and the schedules and we re hiring we re ramping up obviously staffing to deal with the demand that we have so i would say yes it s probably more consistent and i think the pricing of oil being in this high 50 range certainly helps that we re not seeing a lot of customers all of a sudden shut off maintenance or capex like they were doing in the past years michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say michael that cycle to your point yes i think that we are but i know this is a big catch up per se i think we re just back on back on a normal cycle and i think 2019 as alan said 2018 in western canada was awesome and i don t think that repeats itself but in the u s grows a bit and i think net net we re probably flat michael hoffman stifel analyst yes and that s what i was trying to get to as we ve now found a pattern again whether we didn t seemed to have a pattern for a while as they change the cycle volumes michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer that is fair alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then you used to talk about in the incineration world of 0 50 a pound sort of your middle of the road pricing and then you add el dorado and it clearly would dampen it as you loaded and then we re off the tsdf ph how would you frame where you are in the aggregate to that 0 50 a pound alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes it s a good question i guess jim you have a comment james buckley svp investor relations yes michael we re kind of back to where we work because throwing the 70 000 tons of capacity and then having to fill that up we obviously diluted the price and with the large increase we re reporting in the past several quarters we put the average price back up i m not sure that 0 50 a pound unless you re excluding our canadian incinerator which is liquids only that dilutes that price but in the u s network that s approximately where we are michael hoffman stifel analyst right and so to the point of pricing anything from the here and now is more likely real price as opposed to asp and mix because you now get the benefit from better volumes alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer to hamzah s point about asking about year over year yes we had a bit of a favorable comp last year obviously with running so much low price material through so if you say we re back to kind of level set here with 70 000 more tons then everything from here forward is moving up upscale michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer incremental michael hoffman stifel analyst right alright which is the point i was trying to make and then lastly we can as market observers see posted base oil prices and so we understand what s happening on that and to your spread and we have no idea what s happening on the front end but i have to believe you didn t sit idly when oil was coming down so could you share at least what you did in the fourth quarter on an incremental basis for charge for oil so the market understands how quickly you re able to respond michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so michael this is mike so it was a about zero about flat maybe down rounded down to a penny but as you look into 2019 it s been up a bit here in january so yes we did drop we did raise our pricing down pushed out price but when the price went down on december 1st but at the end of the day we ve kind of recover that alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer so probably in a charge for oil michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer we are definitely charge for oil right now absolutely michael edward hoffman stifel nicolaus company analyst so 2019 is a charge and can you share any assumption about i guess really what you re saying is you re going to manage the spread regardless and therefore that s why we can look at a 1 to 2 ebitda growth despite base oil down michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right that s exactly right michael edward hoffman stifel nicolaus company analyst sorry last i just to closed loop on it i m assuming you haven t built any seasonality you ve taken the base oil where it is at the moment and that s what life is manage the spread and if we get a normal seasonal slight demand push then that s upside as well michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sir michael edward hoffman stifel nicolaus company analyst great thanks nice quarter alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer thank you michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks michael operator the next question is coming from the line of jeff silber with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much in your commentary around the safety kleen you talked about your goals to increasing the blending products component in 2019 can you give a little bit more color how you are going to get there and what you think the impact might be on segment margins alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer sure we established about 15 bulk distribution facilities within our existing network and we have been and our supply chain organization been expanding the quantities and the types of products really across the network not only in those bulk facilities but through our distributors as well as our package materials across our distribution centers so as 2018 continue to rollout and we ran our sales initiatives we realized that there was a lot more opportunity for us to continue to grow that we ve kind of i would say made a case that customers really are willing to buy our oil they like the product we have they liked it the delivery methods that we re making here to pickup their waste and deliver oil at the same time so i think we re just going to continue now to execute on that plan we d like to gone faster than the way we ended up for the year we re a little bit short from where our internal targets were but all in all i think we go at about 60 to 70 so that was good news for us jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst and i m sorry the potential impact on margins if you get there alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer well i think just at a very high level we ve always thought ph this is probably a dollar a gallon kind of margin uplift as we sell more blended oil than if we are in the kind of commodity base oil business so that s always been sort of our thinking at a very high level jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst okay that s fair and mike forgive me in your comments did you say that you sold the lodging business in canada are you completely out of that business now michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer no jeff we sold the lodgy manufacturing operation we had a small manufacturing operation south of edmonton and we sold that that building in the land to a third party for about 7 5 million u s jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great thank you so much for clarifying that i appreciate it thank you operator the next question comes from the line of noah kaye with oppenheimer please proceed with your questions noah kaye oppenheimer company analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking the questions yes so again to come back to price i mean pretty notable mix improvement obviously in es in 2018 so it looks like there s a little over 20 million of ebitda growth kind of the midpoint of your guidance for 19 and really how much of that is price i mean is this basically all price driven can you talk about your assumptions for price versus volume michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer so noah i ll take it and so when you think about the growth in 2018 certainly prices as alan and others have said it was a good driver of that i would say the predominance of the growth in revenues was mix as alan tried to say we re kind of higher margin waste streams higher inaudible waste streams that are difficult to dispose of really kind of came into the network and that s due to that our growth in the chemical and the manufacturing space so that really that really drove the incremental revenue and the incremental margin improvement as you look to 2019 i think that just keeps going i think some of the contracts we have kind of continue and these types of waste streams continue into 2019 so when i think of kind of the midpoint we ended at 491 million in the midpoint of our guidance is 520 million i think a lot of that is really a mix issue as much of the price issue prices up no doubt about it catching up from 2017 and really our costs are going up and we ve been able to have constructive conversations with our customers by increasing price but if you look at the overall growth it really is a mixed story and that continues to 2019 which i think is actually much a more positive story frankly i think that really talks about kind of what s happening in the united states from a chemical renaissance which we ve talked about quite a bit whether our current customers are doing more or new customers are coming online it s really been it really was a great finish to a great year and i think the story is a mixed story as much as the price story noah kaye oppenheimer company analyst that s very helpful thanks mike kind of switching gears how should we think about working capital impacts for the free cash flow guide for 19 it looks like you got a nice benefit to 4q around the payable side you talked about maybe still an opportunity to decrease dsos what should we expect for working capital impact michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say working capital is neutral maybe it grows a bit as the business grows but we re not anticipating us in my guidance i m not anticipating dso dropping dramatically we will continue to work it we have plans to do that but i don t think that it s going to be i really don t think it s going to be a we are not planning on a big dso decrease noah kaye oppenheimer company analyst yes i mean i would just point out that from our perspective kind of underlying free cash flow growth in the guide is higher you did a really nice job to your credit from 4q on the working capital side let me just ask one slightly different question to finish off here i think we ve seen data from epa that something like 1 3 of all public water systems have detections of pfas that are added above the nation s health advisory level and recently we ve seen epa saying they re going to propose a regulatory determination by the end of 2019 alan i think last quarter you estimated 25 million to 30 million revenue in 2018 from the pfas cleanup so really kind of a three part question where did you end up in 2018 revenues what have you projected for 2019 and how large do you think the tam ph becomes if the epa ultimately set a rigorous water contamination standard alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes it probably come in closer to 15 million plus last year but we certainly been paying attention to that regulatory change that s going to be coming about and we see a real opportunity to be honest with you we ve invested capital and part of our increasing capital spending is to build more onsite treatment units to support our customers demand in that area we ve been pretty much maxed out with the facilities that we have today so that s going to be a real positive i think for us michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer hi noah can i add one more point to alan s comments so i think if you look at 2019 guidance we haven t assumed a lot of incremental from that number and just so you and i are in the same page and the street on the same page if pfas becomes a thing here in 19 there s probably upside to the model noah kaye oppenheimer company analyst okay perfect thanks so much operator the next question comes from the line of larry solow with cjs securities please proceed with your questions peter lukas cjs securities analyst yes hey good morning it s pete lucas for larry i apologize if i missed it in the prior question just on direct lube you ve done a nice job there and expanding it over 25 000 customers do you see the continued growth there s a slow grind more of a hockey stick growth that will need a couple of national accounts to get it going michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes pete this is mike i ll take it and alan feel free to jump in i d say that 2018 on the direct lube didn t hit our own internal guidance but still great growth for the 70 growth year over year on our direct lube business and it continues to grow in 2019 the point we wanted to mention in the comments was it s more of a blended lube story and so we re trying to grow both our distributor business and our direct lube business going from kind of 39 million 40 million in 2018 to 50 million in 2019 so whether we get it through the direct lube channels that we ve talked about previously or through our distributor network and we want to grow that blended lube that s where the margins are that s where the stickiness is that s where we really want to kind of drive this business going forward alan s mckim chairman president and chief executive officer yes it just reduces the volatility and the exposure on base lube peter lukas cjs securities analyst perfect you guys did a real nice job covering it and talking about the ebitda guidance going forward there so a lot of positive commentary for 19 and it sounds like mix is kind of the main driver between the high end and low end of guidance is that the right way to think about it or is there any other key driving factors that we should think about there michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say mix is a big part of it i think that one would be depends on the mix and the projects that we have the pipeline of projects looks very strong one of our guys said one of the strongest we ve seen in a long time and so we re hopeful that comes through if that comes through we are going to be in the high end if those get delayed for reasons beyond our control we ll be on the low end peter lukas cjs securities analyst very helpful thanks and congratulations on the quarter michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks pete operator our next question is coming from the line of william grippin with ubs please proceed with your question william grippin ubs securities analyst hi good morning everyone just quickly sorry if i missed it but could you just detail the veolia contribution in 4q for both revenue and ebitda and then it sounds like you re making some good progress ramping that business improving margins just kind of size up for us maybe what you re expecting for 2019 for that acquisition michael l battles executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so william off if you give me 30 seconds i ll pull the q4 revenues the ebitda was about 4 0 million to 4 5 million in q4 and so for the year that turns out to be about 14 0 million 14 5 million of overall ebitda for veolia we think that goes up into that into the high teens into 20 million in 2019 as that business continues to do well for us but i don t have the revenue numbers at my fingertips william grippin ubs securities analyst no problem thank you very much that s all i have operator thank you operator instructions thank you at this time i will turn the floor back to mr mckim for

officer commented in 2018 we continued our transformation of the company while delivering consistent financial performance throughout the year we outpaced our underlying markets growing revenue by 5 despite macroeconomic challenges in brazil and china as well as the continued and anticipated ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs we expanded our ebitda margin which drove ebitda

reductions partially offset by increased sales volume in china and our commercial vehicle markets control devices gross margin decreased slightly due to lower sales and higher direct material costs as a percentage of sales and the adverse impact of additional tariffs of approximately 2 4 million which were partially offset by lower overhead costs from a reduction in warranty costs the segment s adjusted operating income decreased by 8 6 electronics segment sales increased by 18 6 primarily due to an increase in european and north american commercial vehicle and off highway product sales electronics gross margin increased due to higher sales and favorable product mix partially offset by the adverse effect of u s denominated material purchases at non u s based operations the segment s adjusted operating income increased primarily due to the higher sales and lower sg a expenses resulting in adjusted operating margin for the segment of 9 0 compared with 7 4 in 2017 pst segment sales decreased by 15 7 primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation of 11 9 million or 12 6 as well as lower volumes for audio products and the argentina aftermarket channel pst gross margin improved slightly due to a favorable sales mix related to the lower volume of audio products that resulted in lower direct material costs as a percentage of sales pst adjusted operating margin

2018 sales of 866 2 million bob krakowiak chief financial officer commented we expect revenue to remain relatively flat as compared to 2018 with midpoint revenue guidance of 865 million as we have discussed previously 2019 will materially conclude the ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs creating a revenue headwind of approximately 35 million relative to last year the ramp down of shift by wire in the second half of the year should be offset by new product launches including the rollout of our mirroreye retrofit program with respect to adjusted earnings per share we expect incremental net tariff expenses of 1 2 million in the first half of the year and incremental design and development investment of approximately 5 million in 2019 we expect that favorable product mix structural cost initiatives and operational improvements will approximately offset these additional costs in 2019 leading to flat operating income further the company announced guidance for 2019 adjusted gross margin of 29 5 31 0 midpoint improvement of 55 basis points adjusted operating margin of 7 75 8 75 and adjusted ebitda margin of 11 75 12 75 midpoint improvement of 35 basis points the company announced adjusted earnings per share guidance of 1 70 1 90 and an effective tax rate of 20 0 25 0 krakowiak continued we expect an increased tax rate relative to 2018 we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2019 to be in line with our previously provided guidance of 20 to 25 we expect a 0 15 to 0 20 reduction to adjusted eps relative to 2018 primarily driven by the increased tax rate expected in 2019 resulting in midpoint adjusted eps guidance of 1 80 conference call on the web a live internet broadcast of stoneridge s conference call regarding 2018 fourth quarter and full

gary guidry president and chief executive officer of gran tierra commented in 2018 our returns focused strategy with an emphasis on profitable production growth generated strong financial results gran tierra s high quality operated diversified suite of assets in colombia delivered material year on year improvements in several important metrics including a 15 increase in production a 424 increase in net income a 45 increase in oil and gas sales per boe a 36 improvement in operating netback per boe and an increase of 41 in funds flow from operations per share with our high netback production low declines and large resource base and drilling inventory we demonstrated in 2018 that gran tierra has created a sustainable business model which we expect to be fully funded by forecasted cash from operating activities in 2019 since we operate over 90 of our production and have a 100 wi in 18 out of 27 of our blocks including 16 out of 16 in the putumayo gran tierra also has significant control and flexibility on capital allocation and timing during volatile periods in oil price and capital markets our 1 100 000 net acres in the putumayo 715 000 net acres in the llanos and 87 000 net acres in the middle magdalena valley give gran tierra a significant amount of exploration appraisal and development opportunities for years to come we have a strong position in the three major producing basins in colombia as we look to 2019 and beyond we remain focused on creating long term shareholder value which we believe is achieved by focusing on capital efficiency and returns on invested capital we believe that our focused strategy is delivering results on several fronts and that gran tierra is well positioned for an exciting year of growth in 2019 and beyond as we continue to create

royalties for per boe amounts based on nar production see gran tierra s annual report form 10 k filed on february 27 2019 10 the decrease in average realized price is attributable to the company pricing its revenue at m 1 month plus one and the widening of the brent vasconia differential in 2018 gran tierra sold its oil at the following month average brent price the company benefited from this structure up to the fourth quarter of 2018 however with the sharp decrease in the brent oil price in fourth quarter 2018 this structure impacted the average realized oil price during the quarter as m 1 brent was 60 37 per bbl versus the average monthly brent oil price m of 68 08 per bbl this marketing structure ended in december 2018 in 2019 the company plans to price its oil sales based on m

assumptions of gran tierra including without limitation that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates rig availability the risk profile of planned exploration activities the effects of drilling down dip the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions and the general continuance of current or where

statements in this press release are prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate significantly gran tierra s operations are located in colombia and unexpected problems can arise due to guerrilla activity technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of gran tierra s products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel the risk that current global economic and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program the risk that previously announced acquisitions do not receive required approvals or do not close on time or as anticipated and the risk factors detailed from

contained herein do not necessarily represent fair market value of reserves estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effect of aggregation there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s reserves and future net revenue will be attained and variances could be material all evaluations of future net revenue contained in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are after the deduction of royalties operating costs development costs production costs and abandonment and reclamation costs but before consideration of indirect costs such as administrative overhead and other miscellaneous expenses it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in this press release represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the reserve and associated cash flow information set forth in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided therein boes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet mcf natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value future net revenue future net revenue reflects mcdaniel s forecast of revenue estimated using forecast prices and costs arising from the anticipated development and production of

hurricane michael adjusted ebitda margin would have been 18 3 and 18 6 for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 respectively kraton s results for the fourth quarter 2018 were in line with our expectations reflecting positive underlying demand fundamentals improved profitability in our chemical segment and lower sales volume in our polymer segment primarily reflecting the impact of the previously disclosed production disruption at our wesseling site said kevin m fogarty kraton s president and chief executive officer specifically despite the post hurricane recovery underway at our panama city florida site results for our chemical segment were favorable with margin improvement contributing to 18 growth in adjusted ebitda compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted ebitda for our polymer segment was 44 million down 6 million from the fourth quarter 2017 the multi week production slowdown resulting from the record low levels of the rhine river contributed to lower fourth quarter paving sales additionally in the quarter we also experienced lower sales in our specialty polymers business specifically in china and into north american automotive applications as these markets contracted as we approached year s end said fogarty for the full year 2018 on a consolidated basis adjusted ebitda for 2018 was 378 million compared to 374 million in 2017 chemical segment adjusted ebitda increased 8 to 163 million representing the first full year of adjusted ebitda improvement since we acquired the chemical segment in 2016 the results achieved in 2018 reflect modestly higher sales volume despite the negative effect of hurricane michael in the fourth quarter and the year long trend of improved pricing for tofa tofa derivatives and other high value product streams including sales into our tires markets we expect these favorable market trends to continue into 2019 said fogarty our polymer segment adjusted ebitda was 215 million down 8 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the impact of production challenges in the second half of 2018 lower sales volume into non core paving markets lower overall demand in china and weakness in north american automotive applications as well as higher costs including transportation and logistics costs despite these very real headwinds overall profitability for the polymer segment in 2018 was consistent with our longer term objective of delivering adjusted gross profit in excess of 1 000 per ton moreover we believe underlying business fundamentals across both our performance products and specialty polymers businesses in both the americas and europe remain vibrant as we transition from 2018 in to 2019 only in china and by extension greater asia do we see more immediate term indications of markets continuing to pull back in 2018 our cariflextm volume was up 8 following minimal growth in 2017 which we believe was negatively impacted by a pull forward of volume into 2016 associated with the food and drug administration ban on powdered natural rubber latex in fact based on our current outlook for cariflex we believe we have an opportunity for further expansion commented fogarty with regard to the previously discussed production challenges we have taken steps to address those which were under our direct control and for those more outside our control we believe we have built contingencies into our supply planning for 2019 added fogarty in 2018 consistent with our stated strategies we reduced consolidated net debt by 113 million or by 76 million when excluding the benefit of foreign currency favorability thus exceeding the high end of our recent guidance range of 50 60 million at december 31 2018 our consolidated net debt leverage ratio was below 4 0 turns our capital structure is solid with no scheduled maturities until 2025 and debt reduction will remain a priority in 2019 said fogarty polymer segment three months ended december 31 years ended december 31 2018

addition to the 5 5 billion ntd kfpc loan agreement outlook during 2019 we expect strong underlying business fundamentals including significant volume growth and margin expansion in both our polymer

both segments in 2018 while we strive to off set this cost pressure through a combination of logistics optimization and pricing initiatives we currently expect a net increase in transportation and logistics costs of approximately 10 million 2019 is a significant turnaround year with planned maintenance costs expected to increase by 7 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 lastly during the fourth quarter 2018 we began to experience volume declines in our specialty polymers business associated with slowing consumer demand in asia and in particular china as well as tariff impacts from the ongoing trade negotiations between the u s and china based on our current view we do expect this trend to continue into 2019 we therefore currently anticipate 2019 adjusted ebitda will be in a range of 370 390 million this range does assume recovery under our business interruption policies in 2019 that will offset any lost margin occurring in the first quarter of 2019 associated with hurricane michael at our panama city florida site consistent with the aforementioned 2019 adjusted ebitda range and excluding any activity under the recently announced share buyback program we currently anticipate reducing consolidated net debt excluding the effects of foreign currency by 170 190 million in 2019 we have not reconciled adjusted ebitda guidance to net income loss because we do not provide guidance for net income loss or for items that we do not consider indicative of our on going performance including but not limited to transaction costs and production downtime as certain of these items are out of our control and or cannot be reasonably predicted we have not reconciled consolidated net debt guidance to debt due to high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections that are impacted by future decisions and actions the actual amount of such reconciling items will have a significant impact if they were included in our adjusted ebitda and net debt accordingly a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure guidance to the corresponding u s gaap measures is not available without unreasonable effort use of non gaap financial measures this press release includes the use of both u s gaap and non gaap financial measures the non gaap financial measures are ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted diluted earnings per

condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10 k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 we consider these non gaap financial measures to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by investors securities analysts and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance including period to period comparisons and or that of other companies in our industry further management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and our incentive compensation plan bases incentive compensation payments on our adjusted ebitda performance and attainment of net debt along with other factors these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and in some cases can vary substantially from other measures of our performance you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results under u s gaap in the united states ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for our consolidated results ebitda represents net income loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for each reporting segment ebitda represents operating income before depreciations and amortization disposition and exit of business activities and earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures among other limitations ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt or reflect the significant depreciation and amortization expense associated with our long lived assets and ebitda included herein should not be used for purposes of assessing compliance or non compliance with financial covenants under our debt agreements the calculation of ebitda in our debt agreements includes adjustments such as extraordinary non recurring or one time charges proforma cost savings certain non cash items turnaround costs and other items included in the definition of ebitda in the debt agreements other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure as an analytical tool adjusted ebitda is subject to all the limitations applicable to ebitda we prepare adjusted ebitda by eliminating from ebitda the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our on going performance including the spread between fifo and ecrc but you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items in addition due to volatility in raw material prices adjusted ebitda may and often does vary substantially from ebitda and other performance measures including net income calculated in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue for each reporting segment or on a consolidated basis as applicable because of these and other limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business adjusted diluted earnings per

performance including the spread between fifo and ecrc consolidated net debt and net debt we define net debt for kraton as total debt excluding debt of kfpc less cash and cash equivalents we define consolidated net debt as kraton net debt plus debt of kfpc less kfpc s cash and cash equivalents management uses net debt to determine our outstanding debt obligations that would not readily be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand management believes that using net debt is useful to investors in determining our leverage since we could choose to use cash and cash equivalents to retire debt in addition management believes that presenting kraton s net debt excluding kfpc is useful because kfpc has its own capital structure consolidated net debt leverage ratio the consolidated net debt leverage ratio is defined as consolidated net debt as of the balance sheet date divided by adjusted ebitda for the twelve months then ended our use of this term may vary from the use of

washington feb 27 despite solid growth and continuing job gains the us economy will see inflation fall even further below the central bank s two percent goal at least for a time federal reserve chairman jerome powell said yesterday that forecast added weight to the fed s recent announcements that it will be patient before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate a stance powell re emphasised in semi annual testimony before the us senate banking committee recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the longer run goal of 2 per cent for a time he said the us central bank increased the key policy interest rate four times last year but rising uncertainty especially around the us trade confrontation with china amplified concerns about slowing global growth and fears the fed was moving too aggressively advertisement and with no sign of rising inflation that prompted the fed to signal clearly for the past several weeks that it would tread carefully many economists no longer expect any increases this year while a few say the next move could be a cut if the economy slows further noting the fed s preferred annual inflation measure sits at 1 7 per cent powell said the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook advertisement the danger of having inflation continually below the target is that it saps confidence in the fed s ability to impact the economy especially during a slowdown but the muted inflation pressures and risks on the horizon mean this is a good time to be patient and watch and wait and see how the situation evolves he said in response to a question unlike the reaction to some of his comments late last year markets largely shrugged off powell s testimony to focus on other issues wall street closed slightly lower he remained upbeat about the economic outlook saying fed officials generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market to remain strong economic crosscurrents however crosscurrents and conflicting signals pose a potential danger the predominant risks are slowing global growth particularly china and europe which he cautioned can create headwinds for the united states economy brexit and ongoing trade negotiations also are issues the fed will carefully monitor the united states and china have hammered each other with punitive tariffs on more than us 360 billion rm1 46 trillion in two way trade raising prices to producers and consumers and undercutting economic growth the international monetary fund cites the trade war between the world s two largest economies as a major risk to global growth and cut their growth forecast for this year but president donald trump on monday said he expected to hold a signing summit soon with china s leader xi jinping to resolve the issue and he pushed back a march 1 deadline which would have triggered tariffs to more than double on us 200 billion in chinese exports in the us economy low inflation and sluggish wage growth despite net job gains that averaged 223 000 last year and gdp gaining just under three per cent have continued to baffle economists and the fed powell noted some signs of stronger wage growth particularly in lower skilled jobs but also said disparities persist in the labor market along racial and ethnic lines and also between rural and urban workers they did it anyway however longer run trends such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes also remain important challenges he said and the united states has a lower share of prime age workers participating in the economy than comparable advanced economies which has the effect of holding back productivity which is needed to boost growth he added powell said in addition to programs to promote worker training and dealing with the opioid crisis that keeps people out of the workforce the government needs policies that do not punish people for going back to work he described a training programme in west virginia where women who participated lost the meager benefits they were already getting because many us aid programmes end as soon as the recipients find jobs they had to take a pay cut to go back to work and they did it anyway which is pretty inspiring powell told senators afp

finally we ask any members of the media to be in a listen only mode now i d like to turn the call over to steve ritchie for his comments steve steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thank you steve and good afternoon everyone as you saw the fourth quarter and full year results reported today are consistent with the preliminary results we announced earlier this month overall north america comps were down 8 1 for the fourth quarter and were down 7 3 for the full year international comps decreased 2 6 for the fourth quarter and were down 1 6 for the year the north america results are disappointing to all of us and continue to reflect the consumer sentiment challenges our brand has experienced in the us in addition sales were impacted by the conversions of the company s new loyalty program and ineffective promotions our creative and value offerings have not resonated with consumers in a heightened competitive environment despite these difficulties we remain confident in the long term potential of papa john s our confidence is supported by three factors first we have a differentiated brand papa john s is the quality leader in the pizza category in our case better ingredients do mean better pizza and we think quality will be an attribute that consumers continue to value secondly we have new partners who bring additional expertise and financial resources to help us capitalize on this differentiated market position as previously reported starboard made a 200 million convertible preferred stock investment in the company in early february starboard and our new directors jeff smith and anthony sanfilippo have accomplished significant turnarounds and value creation at other companies in the restaurant retail and consumer industries already jeff has been actively engaged as our new chairman as we evaluate and adjust our plans and strategies for 2019 he is also helping us to stay focused on the value drivers of papa john s namely quality pizza and building strong consumer connections the third factor supporting my confidence in papa john s is the commitment of our team and their continued enthusiasm for our company even with a significant amount of work that allows ahead we know we must improve how we communicate with and connect with our customers it is not just about spending more on advertising and promotions we need to do a better job of showcasing our quality as a real product differentiator while making it easier for our customers to purchase our pizza whenever wherever and however they want in connection with the starboard agreement we have begun to examine investment opportunities within our strategic pillars to reinforce our better ingredients better pizza market position and reinvigorate performance we are in the early stages of this evaluation and do not have specific details to share today however we are making progress within our strategic pillars and this progress is important to the long term success of the company let me spend a few moments updating you on our work in these areas first making people a priority over the past months we have launched a number of initiatives to communicate the importance of people to papa john s and to begin transforming our culture in a positive way as part of this we engaged outside experts to conduct a cultural audit and provide recommendations on actions we need to take to ensure our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion is represented throughout the company the audit is now complete and we have already begun to implement several of the recommendations as an example of the steps we have taken we recently completed the diversity equity inclusion training for our corporate office team members that i mentioned on last quarter s call we have nearly 100 participation rate for the 7 hour workshop and employees rated the experienced 4 5 out of 5 we are now rolling the workshops out to our field team and the program is available to our franchisees at no cost to them in january we hired our first chief people officer marvin boakye marvin has more than 20 years of human resource experience as well as expertise in change management and culture transformation he is leading the implementation of our talent management strategy which includes overseeing people operations compensation and benefits and learning and development as a clear marker for our commitment to employees and their development we recently announced a higher education benefit program with purdue university global the program covers 100 of tuition cost of undergraduate and graduate online degree programs for papa john s 20 000 corporate team members and offers significantly reduced tuition to franchise employees the program allows participating employees to expand their skill set build leadership and management expertise and prepare to advance their careers this is a first of its kind of benefit in the quick service restaurant industry and no one we believe will help improve employee retention especially at the restaurant level and will differentiate papa john s as employer of choice in a competitive employment environment turning now to the work we are doing to improve papa john s brand differentiation we firmly believe that our ingredients are what differentiates papa john s from our competitors however our creative has continued to underplay this attribute with a focus on limited time products loyalty and promotions as a result our brand has not been breaking through the significant marketing dollars that our competitors are spending next month we will be launching tv and digital campaigns that show papa john s leaning into the story of our products and ingredients and doing it in a way that is relevant to millennial and gen z consumers we want to ensure the new generation of pizza consumer to understand the quality foundation of our brand so that we can attract new customers better ingredients better pizza is our brand equity as a part of this brand differentiation work we will offer specialty pizzas that are unique in the market for example in february we featured the philly cheesesteak pizza this has been a fan favorite in the past and we are excited to bring it back to our lineup in march we will introduce permanent menu additions with six handcrafted specialty pizzas including the ultimate pepperoni meatball pepperoni philly cheesesteak fiery buffalo chicken zesty italian trio and the super hawaiian and later this year we will introduce a new hot and honey chicken waffles and waffles pizza ph which was the winner of our pick our next specialty pizza contests that ran in february as you know creating accessible value has also been a focus area for us let me update you on our work in this area late in the fourth quarter we relaunched our papa rewards loyalty program the surge in migration to the new program combined with the free cheesestick introductory offer but unexpected temporary pressure on the average ticket per order however we believe the transition to the new rewards program was important because of the value and variety it provides our customers and the consumer insights we gain in particular we now have the data that allows us to engage in one to one marketing with our customers and by segment which enables us to drive traffic without relying on blanket discounts across all channels for example we executed a successful rewards only promotion that offered free pizza to members who spent 20 during super bowl week these targeted offerings and others exclusive perks that are tailored to the customer also build brand loyalty over time we believe the new papa rewards program will be a positive contributor to our performance and our brand differentiation also during the fourth quarter we began developing additional everyday value offerings that we are now testing in select markets for example we know that certain segments of our business are heavily carryout and we are now testing offerings that speak to those customers we ll be examining the results from these tests and making further adjustments or expansions in the coming quarter as we determine the offerings the best of each value consumer turning to technology our fourth strategic pillar as we ve previously discussed mike nettles and his team have elevated the consumer experience across our digital and mobile platforms and have expanded the way customers can order papa john s our mobile channel is now represent around three quarter of digital sales on our website we deployed mobile first design improvement and an intelligent chatting technology to better engage our customers on our mobile apps which have seen significant growth we ve integrated apple pay and google pay enabled more targeted messaging and made a number of enhancements to simplify the user experience and advance our loyalty program in addition ordering is now available on apple tv amazon alexa and through doordash which currently serves more than 1 300 restaurants and will increase further in the coming months these channels are enabled by apis that allow us to launch future partnerships with unprecedented speed and cost efficiency we are examining the potential for further improvements in our technology including new app capabilities innovative partnerships and additional ways to enhance the delivery experience for our drivers and our customers pizza brings people together and we want our digital and social capabilities to fully reflect this mission and now to our work related to unit economics we have continued our work with a third party efficiency experts and food aggregators to drive both revenue and efficiencies in our restaurant level operations specifically we have identified procedures to improve food cost controls and we have made enhancements to our labor management system that better align labor goals with individual restaurant characteristics in addition we maintain our commitment to supporting the long term financial health of our franchisees we are continuing to provide royalty relief for all domestic traditional restaurants for the first quarter of 2019 furthermore we are extending the high level of support to franchisees and higher cost markets on both coasts of the us we believe these efforts coupled with our review of additional technology solutions that we are currently evaluating for our restaurants will provide opportunities to improve unit economics in 2019 over the past several weeks i ve spent a significant amount of time with our company store operations team to identify and address operational improvements that are needed our team has accepted the challenge of improving sales and operations to set the pace for the north america system we will continue to evaluate our company store performance by market to ensure that we are maximizing long term value before turning the call over to joe i d like to provide an update on international our international business continues to grow sales and restaurant unit counts at a double digit pace as both increased 11 during the quarter for the year we opened 304 international restaurants which was the record breaking performance for our brand our robust expansion continues as we just opened our first restaurant in pakistan and have now entered 12 new countries since 2016 we are now in 47 countries and territories around the globe and we are getting very close to opening international restaurant number 2000 we are pleased that our organizational changes made during 2018 are fostering improved performance while comp sales were still not where we wanted them to be for the quarter we did see marked improvement in the uk and the middle east we continue to see positive signs of a turnaround in both businesses in the international business as a whole as evidenced by the flat january comp sales we previously announced in summary we still have lots of hard work to deliver sustainable growth in the business and you see that in the guidance we announced today which joe will review shortly in detail however we are making progress and our recent investment agreement with starboard represents a strong vote of ph confidence in our company and the opportunities ahead the additional financial resources and the new expertise gains of the agreement better position us to realize these opportunities we are operating and allocating capital with deeper discipline we are focused on people and pizza and our team members and franchisees are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead now let me now turn the call over to joe to discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail joe joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you steve for the fourth quarter we reported a diluted loss per share of 0 44 on a gaap basis compared to diluted earnings per share of 0 81 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decline in our earnings per share was primarily attributable to our special charges which will be described below in addition results were impacted by lower north america comparable sales and the impact of other special items in the prior year comparable quarter including an extra week of operations and the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability resulting from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act during the fourth quarter we incurred special charges of 25 9 million approximately 15 5 million of these costs included support to our north america restaurants through short term royalty reductions for franchisees and a contribution to the national marketing fund in addition we incurred 8 1 million of cost associated with activities of the special committee of the board of directors including legal and advisory costs culminating in the recent strategic investment by starboard value the remainder of the special charges were primarily associated with reimaging costs and other asset write offs for the full year our special charges were 50 7 million excluding these special charges and other special items as detailed in our earnings press release we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of 0 15 on a non gaap basis compared to 0 54 in the fourth quarter of 2017 our fourth quarter net loss on a gaap basis was 13 8 million excluding special items our fourth quarter net income was 4 6 million compared to 18 9 million for the corresponding quarter in 2017 as outlined in our earnings press release 2018 gaap eps was 0 05 as compared to 2 83 for 2017 excluding special items in both years our adjusted eps was 1 34 in 2018 as compared to 2 51 in 2017 consolidated fourth quarter revenues excluding the 53rd week in 2017 decreased 62 7 million or 13 4 primarily driven by lower comparable sales for north america which resulted in lower company owned restaurant revenues lower royalties and decreased north america commissary sales in addition the refranchising of 62 company owned restaurants in north america earlier in the year reduced total revenues on a quarter and year to date basis by approximately 15 million and 42 million respectively as compared to the prior year comparable periods international revenues also decreased due to the refranchising of our company owned operation in china earlier this year now turning to the business units for the fourth quarter domestic company owned restaurants operating margin decreased 9 3 million or 0 6 as a percentage of related revenues primarily due to the impact of lower comparable sales and the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards that revised the method of accounting for the customer loyalty program in addition the 53rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 2 4 million of the decrease north america franchise royalties and fees decreased 9 2 million or 34 1 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the 5 5 million of short term royalty reductions granted to our north america franchisees and further reduced due to negative comparable sales in addition the 53rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 2 million of the decrease north america commissary operating margin decreased 5 5 million or 2 4 as a percentage of related revenues due to the decline in north america restaurants sales and due to the required reporting of 2 6 million in franchise restaurant equipment incentives under the new revenue recognition standards which was previously included in our g a expenses in addition the 53rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 1 7 million of the decrease for the quarter our international operating margin decreased 2 5 million due to lower new restaurant openings fees and lower revenues from the united kingdom quality control center due to the required reporting of franchise restaurant equipment incentives under the new revenue recognition standards in addition the 53rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 700 000 of the decrease as a percentage of international revenues the operating margin increased 0 7 primarily due to the divestiture of our china operations for the fourth quarter g a cost increased 20 2 million primarily due to the previously mentioned special charges the remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher technology initiative costs and the 1 5 million contribution to the newly formed papa john s foundation these increases were partially offset by the previously mentioned required reporting of franchise restaurant equipment incentives net interest expense increased 3 2 million in the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average outstanding debt including the impact of share repurchases made through 2018 as well as higher interest rates at the end of the year our outstanding debt balance was 625 million subsequent to year end we have used the starboard investment proceeds to reduce our revolving line of credit while we execute our disciplined approach to capital allocation and review our opportunities to further invest in the five strategic priorities steve previously discussed for the full year our effective tax rate was 44 9 which is higher than the 24 1 effective rate for 2017 the increase in the tax rate is primarily due to the impact of lower pre tax earnings in 2018 and the required recapture of operating losses associated with the divestiture of our china operation our free cash flow which is a non gaap measure that we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures was approximately 30 8 million for the full year as compared to 82 4 million in 2017 this was primarily due to the company s lower net income in 2018 we paid a cash dividend of 7 1 million or 0 225 per common share during the fourth quarter for a total of 29 million of dividends paid in 2018 the full year dividend was 0 90 per share subsequent to the fourth quarter on january 30 2019 our board of directors declared a first quarter dividend of 0 225 per common share during 2018 the company repurchased approximately 2 7 million shares of stock for an aggregate cost of approximately 158 million the company did not purchase any shares at early august turning now to our outlook for 2019 we expect our gaap eps to be between zero and 0 50 for the full year including anticipated special charges of 30 million to 50 million which will largely be assistance to the north america franchise system and costs associated with the special committee of the board of directors we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between 1 and 1 20 excluding special charges north america comparable sales are expected to be between negative 1 and negative 5 while international comparable sales are expected to be flat to positive 3 we anticipate global growth of 75 to 150 net units we are also planning to invest between 45 million and 50 million on capital projects in 2019 our preliminary tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 21 and 20 finally block cheese prices are projected to be in the low to mid 1 60 range i ll now turn the call back over to steve ritchie for his final remarks before we take q a steve steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thank you joe just to say ph i am confident papa john s is positioned for long term success as we work to better showcase our quality and improve the customer experience with the additional financial resources and new expertise gain through the partnership with starboard we will be making targeted investments directed to the highest return initiatives across our five strategic pillars we look forward to unveiling additional product menu advertising and customer engagement strategies to four to five ph papa john s position as the better ingredients better pizza company as always we appreciate your continued support and i will now turn the call over to the operator for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from line of alex slagle from jefferies you may begin alexander russell slagle jefferies llc analyst hey guys thanks for the question just wondering ph if you could provide some commentary around the february same store sales trends in the us and maybe what gives you confidence in the range the comp range you outlined in the guidance specifically if there is any measurable metrics you re following maybe brand sentiment or something like that steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer sure alex it s steve so thanks for the question so just stepping back a bit certainly challenging into 2018 and a very difficult start in january so i call that out because i think there s a couple of more short term non recurring factors in the business and kind of our outlook on the full year of 2019 which we called out some of the which we re very excited about the long term potential of the loyalty program but it did provide extensive pressure on check when we coupled that with the we wanted to obviously gain visibility and awareness of the program to garner our attention and increase the enrollment piece we coupled that with the new cheesestick promotion and then we layered on a pretty extensive value for papa john s in january with the two medium promotion at 6 each so i think a number of those things provided pressure in late december and january but moving forward to your question in february we re seeing very solid improvement from february from the january and we certainly have incorporated that into our full year outlook which we re not proud necessarily of the negative 1 to negative 5 but we do know the first half of 2019 is going be more challenging than the back half of 2019 but we re very pleased with the progress thus far here in february on the backs of getting back to talking about quality getting back to talking about interesting ingredients and an interesting product that being our philly cheesesteak pizza and that s been supported by complete new marketing and creative campaign from the team here so excited about the outlook alexander russell slagle jefferies llc analyst thanks and then on the development front if you could provide an idea around the expected gross openings or closings in 2019 that s baked into that net guidance steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer sure joe you want to talk a little bit about development joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean we are not going to give the specific numbers on that obviously and kind of look at where we are this year and hopefully that will give you a pretty good guidepost steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer alex it s steve i just add to that yeah we probably don t want to give details on the breakdown of that but i think you look at the overall gross performance as i outlined in my opening comments 304 units in the international side our expectations are similar those kind of track rates that we ve experienced in the international side we know that we re going to continue to experience some pressure on closures domestically but i would call out that a good chunk of the closures that we experience in 2018 was the non traditional venues so that is more of a non recurring event so we do expect a step down in closures domestically in 2019 just because of that event and obviously the quicker we can turn the sales around the more optimal will have potential on the overall net units hitting at the higher end of our range there alexander russell slagle jefferies llc analyst okay thanks for that operator thank you and our next question comes from line of peter saleh from btig you may begin peter mokhlis saleh btig llc analyst great thanks i just wanted to ask about the marketing budget i think steve you had mentioned next month you guys are going to launch a new campaign what is the expected marketing budget in 2019 versus 2018 will you be investing more dollars into the marketing budget and how do you plan to spend it how is the cadence looking for 2019 versus 2018 is it going to be heavier spend in the second and third quarters or how should we think about your marketing dollars spent this year steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer sure sure peter it s steve so i will touch on it a bit so i mean first off just stepping back on our overall national marketing fund contribution rate in 2018 that was 4 5 that did step up the first day of january to 4 7 4 75 obviously that contribution rate is driven off of same store sales and overall units so there is some pressure on the overall side of the revenue is coming in and that contribution rate that drives it but because of the increase in the contribution rate we do think we get close to parity levels on the overall access to our national marketing fund dollars we will have additional pressure as you would expect from an inflation standpoint on the media side but the team has done a nice job they are really thinking about the cadence of how we plan out each of the quarters i don t want to get into specific cadences of the investments within the quarter but it will be a well thought allocation of those investments we will still be as you would expect spending money into television spend the money into digital and social we ll be evaluating things like our partnerships that we have and also looking to expand that in potential influencers to help support the brand last year in the fourth quarter pji papa john s international did make an investment of 10 million into the national marketing fund so that certainly is a headwind as we get look into 2019 but those are part of that evaluation process with the 200 million investment as we talked about half of that being invested back into the business those holes will be areas that mike nettles and myself and the rest of the team will be looking at how do we evaluate where we make the right investments to take up some of the shortfalls we may have in the marketing front and making sure that we re making the right investments to support unit economics and the franchisees and primarily obviously to get sales back to the levels that we need to get them at so i d say a lot of that and mike i don t know if i you want to add any color just to give a little bit commentary around where we re at from the growth team perspective michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer sure thanks steve hi peter so really the only thing i would probably add to what steve just said is our spend will probably be a little different this year than it was last year clearly if you look back at 2018 we had quite a few challenges on the pr side of the equation and the sentiment side of the equation so we had to put a lot more effort probably into that then maybe commercial retail marketing this year it continues we ve actually done quite a bit on the brand reputation side of the equation but you re going to see a lot more commercial advertising for the brand and very different with the launch of papa rewards peter as we shared with you and others in the past a big part of that is actually the introduction of one to one marketing and so a lot of that marketing now goes through our own individual proprietary channels as opposed to us having to go out through maybe the top of the funnel kind of traditional marketing but nonetheless you will see a heightened level of commercial messaging a lot more on the one to one which really gives us a very different marketing mix in 2019 than we have in 2018 peter mokhlis saleh btig llc analyst great and then just i know you guys received 200 million from starboard 100 million is already accounted for the other 100 million is that anticipate to sit on the balance sheet or do you guys expect to use some of that for some of these investments could some of this going to the marketing fund or how do you guys anticipate using those funds over time joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah peter this is joe we will start off as you said paying down the revolving line of credit but the nice thing is obviously we can access that back so the debt will initially go down but then under the revolver we can access that and make the necessary investments that once we test improve that those investments have a good return we ll destroy that back and use those accordingly steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer and peter just add on to the latter part of that question on where we going to spend the money so we are still we re only three weeks in so we want to make sure that we are working with all of our stakeholders to assess what are the best places to be investing this money but we ve talked about our five strategic priorities being people brand the value in the product side technology and then of course unit economics those are very broad and there s a number of initiatives that are layer up within the growth team to support those so we are in that the assessment phase of evaluating each one of those initiatives but we know the areas where we need to invest is to improve team member experience and improve customer experience and the lagging indicator of that obviously being sales so we need to get the sales turnaround to improve unit economics we know we ll be able to do that by making sure we re really leaning into the things that are going to improve again team member experience and customer experience so as we make decisions as we get through our assessment phase here certainly we ll be communicating those things out to the street i don t have a timeline on that yet because we want to be very thoughtful and to joe s point there will be a lot of test improve out scaling things from a small standpoint in individual markets before we do anything from a national perspective peter mokhlis saleh btig llc analyst great and then just my last question steve i think you mentioned more menu innovation and potentially some more news on the value front can you give us a little bit more specifics in terms of what you may be testing what you may be thinking about from either a carryout or delivery perspective on the value side steven r coke vice president investor relations and strategy sure sure it s steve i ll start and then i ll ask mike to jump in as well because he s got spent a lot of his time here lately on the product side and we get there is a lot of excitement and energy around the things that we re evaluating as the operator as you know my long track record in operations looking through the lens of what also is that it is not going to create operations complexity in our business model always looking through the lens of simplicity but trying to make sure that we are connecting with things with our consumers so the first piece is it might not sound like a lot but this is the most extensive product launch that we ve had in the history of the brand in terms of number of pizzas so the first one i would highlight is the six handcrafted specialty pizzas that are soft launching this week to national our media supported launch next week those six handcrafted specialty pizzas i called out in my prepared remarks they include a number of new premium ingredients and we think the uniqueness of that will also be very good value proposition because we re offering them at 12 for not only the six new specialty pizzas but we re extending that to all of our specialty pizzas and as i talked about february performance improving that is the same promotion but with just the philly cheesesteak pizza and all specialties in period two here in february so nice performance from that so we want to continue along that as far as additional value and product side we are i think we re everyone is well aware that we have been testing sandwiches out in various markets across the country continuing to test and read and learned to understand how that may play within our value proposition and i ask mike to talk about a little bit just strategically how we re thinking about it from a product standpoint and some of the other areas that will be targeting and how we re looking at value in general mike because i know this is a big part of the growth teams work michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer sure so peter if we ve always stood for better ingredients and better pizza that s a big part of our brand heritage i think we in years past maybe we ve not spoken to that in a way that s resonated directly with the consumers as we need to and so we re really leaning heavily back into that we believe that better ingredients do make for a better pizza and quite frankly our customers deserve a better pizza and an overall elevated better pizza experience so a big part of that starts with the product steve just said with all the new specialties coming out but if you follow us on social media you can see that we ve really been engaging our customers with some fun ideas help us choose our next really cravable kind of pizza item the winner right now of that contest has been the hot honey chicken and waffle pizza so you can expect to see hit that hitting our menu at some point soon some of these new creations may be introduced as ltos but just like the philly cheesesteak pizza was a fan favorite and came back in this past period it remains on the menu now as one of our new signature specialty items that are out there so we re going to lean heavy into really trying to come up with some bold and some creative pizza types that you can get at papa john s but you can actually enjoy the better ingredients that go along with them that really help us to tell that story if you ve also been kind of following the brand for at least the last two periods you ve seen two very clear messages from us 6 and 12 and that s very intentional you ll probably see that moving forward in the periods yet to come as we tried to test some of these value constructs we hear from our customers a perception sometimes that maybe papa john s has been priced too high in the past relative to the overall experience that they receive so as we lean on better pizzas we really lean in on the operating experience and the customer experience we re also going to lean in heavily on saying hey there is an accessible value construct that you can come in and get a pizza for 6 we led that in period one with two medium one tops for 6 each and in period two that s a carryout special which is also medium one top for 6 may not always be the pizza maybe something else but that s a big part of us testing those value constructs with very high customer acceptance and specifically new customer acceptance are actually being targeted in such a way that we re driving new customers to the brand and it s working out very well for us the 12 side of the equation 12 specialty for the philly cheesesteak in period two that became a 12 any that now leads us into period three where we re finding a very high overwhelming support for our great handcrafted specialties that we ve got out there the 12 price point seems to resonate well customer see it as not only accessible but as you can imagine it actually drives a nice check for us as well so we re happy with that as a starting point but we re going to continue innovating on both of those things to really make sure that is not just a better pizza and overall better pizza experience peter mokhlis saleh btig llc analyst all right thank you very much michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer peter steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thank you peter operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of alton stump from longbow research you may begin alton kemp stump longbow research llc analyst yes thank you and good afternoon steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer hey alton alton kemp stump longbow research llc analyst i just wanted to ask i apologies if i missed what you said exactly in the comments but as far as the concessions given the franchisees i think you mentioned steve that they re going to at least run through the end of the first quarter so are those just for the next three months as far as the commitment there and then you can see where you re at as sort of 2q or is it longer commitment then just all rest of the first quarter steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer sure alton it s steve yes in my prepared remarks i did call out that we have made formal commitments in concessions of royalty relief through the first quarter for all of our franchisees in the domestic business but i did also call out in the first half of the year we do expect to have continued unit economic pressure as we continue to push some of the marketing initiatives to get the sales going the right direction so within the outlook for our guidance we provided ourselves with headroom to be able to find the right level of support to provide to our franchisees throughout the rest of 2019 but focusing in on what we believe will be the more challenging part of the year through that first half alton kemp stump longbow research llc analyst okay makes sense steve and just one more and i ll hop back in the queue just from a market perspective i was kind of think about how is your efforts to fixed brand image versus what s going out there with new products new promotions how do you balance that in other words like it feel that there s more brand fixing that you need to do first for more aggressive promotions or you think you can do both at the same time over the course of the current year steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer sure alton it s steve and i ll let i m going to let mike comment on this because this is something that obviously that we have to balance and we ve had an interesting challenge here over the last year and trying to find and strike the right balance of product versus things that we can do to help on the sentiment side we have to do both so i think what you ve seen represented from us and i will call out february without getting into specific financial results but we did we ve done some things with making our first official grant of the papa john s foundation that we have not officially announced publicly yet the start up of the papa john s foundation but we made a 500 000 grant to then a college so i call that out because it s around doing good things in the communities that we serve it was very very well received and help make significant sentiment improvement marks for the brand it can t be one thing it has to be a cadence of multiple things so we ve got for the full calendar year 2019 continuing to have plans on things from a public relations standpoint but just doing good work at the same time a lot of the work that we ve been doing on diversity equity and inclusion as i called out internally a lot of internal work happy to be through the conclusion of the cultural audit but the cultural audit concluded in gave us in extensive lineup of recommendations that marvin boakye our new chief people officer and victoria russell our chief of diversity equity and inclusion will be leading the efforts to work on the internal i fundamentally believe the more work that she can do on the internal culture the more of that output will translate into overall better consumer sentiment for the brand and i will tell you that we ve had our some challenges over the last year but we found the opportunity to think about partnerships and influencers because of the work that we have been doing over the last several months at the same time to your question on product you have to figure out how to do both because we do have to have exciting value proposition innovative products out there leaning in on the quality story so that we think for the 2019 calendar year we ve built out a roadmap with the appropriate level of multiple things to move the brand forward mike i said a lot of there but i don t know if there s anything that you d like to add on to that just to complement michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer the only thing i would add because i think steve did a good job of kind of outlining is if in our business one of the things we are really focusing on in late 2018 and certainly leading into 2019 and beyond is the quality and the better story but not just to tell it in terms of our ingredients tell it in terms of the happiness and kind of real human kind of interaction basis so everything from the work that we re doing as steve said inside the organization with our people and with those voices that we talked about and the voices campaign the commercial that had a lot of success back in the last quarter of 2018 to making sure we continue to tell people the story of why they want to buy papa john s not just for the better product that it is but because we re good corporate citizens because we have a good placement out there in the communities that we support and we have happy and engaged people inside the store servicing the needs of those customers accordingly so we know that this is a long term effort this is something we re going to have to keep pulsing on but back to the calendaring function that steve just talked about the team actually set up the full year in advance and we ve got a very strategic set of kind of master messaging that goes out each period with some underlayments to go with it and really trying to push at an integrated level with all channels whether it s broadcast television or social media you will see many of these messages again and again and when we say better ingredients we don t just mean what s on top of the pizza but actually who is making the pizza and who we re serving it too that s a big part of our messaging moving forward alton kemp stump longbow research llc analyst great thank you steve and mike steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thanks alton operator and our next question comes from line of greg badishkanian from citi you may begin frederick charles wightman citigroup inc analyst hey guys it s actually fred wightman on for greg the february commentary was really helpful it s nice to hear that things sound like they ve improved but should we be expecting any impact from the easter shift as we move through the rest of the quarter joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah fred this is joe smith looking at that and also just the change in new year s eve it s actually gone not be too significant for us probably less than 1 impact on our comparable sales frederick charles wightman citigroup inc analyst okay and then that s helpful and then understanding that you re still seeing some ticket headwinds from the loyalty shift what are you guys assuming for pricing for the year steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer fred it s steve we don t typically breakout check and traffic on an annual basis but i will tell you that we are going to be very focused on getting traffic going the right direction we still have a relatively low share within a very fragmented large category about a 40 billion category so we re going to be very focused on getting traffic moving back in the right direction we do know the layer to your point the loyalty program and what that s going to do is a balancing act of how we will appropriately plan out the cadence of all of our promotions through the year so we know we got to get traffic growing but we do want to have stability in our check and what we had in period one that i call it out was instability in our check because of the multiple things all at the same time so we wouldn t expect that to be a drag on what we would deem to be appropriate kind of check averages on a go forward basis frederick charles wightman citigroup inc analyst okay and then the gap between company owned and franchise did come down a little bit this quarter how should we think about that going forward steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer fred this is steve again so are we we had a long track record of very solid performance as you would know i think the cagr on a five year basis through 2017 and excluding 2018 was about 5 per year for our corporate restaurants so they ve had a tremendous run and they were surpassed our franchise results by 1 to 2 per year on an average year so the franchise folks have closed the gap a bit but there are a number of factors within the individual corporate markets that have caused some what i would call to be more short term pressure on the overall comps i don t believe as we get through the full year that you re going to see the kind of spread that we ve experienced over the last couple of quarters we do have some work to do in our corporate restaurants we have had significant pressure not only in sales but on overall margins but in the conversations i called out in my prepared remarks the planning energy and drive from our corporate operations leadership team getting back to the basics and the fundamentals that drove the performance for multiple years there is a level of energy and confidence that we ll get back to those levels so i fully expect the gaps to close as we progress throughout the year frederick charles wightman citigroup inc analyst very helpful thanks guys steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thanks fred operator and our next question will come from the line of will slabaugh from stephens you may begin william everett slabaugh stephens inc analyst yeah thanks guys had a question on the check and the traffic just given the movement that you talked about in the past a couple of periods so it sounds like that taken impact you mentioned was multiple discount that layered on one another i wondered if you could quantify that in any way versus the recovery that you ve seen more recently and i guess maybe kind of behind the question is how traffic behave during that period do we see fairly similar traffic results and it was mainly just ticket that was driving it down and how you feel about sort of the traffic growth that you re seeing right now i guess relative to your expectations and if it s behaved as you would have expected along with that february recovery that you talked about steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer sure will it s steve i mean i would just say that overall disappointment both in traffic and in check in december and january we saw a slight uptick maybe in the traffic side but there wasn t the kind of lift that we would expect for the check declines that we experienced in december and january with that being said turning the page to february we ve got back to as i called out more stable levels of what we would be looking for on the check side and seeing significant improvement from january february on the overall transaction level on a per week basis by store and as you look at that on a comp perspective so i think you got to kind of exclude some of the things that happened in december and january because there s so many things that are moving in that month and a half period of time we are thinking about moving forward and we like what we ve seen in february we think we can balance out that with based on the cadence of the promotions that we have as we think about the rest of this year and again we re going to be very focused on getting traffic moving back in the right direction because we donated a lot of share in 2018 and we certainly want to get that share back over a period of time william everett slabaugh stephens inc analyst got it and then one more question if i could your menu innovation you ve been talking about it sounds like you re capitalizing here first as you sort of kind of reemerge here as on your brand equity is around quality so i m curious how you plan to treat some of these more specialty pizzas if that 12 price point is something that you plan to sort of hang with royal it sounds like that it is because you mentioned 12 and 6 or if there is room there if you feel like there is room to go up if you go more specialty and how you feel like the brand could play if you did go more premium and then kind of what that means for value if 6 ends up being your national value message does that make sense for every market or might value be more regionalized or localized down the road michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer hey will it s mike i ll take some of that and my colleagues here can chime in but basically from our perspective we re still in test mode 6 and 12 seem to be working very well for us together more so than maybe individually they are targeted a very different customer segments for using our newly developed marketing technology to really go after those segments with various types of messaging and promotional offers that really pulse on those and it s working really well it s been a great formula so far still has room for tweaking and we re not sure that those will be the final numbers that we had on forever however having said that there will always be opportunities for franchisees in different markets that have some opportunity for upsells that s a feature that is really important to us in the digital systems which would allow our franchisee to actually have a little more local flavor on what they upsell you to or what you re being up sold from they also have quite a bit of control over the pricing of that be it just extra ingredients or would you like to papa size that and take it to an extra large pizza as opposed to the large pizza so there ll be plenty of opportunity to keep pushing for a little higher premium and we ve not ruled out that there could even be a tier above the 12 side of the equation clearly we have some of that now with our extra large pizza it s one of the few in the industry that actually is there and performs and it s actually a great ticket draw for us but there ll be some other opportunities for us to continue pulsing around that as well so while it s working i don t want to say that that is our absolute future we ll continue to looking at it and clearly looking for opportunities to steve s point they not just drive transactions but also drive check as we look for opportunities to put more out in front of the customers that they really want steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer and will it s steve just a just call out one more thing and mike said this before but i think it is very important as the introduction of the new loyalty program that is a complete value platform so it is a richer program it provides more value to the consumer and also gives them the flexibility of being able to order anything on our menu now so we certainly want to highlight that as part of our overall frequency driver for the brand from the loyalty and value perspective at the same time we do know that we got to have a real balance and rigor out there as you called out on the individual markets some of our high wage market so we will be leveraging some of the new tech within the loyalty program to be more specific targeted segmenting out building out some of our one to one capabilities so that we re not broad brushing value or value is not a need state from a consumer perspective so we re excited about some of the new tech that we have and we are excited about how we might target that and when we say 6 it might not mean one item at 6 it might be requirement of multiple items purchased at 6 and this may not be pizza so we just know that we need to have a value layer out there that gets provide the opportunity for consumers to get access so excited about the learnings that we ve seen thus far but to mike s point we ve not made final decisions on exactly how we intend to have that 6 layer unlike we like what we have seen and we will obviously can continue at least through period three in march there with the 12 specialty piece michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer yeah will just one final comment on that you would have seen this if you were papa john s customer during the super bowl we ve done bounce back promotion that s fairly common in this industry but for the first time we actually executed a bounce back program through the new papa rewards system and so it was literally no need to enroll you bought a pizza from us during the period around super bowl and you are automatically enrolled for a bounce back of a free pizza in the following period and there really was a high usage of that at a customer level but it also gave us very directed ability to communicate to that customer what rewards they had they were dropped into their wallet they didn t have to remember a promo code it was all automated through the system really a good example of why we re going to continue playing with the right price points because we have new technology and capabilities to really maximize on this and deliver some really surprise and delight on the consumer side but also drive some incremental check and profitability opportunities for us on the business side william everett slabaugh stephens inc analyst got it thanks for all that guys steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thank you will operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chris o cull from stifel you may begin christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst thanks good afternoon guys i apologize if i missed some of your responses i ve been bouncing back and forth between calls but why steve why do you think the philly cheesesteak promotion is working better in february than it did last fall steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer we didn t run the philly cheesesteak last fall but we our lto products actually christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer in the past well it actually performed quite well in the past and the last time that we did run that specific promotion and some of our ltos in the past with the specialty pizzas have performed at the mix expectations but we ve seen very nice incremental new customer traffic coming from those promotions and i think the best way to compare it against though is that what we did in period one trying to have parity value coupled with loyalty coupled with the free cheesesteak promotion drove extensive pressure on check and i e negatively impacted the overall sales piece but also it s not just about the philly cheesesteak pizza i think the marketing teams did a really nice job on the creative execution so it really does highlight the quality of our ingredients we have a new media buying agency that we brought on last year that s some of that work making sure that we re allocating the right investments targeting the right consumer so it s really a recipe for success as opposed to it s all about one product that s drove the overall performance and improvement we ve seen in february and it s not a limited time offer so we ve done a complete refresh of our overall specialty line up here and introduced new pizzas and also took off some of our underperforming specialty pizzas as well michael r nettles executive vice president chief operating and growth officer to that same point it s mike chris just to add on to it last time we would have run philly cheesesteak and it did perform well it was marketed the same way to everybody in the papa john s universe so we just did a broadcast marketing like we always did and let that kind of speak for itself this time we still did that with some really compelling creative to go along with it a lot of messaging around it but again leveraging all the investments we made in 2018 with new marketing technology there was a massive amount of targeted marketing we went after people that have bought it before we went after people that look like the people that had bought it before through database marketing and the one to one marketing and we found really good reception by using that new technology to try to drive more customers into the brand that we thought would really like it by telling that great ingredients story and that better pizza story so the technology is working really well for us on the marketing side that s a big reason why the growth team was built to merge both the technology pieces and the marketing pieces together so that we have much higher efficacy in our overall messaging and that s just starting we ve got a lot of room to play with but quite frankly we re really pleased with how that technology is working so far christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay that s helpful and then joe do you know what percentage of domestic franchisees had a loss last year in 2018 joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris i mean we re not going to get into specific information on that obviously we have seen some of our franchisees face some more pressures we have some metrics that we use and that is some of the metrics that we use to know how to go in and help some of the specific franchisees that might need additional help steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer and i ll just add to it chris it s steve i mean i think that this what we intended to do there and i think that pretty successfully is bridge some of the challenges from a unit economic perspective with the multiple things that we didn t support last year so if we didn t do those things or would have been a much higher percentage of stores that would have been below that breakeven point we have a percentage of stores that are below the breakeven point that we are constantly trying to drive the top line improve their execution and overall unit economics but as we looked at it we are how can we provide levels of support to the bridge solutions to improving the overall sales in addition to making investments like we did last year in the national marketing fund the 10 million so it s a balancing act but clearly depicted by the increasing number of closures last year gives you a feel for the amount of pressure that was occurring on the business model last year christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst no it s helpful and then joe i know in the past the company has targeted a 6 commissary margin do you have an expectation for the commissary margin this year joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean chris again we re not going to get into specific percentage margins but again we are always going to keep that relatively consistent it is lower last year as again we made some we reduced our margin to assist our franchisees i think you see that again we continue to evaluate it but we ve always tried to maintain something consistent that we think is fair to our franchisees and us and we re not going to obviously increase that significantly steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer yeah chris i mean i think it s i mean it s fair question as we did in the fourth quarter last year to joe s point we did provide a level of relief on the food service side but based on the transaction level that we experienced the margins at the food service side of the business is clearly driven by transactions and peace counts and when we saw those declines we didn t feel it appropriate to raise prices for our franchisees so that was part of the level of support that we provided that was a one off we have had a very consistent verbal agreement with our franchisees for many many years we want to continue to honor that verbal agreement and to joe s point maintain a consistent margin prior to the 2018 piece and use the other pieces to help continue to support our franchisees and again assessing where we may make investments to fix the top line so i would expect if you look at your modeling we thinking about margin percentages looking more similar to pre 2018 levels christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay and then how should we think about g a expense if you exclude the special charges for this year joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we re going to be very consistent again if you take the special charges out of both years and i think you re going to be in a fairly consistent place chris christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst in terms of dollars joseph h smith senior vice president and chief financial officer terms of dollars and the percentage yeah but it s more on the dollar christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay okay and then should we expect the royalty relief impact in the first half of the year to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer so chris it s steve so the fourth quarter is going to very look very similar to what we have planned out for the first quarter we are still evaluating what the we intend to do beyond the first quarter how much support where we might apply that support but again we as you might have heard in a question earlier believe that the first half of the year will be more challenging so royalty abatement or support to franchisees is likely to occur more predominantly in the first half of the year and as leveraging investments more throughout the year and more into the back half of the year as we assess and evaluate some of these tests to get the sales moving in the right direction so we have not made a final decision on exact numbers but i will tell you that we gave ourselves enough headroom within the guidance outlook to be able to incorporate what was what will be necessary to support our franchisees christopher thomas o cull stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay great thanks guys steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer thanks chris operator thank you and i m showing no further questions in the queue i will turn the call back to steve ritchie for closing remarks steve m ritchie president and chief executive officer so i just want to thank you guys for joining the call today i don t want to lose sight of the fact that we have a lot of positive and a lot of excitement

million higher than the top end of the company s annual guidance range reaffirmed in the company s third quarter 2018 earnings release the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the

self storage facilities underlying certain of our development investments as well as the timing of stabilization of facilities in which we have invested timing of fair value appreciation is heavily dependent upon construction progress and the timing of construction completion both of which are subject to factors outside the control of the company s development partners moreover when the company acquires the developer s interest in a self storage project that the company has financed the company no longer accounts for such investment on the fair value method so acquisitions of developer interests have a potential material effect on future fair value recognized in our financial statements as such the amount and exact timing of fair value recognition is subject to change refer to the

2018 said chief executive officer david roberts post quarter end we completed an overnight common equity offering raising approximately 57 million of net proceeds we have successfully deployed this capital taking advantage of the current investment landscape to invest at favorable risk adjusted returns the fourth quarter of 2018 was volatile as agency mbs spreads widened and risk assets underperformed benchmarks in response to a reversal in sentiment around the path of the economy in 2019 said chief investment officer t j durkin the risk off sentiment was driven by uncertainties surrounding fed policies softening of select manufacturing data the absence of optimism on trade negotiations with china and the government shutdown since year end there has been a modest recovery in the market for risk assets and in the agency basis against this backdrop during the quarter we were able to deploy capital into re performing mortgage loans and non qm pools alongside other angelo

measure our presentation of core earnings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies who may use different calculations this non gaap measure should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap our gaap financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated during the three months ended december 31 2018 we determined that we should modify our definition and calculation of core earnings a non gaap financial measure to exclude realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of arc home s net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights held at arc home our subsidiary licensed mortgage originator the modification to our definition and calculation of core earnings is consistent with our treatment of excluding realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of excess msrs held directly by us we define core earnings a non gaap financial measure as net income loss available to common stockholders excluding i unrealized gains losses on securities loans derivatives and other investments and realized gains losses on the sale or termination of such instruments ii beginning with q2 2018 as a policy change any transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of our investments iii beginning with q3 2018 concurrent with a change in the company s business any depreciation or amortization expense related to the company s sfr portfolio iv beginning with q3 2018 as a policy change accrued deal related performance fees payable to arc home and third party operators to the extent the primary component of the accrual relates to items that are excluded from core earnings such as unrealized and realized gains losses and v beginning with q4 2018 and applied retrospectively as a policy change realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of arc home s net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights items i through v above include any amounts related to those items held in affiliated entities management considers the transaction related expenses referenced in ii above to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition or disposition and does not view them as being part of its core operations management views the exclusion described in v above to be consistent with how it calculates core earnings on the remainder of its portfolio as defined core earnings include the net interest income and other income earned on the company s investments on a yield adjusted basis including tba dollar roll income or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent one of the company s objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio and management uses core earnings to help measure this objective management believes that this non gaap measure when considered with its gaap financials provides supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate the company s current core performance using the same measure that management uses to operate the business this metric in conjunction with related gaap measures provides greater transparency into the information used by the company s management team in its financial and operational decision making a reconciliation of gaap net income loss available to common stockholders to core earnings for the three months ended

on core earnings for that period the company s policy with respect to deal related performance fees was modified in q3 2018 footnotes 1 diluted per share figures are calculated using weighted average outstanding shares in accordance with gaap per share figures are calculated using a denominator of all outstanding common shares including all shares granted to our manager and our independent directors under our equity incentive plans as of quarter end book value uses stockholders equity less net proceeds of the company s 8 25 series a and 8 00 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock as the numerator undepreciated book value per share is a non gaap book value metric which adds accumulated depreciation and amortization back to book value to present an adjusted book value that incorporates the company s single family rental property portfolio at its undepreciated basis this metric allows management to consider the investment portfolio exclusive of non cash adjustments 2 the economic return on equity for the quarter represents the change in book value per share from september 30 2018 to december 31 2018 plus the common dividends declared over that period divided by book value per share as of september 30 2018 the economic return on equity for 2018 represents the change in net book value per share from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 plus the dividends declared

including any net tba position by our gaap stockholders equity at quarter end total financing at quarter end includes financing arrangements through affiliated entities exclusive of any financing utilized through ag arc llc plus the payable on all unsettled buys less the financing on all unsettled sells securitized debt and any net tba position at cost total financing excludes any financing arrangements and unsettled trades on u s treasuries 7 this represents the weighted average monthly cprs published during the quarter for our in place portfolio during the same period any net tba position is excluded from the cpr calculation 8 the company estimates duration based on third party models different models and methodologies can produce different effective duration estimates for the same securities duration does not include our equity interest in ag arc llc or our investment in sfr 9 the yield on our debt investments represents an effective interest rate which utilizes all estimates of future cash flows and adjusts for actual prepayment and cash flow activity as of quarter end the yield on our sfr portfolio represents annualized net operating income for the quarter divided by its carrying value gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization net operating income on our sfr portfolio is comprised of rental income and other sfr related income less property operating and maintenance expenses and property management fees our yield calculation excludes cash held by the company and excludes any net tba position the calculation of weighted average yield is weighted based on net carrying value 10 the cost of funds at quarter end is calculated as the sum of i the weighted average funding costs on total financing outstanding at quarter end and ii the weighted average of the net pay rate on our interest rate swaps the net receive rate on our treasury long positions the net pay rate on our treasury short positions and the net receivable rate on our io index derivatives if any both elements of the cost of funds at quarter end are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements and securitized debt outstanding at quarter end excluding financing arrangements associated with u s treasury positions the cost of funds excludes any net tba position 11 the management fee percentage at quarter end is calculated by annualizing management fees recorded during the quarter and dividing by quarter end stockholders equity 12 the other operating expenses percentage at quarter end is calculated by annualizing other operating expenses recorded

jackson pgt innovation s ceo and president jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thanks brad and good morning everyone fiscal year 2018 was a transformative year for pgt innovations and i m very pleased with our results on slide 4 we have included some background information on our company for those of you who may be new to the story and i will highlight some key facts our full year sales of 698 million represent a 37 increase over 2017 with 27 of our year over year growth achieved organically with the acquisition of western window systems last year we became a national leader in the premium window and door space the acquisition expanded our geographic footprint and rebalanced our portfolio to nearly 50 50 split between repair and remodeling and new construction in markets additionally western has a strong non impact brand that come in at higher margins as with our legacy impact products advertisement advertisement to finance the acquisition we entered the bond market for the first time and as a result over 80 of our current leverage is at an attractive fixed rate of 6 75 following the acquisition we ve completed a successful equity offering with net proceeds used to pay down our debt floating rate debt quickly deleveraging our balance sheet i m proud to report pgt innovations net leverage in the 2018 was 2 1 times we believe this balance sheet provides significant strength and flexibility for future operational and strategic initiatives turning to slide 5 it s important to take a few minutes to review our strategy for creating long term value for our customers and shareholders at pgt innovations we attribute our success to the continued execution of our four strategic pillars our first pillar is putting the customer at the center of our business striving to deliver 360 degree service before during and after the sale second we worked hard to attract top talent and we offer benefits and support to help our team member succeed we believe that a talented dedicated team of employees is key to success and we continually look for ways to make our company an attractive place to have a career in 2018 i am especially proud we made every employee a shareholder giving them a chance to participate in our future success we continue this benefit from another grant through all our team members at the beginning of 2019 third we are committed to investing in our business when it is prudent to do so and scaling operations to meet increasing demands our organic growth of 27 in 2018 with solid margin improvement pretty much with significant accomplishments that would not have been possible without well time strategic investments in our business to increase production capacity and improve efficiencies looking forward we expect to continue to invest in operational projects designed to improve efficiency and capacity advertisement advertisement and fourth we strategically allocate capital generated from our strong free cash flow to reduce our debt and support our growth going forward we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and build cash to allow flexibility for futuristic and opportunistic acquisitions and other investments in our business we anticipate that our strategic path forward will involve creating a national market leading building products company with a team focused on niche products and brands which will continue to yield strong margins and significant cash flow now i d like to discuss our results in more detail beginning on slide 6 i m excited to report another quarter of strong financial results reflecting continued growth in demand for our impact resistant products in our legacy markets and growth in demand for our western window systems energy efficient products which are designed to unify indoor outdoor living space for the quarter we delivered sales of 190 million including a sales contribution of 31 million from western window systems acquisition and organic growth of 24 7 million or 18 our legacy repair and remodeling and new construction markets grew by approximately 18 and 19 respectively versus the prior year quarter adjusted gross margin grew by 2 3 in the fourth quarter versus prior year due largely driven by the accretion from the western window systems acquisition our legacy markets we were successful in implementing price increases and driving operational efficiencies to offset labor material and other cost inflations in our business adjusted ebitda of 31 5 million in the fourth quarter represents growth of 34 versus the same quarter last year on slide 7 for our full year i ll reiterate the 2018 sales increased by 37 to 698 million which includes the sales contribution of 49 7 million from western window systems versus the prior year sales in our legacy repair and remodeling and new construction markets grew by approximately 34 and 17 respectively advertisement advertisement adjusted gross margin for 2018 grew by 1 3 versus 2017 driven primarily by our successful efforts in implementing price increases and driving operational efficiencies including a significant reduction in our scrap gross margins were also positively impacted by the accretion from our western window systems acquisition adjusted ebitda for the year of 127 million an increase of 48 versus prior year next turning to slide 8 i would like to provide a further update on western window systems after closing on the acquisition in august of last year integration is on schedule and well under way we expect first year annualized cost synergies of approximately 8 million primarily coming from supply chain efficiencies where we can offer greater economies of scale we also anticipate many cross selling opportunities and strengthen brand recognition as we utilize brands across the pgt innovations portfolio the western window systems acquisition meaningfully expanded our geographic coverage and enhanced our premium product offering in the growing indoor outdoor living market and created synergy opportunities moving forward moving to slide 9 i would like to remind you we are currently four years into our strategy to become a national leader of premium windows and doors the phase one was to further solidify our position in our core market of florida by increasing our product offerings to meet the needs of our customers in our market next we acquired cgi and windor the second and third strongest brands in the impact product space in 2014 and 16 respectively we were able to complete these acquisitions and subsequent integrations while maintaining industry leading margin profiles the next phase of our strategy is and continues to be expansion into new geographies and other niche window and door products we took our first step by the addition of western window systems in this product lines which satisfy some of the most stringent energy codes and regulations in north america and serve a growing contemporary indoor outdoor living segment across the country we believe the western window systems will continue to achieve sales growth above the overall market by adding builders who desire the products western owns and that will continue to achieve industry leading margins by focusing on high end niche energy efficient windows and doors while driving continuous operational improvements turning to slide 10 while certain regions of the national housing market has shown signs of slowing we expect florida to maintain its position as the fastest growing state in the nation with a population of more than 21 million we continue to believe there is significant new construction growth potential remaining in florida we are estimating the 2019 housing starts to be approximately 105 000 well below the normalized single family starts of approximately 125 000 per year advertisement advertisement on slide 11 prior to 2018 it was estimated that of the homes in florida only 18 have impact resistant windows 13 have impact resistant doors and 18 storm shutters that indicate that at least 50 of floridians have no protection on their openings of their homes to safeguard their property against severe storms prior to 2018 this 34 growth we experienced in the repair and remodeling market in 2018 is evidence that many floridians decided to add impact resistant windows and doors and new shutters and plywood hurricane michael and irma demonstrated that every home in florida not just total homes can be impacted by severe weather as a result homeowners throughout the entire state have become searching for hurricane protection for their homes which is why we believe our advertising and marketing investments continue to benefit our growth with western window systems we have expanded into the indoor outdoor living market which represents a total opportunity of approximately 8 million to 9 million the largest segment is in new construction of high end homes that feature more back line doors in the back of the houses from 2012 to 2017 the indoor outdoor living market saw an average annual growth rate of 11 for new contemporary homes this market represents approximately 2 billion opportunity and is growing at a faster pace averaging 24 per year from 2012 to 2017 now i d like to turn the call over to brad to discuss the financial results in more detail brad brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you jeff first i would like to review some of our significant achievements in 2018 and then discuss fourth quarter results in more detail in august 2018 we acquired western window systems for 355 million in order to finance the transaction we entered the bond markets for the first time raising 350 million at attractive rate of 6 75 at the consummation of the acquisition our gross leverage ratio was approximately 4 times trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda inclusive of 8 million in annual cost synergies and within our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times in september 2018 we completed a stock offering which generated proceeds allowing us to pay down 152 million of our current loan credit facility to further strengthen our balance sheet in the fourth quarter we also paid an additional 8 million of our current loan credit facility as jeff mentioned at the end of fourth quarter our net leverage ratio has improved to 2 1 times and over 80 of our remaining leverage is at fixed rate of 6 75 in an environment of rising interest rates another positive result of our 152 million debt pay down was that we received ratings upgrade from moody s to b1 additionally we have a b plus rating from standard poor s with a positive outlook we believe our access to long term borrowings at an attractive rate together with the completion of an acquisition that provides us with geographical and product line diversity and other benefits has put pgt innovations in a strong financial and operational position well poised for continued growth now moving on to slide 12 for a summary of our results for the quarter we reported net sales of 189 9 million including our organic growth of 24 7 million or 18 driven by a growth in our legacy repair and remodel and new construction markets of 18 and 19 respectively versus prior year fourth quarter sales also included a sales contribution of inaudible from western window systems advertisement advertisement our gross profit exclusive of adjusted items was 66 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 up 22 6 million versus the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted gross margin increased to 34 8 or 2 3 increase from prior year driven mainly by gross margin accretion from western window systems in our fourth quarter in our legacy business we were able to offset higher cost with increases in our prices higher volumes and improved operating effectiveness and efficiency you get an update on our aluminum covered program the increase in aluminum prices had a negative impact of 1 5 percentage points on the gross margins in the fourth quarter as of today we have contracted approximately 75 of our estimated aluminum needs for 2019 our current coverage for aluminum portion only in is at 0 96 per pound this does not include the delivery cost which today is approximately 0 19 per pound we will continue to monitor tariff and trade environment effects on aluminum pricing and as appropriate make adjustments for our covered program and pricing strategy selling general and administrative expenses were 45 6 million in the fourth quarter 2018 an increase of 19 2 million from 26 4 million in the fourth quarter 17 adjusted selling general and administrative expenses was 44 1 million in the fourth quarter or 23 of net sales compared to 25 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 or 19 1 of sales an increase of 4 1 western window systems contributed 12 6 million including 2 4 million of non cash amortization and sg a in the fourth quarter of 2018 our legacy business sg a grew from 19 1 of sales in the fourth quarter of 17 to 19 8 of sales in the fourth quarter of 18 including 1 7 million of higher incentive compensation due to our improved performance year over year advertisement advertisement adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 31 5 million or a margin of 16 6 compared with adjusted ebitda of fourth quarter 17 of 23 5 million or 17 5 as additional information the new accounting standard for revenue recognition impacted our fourth quarter 2018 results negatively by reducing sales and adjusted ebitda by 7 5 million and 2 5 million respectively which reduced our adjusted ebitda margin by 70 basis points interest expense for the fourth quarter was 7 1 million an increase of 1 8 million versus last year the increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher debt balance for the quarter the current quarter interest expense includes approximately 300 000 of non cash charges related to the 8 million prepayment that we made during the quarter depreciation and amortization expense was 8 6 million in the fourth quarter 2018 an increase of 3 4 million versus the prior year period driven mainly by the acquisition of western window systems taxes for the fourth quarter were 2 5 million at an effective tax rate of 19 4 additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had a tax credit of 12 4 million reflecting the positive impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was favorably impacted of 6 500 for excess tax benefits of stock option exercises we reported gaap net income of 10 9 million or 0 18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter versus 20 3 million or 0 39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding one time items adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 21 versus 0 18 in the same quarter last year representing a 17 increase moving on to slide 13 i would like to review our current expectations regarding our capital allocation priorities our first priority is internal investment and strategic growth projects that we believe are important to pgt innovations ability to drive future shareholder value and we expect to continue to support our product portfolio by making investments in advertising and marketing which have proven beneficial to our growth our second priority is at reductions in making an solid balance sheet i ve already gone over how we completed a major transaction and we are able to subsequently paid down debt to finish the year with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 2 1 times we maintain as a goal achieving a conservative leverage profile within the range of 2 times to 4 times our third priority for capital allocation is not just looking for strategic acquisitions we expect to continue to look for attractive opportunities to expand into new geographies and or other niche window and door products looking ahead to 2019 on slide 14 i ll give some of our expectations regarding combined company assumptions going forward we expect interest expense the approximately 7 million per quarter we expect the tax rate around 26 we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately 9 million per quarter and we expect annual non cash stock compensation to be approximately 4 2 million due to our employee stock base ph lastly we expect capital expenditures to be to average between 3 and 4 of annual sales and finally i would like to review 2019 guidance provided this morning pgt innovations expects to finish in the following ranges for 2019 fiscal year net sales of 775 million to 800 million an increase of 11 to 15 compared to 2018 adjusted ebitda of 143 million to 152 million an increase of 13 to 20 compared to 2018 and net income per diluted share of 0 93 to 1 05 in first quarter we are currently tracking to 174 million to 179 million in sales which will be growth of approximately 3 to 5 on a pro forma basis this is higher than our full year guidance of 3 at the top end of our annual range ebitda for q1 is expected to finish at approximately 16 inaudible with that i d like to turn the call back over to jeff for some closing thoughts jeff jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thank you brad now i d like to take a few minutes just to elaborate on the macro economic assumptions behind our guidance for 2019 consistent with many industry forecasters we are expecting a low single digit growth rate in national housing starts mainly due to labor constraints affordability concerns and interest rate increases we experienced in 2018 relating to a couple of our core markets we are expecting new home starts in florida to grow approximately 9 to 10 in 2019 while we expect new home starts in california to remain relatively flat versus in 2019 we believe pgt innovations is strategically insulated in most building product companies from national housing starts due to our geographic concentration in destination states and our focus on selling into indoor outdoor living market which has historically grown at rates higher than the national housing starts regarding the growth prospects for the indoor outdoor living market please note that western window systems has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22 since 2015 far exceeding the growth than housing start during that period we believe this level of growth demonstrates the strength of demand for building products that unify indoor outdoor living spaces and we anticipate opportunity to continue to gain market share and penetrate into this growing market our 2019 guidance assumes an overall high single digit growth rate for new construction sales related to the repair and remodeling market we just concluded the strongest year in company history with 34 repair and remodeling growth fueled by hurricane awareness from irma the first hurricane hit florida since 2005 while we believe repair and remodeling markets are still strong quarter our expectations will be for the repair and remodeling market to be flat as 2018 with another storm driving further awareness regardless at the end of 2019 our two year compound annual growth rate will still be quite healthy florida remains in great state to operate in and we will continue to drive sales of our impact resistant products with our leading market position of highly innovative product offerings and increase adversiting from a margin perspective our 2019 guidance assumes the following cost inflation from materials mainly due to tariffs continued wage inflation associated with attracting and retaining qualified workers the negative impact of mix that will result from new construction sales outpacing the repair and remodeling growth somewhat offset by the impact of a price increase announced in the back half of 2018 we will strive to continue to drive operational efficiencies as we demonstrated during 2018 and supply chain initiatives also to offset these cost of inflation initiatives finally our guidance for 2019 assumes that there are no major hurricanes in florida that would disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver our products or disrupt the ability of our dealers to take orders during 2019 in closing i d like to remind you of the five elements of our investment thesis first on slide 15 first we are national leader in the growing category of premium window and doors second we are committed to continuing our investments in talent and r d to remain the industry leader with innovative products third we have an ongoing focus on operational efficiency expected to drive additional margin expansion four we are focused on striving to achieve strong execution of our strategy to create long term customer and long term shareholder value and fifth we are well positioned with a diversified product portfolio and a diversified geographic markets to capture profitable growth in new construction and repair and remodeling trends 2018 was a milestone year for pgt innovations and our team it is an exciting time to be a part of our family of brands at this time i d like to turn the call over to the operator to begin our q a operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions we ll take our first question from truman patterson with wells fargo truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking my questions the first one first thing that i d like to dig into is your revenue growth guidance for 2019 you guys set up 11 to 15 if i throw in an extra seven to eight months of western windows in there it seems like your guidance implies flat to maybe 1 growth in the legacy pgti and even western windows growth in there could you walk us through the moving parts you guys said california market should be flat while florida new resi ph should be up high single digits i think this implies that actually florida r r should be negative then could you just walk us through how to think about this jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes i ll touch on that and i ll let brad dig in some details as well as brad told mentioned in his comments our q1 guidance right now florida overall company we are tracking anywhere from 3 to 5 growth in our first quarter that s before our heavy r r quarters and the second and third quarter are very heavy r r periods for pgt legacy brands and we are comping an incredible year 34 growth rate in r r largest percentage in our company s history largest base in our company s history so right now we have that kind of headwinds that to go through and we re trying to lay out what we consider a conservative guidance as we face that comp that will impact us on that process second is moving to california market which you mentioned in your comments that the california market being flat what we have to do and it will be new for us this year consistent with western previous but we have to execute in that flat market and gain share we think we want to we got initiatives to drive penetration in a flat market we think we can still grow but our assumption in our guidance is that s flat and that s going to be a tough hurdle to overcome so those are the two driving initiatives that have our guidance to where it is and we have initiatives in place to address at all it s just too early in the process for us to be aggressive and thinking we going to succeed brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer and let me add to that as going to last year in q4 of 17 you started to see in the demand for r r pickup and that carried all the way through 2018 as we mentioned but at the beginning of the year we kind of anticipated some of that a price increase that we announced at the beginning of last year and also the middle of the summer season we announced a price increase specifically dealing with aluminum heritage rate that was going on we had two price increases last year as well that also probably drove some of the summer season tough comps that we are dealing with as we go into 2019 truman patterson wells fargo analyst i m having a little bit of a hard time hearing you guys but is it safe to assume that what s implied in your guidance is probably negative r r growth yet that might not be exactly what s in your real expectations is that safe to assume brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes again we re comping at 34 incredible growth year and so yes we are saying after an another major storm or something happening we could be negative to slightly negative in our r r growth offset by obviously new construction still growing that s taking share there and then offset somewhat again by tough comp in california with housing starts everyone saying they re going to be roughly flat and trying to gain penetration there truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay okay thanks thanks for that guys another question on guidance when we look at your 2019 ebitda margin the midpoint i think is only up about 50 bps year over year at 18 7 or so it seems like the accretion from western alone just from another seven to eight months should add that to your 2019 margins alone this is excluding any of the 8 million in synergies that you guys are suggesting you re going to achieve so essentially we ve got flat legacy pgti and flat western windows margins year over year i guess what s driving that or are there any mix issues are we actually going to see negative gross margins or just flat gross margins flat sg a i m trying to understand what s going on with your legacy your legacy pieces of the business brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so truman the initial estimates that we talked about for western are still in place the basic issue that we re dealing with is absolutely mix so last year during the first second and third quarter where r r growth substantially outpaced new construction we called out about 100 bps on average of mix improvement that we saw from the r r growth what we re thinking this year with our guidance is the kind of the reversely new construction growth faster than r r so there are some implied mixed negative impact in our guidance of about 100 bps and that is kind of basically how you get to the expectation we had of 150 bps from western to 50 bps now is that a 100 bps reduction on the mix side and that s basically the legacy at r r and new construction mix that we re talking off truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay so there s no negative margin in western windows at all implied in that guidance or accretion jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president no absolutely not truman patterson wells fargo analyst flat as well jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes the cost synergies in western margin profile continues to grow as expected truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thanks guys jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll turn next to michael rehaut with jpmorgan maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst hi this is actually maggie on for mike first i was just wondering if you could kind of quantify some of those gross margin drivers a little bit more for 2019 and could you talk about what you re expecting to see in terms of like inflation raw materials as well as price brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so we talked about on the last call the impact of tariffs being about 40 bps and that is still kind of implied in the guidance we do not have any at this point in time any assumed price increases that will go into place in 2019 we do get the impact of the price increase that was made in the summer of 2018 the first six months of that i do think in the first quarter we ll still have some aluminum headwinds last year the midwest premium jumped up at the end of the first quarter so we saw that in second third and fourth quarter in the first quarter we will probably get 50 bps of aluminum headwinds that just overcome and then it should be flat for the rest of the year but i think the most important issue is the mix issue i just described to truman at at 100 bps that s really the most important factor on gross margin for this year maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay great thank you and then secondly i was wondering if you could talk about how you re thinking about your m a pipeline are you actively looking into potential acquisitions or are you more fully focused on integrating and leveraging internal systems and growing western window jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes this is jeff as i look at that i ll be honest with you the team is keenly focused on the integration efforts which are going incredibly well we will probably i get different companies sent to me just like everyone else but right now honestly we are at 2 1 times leverage i always like to go below 2 so we got another couple of quarters for that to happen and then again integration once western s as western continues to perform like and then pgt we will look to future acquisition is more toward the end of this year or beginning of 2020 versus currently maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay great thank you operator we ll turn next to jeremy hamblin with dougherty company jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst thanks and congrats on a strong 2018 guys i wanted to hop into the eps guidance for the year and just brad if you might just help us to understand the puts and takes here on share count taxes it sound i think i caught 26 tax rate but could you just walk us through a little bit more of the puts and takes on your eps guidance brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sure jeremy so we finished the year at 1 18 reported in 2018 adjusted eps that does have a couple of things that i d like to normalize whether those go into 2019 first is the share count obviously versus last year our share count is up a good bit and our weighted average is up about 5 5 million of shares based upon the equity offering if you look at that that s about 0 10 so that 1 18 was then therefore be a 1 08 and then if you look at our tax rate as we mentioned we had 0 09 of excess tax benefits we have quite a bit of option exercises last year in 2018 our guidance does not assume any of that will happen in 2019 though likely they likely will as you really can t put that your guidance that was 0 09 so that was got the 0 99 in 2018 kind of apples to apples basis so the top end of our guidance of 1 05 will be eps growth of about 5 to 6 off of that jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay great that s helpful i wanted to come back to q4 for second and just see i think it contributed western windows contributed 31 million to sales what was the contribution to ebitda from western windows in q4 brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes that s not that is not a number that we normally would put jeremy i will say one thing about western as we go into q4 of 2018 and into 2019 they do operate in both custom and production builder volume market channels that we talked about a good a bit during in site tour that i know you are at in phoenix and one of the things that the mix that 100 bps that we are kind of talking about there is a little bit of in western when they sell into the production builder business they sell mostly doors and the company business will tend to have a little bit higher percentage of windows so one of the things that we see with western is from a mix perspective is as they sell less production builder will sell less doors which will have less effect ph it s a small impact on the total of the company since western is a smaller portion of the business but they did in q4 has a little bit higher percentage of window sales than they had the rest of the year and that is a part of that but we re not going to give specific in to that guidance jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay understood and then just elaborating on the ebitda margin the swing from or i should actually even focus just on the gross margins here in q4 that kind of roughly 200 basis point decline from q3 to q4 despite kind of a full quarter of benefit from western windows was there slightly negative mix shift as well but just a little bit more color on that sequential change in gross margins i know some of it s just from lower sales probably end of year reduction in factory times brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes from a sequential standpoint it is basically mostly just a change in sales from q3 to q4 we did have a little bit of a mix issue because we were had been 34 plus in r r all year long and new construction was something less than that but then in q4 they leveled out we talked about 19 and 18 i do want to go back i m not going to spend a lot of time because it s kind of accounting technical but when i mentioned that accounting 606 implications that actually that 70 bps for the most part all our gross margin and that s what that comes down to just to get as real quickly is just the level of finished goods you have on hand and typically going into the end of the year we will reduce our inventories as we head for the shutdown so from while we actually invoice and sold our performance would have been higher and our results and our margins would have been higher based on this new accounting treatment would you take in 2019 that kind for the most part will level so far because our inventory levels were higher at the end of 18 because of hurricane irma and that s what kind of drove it but that s really what kind of drove the earnings the gross margin issue looking at 2019 we still expect the improvements that we talked about from western and the only real headwind that we re facing on that besides aluminum in the first quarter i mentioned was the mix issue that we re probably going to fight with all year jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay thanks last one here just the implied range in your guidance for sg a for the year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer well inaudible it s probably going to be a number of this will be a full year of western which has the higher sg a cost coming from improved higher non cash amortization but it s probably in the neighborhood of 21 to 22 in that range and so on jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay and the amortization that you factoring in there is rough brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer well 9 million a quarter is combined company depreciation and amortization and i think i mentioned in the last call that amortization from western will be 9 million a year in sg a so that s unchanged jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay and so the amortization i get it s kind of in the 15 million 16 million range for the year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer for the total company yes i think that s correct jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst all right thanks guys good luck this year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeremy jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thanks jeremy operator we ll turn now to phil ng with jefferies jefferies analyst good morning guys it s inaudible for phil jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president good morning jefferies analyst i just want to hi i wanted to dive into the projected organic growth you know it implies a pretty short deceleration i know in the past you ve talked about increasing consumer awareness driving demand in 2018 so i guess given the lack of major storms in florida this year are you starting to see that tail end taper off jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes i don t think it is not this tapering off i would say it s more yes if you look at the r r growth market in florida this past year 2018 i think it grew way more than even our dealer base anticipated would so there are inherent constraints in that growth in that market inaudible continue to grow namely in labor and so that s acting kind of as a governor and again in our thought process of how much more in r r grow in any given quarter but with that said we do think we re going to continue to advertise and then continue to push our brand and there is more market share we can take within r r market is flat but that s executing against a competitor versus just growing in a market is growing 34 so it s a little bit different strategy little bit different taxes involved but we re definitely executing on the strategy to take share even as our market does end up being flat year over year jefferies analyst okay got it and then on a larger theme we ve been seeing is kind of the shift to more affordable homes so curious to hear if you ve seen or expect to see any trade down effect from that shift to affordability jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president no not really that s really not the market we serve that s the commodity window and door market with that said our products especially the indoor outdoor living products can go into a lower priced homes because the cost of having a wall full of windows versus a wall a couple of doors and sheet rock and forming electrical et cetera is about the same and so the up selling options for that builder is much more obviously so it can go into that and also to address that kind of lower impact market we didn t watch sparta last year if you will recall and so that s been a definitely a good win for us in locking up some builder business that typically would have been went to other competitors jefferies analyst got it and if i could squeeze in one more you mentioned internal investments as your top capital allocation priority can you just talk us through some of those and whether it s improving efficiency or expanding capacity how we should think about those benefits starting to flow through to results thanks jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes i mean from my seat we re constantly looking at innovation and products product offerings we have an innovation lab we have products in there that we re testing in the market to see if there viable so technology surrounding how we actually produced one of the driving factors of our improved gross margin and ebitda margin over the last few years is the technological advances we put our plant here behind me as well as what western window systems had bought previously to our acquisition so technology advances we wouldn t be on that cutting edge to drive our labor cost and obviously would benefit with improved margins so we mentioned investing in our technology is surrounded with the thought process of sustained industry leader in our categories with innovative products and then automation that s kind of the next phase of manufacturing in terms of driving out labor costs brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer and if i add to that jeff we had a point last year where we increased within our venice operations basically our ability to deliver almost 1 5 million to 2 million more a week in a very short amount of time to handle the 34 r r growth with some of that growth was fueled by the marketing and advertising decisions that we made both following the storm in fourth quarter 2017 as well as thoughtful additions to our portfolio from a margin perspective in the first half of 2018 as we head into the season so i thought our internal investments that we made or passed over the year specifically the back half of 2017 and the first half 18 were huge driving factor toward what we called off in 2018 jefferies analyst all right great thanks guys good luck this year jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll now turn to alvaro lacayo with g research alvaro lacayo g research analyst good morning guys just have a question a regarding western windows and california and the assumption for flat housing starts in california the dynamics in california a little bit different from florida from an affordability standpoint which seems to be a little bit more stretched and there seems to be a little bit more volatility recently in demand from housing starts there so maybe if you can give some color on how you arrive to flat housing starts in california and then bigger picture when you think about the growth algorithm for western window how do you think about the piece of increased penetration market share and if pricing plays a role at all and when you put on all that together what are the expectations for 2019 what kind of growth are you expecting to see out at western windows jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president as relates to the actual guidance for housing starts in florida i mean that s basically just based on the movies or any kind of those housing starts that we see in the trends obviously we are back to kind of single digit nationally but florida and california are very different in that and as we mentioned about 9 in our florida western operates both in southern california and in northern california and just probably some different housing start factors within those if you split the state in half like that but i think flattish kind of where we landed on for our guidance and as western has always trying to accomplish and has accomplished they gained share and they beat that number and that s what we expect going forward from western brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll just comment briefly on western as well i mean the goal is very simple is to grow western brands in a flat market initiatives involving that are a little bit more complicated we are actively establishing an r r market so we re going through california today establishing dealers that deal more in that r r space to get that western brands in that market as well as expanding our relationships with the current home builders there to further penetrate and get into the model homes so that product can be shown as an option versus other choices so those are the two kind of initiatives that we re tackling what we consider a potential flat market in california and we will grow and it s just a matter of the success of those initiatives i don t think we have ever commented on certain brand growth before really want to get into that at this point in terms of pricing the kind of the third part of your question pricing western currently in their setting incredibly nice in their pricing in terms of compared to competitors they are not the highest they re typically more toward the lowest even though obviously those higher will come down account in pricing to try to get a job but for the most part western windows systems and our products there are priced in the lower side versus the competitors and what key is the delivery lead times are better so again that plays into that capturing share in the flat market we can deliver a lower priced product in a quicker manner but the quality is as good or better so that kind of combination i think we also comfortable we re going to succeed but again 2019 is going to be a challenging year that s been the consistent theme we heard from a building community and we got to playing that or executing that alvaro lacayo g research analyst thanks and then just with regards to the pricing carryover from last year could you just give us a reminder on what s the magnitude of that pricing and what to expect in the first six months of 19 from the carryover brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes we basically announced and this was a pgt legacy price increase we basically now excised the 7 price increase in the summer as far as specific and it was kind of geared toward aluminum costs offset though some labor costs as well aluminum labor costs that basically started hitting toward the end of q3 and in q4 so we ll have about two quarters of that i did mention that just kind of implied in our guidance as well though because the price of labor continues to go up as we attract the best talent and i did say that we probably have about a 50 bps to 60 bps aluminum pressure in q1 that s coming from last year alvaro lacayo g research analyst thank you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator we ll turn next to sam darkatsh with raymond james sam darkatsh raymond james analyst good morning jeff brad how are you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer hi sam good how are you sam darkatsh raymond james analyst i m well and i just wanted to also send my thoughts out to anybody that was affected by the shooting earlier this week our thoughts and prayers go into your employee base and hopefully all as well i just have a like three or four housekeeping questions and i apologize for the elementary nature of these so brad i didn t catch us if you mentioned it what were impact sales in the fourth quarter year on year in the legacy business percentage wise brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes just a second sam we were basically well let me do this way we were legacy wise we were 86 in q4 and when you look at the depth of total share in the total impact sales were 136 million basically for the consolidated business 72 of impact of sales were impact sam darkatsh raymond james analyst i m not sure i m following so i m looking for the year on year growth rate of impact in the fourth quarter brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer i thought you are talking about dollar amount so okay no it was up 20 year over year sam darkatsh raymond james analyst that s it there you go and then backlog at the end of the year brad do you have that handy brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer i do just one second please so we finished the year with backlog of 64 million which includes 11 million from western sam darkatsh raymond james analyst and that would be related to the 50 million 5 0 from last year on an organic basis right brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sam darkatsh raymond james analyst all right so it s up markedly that s good okay and then two other questions and if you talked about this you talked around it on the call but i want to make sure i m aware so in the fourth quarter you obviously had a terrific sales print and it looked like the gross margins at least might have fallen below expectations at least either externally or internally you mentioned aluminum you mentioned mix of r r versus builder but where was the primary negative variance versus your internal plan in gross margin in the fourth quarter brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sam actually it all came down to the accounting entry related to the new accounting standards so that affected by 70 bps it s just when we ended up with lower finished goods at the end of the year it required us to have a accounting entry that reduced margins by 70 bps that actually the biggest factor but the reason why i didn t talk about it so much because it s not really a factor in 2019 it was a factor in q4 sam darkatsh raymond james analyst got it okay thank you for that and then last question i apologize also if this was covered directly but the guidance for the year sales guidance for 2019 what s the implied organic sales growth rate i think you mentioned for q1 is 3 to 5 but what specifically is it for the year inherent within your guidance brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it s the combination of r r expectation which at the top end of the range is probably flat like jeff mentioned and the new construction is growing at 9 so it basically flat to 3 sam darkatsh raymond james analyst got it thank you very much gentlemen i appreciate it jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president and then sam just do your point of reference just in case if others don t know on the call we did have a shooting one of our employees was in his car in the parking lot on tuesday night actually monday morning tuesday morning early and obviously our number one priority is safety of our team members and we re committed to ensure they have a safe work environment but what we found out is more of a domestic issue with him and another person and we immediately got him attention inaudible took him to hospital minimal downtime in terms of the events here at pgt we obviously have secured plant and we ll work with the police accordingly to make sure that this incident was resolved with him and the issue he was facing so thank you for asking about that and just wanted to let you know things are good here at kansas sam darkatsh raymond james analyst that s terrific thank you jeff operator let s turn next to nishu sood with deutsche bank myers deutsche bank analyst i had this is myers ph in for nishu thank you for taking my question so my first question i just trying to go back to the growth assumption the sales growth assumption for 2019 is 11 contribution from wws acquisition a good assumption to use brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer well we are not going to get into brands specific growth the bottom line is i think we kind of said what our legacy growth is kind of being kind of imply we have a whole bunch of initiatives around synergies and driving additional brand awareness with western as the new brand for us that s going to help drive growth faster than the market but i think when we get a combined guidance that we re kind of that s the extent that we really want to talk about myers deutsche bank analyst okay and going back to price do you mind giving your price assumptions for example masonite talked about how most of their growth is going to be priced so same thing i assume you anticipate some volume growth as well that s what i am i think i m hearing and i was just wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of how much is coming from pricing how much from volume brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so basically only price increase assumed in our model is the remaining effect of the price increase we have from last summer so it about half year and followed 5 you could probably say in 1 to 2 is left over from that growth and price rest is on in the first half not for full year myers deutsche bank analyst so 1 to 2 for impact for full year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer 1 to 2 impact for the first half and then we catch up with the pricing increase myers deutsche bank analyst all right thank you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer you are welcome operator i ll turn now to ken zener with keybanc kenneth zener keybanc analyst good morning gentlemen jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president hi ken brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning kenneth zener keybanc analyst so i empathize we heard trying to forecast comps when you re r r is up 30 to 50 in the second and third quarter it s obviously very difficult if we can to kind of narrow that in i think your backlog you talked about 53 million well adjusted 53 million versus 50 million so up 6 your kind of backlog that you re seeing right now that i assume is obviously your organic business i am not sure but i just said if r r because it grew so well and i think being conservative as appropriate r r was 5 higher than you re talking about that being roughly 0 05 or 0 06 is how we re calculating it given your guidance how i mean a quarter from now are you going to have a much cleaner view on perhaps how you re cautious view on r r is well not cautious but you re 1 to 3 view if we re seeing backlog up 6 or 10 is that going to get you to kind of shift your view about what the second third quarter comps might be jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes ken as you look at how we executed in 2018 as 18 played out and we realized we re go in to do better as we beat expectations every quarter as we saw that we did change our guidance and so we will definitely have a better feel for how that r r comps going to impact our second quarter really at the beginning of the second quarter just based on order patterns and backlog like you d mentioned we will also have a better feel for how we can execute in a flat say california resident a flat how we execute in taking share which we ve historically done as that i pointed out with the growth patterns in western in a flat market we will have a better understanding of how we are going to be able to do that and our initiatives there and we will adjust accordingly hopefully it was all be positive and we will be in a position to adjust our guidance upward but right now we feel based on what we said and the order patterns we ve seen and the comps we re looking at and the housing commentary we listen to we think we re still going to execute 11 to 15 growth and be conservative and have a great year kenneth zener keybanc analyst yes and i appreciate that and brad i think you talked about mix right impacting r r versus new construction obviously 2q and 3q is going to be very relevant for you i m just trying to get sensitivities if gross margin i think you talked about higher sg a 21 22 i m going to call that 21 5 kind of the midpoint of your guidance for your ebitda guidance that means gross margins are kind of flat but if we face about 100 bps gross margin pressure this quarter was your 100 basis point comment for gross margin pressure was that is that a full year thing i m just trying to think about how we can properly set expectations for 2q and 3q given that that was enormous r r therefore uplift in mix and how we should think about the full year versus kind of that 2q and 3q mix issue i just want to make sure everyone s on the same page here brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes the 100 bps is the full year but it will definitely have a more impact in a quarter that you re comping a harder on our quarter because that s the genesis of the mix issue is the strength of the r r margin so yes in q2 and q3 it might be slightly higher than 100 bps and q1 and q4 maybe not as high as 100 bps but this 100 bps for the full year kenneth zener keybanc analyst okay all right i appreciate it thank you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks ken jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thanks ken operator and with that we ll conclude our question and answer session i ll now turn the conference back to you mr west for any closing remarks brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks everybody for taking the time to join us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter take care operator with that we

dave to get things started dave dave adams chairman and chief executive officer thanks jim good morning everyone i ll begin our agenda with fourth quarter and full year 2018 highlights followed by a recap of our journey to achieving top quartile performance then i ll turn it over to glenn to provide a detailed review of our 2019 guidance and updated china direct cap1000 financials finally i ll return to wrap up prepared remarks with a discussion on several strategic topics including plans for capital investment in our drg business and update on our capital allocation strategy and lastly the establishment of new three year targets supporting our drive for long term profitable growth after that we ll move to q a starting with the fourth quarter highlights we delivered yet another solid quarterly performance with adjusted operating margin diluted earnings per share and free cash flow ahead of our expectations the net sales increase was led by strong double digit organic growth in the power generation market due to higher cap1000 and domestic nuclear aftermarket revenues our results also reflect the contribution from our drg acquisition in the power segment the increase in adjusted operating income was principally driven by strong profitability in the power segment while adjusted operating margin was essentially in line with last year s strong fourth quarter this performance resulted in adjusted diluted eps of 1 90 a 25 increase over the prior year and includes the benefits of lower interest expense driven by a 50 million debt repayment technical difficulty lower effective tax rate and continued share repurchase activity we generated very strong free cash flow of 214 million in the fourth quarter technical difficulty in the fourth quarter resulting in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 260 turning to our full year 2018 highlights we experienced sales increases in all of our end markets driving sales up 6 overall and 3 organically total defense sales were up 10 overall including the drg acquisition total commercial sales were up 4 led by solid growth throughout the general industrial market we generated a 110 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin to 15 8 the highest level of profitability produced by curtiss wright in more than 20 years this solid performance drove a 28 year over year increase and adjusted diluted eps which included a lower effective tax rate and continued share repurchase activity we invested nearly 200 million through a combination of 10b5 1 plans and opportunistic repurchases in 2018 new orders were up 6 principally led by strong demand in naval defense in addition full year adjusted free cash flow was strong at 333 million which drove a solid adjusted free cash flow conversion of 121 this next chart reflects the results of the transformational journey we embarked upon in 2013 under our one curtiss wright vision for those less familiar with curtiss wright in december 2013 we established an aggressive five year goal to achieve top quartile performance versus our peer group our metrics were a mix of key performance indicators as listed on the slide at that time we were in the bottom quartile of our peer group for most of these metrics due to our team s unwavering focus upon execution over the past five years i m very pleased to report that we have achieved our or exceeded all of our the original targets and reached top quartile for every metric illustrated further it s important to note that these targets were set without considering any benefit from sales growth over the past two years solid top line growth combined with our leaner operating structure has enhanced our operational performance and driven even stronger returns it s been an exciting journey and i m very proud of the entire team s accomplishments we remain focused on driving margin improvement leveraging the critical mass of one curtiss wright across the enterprise and maintaining our position in the top quartile of our peer group two metrics that we re particularly proud of include operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation starting with operating margin expansion for those of you who recall we laid out a plan to reach margin expansion via a focus upon consolidations portfolio rationalization operational excellence shared services low cost economies and segment focus the teams ongoing successes across each and every one of these initiatives has led to our strong margin expansion of more than 600 basis points over the past five years and we will relentlessly pursue continued improvement in all of these areas next moving to free cash flow generation where our results have been tremendous over the past five years we ve generated more than 1 5 billion and adjusted free cash flow with an average adjusted free cash flow conversion of 155 our efforts here were led by strong operational performance a significant reduction in working capital as a percentage of sales the 2015 cap1000 order and our focus on efficient capital spending robust free cash flow generation combined with our strong balance sheet has enabled us to drive a healthy capital allocation strategy with returns to shareholders reinvestment back into the business and strategic acquisitions now i d like to turn the call over to glenn to provide a review of our financial outlook for 2019 glenn glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer thank you dave and good morning everyone moving to our 2019 guidance beginning with our end market sales where we expect growth of 3 to 5 overall with gains in all of our end markets in the defense markets our overall sales growth reflects the continued benefit from the favorable trends in defense spending including an additional quarter of sales per drg and our first full year ownership in aerospace defense we expect sales growth to come from higher demand for embedded computing products supporting the ramp up on the f 35 program as well as higher sales on the black hawk and apache helicopter programs this growth also includes some system sales that we previously expected to recognize in 2018 as mentioned on our third quarter call in ground defense sales growth is expected to be driven by higher sales on the abrams tank and bradley fighting vehicle platforms as we expect to benefit from the long awaited monetization of these programs and in naval defense we expect sales growth to be led by the ramp up on the cvn 80 aircraft carrier program and higher virginia class submarine revenues moving on to the commercial markets commercial aerospace sales growth is projected to benefit from improved demand for actuation and sensors equipment and surface treatment services primarily supporting narrow body platforms included in this guidance is a 20 million offset from a combination of reduced revenues from previous faa directives that continue to warrant and the delay in the signing of a new supply agreement with boeing otherwise core oem growth is expected to be 9 in power generation we expect a modest increase in revenue growth on the cap1000 program as you will see in the updated revenue projection that will be discussed in a few minutes we still expect 2019 to be the peak year on this program meanwhile following sequential improvement in sales throughout 2018 domestic nuclear aftermarket sales are expected to continue to improve modestly in 2019 particularly for higher sales of valves partially offset by lower international nuclear market aftermarket sales and finally in the general industrial market industrial vehicle sales are expected to demonstrate load to mid single digit growth led by solid off highway demand in the agricultural market please note that within the waterfall charts we have shifted our sub sea pump revenues from the industrial controls category into a newly named industrial pumps and valves category to better represent our sales to the energy markets in industrial pumps and valves we are expecting mid single digit sales growth principally led by higher sales in valves in the downstream oil and gas market and higher sales of pumps in the sub sea market industrial control sales are expected to be down slightly technical difficulty of automotive contracts completed last year and for our service tech services business which tends to be more economically sensitive sales are expected to be essentially flat in 2019 due to global economic uncertainty and finally in the appendix of our presentation you will find detailed breakdowns of our full year 2018 sales by end market as well as our 2019 end market sales waterfall chart our financial guidance for 2019 reflects solid sales growth across all three segments while total curtiss wright operating income is expected to grow 4 to 6 operating margin is expected to range from 15 9 to 16 reflecting a 10 basis point to 20 basis point increase compared with 2018 adjusted results and includes the increased r d and other growth investments as noted on the slide continuing with our outlook by segment starting with the commercial industrial segment we expect sales group to be led by both our commercial aerospace and general industrial end markets we are projecting segment operating income to grow 6 to 9 while operating margin is expected to increase 40 basis points to 50 basis points to range of 15 5 to 15 6 higher operating income will be driven by higher sales volume and the benefit of ongoing margin improvement initiatives including restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offsetting that improvement is 4 million per tariffs and a 3 million increase in r d excluding these two items segment operating margin guidance would have reflected a 100 basis point to 110 basis point increase compared to 2018 results next to the defense segment we expect sales growth to be led by improvements in the aerospace and ground defense markets partially offset by lower growth in the naval defense and general industrial markets we are projecting segment operating income to grow 0 to 2 while operating margin is expected to decrease 50 basis points to 60 basis points to a range of 22 6 to 22 7 this outlook primarily reflects unfavorable mix due to a higher percentage of lower margin system sales as well as a 5 million increase in r d to support our higher tech embedded computing products which will continue to drive organic growth excluding the increased r d investment segment operating margin guidance would have reflected a 30 basis point to 40 basis point increase compared to 2018 results and next to the power segment we expect sales growth to be led by higher revenues in the naval defense market we are projecting segment operating income to grow 1 to 4 primarily driven by the higher sales volume while operating margin is expected to decline 50 basis points to 60 basis points to a range of 16 to 16 1 partially offsetting that improvement will be 6 million per transition in it security costs related to the relocation of our drg business as well as a 2 million increase in r d excluding these investments segment operating margin guidance would have reflected a 60 basis point to 70 basis point increase compared with 2018 adjusted results continuing with our 2019 financial outlook we expect full year 2019 diluted eps guidance to range from 6 80 to 6 95 up 7 to 9 over 2018 adjusted results we expect our 2019 diluted earnings per share to follow a very similar cadence to our 2018 quarterly performance where first quarter eps should be slightly above last year s first quarter followed by sequential quarterly improvement with the fourth quarter being a strongest as we have done historically next the free cash flow for 2019 we expect to generate north of 300 million of free cash flow for the fourth consecutive year while capital expenditures are expected to rise to range of 75 million to 85 million the capex guidance includes a 20 million capital investment for new machinery and equipment for our drg business which dave will discuss in more detail in a few minutes excluding this capital investment we expect adjusted 2019 free cash flow to range from 320 million to 330 million while adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 110 next on our product ph updates on the cap1000 program revenue and free cash flow projections which were reported in the power segment beginning with the updated revenue forecast you can see the initial projections from october 2016 in gray and the current forecast in blue as a reminder we expect to generate 448 million in total production revenue covering 16 reactor coolant pumps at 28 million a piece we continue to experience favorable cost performance and strong profitability on this program generating a healthy 23 plus operating margin this new 81 000 forecast not only reduces some of the year to year volatility but will also lead to a 30 million in the increased revenue and higher profit over the 2019 through 2021 period compared to our original projection based on the current pace of production revenue is still expected to peak in 2019 slightly up from 2018 and as we look ahead to 2020 we initially expect the drop in revenue of approximately 100 million which has been at the forefront of investor concerns has been significantly reduced by 70 we now expect to generate much higher ap1000 production revenue in 2020 compared to our original production with the more manageable drop of only 30 million from the 2019 peak as you can see on this next slide we are confident that we will be able to cover this much more manageable gaap and the ap1000 revenue with increased defense revenues over the next few years based on expectations for higher fighter jet submarine and peak cvn 80 aircraft carrier revenues to name a few in summary we expect to generate both higher revenue and operating income over the remaining years of this contract compared to our original projections next turning to our updated cap1000 free cash flow forecast once again you can see the initial projections in gray and the new forecast in blue our performance over the past few years has been better than expected led by strong execution and a higher profitability along with the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate as a result we now expect a much higher cumulative free cash flow total of 110 million well above the prior expectations of 65 million and also much less of a drop off from the peak cash flow levels in this new forecast so to wrap up our remarks on the ap1000 we continue to execute very well on this contract we expect 2019 to be another year of strong profitability and free cash flow generation with the revenue gap in 2020 becoming much more manageable and less of an issue looking ahead despite the solid demand from china india and other countries i ll reiterate that we are not going to speculate on the specific timing of future ap1000 rcp orders now i d like to turn the call back over to dave to continue with our prepared remarks dave dave adams chairman and chief executive officer thanks glenn next an update on the integration of our drg business which is going quite well we continue to integrate drg into our hr finance and erp systems and are on track as planned given the sophisticated and critical nature of curtiss wright s technology and intellectual property we are investing 3 million in 2019 to support drgs it security infrastructure to continue to grow this business we are investing the necessary capital and resources to position us to deliver long term growth and margin expansion accordingly we have broken ground on a new state of the art naval facility in charleston south carolina which we expect to be operational in 2020 this timing aligns with the conclusion of our two year supply agreement with siemens the new facility will enable us to optimize capabilities and improve our cost structure by establishing more efficient production processes in addition we are investing 20 million for new capital equipment that will provide long overdue upgrades to critical steam turbine machinery and equipment this new location will also provide future cost saving opportunities to our customers based on its proximity to deepwater ports in south carolina combining curtiss wright s existing naval defense capabilities with drgs mission critical equipment and service centers yields a formidable force for our end customer this capability enhancement along with increasing naval defense budgets signal a very bright outlook for curtiss wright s naval defense business next an update on our capital allocation strategy since 2013 i m proud to say that we ve accomplished the following returned nearly 850 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends share count has been reduced by 8 7 million shares we ve completed two significant acquisitions for nearly 500 million and we spent 500 million on operational investments including capex voluntary pension contributions and debt prepayments if you recall back in 2013 when we revealed our balanced capital allocation strategy we implemented a self imposed hiatus on acquisitions we stated that we needed to improve our operating metrics in order to earn the right to acquire again based upon our strong operational performance as discussed in my opening remarks we felt we earn the right to acquire again so we reopened the door to acquisitions which led us down a path to acquire ttc and drg both excellent additions as you can see on the slide we are now amending our capital allocation strategy slightly we will increase our focus on accelerating top line growth via two critical areas internal growth investments and acquisitions we believe that it is now prudent to moderately increase our investments in capex and r d as both remain critical to driving long term organic growth regarding capital investments the aforementioned 20 million investment in the drg business is a perfect example of our commitment to driving improved operating efficiencies and long term margin expansion we have included a 10 million increase in internal r d spending in 2019 we have had considerable success with our r d investments in recent years leading to significant awards and long term sustainable growth for curtiss wright i ll remind you that despite these growth investments we re still projecting operating margin expansion in 2019 we also intend to increase our allocation of capital to high quality profitable acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria and as i ve often indicated we re not looking to revert back to the days when we were a serial acquirer we have a strong balance sheet of 500 million untapped revolving credit agreement with a 200 million accordion and ample capacity to spend up to 1 5 billion in meaningful acquisitions in addition we will continue to focus on returns to shareholders through steady buybacks and dividends at a minimum we repurchased sufficient shares to cover annual dilution from stock compensation shared acquisitions not materialize as expected then we will consider additional share repurchase activity as we ve done in the past few years the final topic i d like to discuss today as our new targets covering the three year period ending in 2021 having completed the previous five year cycle we are ready to discuss the next phase of our evolution and the changes that are taking place to drive those efforts as you ve heard throughout our prepared remarks we re shifting our focus to deliver more top line growth we expect to accomplish this organically aided by our growth investments and through acquisitions by utilizing our strong balance sheet as a result we are targeting 5 to 7 total sales cagr which is an acceleration of our prior long term range of 3 to 5 of note the sales growth target does not include any ap1000 orders we also expect to be a leaner and much more efficient business by the end of 2021 we are targeting an operating margin of 17 and are committed to continuing to grow curtiss wright for the long term we remain focused on driving long term profitability and remaining in the top quartile of our peer group in addition we are targeting double digit adjusted diluted eps growth we concluded 2018 was 6 37 in adjusted diluted eps and are confident that we can reach 8 50 by the end of 2021 regarding free cash flow we expect to generate more than 1 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next three years we are raising our minimal annual free cash flow target base from 250 million to at least 300 million improved operational performance will help us reach this goal combining organic and acquisitive growth with our leaner and much more efficient operating structure our constituents will further benefit from curtiss wright s solid growth in earnings per share and free cash flow for years to come in summary we look forward to continuing to deliver on our long term strategy and generating solid financial results for our stockholders at this time i d like to open up today s conference call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of peter arment of baird your line is now open peter arment baird analyst thanks good morning dave glenn dave adams chairman and chief executive officer hi peter glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer good morning peter peter arment baird analyst hey i guess thanks for all the targets and the updated information on the china direct i guess i just wanted to talk guess about the new long term targets initially when we think about just your sales outlook in the kind of the 17 adjusted margin target is there any way to give us a little color how you think that plays out with the individual segments dave adams chairman and chief executive officer well peter i ll talk to the models we prepared we prepared several scenarios to get to that these targets have not broken down specifically by segment but we ve done several models with ebitda exemptions and say 12 axis ph one scenario we did and if we did that we have to spend probably 210 million to 375 million on acquisitions over the next three years each year or between 600 000 and 1 1 billion in total over the three year period we would expect to utilize our revolver and again use to pay our strong cash flow to pay it down from a debt to cap we would go from 36 down to 30 in that scenario over the three year period so we feel we have plenty of room from a leverage standpoint to do what we need to do but i don t really have that broken down by segment getting to our 70 margin does include our continued margin improvement initiatives that we again also hope get to that 17 but i m sorry i don t have it by margin by segment peter arment baird analyst okay and then just as another follow up i guess specifically on the quarter organic growth was down again in kind of in defense and it was down again in q3 and i think you re expecting i m talking about specifically the defense segment is it just do we just view this as timing associated with the projects that you re working on with the naval business or maybe just some additional color there dave adams chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean i talked to the person who heads up that i mean we haven t watched any programs it is a good portion of their business is book to bill and you can try to predict when you think you re going to get the orders but the customer controls that so you ve seen some shifts in the 2019 and our aero defense is up in 2019 by 10 so you are seeing that flow into 2019 but it is timing issue peter arment baird analyst okay and then just one last one just related to filling the revenue gaap with the from china direct you mentioned that you re going to do it through a increased defense revenues just do you have line of sight on those revenues or just based on what the projects that you have in backlog or at least on the programs of record thanks dave adams chairman and chief executive officer no we have line of sight i mean it comes from our strategic plan i mean that the cvn 80 peaks i believe in 2020 the jsf is going to continue we have line those are long term defense programs that we have good line of sight on peter arment baird analyst okay i appreciate the color thanks dave thanks glenn dave adams chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of michael ciarmoli of suntrust your line is now open michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question and i love seeing the new target out there glenn maybe just a follow up just a clarity i don t think i heard you in that first comment how much m a did you say would be needed to accomplish the 5 to 7 cagr did you say a 1 billion glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer i said between 601 1 billion over the three year period michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst got it got it okay and just on that target i mean the margin getting up to 17 presumably you said you don t have any more ap1000 orders in there you ve got not only do you have that little bit of a revenue gaap which you guys have managed but presumably you re going to have a downtick of some of those higher margin revenues so i know you didn t give us any color by segment but can we sort of assume that maybe the profitability profile in power might have a little bit more pressure on it and you kind of see maybe some margin expansion in the other two segments just given that the the 81 000 at 23 sort of rolls off here is that a fair way to look at that glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer that is absolutely a fair way to look at that michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst okay and then just a maybe a couple of housekeeping items i think you ve mentioned in the prepared remarks a delay in your agreement with boeing can you just elaborate on that and if there s any potential margin pressure you might see as we sort of know what boeing is trying to do it with suppliers maybe just give us a little more color there dave adams chairman and chief executive officer yes we go mike this is dave we go through this contract negotiation every two years to five years and we re basically in the same point that we ve been at every several years and it s been a little bit of a delay in the negotiations on it and if anything it would mean a uptick in margins going forward we ve talked a lot in the past about the business that we have the main stay of curtiss wright is high ip proprietary type business and products niche oriented and so forth and so we look with a similar some of the more let s say common parts that we might do like built to print and so forth so that s part of the negotiations and like i said i think that going forward you ll see an uptick as a result of this kind of a delay and anything else that might be associated with it michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst okay that s helpful and then just back to the ap1000 maybe just two items i know you didn t include any potential future orders but maybe dave can you give us sort of the state of the union on what the marketplace looks like i know saudi arabia has launched a pretty broad infrastructure spending plan and then glenn just on the gaap you talked about back filling that gap with defense but i m just thinking about the overhead side while a lot of those potential revenues be able to flow through the cheswick facility where you have excess capacity there and it sounds like you should be able to utilize that capacity but how should we think about that i ll jump back in the queue guys glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer no you re right i mean a good chunk of it is obviously on the navy side is going to flow through cheswick and we ve been modelling that for several years now as you know and the gap obviously become a lot more manageable as well but yeah a good chunk of it will come through cheswick but you will also going to have fighter jets and things that come from other parts of the business as well dave adams chairman and chief executive officer and let me get mike s other half and that is on relative to stated union on ap1000 beyond what we said in prepared remarks everything is going good we got commercial operation and all the sites that s been declared so far and a lot of interest in saudi arabia and they ve got several different countries basically quoting for their next iteration of power and where it s going to come from and certainly the ap1000 is one of those india is still very strong and that s still i mean looking at a couple of years out at least it s just going to take them a while and we are still working this indemnification stuff and i believe that we will get over it but that market is very big india is and then china remains the world s largest we re still looking at a total of 4 billion market for the reactor coolant pumps and then i ve said in the past if we got only half of those we d be happy with that but we went in and gave you the bold statement here that we were not putting orders in for the next three year period we re not forecasting that and that s pretty much the staple of our diet here at curtiss wright as you ve grown to know us and that is underpromise and overdeliver and if the order comes in wonderful if it doesn t then ok we didn t plan on it and it s not that we re not planning on it it s that we re just being inaudible michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst hold on hold on this call dave hold on dave adams chairman and chief executive officer it s not that michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst sorry guys dave adams chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s not that we re not intending for it to come and eventually we re just being very conservative in our approach on this one so the outlook still remains really strong for the nuclear side especially in the commercial side michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst got it thanks a lot guys i ll jump back in the queue dave adams chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of myles walton of ubs your line is now open myles walton ubs analyst good morning dave adams chairman and chief executive officer hi myles glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer good morning myles myles walton ubs analyst dave i was hoping you talk a bit about the pivot on the capital deployment and any constraints that you re putting on that pivot as it relates to roic or hurdles hurdle rates and how those are similar or different to what you ve had kind of over the last few years since you turn the spigot back on for m a dave adams chairman and chief executive officer no we actually haven t changed the roic on our targets 10 year three 12 by year five and hurdle rates we re still looking at from a multiple we like the last two that we bought and until what we feel exceptionally good about those one of them has been accretive from the get go the other one with the changes that we re implementing and this new 20 million investment that s going to bring them up to exactly where we expected them to be so if you like the last two then you should love the next ones that we look for and hope to find and so that s just really again the staple of our diet is more of the same and it s proven us right that we can do it we earned the right to do we re not going to throw away that right that we earned so i expect it to keep going we got from jumping a little more specifically into what we re more interested in is from a targeting perspective we ve got to be proprietary high barriers to entry we love customer diversification although i know it gives you guys some headaches in terms of i m trying to figure this out but the diversification gives us a lot of anti cyclical sort of problematic issues like recessions and stuff solid operating margins so it s not dilutive and then in areas embedded computing for example the military side and some of the industrial side so we like to see for isr we re going to continue to focus there and a lot of opportunities and then on the industrial on off highway we have this on the cab ph project that continues to grow and ramp up with a lot of interest from our customers same industrial valves we like those chemical water markets great we just not interested in a peer play oil and gas we ll avoid that as we ve stated in the past and then i guess you ve got some sensors in there that that we continue to look for but that s once again a very niche oriented play so we ve got our peers ph out there on a lot of opportunities and are more to come but we do expect that we will be able to achieve that myles walton ubs analyst and maybe i missed it the 5 to 7 total sales cagr the implied organic is it about half that or so is that what s kind of online dave adams chairman and chief executive officer you know it s roughly three to five and then let s say some acquisitive maybe in the range of three ish adam farley stifel analyst okay okay got it and then just maybe one last one when you look back at the target for sales since 2013 obviously that didn t hit the mark was that and you turned up the dial on r d here i guess it s a 30 basis point headwind or so for 2019 would that have helped you do you think looking back to be turning up their dial on r d did you know where to invest and then is that what you think is going to kind of move you from what s been a 1 or 2 organic growth to 3 to 5 organic growth dave adams chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think the turn up the dial probably three years ago on r d is this really a turning point it s i d say a because it s one of several that will move that organic side that we also started a significant focus on the organic side meaning we as i just indicated on for example some of our commercial aerospace stuff if it doesn t meet the criteria that we have built in for hurdle rates relative to margin so forth then we re not going to pursue that but when it so we really drove a very specific approach to it but then on the r d side i ll throw out a couple of things that we have worked on it and spent money on and with long term values of they are anywhere between 3 million and 10 million the tilt sensors that we have developed these are for primarily work platforms and off highway vehicles and that s some something that s somewhat associated with the inaudible but there is an example of the next generation flight test for the classic flight test and then now a more growing demand that we found in the last three years and certainly after we acquired ttc and then have been growing aircraft is for more of a permanent fit for flight test information and big data kind of stuff and when you get a permanent fit you know that for us that really is meat on the bone because flight test now goes up in a plane and it s a bunch of planes but it doesn t go up in all the planes so now with the next gen with a permanent fit well that would go up in every planes so there is an example of the one plus one would equal three or four trusted card ph cyber security anti tamper technology again something that we started ramping up a few years ago the leap engine ramp on some of our services businesses that that s going to generate some nice incremental sales that was a minimal r d investment but by doing some of our laser stuff and then some of our more automated the shot peening activities that s a bump for us so what we look for in all of these r d kinds of opportunities are areas where either we haven t been before over there and we can see a exponential leapfrog and that really play a small a large portion of that three to five growth you know then in the last one we just announced you saw the other day was the curtiss wright honeywell teaming on crash record technology the europeans are looking for a longer cycle of peening and they re also looking for greater bandwidth and other information coming out of those with real time data and here for the market has not had it and we are leaders in that arena so that s why we teamed with honeywell and we re spending r d dollars there so it s some things like that and i ve got a whole list i got two pages worth here mike going to continue all of them but those are the kinds of things myles that you re going to see from us myles walton ubs analyst okay well thanks for the color thanks guys dave adams chairman and chief executive officer thanks myles operator and our next question comes from the line of nathan jones of stifel your line is now open adam farley stifel analyst hey good morning this is adam farley on for nathan dave adams chairman and chief executive officer hi adam good morning glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer how are you adam farley stifel analyst i kind of just shifting subjects general industrial market sales growth was driven by solid demand for industrial valves so maybe get some color on that are you seeing any pickup in mro spending is there any projects spending downstream and i think your 2019 guidance also called strength there so any color there would be great glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s both projects and mro little bit higher internationally than domestic but it also includes subsea pump in that particular category and new industrial pumps and valves category but it s again both projects and mro mostly internationally is higher than domestic and includes subsea pumping being up as well adam farley stifel analyst it s helpful and then just price cost in tariffs you guys have managed pretty well there maybe some raw materials are coming down a bit maybe just talk about price cost and then also in supply chain if there s any discrete items out there that we not really thinking about they are harder to source maybe electronic components something like that thanks glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean we continue to monitor that whole global tariff situation and have been addressing any cost issues with our supply chain including alternative sourcing or raising our prices if necessary so based on the tariffs in active data ph and what we have done we had a 2 million net impact in the fourth primarily in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the commercial industrial segment for 2019 we are expecting 4 million incremental impact through the commercial industrial segment the gross amount was originally 8 million so we ve been able to essentially mitigate 50 of the impact most of the wave one and two the tariff mostly impacted our industrial valves in the c i segment and the third way but mostly impacted the electronic components and accessories for motorized vehicles again also on the commercial it s on commercial industrial segment from a cost standpoint the only thing we really experience i think we ve said it before and we are not hearing the preponderance or input costs are going up but we have seems shortages in some of the electronic components that are in our defense these are capacitors and things where just supply is just greater than way greater than demand so that s caused the little bit of disruption in some increased cost to expedite parts and things like that but other than that we haven t really heard a widespread cost increase in our inputs adam farley stifel analyst it s great thank you guys glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of kristine liwag of bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning guys dave adams chairman and chief executive officer good morning kristine kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst for your 2019 to 2021 target what are you assuming for the ap1000 in that 5 to 7 total sales cagr and what are you assuming in terms of deals in that number and that 850 adjusted diluted eps by the end of 21 dave adams chairman and chief executive officer yeah we are assuming no new orders on the ap1000 suggest our cap1 000 order right now in the target and we said for the inorganic growth we got to spend between 600 000 and 1 1 billion for over the three year period to achieve our goals kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst that was helpful and on the navy we re starting to see some operational risks in the navy supply chain in the past few months we ve seen issues with missile tubes and even issues on the virginia class submarine which has been in serial production for some time it seems like experienced labor is pretty tight and may be contributing to some of these issues with your now higher navy content with dresser rand how do you think about managing operating risk in your navy business and also if there is a two carrier by that is approved and funded is there upside to your navy growth in 2019 dave adams chairman and chief executive officer from the operational side kristine we re not seeing any real hurdles in terms of manpower operationally to or in cheswick and bethlehem and wellsville and across the different navy sites new york long island we haven t found that to be a problem and as matter of fact if anything we ve probably got excess capacity in terms of labor and because we were becoming so efficient so that has not been a hurdle for us we demonstrated to the navy on more than one occasion and in each of the sites that we re absolutely capable to handle what it is that they e given us and going forward and then relative to the additional block by nothing in 19 it wouldn t benefit 19 it would basically does and from my perspective glenn might want to add to this but what it basically does it gives you certainly long term visibility of 10 year build cycle with the five and five for building a carrier and so i will be delighted to have that happen we think you probably get some purchase side purchase pickup there on ppm ppd for some parts but that assumes that orders are all delivered down at the same time and which they re are not yet but in any case it certainly cements a longer term visibility profile for us which we would love glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer i mean it s definitely going to be positive to us we did see the huntington ingalls order back in january which is a good design good start but an abatement indicated should enable them to build these carriers to built every three years to four years so with our 380 million content is used to be over poc of five years obviously if we move that up and layered on top of what we re doing now it s going to be positive for us but until we know that procurement pattern of the plan we can t really tell we don t have anything in our guidance for that either as well so that would be upside to us whenever we get the information kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and switching gears on power when i look at the midpoint of your 2019 revenue outlook of 6 85 million and i look at your 2018 reported revenue of 6 48 million that s a difference of 37 million but if i take out your 9 million expected growth for ap1000 that s only giving you 28 million revenue growth for the rest of the segment i guess i would have thought that that should have been higher with the timing of dresser rand since that closed mid year last year is there anything that i m missing glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer no no i don t think so and it is there is incremental sales obviously on cvn 80 and the virginia subs are up there s probably some offsets in there to that not thinking up but you also you do have another quarter of drg in here as well so you i think you got little pieces yeah kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks guys glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer guys thank you operator and our next question is a follow up from the line of peter arment of baird your line is now open peter arment baird analyst yeah thanks just a quick one in the exciting subject to pension glenn any kind of commentary that you can give us on update on the pension or any contributions that you may have to make in your when you re thinking about your 2019 to 2021 targets thanks glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer yeah no we not no major changes in our assumptions but we did make that voluntary pension contribution in the first quarter of last year the 50 million contribution and since then we don t project any further contributions for the next months four years five years probably including last year so no no contributions on the horizon as of today peter arment baird analyst great thanks glenn glenn tynan vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to david adams chairman and chief executive officer dave adams chairman and chief executive officer thank you everyone for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again during our first quarter 2019 earnings call have a great day

tupperware s stock fell over 20 after its recent earnings miss the company has announced a turnaround plan but will it succeed tupperware tup 2 44 reported its fourth quarter 2018 earnings on jan 30 and surprised investors with weak financial performance and a 60 dividend cut the company s stock price dived over 27 in the day following the announcement and is down nearly 40 in the past year could tupperware s depressed stock price be a buying opportunity or is the dividend cut a signal that management sees more pain ahead perhaps both statements are true what drove the recent earnings miss tupperware s q4 2018 earnings were weak due to a combination of macroeconomic headwinds stemming from the strong us dollar and company specific issues q4 revenue declined 14 but only declined 7 in constant currency terms q4 eps declined 11 but only declined 6 in constant currency a strong us dollar hurts tupperware s earnings because over 90 of the company s sales are generated outside of the united states and tupperware reports its financials in terms of us dollars the reported dollar amount of revenue and earnings are worth less in us dollar terms if the foreign exchange rate in places where tupperware operates becomes relatively weaker vs the us dollar this negative impact from currency exchange rates explains half of the recent quarter s revenue decline another headwind for tupperware has been weakness in emerging market economies 67 of tupperware s sales are generated in emerging market countries such as india china mexico and brazil historically these countries have spurred growth for the company but today these markets are suffering due to a whole host of issues in the recent quarter tupperware saw its sales in asia decline 16 and its sales in south america decline 22 however not all of tupperware s problems can be blamed on external economic forces the company saw its salesforce decline 5 last year tupperware has a direct to consumer business model whereby an independent salesforce distributes the company s products directly to retailers and consumers tupperware is dependent on its direct salesforce to sell its products and a decline in the number of sales people translates to lower product sales there is no doubt that the q4 earnings report was disappointing but much of the negative drivers were due to economic factors that are out of the company s control these economic headwinds could abate or even reverse in the future also shareholders may be happy to hear that the company has a plan to address the company specific issues check out the latest tupperwareearnings call transcript a turnaround plan tupperware s turnaround plan is propelled by the dividend cut tupperware cut its dividend from 0 68 per share to 0 27 per share a 60 reduction this reduction saves the company 80 million per year in cash which it plans to invest back into the business on the q4 2018 earnings call management announced a plan to invest 100 million over the next 3 years in efforts to grow sales and reduce costs specifically the company wants to deploy technology that will help improve the productivity of its salesforce by spending less time on logistical and administrative duties and more time focused on speaking to customers furthermore tupperware is streamlining its organizational structure and compensation so that there are fewer layers of management and salespeople are better incentivized the company noted that a reduction in management headcount would result in 50 million in annual cost savings beginning in 2020 tupperware has suffered a decline in its salesforce headcount over the past year which has translated into a decline in revenue because tupperware uses a direct to customer salesforce the company must constantly work toward recruiting and retaining productive salespeople for the business to thrive the company believes that the investments it plans to make over the next 3 years will improve the size and the productivity of the salesforce helping to drive revenue growth tupperware s turnaround plan appears very sensible the big question mark is execution if the changes being made do not result in a better salesforce headcount and improved productivity then the company may need to explore a deeper rethink of the brand or business model shoring up the balance sheet in addition to the cost cuts and growth investments announced tupperware will be allocating the remaining savings from its reduced dividend payments to paying down debt and opportunistically repurchasing shares metric financials as of q4 2018 in millions total debt 888 9 2018 adjusted ebitda reported 351 6 debt to ebitda ratio 2 53x tupperware carries 888 9 million in total debt and reported 2018 adjusted ebitda of 351 6 million ebitda is a measure of earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is the measure of earnings most commonly used for assessing leverage because it shows a company s capacity to service interest payments taking the ratio of debt to ebitda shows the company has a leverage ratio of 2 53x while tupperware does not have an unsustainable level of indebtedness leverage could become a more serious problem if earnings continue to decline the company is targeting a leverage ratio below 2 0x over the next couple years with 149 million in cash on its balance sheet and over 125 million in cash flow expected for 2019 reducing leverage likely won t be a herculean task the company will be balancing debt reductions with share buybacks last year tupperware announced a 200 million share buyback plan the company executed 100 million of buybacks in 2018 and recommitted to finishing the remaining 100 million of buybacks opportunistically share buybacks give the company more flexibility than dividends sacrificing dividends for a stronger balance sheet is a bitter pill to swallow for shareholders however shoring up the balance sheeting and shifting to a more flexible capital return policy will protect the company ahead of the next economic downturn putting the pieces together the depressed stock price and dividend cut have rattled tupperware s shareholders however there is a silver lining to the story much of the weak financial performance over the past quarter and year can be attributed to macroeconomic forces which may abate or even reverse in the future the company specific issues are fixable and tupperware has taken major steps to address the problems the dividend cut is a red flag to the market but it provides the company with the flexibility it needs to turnaround the company and improve its balance sheet despite the dividend cut the stock still yields nearly 4 which could be attractive to prospective investors the deciding factor in the fate of tupperware s stock will be execution the company has reset expectations and laid out a viable recovery plan it will be important to see how the company executes against that plan over the next year to determine if the turnaround will be successful or if greater changes will need to be made

kira sterling chief marketing officer gregg ziegler senior vp and treasurer and don salmon president of tbi mortgage company before i begin i ask you to read the statement on forward looking information in yesterday s release and on our website i caution you that many statements on this call are forward looking based on assumptions about the economy world events housing and financial markets and many other factors beyond our control that could significantly affect future results those listening on the web can email questions to dyearley tollbrothers com fiscal year 2019 s first quarter results were strong with earnings per share of 0 76 pre tax earnings rising 15 home sales revenue increasing 12 and home sales gross margin improving 50 basis points compared to one year ago fiscal year 2019 s first quarter pre tax income was the highest q1 in over a decade our first quarter contracts were down 31 in dollars and 24 in units we attribute this decline to a difficult year over year comparison contracts were up 36 in dollars and 20 in units in fiscal 2018 s first quarter and the industrywide slowdown that began in the second half of 2018 advertisement advertisement california s drop was the most dramatic with contracts down 62 against a difficult comparison of up 72 in fiscal year 2018 s first quarter some of this was due to market softening and some was attributable to mix and the life cycle of certain communities companywide on a per community basis contracts tracked more closely to fiscal year 2016 and 2017 s first quarter which were still quite healthy than to the more robust fiscal year 2018 s first quarter story continues although we experienced a year over year decline in contracts each month of the first quarter the decline decreased as the quarter progressed non binding reservation deposits for the first three weeks of february are behind last year but we are encouraged by improving demand trends during the month and especially by our past week s deposits which exceeded last year s same week this is only one week worth of data but it is an important week historically one of the biggest sales weeks of the year nationally the economy remains healthy unemployment is low and housing supply is still tight many of our potential customers have benefited from a strong stock market and enjoyed increased equity in their existing homes mortgage rates have recently decreased to their lowest levels in a year these factors are all generally positive for the homebuilding sector given our focus on the upscale market our strategy has always been to acquire the best land in the most attractive locations we evaluate each community weekly to carefully balance sales pace and home price with our unique land position we intend to continue this balanced approach with our strong balance sheet we continue to evaluate attractive land new markets and builder acquisitions as we pursue our strategy of diversifying our product lines and geographic footprint we recently announced our entry into the metro salt lake city utah and portland oregon markets with our first communities in both markets planned to open this spring we are excited about these markets as they represent our continued expansion in the west advertisement advertisement our apartment business continues to grow in fiscal year 19 s first quarter we announced three new joint ventures to develop luxury apartment communities in westchester new york atlanta and frisco square a suburb of dallas total cost for the three communities will be about 270 million to build about 1 020 units because we develop our multifamily platform with partners and use project construction loans for about 65 of the cost toll brothers total investment across the three communities is about 24 million we generally get fees and promotes to increase our returns and on occasion we may recognize an upfront gain on the sale of land into the joint venture in q1 we recognized an 8 4 million gain from such a transaction this is a great stand alone business and even better serves as a complement to our for sale homebuilding business we currently have over 18 000 apartment units in various stages of development or lease up we are proud of our tremendous brand this quarter we were once again named by fortune magazine as the world s most admired home building company this is the fifth consecutive year we have been so honored we thank the tremendous team of toll brothers associates who make these recognitions possible with our well located land strong brand and wide variety of communities we believe we are well positioned now let me turn it over to marty advertisement advertisement martin p connor chief financial officer thanks doug before i address the specifics of this quarter i do want to note that a reconciliation of the non gaap measures referenced during today s discussion to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the back of yesterday s release we exceeded our expectations for earnings this quarter our pre tax income rose 15 on a home sale revenue increase of 12 home sales gross margin came in 50 basis points better than a year ago driven primarily by solid operations and favorable mix interest expense through cost of sales was 2 6 of home sales revenues down 30 basis points compared to a year ago impairments remained modest at 7 6 million in fiscal year 2019 s first quarter we had an sg a margin of 12 3 which is a 110 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2018 s first quarter the improved q1 sg a margin reflects increased revenue and good cost control during the quarter we recognized an 8 4 million net gain on the sale of land to into an apartment joint venture that doug just mentioned and we also had a 12 million gain on the disposition of a golf course we remain focused on maintaining our conservative balance sheet with great liquidity low leverage and a long dated maturity profile we ended fiscal year 2019 s first quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 42 7 on a gross basis and a net debt to capital ratio of 36 both compared to 44 2 and 40 1 at fiscal year 2018 s first quarter end we had more than 1 9 billion of untapped cash and available credit facilities at quarter end our weighted average debt maturity is 5 2 years our weighted average interest rate is 4 65 and we have only 250 million of maturities due in the next 36 months our book value per share at fiscal year 2019 s first quarter end was 33 04 our highest ever and it s up from 32 57 last quarter we are well positioned to take advantage of land opportunities to make acquisitions to reduce our debt or to invest in our company through further share repurchases advertisement advertisement here s our forward looking income statement guidance for the second quarter of 2019 we expect deliveries of between 1 650 and 1 850 units with an average delivered price of between 860 000 and 890 000 we expect adjusted home sales gross margin of approximately 23 1 of home sales revenues and sg a as a percentage of second quarter home sales revenues of approximately 11 3 we expect other income income from unconsolidated entities and land sales gross profit of approximately 13 million in total we expect the tax rate of approximately 27 5 we are pleased that our community count has grown from 295 a year ago to 317 at the first quarter end and we expect modest community count growth through the balance of the year lastly we expect interest expense to cost of sales to be approximately 2 7 and our weighted average share count for the second quarter to be approximately 148 million shares now let me turn it back to doug douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thank you marty nicole let s open it up to questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from nishu sood of deutsche bank please go ahead nishu sood deutsche bank analyst thank you i wanted to ask first about you mentioned that the year over year pace the decline lessened as the quarter went on month by month and then also if you re looking at the non binding reservations in february those improved as well can you just give us some numbers around those potentially just to understand where we might be currently advertisement advertisement douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer nishu thanks for the question i m sorry but we re not going to get into the specifics of the numbers we mentioned a few years ago that we would certainly give some flavor but we re going to get off giving week to week month to month numbers so i think we ve explained it accurately which is each month of the quarter the decrease lessened and for february while we are behind after three weeks a year ago we are encouraged by this past week which exceeded last year nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it may be thinking about it a different way then given that your quarter and in february here as well have covered the period where there has been quite a bit of rate volatility can you talk about your thoughts perhaps about how the movement in rates has affected your buyer and the lessening decline that you re talking about advertisement advertisement douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so we had a huge move down in rates in q1 the quarter started with a five and an eight rate and the quarter ended with a four and a half rate i m talking about a 30 year fixed conforming no point mortgage that s obviously a dramatic decrease coupled with that the messaging out of the fed that they were going to probably slowdown or eliminate rate increases throughout 19 so i think the combination of the decrease in the rate and the commentary on what was coming was certainly encouraging we absolutely felt on improvement in the quality of traffic in the interest of our buyers i think sales was pretty down through the fall and when surveyed more recently they re excited they feel like a solid spring season is upon them and i think one of the primary drivers of that is that decrease in rates that i talked about martin p connor chief financial officer advertisement advertisement got it got it and just in terms of incentives can you also just talk about through this bout of volatility obviously happened at a seasonally slow period of time and rates have come back your willingness to use incentives maybe you could just discuss how you re thinking about that and then also the competitive environment in terms of incentives please douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so as we mentioned earlier on this call as i mentioned we buy land in main and main we believe most of our land is unique we look at every community when it comes to pricing pricing of course includes incentives to evaluate what should be done by community and i think we do a very good job of thoughtfully balancing price with pace and with the quality of the land our incentive right now is 3 1 of our sales price and it went up very very modestly as an average nationwide this quarter versus prior quarters nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from stephen kim of evercore isi please go ahead stephen kim evercore isi analyst yes thanks very much guys i just wanted to ask a question regarding your brand and the flexibility of the toll brothers brand is that particularly as it relates to the ability to move it down market and maintain the integrity of the aspirational aspect of the brand can you just give a sense for how flexible you think you can be maybe in terms of putting it in context of price points and what gives you the confidence that you can take it down that far while maintaining the cash that it s always had douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve as you know as we ve talked about we have had and will continue to have a great variety in the price point of our communities from new york city and california that are obviously multi million to jacksonville and boise and other locations that are down in the 300 000 400 000 500 000 i am very confident that we can continue our great brand as we introduce more lower priced communities first of all there won t be that many in the scheme of things right we have 300 to 350 communities and we re talking about something that will probably be less than 10 but more importantly the quality still of the architecture the sales center the sales managers the design and decorating of the home the websites the way we treat our customer the customer experience i am very confident after having watched it be launched in places like phoenix where our average price was up in the 800 000 and we have a new offering down into the threes ph that is doing terrifically well where people are delighted to be buying the toll brothers home in the threes and it s still different from what they re getting from other buyers or other builders in the threes because it s brought to you by toll brothers so it s a good question it s a fair question we re obviously aware of it but i am very confident that we can continue on this business strategy without any dilution to the great toll brand we are building apartments under the toll brothers apartment living name we re building student housing under the toll brothers campus living name it s all condo quality in terms of residents clubs and pools on the roof and finishes of the units themselves and we re actually leveraging the toll brand into that business and never once have i heard a comment out of anybody in the sales office that a buyer was concerned because they saw that we re now in luxury apartments so i m confident we can be wider in scope but still focus on what got us here which is great luxury and just expand it a bit without any issues stephen east wells fargo securities analyst great now i appreciate that full answer second question i had is maybe one more for marty the gross margin in the sg a both kind of surprised us in favorable directions i was kind of curious if you could maybe just tease out was there anything there that would explain why they performed better here in the last when we see the results here a few months after you last spoke martin p connor chief financial officer sure so gross margin essentially remained flat with the fourth quarter i think to address your question specifically the ops team did very well during the quarter and we saw our house costs come in a little bit lower than projected we also benefited a bit from favorable mix including more california deliveries than expected and as it relates to sg a i think we had very efficient cost control from the corporate level as well as out in the field and we had more revenue than we expected stephen east wells fargo securities analyst well do do it every time thanks very much guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you steve operator our next question comes from stephen east of wells fargo please go ahead stephen east wells fargo securities analyst thank you good morning guys doug talking about your progression you ve talked about the recent week i know you don t want to put numbers around it so we ll stay away from that but i guess i m more interested when you look at some of your big markets california the mid atlantic mid atlantic was a big positive surprise in the quarter i just want to understand how those progressed both in the quarter and in february douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so mid atlantic stephen was driven primarily by virginia which is a very large and important market for toll and it s clicked ph the government shutdown didn t have any impact on buyer sentiment we have a terrific management team down there that has redesigned a lot of the communities the product and i m just really proud of how they re operating and the market demand is very solid and that was the primary driver for the good results your question is more specific as to sort of month to month within the quarter it similar to my commentary on the company which is that it improved month to month throughout the quarter and the same is through february stephen east wells fargo securities analyst okay douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer california as i mentioned in my prepared comments it s a really tough comp california was up 72 first quarter of 18 versus 17 and last year we had a number of communities that had just recently opened that had huge pent up demand at the openings i mean we had hundreds and hundreds of people that had already been pre approved for mortgages before we even opened the doors and this five communities out there three in the north and two in the south that combined the 259 contracts a year ago compared to 58 this quarter and when we study those five communities alone they were all new openings they all had huge pent up demand with all these pre qualified buyers waiting for our launch today they are further into the life cycle of the community the backlogs have built so the delivery times have gotten longer we ve obviously had price increases there is still solid demand and that demand has improved through february but it s very different to what it was like a year ago when they had just recently opened stephen east wells fargo securities analyst fair enough all right that s really helpful there and then you were talking a little bit about strategy if i can come back to it i guess a two part question one how important is m a when you look at it moving forward and what are you really wanting to accomplish with it and then you ve got a lot of different initiatives and you went through some of them but gibraltar student housing apartment single family for rent you know hitting the entry level in the active adult as you look at your mix of business where do you want to invest more dollars more time more and then where do you want to pull back a little bit if any of those varied efforts that you have going on douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so the first part was m a and we re interested we have an m a team that that s all they do and right now i d say we probably have as good or better deal flow than we had last year we looked at 30 builders last year we didn t buy any but there was a handful that we re interested in and i d say we re on pace for that or better and nothing certainly to announce but we re in action and the m a market appears to be pretty robust we use m a to enter a new market and we may use m a to enter a different product line or price point those would be the two strategies behind it as for the second part of your question which was all the different business lines that we are now in i m really happy with all of it i mentioned on my prepared comments how delighted i am with and we are with the apartment business the single family for rent is new but it appears to be something that we will be very exciting gibraltar you know it s small right now i mean that company was built to buy distressed portfolios of loans from banks and be a workout restructuring firm it s now a land bank firm we ve had better markets and that team is in place for good markets and bad either land bank or become a workout restructuring firm so you asked has anything shed or downsized absolutely not our primary focus just to finish your questions is still our core luxury homebuilding business that s what gets us up every day and that s where we re going to spend most of our money and be most focused stephen east wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator our next question comes from alan ratner of zelman associates please go ahead alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions first question i believe this time of year in february you guys typically do your national sales event and in the past i think doug you ve kind of downplayed the impact of that in terms of margin but just curious when you look at your improvement in the non binding deposits can you talk about how this year s sales event compared to the last few years and tying on to that just wanted to confirm the 3 1 incentive number is that on orders or closings douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer orders alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst got it douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so the national sales event we do four national sales events every year i guess it s our version of inaudible december to remember it s something that s something that we ve worked hard at and works well and we re able to bring sort of national marketing to it it is a combination of some i d say repurposed incentives in the field and then vendor incentives that are kicked in during these events that is not toll dollars but is the opportunity to upgrade flooring upgrade kitchen cabinets upgrade plumbing fixtures et cetera where the vendors participate with us because they want our backlogs to grow just as we do and the timing of the events last year to this year lined up the february event is our biggest because it s sort of launches the spring selling season in terms of a comparison to a year ago it was slower than last year for the same reasons i gave that overall february to date has been slower and it was more similar to what we saw in the prior year we feel good about where we are right now and we re delighted with the last week of the sales event and how strong the deposits were alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst right i appreciate that doug and then second question maybe for marty obviously only given one quarter worth of guidance but your backlog gives you pretty good visibility to the back half of the year as well so any chance you can just directionally talk about when you look at the homes in backlog expected to deliver beyond 2q is the margin on those homes materially different than the 23 1 you re currently guiding for in 2q martin p connor chief financial officer i think we just weren t comfortable going beyond the quarter at this point alan we ve seen a lot of changes in the marketplace over the last three to six months between demand and interest rates et cetera as it relates to the margin in our backlog i think we just delivered margin that was consistent with three months ago s margin we ve given guidance for three months from now i wouldn t suspect that there s anything dramatically different than the guidance we ve given but we don t want to get any more specific than that alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst okay that s helpful thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from michael rehaut of jpmorgan securities please go ahead michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thanks good morning everyone douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst first question i had was kind of following in on the incentives and the gross margins you re able to be roughly 50 bps ahead of last year in this first quarter and are looking for a similar year over year improvement in 2q with the incentives you said i guess up only slightly on orders in the first quarter perhaps you could kind of describe your pace over price strategy it seems like there is a decent differentiation between yourselves and perhaps some of the other builders that got a lot more aggressive on incentives in the past several months in the face of the slowdown so given your price point given your positioning it seems like you just kind of took at the recent volatility and decided to hold margin over pace is that a fair assessment or and maybe just kind of talk broadly to the approach douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure michael so i had mentioned on the last call that we didn t feel like the months of november december and most of january were months where you would chase sales through big increases in incentives because it s a slow time of the year but that we would reevaluate as the spring season was beginning and i think that is part of what you ve seen and we ll see how the spring season continues to develop and we ve given plenty of commentary already on the start of that season the one difference between toll and many of the other builders is we re not spec builder we don t have finished inventory that is sitting there and needs to move because it s been built you know you can sit on ground and cut the grass and pay the taxes and it s not all that painful but when you re sitting on a finished home you got to make a decision every week inaudible years ago on a finished spec in every week it s sitting there one more week guys what are we going to do we re going to drop the price one more week we got to drop the price it is completed martin p connor chief financial officer and it s difference between having 0 20 of your revenue dollar invested and 0 80 your revenue dollar invested douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so i think that is one significant difference between our business model and some of the other builders we talked about endlessly our land being unique hard to replace and in those that s not everywhere but in those locations we will be more deliberate and more thoughtful on the balance between pace and price michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst all right i appreciate it i guess secondly on the land market the recent pause we ve heard in generally this would apply to perhaps different price points but maybe a touch of softening here or there maybe a little bit of retrading maybe a little bit of easing on some terms have you seen any of that in your core markets and perhaps given your approach going to step in here or there if you ve seen any more opportunities come up in the last few months douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer not really the land market generally lags far behind the overall housing market until land sellers start feeling some pain start feeling pressure they generally stand pretty firm in limited cases we ve had some opportunities to renegotiate some terms but it s still a pretty robust land market out there there is still a lot of competition we have been careful and conservative and certainly tightened some underwriting in certain areas but i wouldn t say there s been any significant amount of retrading or renegotiation with land sellers michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from john lovallo of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions the first one marty the second quarter sg a as a percentage of sales guide of 11 3 seems a bit high just given the fact that your outlook appears to kind of call for flattish revenue on a year over year basis and that would be a pretty good step up on a year over year basis in sg a so anything one time in there that may be shifted from the first quarter into second quarter or how should we think about that outlook martin p connor chief financial officer no i don t think there s anything one time in there i think our g a is going to be almost within 1 million or 2 million in terms of absolute dollars and then the s components offer the touch john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and that would actually fit into the second question here in terms of i think it was last quarter you guys talked about outside realtor commissions being a little bit elevated versus history or at least versus the fourth quarter how did those trend in the first quarter martin p connor chief financial officer i don t think there was any change john in outside realtor commissions and remember that our outside realtor commissions are in our cost of goods sold it s our inside sales teams that are in our s for sg a john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay thank you guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from susan maklari of credit suisse please go ahead susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning susan maklari credit suisse analyst my first question is around you ve spoken in the past about perhaps some easing on the labor side of things which could help us as we think about as this year coming together can you just give us an update on what you re seeing from that front douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure we had modest decrease in building costs in q1 in certain markets we are hearing of contractors are green to some modest price concessions because they have slowed down which is typical of what we see when it s all demand and supply driven so they built up their teams and as our sales slowed a bit they had employees that were not as busy and now we ve had some modest opportunities to take the price down i think that will continue at least for a quarter or two as the sales over the summer and the fall start feeding through into construction our longer term we ll have to see where the markets are but it does appear that we will at least stop the increases and we have some modest decreases martin p connor chief financial officer and that stability and decrease that we ve been able to achieve this quarter shows up in our income statement nine months from now not douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer right susan maklari credit suisse analyst yeah ok my next question is around can you talk to some of the attributes of salt lake and portland what do you found attractive about getting into those markets and why you decided to go greenfield there versus maybe approaching it from an m a perspective douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we looked hard at m a opportunities we got close in one of those markets and so as we were looking we first study a market and decide we want to be here and then we look at how we re going to get there and as we re looking to buy a builder we re also putting a management team in place and looking to buy land so in both locations as we are in the early stages looking at m a opportunities we are beginning to buy land since we have not yet bought a builder in either market and i don t i m not suggesting there s anything cooking we now have a handful of land owned or controlled in both markets the management team is in place models the road is going in models being built so there is the strategy on whether it s m a or greenfield i mean if m a doesn t work we go with greenfield the what we liked about the markets we ve looked at portland from the perspective of the seattle team i guess ever since we got into seattle which is now about six years ago and have been studying and studying that market and to us it s a little it s a mini seattle that is only a couple of hours away it has great job growth it has some limitations on supply because of some pretty tough entitlements and development zones and that s right up our alley because we like markets that have difficult are difficult to get land entitled because we have the patience and the wherewithal to stick with it and when you get it it s gold a lot of the architecture can come right out of seattle our management team has moved down from seattle and so what i m describing i think is a natural progression out of our great success that we ve had in seattle salt lake city is a market we looked at for more than a decade it has changed dramatically in the last three to four years in terms of the diversity of businesses the economy growth it has become a very desirable place to live whether it be as a family moving up and working and what they now call the silicon slope because every city of course has to have a silicon something or whether it s move down location because of the lifestyle associated with salt lake and the mountain towns around it so we re really excited about both opportunities both markets and they will start out slower because they re greenfield but that can also be a more cautious way to go and i am very happy with the land we have the teams we have and stay tuned because we ll open in both locations this spring susan maklari credit suisse analyst all right thanks for all that color good luck douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you susan operator our next question comes from mike dahl of rbc capital markets please go ahead mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and all of the details so far douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst i wanted to ask about just the thoughts on where you see the business at a bit of a higher level i know you re not giving the guidance but clearly some market softness but i think doug overall what you re also speaking to is just a normalization particularly in a place like california where you described kind of some super normal trends that you re comping against so if we re thinking about kind of what you see as quote unquote more normal absorption for this type of market 15 16 17 as we re doing around two sales a month ist that about where you think the market is settling in at do you think there is opportunity for upside and if so how much of that is kind of your mix initiatives versus market recovery douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer mike i can t answer you specifically because i don t have that crystal ball i think i have properly described the difference between this first quarter and the last year i ve also explained that 17 was a really solid year in california and that s what 19 felt more like what i will say is i think we re positioned well with the communities we have and with the future land the land that we own that will become future communities so we re going to have community count growth add in california because of the land that we own and i am confident that like i said we are well positioned last year was a pretty unique year just in terms of the number of communities we opened within a relatively short time frame that had terrific pent up demand at the opening that s not to say that couldn t be repeated but it was certainly a unique year but overall we are positioned well with our holdings and with our brand and i feel good about our future out there mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay got it understood my second question maybe for marty i know that jv land and other category is pretty lumpy and you described some of the contributions to the quarter is there any i think you guys did about 150 million in the full year of 2018 any color you could give us on directionally or magnitude of what to expect for the balance of 2019 beyond the 13 million in 2q martin p connor chief financial officer sure so i think if we walk backwards a little bit last year we did do about 148 million we did around 167 million the year before that which was significantly influenced by our peer house project in brooklyn and the years before that we were right around the 100 million for two or three years in a row so i think we ve mentioned this part of our business as being important to us and being at some sustainable level right now i d put that sustainable level somewhere north of 100 million for this year and south of 150 million for this year this next upcoming quarters is going to be a little bit lower than a pro rata piece of that just because of the lack of any particular transactions that we currently have on the drawing board expected the close mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you operator our next question comes from ken zener of keybanc please go ahead kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning everybody douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst doug and marty obviously i heard read your comments about sequential orders and all that stuff so we will just let that sit my question is more around how your backlog margin in california which is obviously part of your one forward quarter guidance plays out but how that also interacts with what we re seeing as the lower orders from that area and i focus on california because ebit margin i think for fy 18 it s pretty a case 25 versus 15 ebit how you guys describe it but i m just trying to think about how that high margin contribution plays out within the one quarter forward guidance but also how it can play out structurally right two and three quarters down is that order orders begin to kind of flow into there i m trying to think structurally how that can play out any help there would be appreciated thank you martin p connor chief financial officer yeah ken it s marty i think we haven t given much in terms of guidance for the balance of the year but as it relates to your specific question in california i think the backlog we have gives us visibility into some level of stability in california deliveries for the balance of the year kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst you re saying for delivery i m just trying to see if it s as simple as looking at the margin contribution based on kind of what the orders might suggest about martin p connor chief financial officer i would technical difficulty unidentified participant analyst hi thank you for taking my questions i just wanted to look at the overall order asp you know 844 000 obviously there s a lot of mix going on and you re still calling for a 860 000 to 890 000 in the second quarter but just given kind of the recent sales trends and asps on this sales how should we think about trending delivered asps in the second half of this year thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so i think it s helpful to recognize that we sell homes from 300 000 to 3 million and so the movement in any particular quarter of either average delivered price or average selling price is really driven by mix predominantly not price increases or price incentives and so as we look across the balance of the year i think the best estimate you can use is the approximately 900 000 sales price sits in our backlog unidentified participant analyst okay i appreciate that and then secondly just to kind of follow up on the last question because it seems clear and i think marty you mentioned it earlier that california was obviously a benefit from a mix perspective in the first quarter and that would seem to continue in the second quarter but just given that the past two quarters of decline on the order side is it fair to assume that california would be a lower mix as a percentage of revenues in the second half of this year and accordingly what would that mean for margins thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer i think your presumption is directionally accurate but your timeframe is off i think you re going to get into next year before the california volume through the income statement is impactful to margins unidentified participant analyst okay thanks for the detail good luck douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from scott schrier of citi please go ahead scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask about the timing of closings understanding you came in toward the higher end of your guidance for and the next quarter it looks like the guide is a little lower than maybe what analysts were expecting so i m curious was there anything in there that happened understanding 1q 18 was a big orders quarter in your cycle times but was there anything in terms of cycle times or regional implications that we should be considering from the closings timing martin p connor chief financial officer scott i m not sure i can point to anything in particular i do know that the nature of the buildings we are constructing the attached product we are constructing in northern california provides a bit longer backlog and some of the detached single family product around the country so i would say there is some impact of longer cycle times not necessarily abnormally long or longer than our expectations in northern california just because of the 24 and 36 unit buildings that need to be completed before you can deliver one year scott schrier citi analyst got it and then can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the design studios and lot premiums and design studio option premiums and things like that douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so as you know we have almost 30 now design studios around the country in each division where the client goes to pick all their finishes and we encourage that process it s a major part of what distinguishes toll from other builders our upgrades i m not this is not a number just for design studio because some of it is structural changes that occur at the sales center at the community but we are still running at about 160 000 of upgrades which is about 20 of the home price and that number has not changed scott schrier citi analyst got it okay so no real change given market conditions or anything in buyers appetite for options basically douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer that s correct scott schrier citi analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from jade rahmani of kbw please go ahead jade rahmani kbw analyst thank you very much can you provide any additional information on the single family rental investment what s the magnitude and scope of the investment and is it investment in another company which has been reported in the media do you expect to grow it et cetera any color would be helpful douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we would love to give some color but we must apologize that we are under confidentiality at the moment and cannot discuss it so what you read in any builder magazines or elsewhere it did not come from us and we can t comment on it jade rahmani kbw analyst okay just separately in terms of operations can you comment on where current cycle times are running douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer the range and it s so community specific is six or seven to 12 months and again it depends on the size of the home the extent of the backlog the trade base the depth of the trade base but that is the general range martin p connor chief financial officer i think in a perfect world it would be three to four weeks shorter than it is right now but labor constraints have that extended the three or four weeks i mentioned but i think it s the same three or four weeks we ve seen for 18 to 24 months jade rahmani kbw analyst so safe to assume that the next quarter s deliveries reflect orders from the middle of last year martin p connor chief financial officer in some markets that could be from the middle of last year in other markets it could be even shorter or longer than that jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer that s a good average operator our next question comes from jay mccanless of wedbush securities please go ahead jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking my questions just wanted to pick up on that theme given the longer cycle times you guys have and the visibility that should provide you why are you all not comfortable giving full year guidance when you think have pretty decent certainty of what s in the backlog martin p connor chief financial officer well i think jay would given some consideration to that and i think we re just not comfortable at this point we ve seen a lot of changes in rate expectations we ve seen changes in demand that have been pretty significant over the last three and six months and we didn t think it was prudent to give guidance beyond the three months that we gave and we gave pretty good detailed guidance in the three months jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay great the second question i had i m surprised for you guys talking about how interest rates are driving the buyers back to the toll communities because historically with the high amount of cash buyers will generate relative to some of your peers and then also with buyers i think typically putting down more for all houses than the competitors houses it would seem that buyer should your average buyer should be somewhat a need to what rates are doing i mean has there been a large change in the composition of your buyers over the last three to four years inaudible gone into these different product types or is there something else that you re hearing in the field besides rate and price that s making people don t want to buy a home right now douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer no jay my comment i was certainly not comparing our buyer to other buyers in the market you are correct our buyers are less sensitive to rate moves no nothing has changed with our buyer profile over the last few years the average ltv is at 68 for our buyers that get a mortgage and 21 of our buyers are all cash so you re right they are less affected by a move in rate but let s not forget the confidence side of it which is what s really going on let s not forget the headlines when the fed was talking about four rate moves in 19 and the other headlines they talked about the slowdown of the housing market right even though they can afford the house and they are not as sensitive to the rate they re are not immune to the headlines and the fear that they were the fools that bought at the top and so it s a confidence issue more than a specific rate move martin p connor chief financial officer the other thing that overlays that is the they have a bit more invested in the stock market and the fall wasn t the greatest time to have your money there so couple of different factors jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst yeah understood and that s what i was trying to get to is the confidence thing it sounds like it s that more than anything else one other quick one if i could active adult your age targeted communities how are those been trending and what are you all looking to do with that type of business in the 19 douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer they are trending positive we like the business a lot we are absolutely chasing the baby boomer as they downsize and we are expanding the business to many different markets it started in the mid atlantic northeast midwest and we ve now expanded it into the west we have a very large community opening next year in greater phoenix several thousand homes that will have a large component that is active adult that community is called sterling ridge sorry inaudible thank you kira who is sterling if anyone should know the name it s kira sterling martin p connor chief financial officer did we name that after her douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so you will continue to see toll brothers active adult expand jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks again operator our next question comes from megan mcgrath of buckingham research please go ahead megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst good morning thanks both of my questions have been answered just wanted to follow up on two quick things first on california since the life cycle of communities was such a big impact this quarter i want to make sure that we all understand for the remainder of the year is there any other compare upcoming any other sort of big chunk of community openings that make a difficult compare and what s your community opening cadence look like in california for the year douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer community count will be relatively flat so there is nothing unique coming up in the comparison we do have five new communities that we plan to open anticipate opening in northern cal during the balance of the year megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst okay great and then following up on the conversation around sort of the macro factors one thing that you haven t talked about and i d love your opinion on now that we re further along is the tax reform do you think that impacted anything in california and other high tax markets douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we don t hear about it from sales right common sense would suggest that it has to play a part in some buyers decisions particularly as they are now beginning to prepare tax returns and understand the impact but the frontline sales teams are not hearing about that impact so california has always been a very expensive place to live long before salt and thankfully with that sun shining and that beautiful environment and great jobs people that have the money are willing to live there even though it costs a lot those that are not there that s why we have boise and that s why we have reno and that s why we have las vegas and even we re hearing of some buyers that make their way to dallas austin and houston but our core business in the coastal areas where the very affluent live we are not hearing much about it also remember that at certain submarkets of california we have a significant proportion of foreign buyers and they are not paying us taxes and are not impacted by the tax reform martin p connor chief financial officer additionally small business owners saw some relief from tax reform but i guess a lot of this will play out as people file their taxes and see what their situation is over the course of the next month or two megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst great thanks very much douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from buck horne of raymond james please go ahead buck horne raymond james analyst thanks guys wanted to see if you ve given some consideration to your land spending plans for the year i know last year your total land budget was up pretty significantly if you re given your views on the market right now have you kind of tightened up your underwriting and how do you plan on budgeting land acquisition going forward douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer buck we don t budget we don t allocate capital to divisions we stay opportunistic when good deals come in in markets we like we go yes the underwriting has certainly tightened up through the fall in certain locations either because we have a lot of land or we re concerned about some market dynamics but it s really market by market deal by deal if you look at prior years as a guide we have recently spent just north of 1 billion a year on land and i d say at this point fairly early on into 19 we re i think that s a fair estimate buck horne raymond james analyst okay helpful and we haven t talked much about city living so i just wanted to circle back on the city living side and get your thoughts on how the market is reacting to market conditions in new york and i think how the recent building openings have progressed your thoughts on timing of any new buildings coming up douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so the decline in contracts this quarter to last year in city living was driven by 10 provost which is our highrise in jersey city and the sell out of the sutton which was is one of our buildings in manhattan the city living market continues pretty much the same as we ve described in other quarters which is that it s ok it s not strong it s ok we have thankfully bought land and positioned ourselves in locations that are about 2 000 per square foot selling price and that market is ok the margins are high they are still above company average the jersey side which is for us hoboken and jersey city has slowed down a bit which is what i mentioned with 10 provost in jersey city having more sales last year than it did this year with respect to future opportunities and new buildings we continue to look we see deals fairly regularly most land sellers are not realistic in today s value of their land based on today s market conditions but i m still hopeful based on the deal flow that we will pick off one or two here or there that makes sense but we re not going to chase a deal in new york building in inflation it s just not what we do and it s too risky of a business with the price of the land with building these big buildings all at once and so we re going to be very disciplined it has certainly our investment in new york and city living has shrunk significantly over the last few years since we haven t bought new land martin p connor chief financial officer it s the lowest it s been since 2012 buck horne raymond james analyst yeah martin p connor chief financial officer and it gets to your point earlier about how land sellers change their expectation and we see that in new york they have not yet despite a number of years of the market not being as strong as it had been buck horne raymond james analyst great that s very helpful thank you guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from carl reichardt of btig please go ahead carl reichardt btig analyst good morning guys i want to ask about the cancellation rate and it s always low for you and so we re not talking about a lot of units but the change was reasonably significant from last year doug would you attribute that to this idea of the fear factor that you talked about or is that a function of contingencies or inability of folks to sell houses or something else in terms of that increase douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer no carl the increase it s spread out we study we re given reports on the reason people cancel there s not a lot we can read into it it doesn t appear that it was driven by fear or the inability to sell a home or i m worried about job security security or i m worried about the market remember we our average deposit is 75 000 so we take in most locations a lot of money before we start your semi custom home because your home is unique and we deserve that deposit to proceed and build a house that you have specifically designed cancellation as a percentage of beginning backlog is at 2 4 which is pretty consistent with where it s been in the past martin p connor chief financial officer i think we have a bit of a math issue we had a little less sales in the quarter so cancellations as a percentage of sales are up and we have a bigger backlog from where those cancellations can come from so the best way to look at it in a market like this is as a percentage of beginning backlog and it hasn t moved that much carl reichardt btig analyst right fair enough marty thanks and then you talked about the sunny california but the weather out here has been pretty atrocious as in the pacific inaudible in february i mean i m assuming the larger houses are already at dry end but marty are you assuming any kind of a delay impact on closings from this important state for you in the second quarter just based on what we ve seen so far this month douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we are not martin p connor chief financial officer i don t think we are that would be up to the individual teams in terms of what they ve submitted to us in terms of what they expect to close carl reichardt btig analyst all right good deal thanks guys operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to doug yearley for any closing remarks douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you nicole thanks everybody for all of your support have a great week operator the conference has now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now

this article is more than 5 years old bloomberg news for the second straight day investor attention could zero in on capitol hill as fed chair jerome powell takes the mic to address elected officials on the economy he delivered a pretty dovish message yesterday but markets didn t appear to move too much in response other than the powell testimony more below there doesn t appear to be a major theme wednesday as things get started in geopolitics president trump meets with north korea s president today but that arguably hasn t been a market mover lately there s also some tension developing between pakistan and india which could inject a bit of anxiety into things stocks fell yesterday and began the new day with a weaker tone amid mixed action overseas on the earnings front there was some reassuring news from best buy this morning the electronics retailer s shares were up 10 in pre market trade after it blew past third party estimates raised its dividend and announced a share buyback program adjusted earnings were 2 72 per share well ahead of the street s expectations according to factset estimates revenue of 14 8 billion was down from a year prior but slightly beat estimates a traditional retailer that still relies on foot traffic best buy has been struggling the past year with shares down about 17 before the earnings release lowe s shares were also on the rise in pre market trading despite just missing wall street analysts sales estimate the company did beat analyst consensus on earnings per share however and stuck to its 2019 outlook with housing market data generally weak lately shares of home improvement companies like lowe s and home depot might serve as a barometer for investors weak housing market data continued this week as the pace of home price growth hit a four year low on an annual basis according to the case shiller index reading for the last quarter of 2018 in less impressive earnings news weight watchers shares once soaring with the backing of celebrity spokespeople plunged 35 on the heels of its earnings report the weight loss company was undergoing a revival of sorts but said it had a soft start to 2019 and offered weak guidance still revenue was up 6 to 330 million from a year prior losing steam major u s indices slipped tuesday with a late rally attempt failing to hold and the s p 500 index again finishing below 2800 some media reports cited weak home depot earnings as the primary instigator but arguably the real problem was a lack of new positive catalysts especially on the china trade front actually there was arguably some good news from overseas tuesday but it didn t seem to get much attention in the markets chances of an abrupt and chaotic brexit receded a bit when prime minister theresa may agreed that parliament should have the option to seek a delay in britain s exit plans according to a new york times report this doesn t necessarily mean things will go more smoothly but it could conceivably push brexit beyond what s now the march 29 deadline giving the markets a little more breathing room the british pound rose on the news while the dollar index continued to retreat from recent highs and is now back to testing the 96 level faangs up again but is anyone paying attention for the third straight day on tuesday faangs looked shiny as four of the five gained ground though gains were mostly light the five stocks all spent much of the day in the green building on progress made friday and monday all five had risen friday and four rose monday a few months ago before the q4 washout this strength in the faangs might have been the leading story of the day however with faangs mostly trailing the s p 500 year to date they ve lost their starring role to some extent the narrative has changed over the past few months instead a lot of focus has shifted toward the rally in industrials which fell tuesday but are up 18 since dec 31 what s interesting about this market is the ability of a new group to take leadership it seems like every time the naysayers start questioning whether the rally can continue a sector you didn t count on has stepped in to save the day now there s no guarantee that will keep happening but the way industrials replaced faangs does arguably speak to the market s resilience two of the best performing sectors tuesday were info tech and communication services both of which contain faang stocks the communication services sector could be an interesting area for the rest of 2019 and 2020 given all the competition in the streaming space and the entry of companies like netflix into a major film distribution role it shouldn t go unnoticed that roma a film that received 10 academy award nominations was distributed by netflix technical hurdle from a technical perspective tuesday looked like another disappointing day for the bulls after bounding through a number of technical resistance points so far this year the s p 500 index seems to be having trouble with the psychological 2800 mark tuesday was the second straight day where the s p 500 traded above that level but then closed below it which technicians might see as a possible sign of weakness and maybe of a rally that s breathing some thin air another level to consider watching is the region around 2814 which the s p 500 neared this week and which is near an intraday high it posted in early november while not every investor watches technical levels it doesn t take too much understanding of support and resistance to see what it might mean if an index keeps bouncing off of one but fails to pierce it yes individual equities are important to watch but sometimes it s equally important to glance up at the overall macro picture because it can influence those individual stocks as well data wise tuesday was another day the housing market might rather forget december housing starts fell more than 11 month over month and were well below analysts consensus projections homebuilding company stocks which have generally been moving higher this year took a step back tuesday however some analysts pointed out that winter can be a slow and choppy time for the industry so perhaps it s worth waiting for spring to get a better picture consumers powell both sound confident looking for a more positive data story it came right after housing starts when consumer confidence for february surprised to the upside this might have partially reflected consumers relief at the end of the government shutdown and strength in the labor market briefing com said it also might give some investors reason to hope for yet another bullish payrolls report at the end of next week it s not universal but people who have jobs often tend to have more confidence about spending fed chairman jerome powell s testimony to congress is scheduled to continue today after powell didn t really make any big waves at the capitol on tuesday see more below in a nutshell powell basically said he continues to see strength in the labor market and didn t sound all that worried about inflation he is concerned about u s debt levels but investors knew that based on his past remarks the market chopped around during powell s testimony but didn t experience any steep drops the yield on the 10 year u s treasury note slipped back under 2 64 near the bottom of its recent range meanwhile the cboe volatility index continued to climb from recent four month lows tuesday rising back above 15 after falling below 14 last week this combined with the stock market s struggles to climb above resistance and continued strength in treasuries might spell possible caution gathering after weeks of nearly constant rallies across the major stock indices data source ice s p dow jones indices chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade someone once called the presidency the bully pulpit meaning it gives one person s voice a lot of influence the reasoning behind that grew pretty evident this week for investors as two tweets by president trump arguably had a big impact on the stock and commodities markets the first was his weekend tweet about delaying a tariff raise on chinese products thanks to trade negotiations going well the shanghai composite rose more than 5 in one day after that announcement the presidential effect occurred for a second time on monday morning when trump tweeted that oil prices were getting too high and warned opec to consider its policy crude subsequently fell 3 and didn t gain back much of that tuesday while this isn t a political column the tweets might be a reminder that more than ever thanks partly to social media it s important to keep one ear turned toward washington to see if anything potentially market moving might be going viral soft touch just over a year ago u s stocks got crushed after a monthly payrolls report showed year over year wage growth near 3 unleashing investor fears of inflation what a difference a year makes as fed chair jerome powell told senators yesterday he s not too concerned about any inflationary impact as wages continue to rise 3 month after month in his question and answer session powell painted the wage growth as a good thing especially with wages growing faster than inflation the fed he said plans to remain patient about policy changes and still expects inflation to be near its 2 goal listening to powell it seems that maybe the fed has realized it can take a different approach after watching inflation stay pretty stable near or even below 2 over the last year despite rising wages or maybe the fed s four rate hikes last year did what it took to keep a lid on price growth even as the economy added jobs at a furious rate and the labor force started to expand a little there s a phrase some economists might use to describe an improving jobs picture accompanied by manageable inflation soft landing one wild card however is that energy prices retreated dramatically late last year removing a huge potential source of inflation pressure crude is up more than 20 from its december lows so the fed is likely to keep an eye on that for signs of a broader price impact mind the gap last year we also heard a lot of concern from economists about the narrowing yield curve which measures the gap between shorter and longer term u s treasury note yields the gap between 10 year and 2 year yields often gets the most attention and it narrowed to single digits as the economy and stock market weakened in q4 some economists worry that a narrowing gap can point toward possible recession and the faltering curve can also weigh on financial sector profits so far this year however the yield curve has retreated from investor consciousness at least a bit and that s in part because it s been so stable as of midday tuesday the gap stood at around 16 basis points not far off of where its been for some time while that s historically low it s up from the narrowest times last year still some economists would probably like to see it get wider so that the risk of inversion which often accompanies recessions lessens the fed s pause on rate hikes might be helping keep shorter term yields from gaining on longer term ones over the last month the 2 year yield is down 12 basis points while the 10 year has fallen 11 basis points td ameritrade commentary for educational purposes only member

call over to jeff jackson pgt innovation s ceo and president jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thanks brad and good morning everyone fiscal year 2018 was a transformative year for pgt innovations and i m very pleased with our results on slide 4 we have included some background information on our company for those of you who may be new to the story and i will highlight some key facts our full year sales of 698 million represent a 37 increase over 2017 with 27 of our year over year growth achieved organically with the acquisition of western window systems last year we became a national leader in the premium window and door space the acquisition expanded our geographic footprint and rebalanced our portfolio to nearly 50 50 split between repair and remodeling and new construction in markets additionally western has a strong non impact brand that come in at higher margins as with our legacy impact products to finance the acquisition we entered the bond market for the first time and as a result over 80 of our current leverage is at an attractive fixed rate of 6 75 following the acquisition we ve completed a successful equity offering with net proceeds used to pay down our debt floating rate debt quickly deleveraging our balance sheet i m proud to report pgt innovations net leverage in the 2018 was 2 1 times we believe this balance sheet provides significant strength and flexibility for future operational and strategic initiatives turning to slide 5 it s important to take a few minutes to review our strategy for creating long term value for our customers and shareholders at pgt innovations we attribute our success to the continued execution of our four strategic pillars our first pillar is putting the customer at the center of our business striving to deliver 360 degree service before during and after the sale second we worked hard to attract top talent and we offer benefits and support to help our team member succeed we believe that a talented dedicated team of employees is key to success and we continually look for ways to make our company an attractive place to have a career in 2018 i am especially proud we made every employee a shareholder giving them a chance to participate in our future success we continue this benefit from another grant through all our team members at the beginning of 2019 third we are committed to investing in our business when it is prudent to do so and scaling operations to meet increasing demands our organic growth of 27 in 2018 with solid margin improvement pretty much with significant accomplishments that would not have been possible without well time strategic investments in our business to increase production capacity and improve efficiencies looking forward we expect to continue to invest in operational projects designed to improve efficiency and capacity and fourth we strategically allocate capital generated from our strong free cash flow to reduce our debt and support our growth going forward we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and build cash to allow flexibility for futuristic and opportunistic acquisitions and other investments in our business we anticipate that our strategic path forward will involve creating a national market leading building products company with a team focused on niche products and brands which will continue to yield strong margins and significant cash flow now i d like to discuss our results in more detail beginning on slide 6 i m excited to report another quarter of strong financial results reflecting continued growth in demand for our impact resistant products in our legacy markets and growth in demand for our western window systems energy efficient products which are designed to unify indoor outdoor living space for the quarter we delivered sales of 190 million including a sales contribution of 31 million from western window systems acquisition and organic growth of 24 7 million or 18 our legacy repair and remodeling and new construction markets grew by approximately 18 and 19 respectively versus the prior year quarter adjusted gross margin grew by 2 3 in the fourth quarter versus prior year due largely driven by the accretion from the western window systems acquisition our legacy markets we were successful in implementing price increases and driving operational efficiencies to offset labor material and other cost inflations in our business adjusted ebitda of 31 5 million in the fourth quarter represents growth of 34 versus the same quarter last year on slide 7 for our full year i ll reiterate the 2018 sales increased by 37 to 698 million which includes the sales contribution of 49 7 million from western window systems versus the prior year sales in our legacy repair and remodeling and new construction markets grew by approximately 34 and 17 respectively adjusted gross margin for 2018 grew by 1 3 versus 2017 driven primarily by our successful efforts in implementing price increases and driving operational efficiencies including a significant reduction in our scrap gross margins were also positively impacted by the accretion from our western window systems acquisition adjusted ebitda for the year of 127 million an increase of 48 versus prior year next turning to slide 8 i would like to provide a further update on western window systems after closing on the acquisition in august of last year integration is on schedule and well under way we expect first year annualized cost synergies of approximately 8 million primarily coming from supply chain efficiencies where we can offer greater economies of scale we also anticipate many cross selling opportunities and strengthen brand recognition as we utilize brands across the pgt innovations portfolio the western window systems acquisition meaningfully expanded our geographic coverage and enhanced our premium product offering in the growing indoor outdoor living market and created synergy opportunities moving forward moving to slide 9 i would like to remind you we are currently four years into our strategy to become a national leader of premium windows and doors the phase one was to further solidify our position in our core market of florida by increasing our product offerings to meet the needs of our customers in our market next we acquired cgi and windor the second and third strongest brands in the impact product space in 2014 and 16 respectively we were able to complete these acquisitions and subsequent integrations while maintaining industry leading margin profiles the next phase of our strategy is and continues to be expansion into new geographies and other niche window and door products we took our first step by the addition of western window systems in this product lines which satisfy some of the most stringent energy codes and regulations in north america and serve a growing contemporary indoor outdoor living segment across the country we believe the western window systems will continue to achieve sales growth above the overall market by adding builders who desire the products western owns and that will continue to achieve industry leading margins by focusing on high end niche energy efficient windows and doors while driving continuous operational improvements turning to slide 10 while certain regions of the national housing market has shown signs of slowing we expect florida to maintain its position as the fastest growing state in the nation with a population of more than 21 million we continue to believe there is significant new construction growth potential remaining in florida we are estimating the 2019 housing starts to be approximately 105 000 well below the normalized single family starts of approximately 125 000 per year on slide 11 prior to 2018 it was estimated that of the homes in florida only 18 have impact resistant windows 13 have impact resistant doors and 18 storm shutters that indicate that at least 50 of floridians have no protection on their openings of their homes to safeguard their property against severe storms prior to 2018 this 34 growth we experienced in the repair and remodeling market in 2018 is evidence that many floridians decided to add impact resistant windows and doors and new shutters and plywood hurricane michael and irma demonstrated that every home in florida not just total homes can be impacted by severe weather as a result homeowners throughout the entire state have become searching for hurricane protection for their homes which is why we believe our advertising and marketing investments continue to benefit our growth with western window systems we have expanded into the indoor outdoor living market which represents a total opportunity of approximately 8 million to 9 million the largest segment is in new construction of high end homes that feature more back line doors in the back of the houses from 2012 to 2017 the indoor outdoor living market saw an average annual growth rate of 11 for new contemporary homes this market represents approximately 2 billion opportunity and is growing at a faster pace averaging 24 per year from 2012 to 2017 now i d like to turn the call over to brad to discuss the financial results in more detail brad brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you jeff first i would like to review some of our significant achievements in 2018 and then discuss fourth quarter results in more detail in august 2018 we acquired western window systems for 355 million in order to finance the transaction we entered the bond markets for the first time raising 350 million at attractive rate of 6 75 at the consummation of the acquisition our gross leverage ratio was approximately 4 times trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda inclusive of 8 million in annual cost synergies and within our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times in september 2018 we completed a stock offering which generated proceeds allowing us to pay down 152 million of our current loan credit facility to further strengthen our balance sheet in the fourth quarter we also paid an additional 8 million of our current loan credit facility as jeff mentioned at the end of fourth quarter our net leverage ratio has improved to 2 1 times and over 80 of our remaining leverage is at fixed rate of 6 75 in an environment of rising interest rates another positive result of our 152 million debt pay down was that we received ratings upgrade from moody s to b1 additionally we have a b plus rating from standard poor s with a positive outlook we believe our access to long term borrowings at an attractive rate together with the completion of an acquisition that provides us with geographical and product line diversity and other benefits has put pgt innovations in a strong financial and operational position well poised for continued growth now moving on to slide 12 for a summary of our results for the quarter we reported net sales of 189 9 million including our organic growth of 24 7 million or 18 driven by a growth in our legacy repair and remodel and new construction markets of 18 and 19 respectively versus prior year fourth quarter sales also included a sales contribution of inaudible from western window systems our gross profit exclusive of adjusted items was 66 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 up 22 6 million versus the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted gross margin increased to 34 8 or 2 3 increase from prior year driven mainly by gross margin accretion from western window systems in our fourth quarter in our legacy business we were able to offset higher cost with increases in our prices higher volumes and improved operating effectiveness and efficiency you get an update on our aluminum covered program the increase in aluminum prices had a negative impact of 1 5 percentage points on the gross margins in the fourth quarter as of today we have contracted approximately 75 of our estimated aluminum needs for 2019 our current coverage for aluminum portion only in is at 0 96 per pound this does not include the delivery cost which today is approximately 0 19 per pound we will continue to monitor tariff and trade environment effects on aluminum pricing and as appropriate make adjustments for our covered program and pricing strategy selling general and administrative expenses were 45 6 million in the fourth quarter 2018 an increase of 19 2 million from 26 4 million in the fourth quarter 17 adjusted selling general and administrative expenses was 44 1 million in the fourth quarter or 23 of net sales compared to 25 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 or 19 1 of sales an increase of 4 1 western window systems contributed 12 6 million including 2 4 million of non cash amortization and sg a in the fourth quarter of 2018 our legacy business sg a grew from 19 1 of sales in the fourth quarter of 17 to 19 8 of sales in the fourth quarter of 18 including 1 7 million of higher incentive compensation due to our improved performance year over year adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 31 5 million or a margin of 16 6 compared with adjusted ebitda of fourth quarter 17 of 23 5 million or 17 5 as additional information the new accounting standard for revenue recognition impacted our fourth quarter 2018 results negatively by reducing sales and adjusted ebitda by 7 5 million and 2 5 million respectively which reduced our adjusted ebitda margin by 70 basis points interest expense for the fourth quarter was 7 1 million an increase of 1 8 million versus last year the increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher debt balance for the quarter the current quarter interest expense includes approximately 300 000 of non cash charges related to the 8 million prepayment that we made during the quarter depreciation and amortization expense was 8 6 million in the fourth quarter 2018 an increase of 3 4 million versus the prior year period driven mainly by the acquisition of western window systems taxes for the fourth quarter were 2 5 million at an effective tax rate of 19 4 additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had a tax credit of 12 4 million reflecting the positive impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was favorably impacted of 6 500 for excess tax benefits of stock option exercises we reported gaap net income of 10 9 million or 0 18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter versus 20 3 million or 0 39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding one time items adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 21 versus 0 18 in the same quarter last year representing a 17 increase moving on to slide 13 i would like to review our current expectations regarding our capital allocation priorities our first priority is internal investment and strategic growth projects that we believe are important to pgt innovations ability to drive future shareholder value and we expect to continue to support our product portfolio by making investments in advertising and marketing which have proven beneficial to our growth our second priority is at reductions in making an solid balance sheet i ve already gone over how we completed a major transaction and we are able to subsequently paid down debt to finish the year with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 2 1 times we maintain as a goal achieving a conservative leverage profile within the range of 2 times to 4 times our third priority for capital allocation is not just looking for strategic acquisitions we expect to continue to look for attractive opportunities to expand into new geographies and or other niche window and door products looking ahead to 2019 on slide 14 i ll give some of our expectations regarding combined company assumptions going forward we expect interest expense the approximately 7 million per quarter we expect the tax rate around 26 we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately 9 million per quarter and we expect annual non cash stock compensation to be approximately 4 2 million due to our employee stock base ph lastly we expect capital expenditures to be to average between 3 and 4 of annual sales and finally i would like to review 2019 guidance provided this morning pgt innovations expects to finish in the following ranges for 2019 fiscal year net sales of 775 million to 800 million an increase of 11 to 15 compared to 2018 adjusted ebitda of 143 million to 152 million an increase of 13 to 20 compared to 2018 and net income per diluted share of 0 93 to 1 05 in first quarter we are currently tracking to 174 million to 179 million in sales which will be growth of approximately 3 to 5 on a pro forma basis this is higher than our full year guidance of 3 at the top end of our annual range ebitda for q1 is expected to finish at approximately 16 inaudible with that i d like to turn the call back over to jeff for some closing thoughts jeff jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thank you brad now i d like to take a few minutes just to elaborate on the macro economic assumptions behind our guidance for 2019 consistent with many industry forecasters we are expecting a low single digit growth rate in national housing starts mainly due to labor constraints affordability concerns and interest rate increases we experienced in 2018 relating to a couple of our core markets we are expecting new home starts in florida to grow approximately 9 to 10 in 2019 while we expect new home starts in california to remain relatively flat versus in 2019 we believe pgt innovations is strategically insulated in most building product companies from national housing starts due to our geographic concentration in destination states and our focus on selling into indoor outdoor living market which has historically grown at rates higher than the national housing starts regarding the growth prospects for the indoor outdoor living market please note that western window systems has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22 since 2015 far exceeding the growth than housing start during that period we believe this level of growth demonstrates the strength of demand for building products that unify indoor outdoor living spaces and we anticipate opportunity to continue to gain market share and penetrate into this growing market our 2019 guidance assumes an overall high single digit growth rate for new construction sales related to the repair and remodeling market we just concluded the strongest year in company history with 34 repair and remodeling growth fueled by hurricane awareness from irma the first hurricane hit florida since 2005 while we believe repair and remodeling markets are still strong quarter our expectations will be for the repair and remodeling market to be flat as 2018 with another storm driving further awareness regardless at the end of 2019 our two year compound annual growth rate will still be quite healthy florida remains in great state to operate in and we will continue to drive sales of our impact resistant products with our leading market position of highly innovative product offerings and increase adversiting from a margin perspective our 2019 guidance assumes the following cost inflation from materials mainly due to tariffs continued wage inflation associated with attracting and retaining qualified workers the negative impact of mix that will result from new construction sales outpacing the repair and remodeling growth somewhat offset by the impact of a price increase announced in the back half of 2018 we will strive to continue to drive operational efficiencies as we demonstrated during 2018 and supply chain initiatives also to offset these cost of inflation initiatives finally our guidance for 2019 assumes that there are no major hurricanes in florida that would disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver our products or disrupt the ability of our dealers to take orders during 2019 in closing i d like to remind you of the five elements of our investment thesis first on slide 15 first we are national leader in the growing category of premium window and doors second we are committed to continuing our investments in talent and r d to remain the industry leader with innovative products third we have an ongoing focus on operational efficiency expected to drive additional margin expansion four we are focused on striving to achieve strong execution of our strategy to create long term customer and long term shareholder value and fifth we are well positioned with a diversified product portfolio and a diversified geographic markets to capture profitable growth in new construction and repair and remodeling trends 2018 was a milestone year for pgt innovations and our team it is an exciting time to be a part of our family of brands at this time i d like to turn the call over to the operator to begin our q a operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions we ll take our first question from truman patterson with wells fargo truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking my questions the first one first thing that i d like to dig into is your revenue growth guidance for 2019 you guys set up 11 to 15 if i throw in an extra seven to eight months of western windows in there it seems like your guidance implies flat to maybe 1 growth in the legacy pgti and even western windows growth in there could you walk us through the moving parts you guys said california market should be flat while florida new resi ph should be up high single digits i think this implies that actually florida r r should be negative then could you just walk us through how to think about this jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes i ll touch on that and i ll let brad dig in some details as well as brad told mentioned in his comments our q1 guidance right now florida overall company we are tracking anywhere from 3 to 5 growth in our first quarter that s before our heavy r r quarters and the second and third quarter are very heavy r r periods for pgt legacy brands and we are comping an incredible year 34 growth rate in r r largest percentage in our company s history largest base in our company s history so right now we have that kind of headwinds that to go through and we re trying to lay out what we consider a conservative guidance as we face that comp that will impact us on that process second is moving to california market which you mentioned in your comments that the california market being flat what we have to do and it will be new for us this year consistent with western previous but we have to execute in that flat market and gain share we think we want to we got initiatives to drive penetration in a flat market we think we can still grow but our assumption in our guidance is that s flat and that s going to be a tough hurdle to overcome so those are the two driving initiatives that have our guidance to where it is and we have initiatives in place to address at all it s just too early in the process for us to be aggressive and thinking we going to succeed brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer and let me add to that as going to last year in q4 of 17 you started to see in the demand for r r pickup and that carried all the way through 2018 as we mentioned but at the beginning of the year we kind of anticipated some of that a price increase that we announced at the beginning of last year and also the middle of the summer season we announced a price increase specifically dealing with aluminum heritage rate that was going on we had two price increases last year as well that also probably drove some of the summer season tough comps that we are dealing with as we go into 2019 truman patterson wells fargo analyst i m having a little bit of a hard time hearing you guys but is it safe to assume that what s implied in your guidance is probably negative r r growth yet that might not be exactly what s in your real expectations is that safe to assume brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes again we re comping at 34 incredible growth year and so yes we are saying after an another major storm or something happening we could be negative to slightly negative in our r r growth offset by obviously new construction still growing that s taking share there and then offset somewhat again by tough comp in california with housing starts everyone saying they re going to be roughly flat and trying to gain penetration there truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay okay thanks thanks for that guys another question on guidance when we look at your 2019 ebitda margin the midpoint i think is only up about 50 bps year over year at 18 7 or so it seems like the accretion from western alone just from another seven to eight months should add that to your 2019 margins alone this is excluding any of the 8 million in synergies that you guys are suggesting you re going to achieve so essentially we ve got flat legacy pgti and flat western windows margins year over year i guess what s driving that or are there any mix issues are we actually going to see negative gross margins or just flat gross margins flat sg a i m trying to understand what s going on with your legacy your legacy pieces of the business brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so truman the initial estimates that we talked about for western are still in place the basic issue that we re dealing with is absolutely mix so last year during the first second and third quarter where r r growth substantially outpaced new construction we called out about 100 bps on average of mix improvement that we saw from the r r growth what we re thinking this year with our guidance is the kind of the reversely new construction growth faster than r r so there are some implied mixed negative impact in our guidance of about 100 bps and that is kind of basically how you get to the expectation we had of 150 bps from western to 50 bps now is that a 100 bps reduction on the mix side and that s basically the legacy at r r and new construction mix that we re talking off truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay so there s no negative margin in western windows at all implied in that guidance or accretion jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president no absolutely not truman patterson wells fargo analyst flat as well jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes the cost synergies in western margin profile continues to grow as expected truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thanks guys jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll turn next to michael rehaut with jpmorgan maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst hi this is actually maggie on for mike first i was just wondering if you could kind of quantify some of those gross margin drivers a little bit more for 2019 and could you talk about what you re expecting to see in terms of like inflation raw materials as well as price brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so we talked about on the last call the impact of tariffs being about 40 bps and that is still kind of implied in the guidance we do not have any at this point in time any assumed price increases that will go into place in 2019 we do get the impact of the price increase that was made in the summer of 2018 the first six months of that i do think in the first quarter we ll still have some aluminum headwinds last year the midwest premium jumped up at the end of the first quarter so we saw that in second third and fourth quarter in the first quarter we will probably get 50 bps of aluminum headwinds that just overcome and then it should be flat for the rest of the year but i think the most important issue is the mix issue i just described to truman at at 100 bps that s really the most important factor on gross margin for this year maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay great thank you and then secondly i was wondering if you could talk about how you re thinking about your m a pipeline are you actively looking into potential acquisitions or are you more fully focused on integrating and leveraging internal systems and growing western window jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes this is jeff as i look at that i ll be honest with you the team is keenly focused on the integration efforts which are going incredibly well we will probably i get different companies sent to me just like everyone else but right now honestly we are at 2 1 times leverage i always like to go below 2 so we got another couple of quarters for that to happen and then again integration once western s as western continues to perform like and then pgt we will look to future acquisition is more toward the end of this year or beginning of 2020 versus currently maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay great thank you operator we ll turn next to jeremy hamblin with dougherty company jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst thanks and congrats on a strong 2018 guys i wanted to hop into the eps guidance for the year and just brad if you might just help us to understand the puts and takes here on share count taxes it sound i think i caught 26 tax rate but could you just walk us through a little bit more of the puts and takes on your eps guidance brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sure jeremy so we finished the year at 1 18 reported in 2018 adjusted eps that does have a couple of things that i d like to normalize whether those go into 2019 first is the share count obviously versus last year our share count is up a good bit and our weighted average is up about 5 5 million of shares based upon the equity offering if you look at that that s about 0 10 so that 1 18 was then therefore be a 1 08 and then if you look at our tax rate as we mentioned we had 0 09 of excess tax benefits we have quite a bit of option exercises last year in 2018 our guidance does not assume any of that will happen in 2019 though likely they likely will as you really can t put that your guidance that was 0 09 so that was got the 0 99 in 2018 kind of apples to apples basis so the top end of our guidance of 1 05 will be eps growth of about 5 to 6 off of that jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay great that s helpful i wanted to come back to q4 for second and just see i think it contributed western windows contributed 31 million to sales what was the contribution to ebitda from western windows in q4 brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes that s not that is not a number that we normally would put jeremy i will say one thing about western as we go into q4 of 2018 and into 2019 they do operate in both custom and production builder volume market channels that we talked about a good a bit during in site tour that i know you are at in phoenix and one of the things that the mix that 100 bps that we are kind of talking about there is a little bit of in western when they sell into the production builder business they sell mostly doors and the company business will tend to have a little bit higher percentage of windows so one of the things that we see with western is from a mix perspective is as they sell less production builder will sell less doors which will have less effect ph it s a small impact on the total of the company since western is a smaller portion of the business but they did in q4 has a little bit higher percentage of window sales than they had the rest of the year and that is a part of that but we re not going to give specific in to that guidance jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay understood and then just elaborating on the ebitda margin the swing from or i should actually even focus just on the gross margins here in q4 that kind of roughly 200 basis point decline from q3 to q4 despite kind of a full quarter of benefit from western windows was there slightly negative mix shift as well but just a little bit more color on that sequential change in gross margins i know some of it s just from lower sales probably end of year reduction in factory times brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes from a sequential standpoint it is basically mostly just a change in sales from q3 to q4 we did have a little bit of a mix issue because we were had been 34 plus in r r all year long and new construction was something less than that but then in q4 they leveled out we talked about 19 and 18 i do want to go back i m not going to spend a lot of time because it s kind of accounting technical but when i mentioned that accounting 606 implications that actually that 70 bps for the most part all our gross margin and that s what that comes down to just to get as real quickly is just the level of finished goods you have on hand and typically going into the end of the year we will reduce our inventories as we head for the shutdown so from while we actually invoice and sold our performance would have been higher and our results and our margins would have been higher based on this new accounting treatment would you take in 2019 that kind for the most part will level so far because our inventory levels were higher at the end of 18 because of hurricane irma and that s what kind of drove it but that s really what kind of drove the earnings the gross margin issue looking at 2019 we still expect the improvements that we talked about from western and the only real headwind that we re facing on that besides aluminum in the first quarter i mentioned was the mix issue that we re probably going to fight with all year jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay thanks last one here just the implied range in your guidance for sg a for the year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer well inaudible it s probably going to be a number of this will be a full year of western which has the higher sg a cost coming from improved higher non cash amortization but it s probably in the neighborhood of 21 to 22 in that range and so on jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay and the amortization that you factoring in there is rough brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer well 9 million a quarter is combined company depreciation and amortization and i think i mentioned in the last call that amortization from western will be 9 million a year in sg a so that s unchanged jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst okay and so the amortization i get it s kind of in the 15 million 16 million range for the year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer for the total company yes i think that s correct jeremy hamblin dougherty company analyst all right thanks guys good luck this year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeremy jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thanks jeremy operator we ll turn now to phil ng with jefferies jefferies analyst good morning guys it s inaudible for phil jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president good morning jefferies analyst i just want to hi i wanted to dive into the projected organic growth you know it implies a pretty short deceleration i know in the past you ve talked about increasing consumer awareness driving demand in 2018 so i guess given the lack of major storms in florida this year are you starting to see that tail end taper off jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes i don t think it is not this tapering off i would say it s more yes if you look at the r r growth market in florida this past year 2018 i think it grew way more than even our dealer base anticipated would so there are inherent constraints in that growth in that market inaudible continue to grow namely in labor and so that s acting kind of as a governor and again in our thought process of how much more in r r grow in any given quarter but with that said we do think we re going to continue to advertise and then continue to push our brand and there is more market share we can take within r r market is flat but that s executing against a competitor versus just growing in a market is growing 34 so it s a little bit different strategy little bit different taxes involved but we re definitely executing on the strategy to take share even as our market does end up being flat year over year jefferies analyst okay got it and then on a larger theme we ve been seeing is kind of the shift to more affordable homes so curious to hear if you ve seen or expect to see any trade down effect from that shift to affordability jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president no not really that s really not the market we serve that s the commodity window and door market with that said our products especially the indoor outdoor living products can go into a lower priced homes because the cost of having a wall full of windows versus a wall a couple of doors and sheet rock and forming electrical et cetera is about the same and so the up selling options for that builder is much more obviously so it can go into that and also to address that kind of lower impact market we didn t watch sparta last year if you will recall and so that s been a definitely a good win for us in locking up some builder business that typically would have been went to other competitors jefferies analyst got it and if i could squeeze in one more you mentioned internal investments as your top capital allocation priority can you just talk us through some of those and whether it s improving efficiency or expanding capacity how we should think about those benefits starting to flow through to results thanks jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes i mean from my seat we re constantly looking at innovation and products product offerings we have an innovation lab we have products in there that we re testing in the market to see if there viable so technology surrounding how we actually produced one of the driving factors of our improved gross margin and ebitda margin over the last few years is the technological advances we put our plant here behind me as well as what western window systems had bought previously to our acquisition so technology advances we wouldn t be on that cutting edge to drive our labor cost and obviously would benefit with improved margins so we mentioned investing in our technology is surrounded with the thought process of sustained industry leader in our categories with innovative products and then automation that s kind of the next phase of manufacturing in terms of driving out labor costs brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer and if i add to that jeff we had a point last year where we increased within our venice operations basically our ability to deliver almost 1 5 million to 2 million more a week in a very short amount of time to handle the 34 r r growth with some of that growth was fueled by the marketing and advertising decisions that we made both following the storm in fourth quarter 2017 as well as thoughtful additions to our portfolio from a margin perspective in the first half of 2018 as we head into the season so i thought our internal investments that we made or passed over the year specifically the back half of 2017 and the first half 18 were huge driving factor toward what we called off in 2018 jefferies analyst all right great thanks guys good luck this year jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll now turn to alvaro lacayo with g research alvaro lacayo g research analyst good morning guys just have a question a regarding western windows and california and the assumption for flat housing starts in california the dynamics in california a little bit different from florida from an affordability standpoint which seems to be a little bit more stretched and there seems to be a little bit more volatility recently in demand from housing starts there so maybe if you can give some color on how you arrive to flat housing starts in california and then bigger picture when you think about the growth algorithm for western window how do you think about the piece of increased penetration market share and if pricing plays a role at all and when you put on all that together what are the expectations for 2019 what kind of growth are you expecting to see out at western windows jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president as relates to the actual guidance for housing starts in florida i mean that s basically just based on the movies or any kind of those housing starts that we see in the trends obviously we are back to kind of single digit nationally but florida and california are very different in that and as we mentioned about 9 in our florida western operates both in southern california and in northern california and just probably some different housing start factors within those if you split the state in half like that but i think flattish kind of where we landed on for our guidance and as western has always trying to accomplish and has accomplished they gained share and they beat that number and that s what we expect going forward from western brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll just comment briefly on western as well i mean the goal is very simple is to grow western brands in a flat market initiatives involving that are a little bit more complicated we are actively establishing an r r market so we re going through california today establishing dealers that deal more in that r r space to get that western brands in that market as well as expanding our relationships with the current home builders there to further penetrate and get into the model homes so that product can be shown as an option versus other choices so those are the two kind of initiatives that we re tackling what we consider a potential flat market in california and we will grow and it s just a matter of the success of those initiatives i don t think we have ever commented on certain brand growth before really want to get into that at this point in terms of pricing the kind of the third part of your question pricing western currently in their setting incredibly nice in their pricing in terms of compared to competitors they are not the highest they re typically more toward the lowest even though obviously those higher will come down account in pricing to try to get a job but for the most part western windows systems and our products there are priced in the lower side versus the competitors and what key is the delivery lead times are better so again that plays into that capturing share in the flat market we can deliver a lower priced product in a quicker manner but the quality is as good or better so that kind of combination i think we also comfortable we re going to succeed but again 2019 is going to be a challenging year that s been the consistent theme we heard from a building community and we got to playing that or executing that alvaro lacayo g research analyst thanks and then just with regards to the pricing carryover from last year could you just give us a reminder on what s the magnitude of that pricing and what to expect in the first six months of 19 from the carryover brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes we basically announced and this was a pgt legacy price increase we basically now excised the 7 price increase in the summer as far as specific and it was kind of geared toward aluminum costs offset though some labor costs as well aluminum labor costs that basically started hitting toward the end of q3 and in q4 so we ll have about two quarters of that i did mention that just kind of implied in our guidance as well though because the price of labor continues to go up as we attract the best talent and i did say that we probably have about a 50 bps to 60 bps aluminum pressure in q1 that s coming from last year alvaro lacayo g research analyst thank you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator we ll turn next to sam darkatsh with raymond james sam darkatsh raymond james analyst good morning jeff brad how are you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer hi sam good how are you sam darkatsh raymond james analyst i m well and i just wanted to also send my thoughts out to anybody that was affected by the shooting earlier this week our thoughts and prayers go into your employee base and hopefully all as well i just have a like three or four housekeeping questions and i apologize for the elementary nature of these so brad i didn t catch us if you mentioned it what were impact sales in the fourth quarter year on year in the legacy business percentage wise brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes just a second sam we were basically well let me do this way we were legacy wise we were 86 in q4 and when you look at the depth of total share in the total impact sales were 136 million basically for the consolidated business 72 of impact of sales were impact sam darkatsh raymond james analyst i m not sure i m following so i m looking for the year on year growth rate of impact in the fourth quarter brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer i thought you are talking about dollar amount so okay no it was up 20 year over year sam darkatsh raymond james analyst that s it there you go and then backlog at the end of the year brad do you have that handy brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer i do just one second please so we finished the year with backlog of 64 million which includes 11 million from western sam darkatsh raymond james analyst and that would be related to the 50 million 5 0 from last year on an organic basis right brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sam darkatsh raymond james analyst all right so it s up markedly that s good okay and then two other questions and if you talked about this you talked around it on the call but i want to make sure i m aware so in the fourth quarter you obviously had a terrific sales print and it looked like the gross margins at least might have fallen below expectations at least either externally or internally you mentioned aluminum you mentioned mix of r r versus builder but where was the primary negative variance versus your internal plan in gross margin in the fourth quarter brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sam actually it all came down to the accounting entry related to the new accounting standards so that affected by 70 bps it s just when we ended up with lower finished goods at the end of the year it required us to have a accounting entry that reduced margins by 70 bps that actually the biggest factor but the reason why i didn t talk about it so much because it s not really a factor in 2019 it was a factor in q4 sam darkatsh raymond james analyst got it okay thank you for that and then last question i apologize also if this was covered directly but the guidance for the year sales guidance for 2019 what s the implied organic sales growth rate i think you mentioned for q1 is 3 to 5 but what specifically is it for the year inherent within your guidance brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it s the combination of r r expectation which at the top end of the range is probably flat like jeff mentioned and the new construction is growing at 9 so it basically flat to 3 sam darkatsh raymond james analyst got it thank you very much gentlemen i appreciate it jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president and then sam just do your point of reference just in case if others don t know on the call we did have a shooting one of our employees was in his car in the parking lot on tuesday night actually monday morning tuesday morning early and obviously our number one priority is safety of our team members and we re committed to ensure they have a safe work environment but what we found out is more of a domestic issue with him and another person and we immediately got him attention inaudible took him to hospital minimal downtime in terms of the events here at pgt we obviously have secured plant and we ll work with the police accordingly to make sure that this incident was resolved with him and the issue he was facing so thank you for asking about that and just wanted to let you know things are good here at kansas sam darkatsh raymond james analyst that s terrific thank you jeff operator let s turn next to nishu sood with deutsche bank myers deutsche bank analyst i had this is myers ph in for nishu thank you for taking my question so my first question i just trying to go back to the growth assumption the sales growth assumption for 2019 is 11 contribution from wws acquisition a good assumption to use brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer well we are not going to get into brands specific growth the bottom line is i think we kind of said what our legacy growth is kind of being kind of imply we have a whole bunch of initiatives around synergies and driving additional brand awareness with western as the new brand for us that s going to help drive growth faster than the market but i think when we get a combined guidance that we re kind of that s the extent that we really want to talk about myers deutsche bank analyst okay and going back to price do you mind giving your price assumptions for example masonite talked about how most of their growth is going to be priced so same thing i assume you anticipate some volume growth as well that s what i am i think i m hearing and i was just wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of how much is coming from pricing how much from volume brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so basically only price increase assumed in our model is the remaining effect of the price increase we have from last summer so it about half year and followed 5 you could probably say in 1 to 2 is left over from that growth and price rest is on in the first half not for full year myers deutsche bank analyst so 1 to 2 for impact for full year brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer 1 to 2 impact for the first half and then we catch up with the pricing increase myers deutsche bank analyst all right thank you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer you are welcome operator i ll turn now to ken zener with keybanc kenneth zener keybanc analyst good morning gentlemen jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president hi ken brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning kenneth zener keybanc analyst so i empathize we heard trying to forecast comps when you re r r is up 30 to 50 in the second and third quarter it s obviously very difficult if we can to kind of narrow that in i think your backlog you talked about 53 million well adjusted 53 million versus 50 million so up 6 your kind of backlog that you re seeing right now that i assume is obviously your organic business i am not sure but i just said if r r because it grew so well and i think being conservative as appropriate r r was 5 higher than you re talking about that being roughly 0 05 or 0 06 is how we re calculating it given your guidance how i mean a quarter from now are you going to have a much cleaner view on perhaps how you re cautious view on r r is well not cautious but you re 1 to 3 view if we re seeing backlog up 6 or 10 is that going to get you to kind of shift your view about what the second third quarter comps might be jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president yes ken as you look at how we executed in 2018 as 18 played out and we realized we re go in to do better as we beat expectations every quarter as we saw that we did change our guidance and so we will definitely have a better feel for how that r r comps going to impact our second quarter really at the beginning of the second quarter just based on order patterns and backlog like you d mentioned we will also have a better feel for how we can execute in a flat say california resident a flat how we execute in taking share which we ve historically done as that i pointed out with the growth patterns in western in a flat market we will have a better understanding of how we are going to be able to do that and our initiatives there and we will adjust accordingly hopefully it was all be positive and we will be in a position to adjust our guidance upward but right now we feel based on what we said and the order patterns we ve seen and the comps we re looking at and the housing commentary we listen to we think we re still going to execute 11 to 15 growth and be conservative and have a great year kenneth zener keybanc analyst yes and i appreciate that and brad i think you talked about mix right impacting r r versus new construction obviously 2q and 3q is going to be very relevant for you i m just trying to get sensitivities if gross margin i think you talked about higher sg a 21 22 i m going to call that 21 5 kind of the midpoint of your guidance for your ebitda guidance that means gross margins are kind of flat but if we face about 100 bps gross margin pressure this quarter was your 100 basis point comment for gross margin pressure was that is that a full year thing i m just trying to think about how we can properly set expectations for 2q and 3q given that that was enormous r r therefore uplift in mix and how we should think about the full year versus kind of that 2q and 3q mix issue i just want to make sure everyone s on the same page here brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer yes the 100 bps is the full year but it will definitely have a more impact in a quarter that you re comping a harder on our quarter because that s the genesis of the mix issue is the strength of the r r margin so yes in q2 and q3 it might be slightly higher than 100 bps and q1 and q4 maybe not as high as 100 bps but this 100 bps for the full year kenneth zener keybanc analyst okay all right i appreciate it thank you brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks ken jeffrey t jackson chief executive officer and president thanks ken operator and with that we ll conclude our question and answer session i ll now turn the conference back to you mr west for any closing remarks brad west senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks everybody for taking the time to join us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter take care operator with that we

sanctions are back in 2018 there were four rounds of sanctions which clearly did a lot of damage to russia s business and investment case ultimately however they failed to produce the intended result force the kremlin to change its aggressive ways as last year closed the u s midterms interrupted the introduction of a new round of crushing sanctions however on wednesday five u s senators from both parties published a bill called the defending american security from kremlin aggression act daska the aim is to increase economic political and diplomatic pressure on russia in response to its interference in democratic processes abroad its disastrous influence in syria and aggression against ukraine including the recent incident in the kerch strait the senate foreign policy committee said in a press release according to republican senator lindsay graham these are the toughest sanctions of all proposed so far in response to the kremlin s aggression in ukraine the proposed sanctions target 24 fsb agents implicated in the kerch strait attack the russian shipbuilding industry oil research and development and russian state owned oil projects abroad despite the drama a new round of sanctions will have a limited effect on russia s economy additionally the bill aims to accelerate the transfer of weapons to nato countries that on depend on russian weapons as well as creating centers that would help fight russia in areas such as hybrid and cyber threats there has been speculation as to whether the crushing sanctions will target russian sovereign and domestic debt international investors believe that placing a ban on holding these bonds would make them unsellable and drive their value to zero however more sober observers don t believe the u s government will go that far as too many big u s institutional investors already hold this paper thanks to the rock solid macroeconomic backing of the russian government set against the high yields they pay the ruble is likely to weaken further due to the political uncertainty others say that the currency has already priced in some of the threat of sanctions as the central bank of russia cbr prophylactically ended its easing cycle and hiked rates to the current 7 75 despite low inflationary pressure in anticipation of more currency volatility despite the drama a new round of sanctions will have a limited effect on russia s economy the first sanctions were imposed in 2014 following russia s annexation of the crimea and since then the government has been earnestly trying to sanction proof the economy among other measures it undertook were a ban on eu food imports that have spurred massive investment into the agricultural sector to make russia increasingly self sufficient in food production additionally last year the cbr sold off two thirds of its u s treasury bond holds to put the bulk of russia s currency reserves out of the reach of the u s authorities it has also successfully launched and deployed its own payment system to counter the threat of being denied use of the swift system and only recently the government introduced a bill to set up an internal internet in case russia is cut off from the worldwide web the government intends to test the system on april 1 by artificially cutting the lines to the internet to see what happens the bottom line is that sanctions are designed to force a government to change its ways and in that sense new and even harsher sanctions are almost certainly going to fail
analysis brics can defeat trump s protectionism july 25 2018 9 01 am brics is no longer in need of proving to the naysayers its sustainability and viability the time has now come for it to expand its membership and reach among emerging markets the world was in the grips of a growing financial crisis when brazil russia india and china first agreed to form an economic bloc in 2008 the sub prime mortgage crisis which began with the lehman brothers the fourth largest investment bank in the us led to big banks failing major corporations collapsing and spawned the eurozone crisis when south africa joined bric in 2010 all of the leading global economies were faltering it was the us which first resorted to stimulus programs like quantitative easing qe buying bonds back and lowering interest rates the eurozone followed a few years later to deal with stagnation in france and germany and recession in italy greece and others just as the us began to taper off its stimulus program the imf warned that advanced economies should maintain supportive policies in most advanced economies substantial output gaps and below target inflation suggest that the monetary stance must stay accommodative managing high public debt in a low growth and low inflation environment remains a key challenge the imf warned in an earlier report by the time the us ended its qe cash strapped greece was nearly defaulting on its loans and needed a bailout program while china s economy slowed down and entered a corrective phase it wouldn t be until 2016 that the imf started to indicate some semblance of growth in world markets but then the uk voted to leave the european union and market threats to global economy both the europeans and the british are considering worst case scenarios of a no deal brexit which is no longer a far fetched notion with some doomsayers predicting that the military will have to intervene to ensure no food shortages while this may seem unnecessarily apocalyptic the disruption to the existing world economic order is all too real this is all exacerbated by what seems like us president donald trump s trigger happy trade war on allies and competitors alike slowly pulling the global economy into a downward spiral of uncertainty it was just last year that the imf said the global economy had turned the corner but if the protectionist policies and trade wars continue the imf predicts considerable global economic slowdown and the loss of several hundred billion dollars in gdp the danger is that trump s insistence on tariffs could extend beyond steel and aluminium and also create a cascade effect where other nations see no recourse but to also resort to protectionist measures why brics matters more than ever ten years after their first meeting the leaders of the five brics countries meet amid dire economic realities protectionism and trade wars the 10th brics summit in johannesburg july 25 27 is perhaps the most important since the bloc s inception because it will mark whether hundreds of years of global trade development and political multilateralism will overcome the lone whims of a world power insisting on establishing barriers of economic conflict and distrust the ashes of the failing banks were falling when brics was formed now it is the fire of xenophobia and inconsistent immigration laws coupled with the divisive measures of brexit and tariffs that are unraveling decades of integration and cooperation forget for a moment that brics countries account for 40 per cent of the world s population and more than 25 per cent of the party s landmass put aside also that brics countries accounted for more than 25 per cent of the world s gdp in 2017 a figure that is to grow to nearly 27 per cent in the next few years the imf predicts this is not the true source of brics strength in the past 10 years the five member states of brics have shown incredible resilience weathering several crises including the 2014 decline in commodity trading which lead to stagnation and recession and brazil south africa and russia in 2016 alarm bells were sounded by those who have always panned brics as a failure from the outset they said china was crumbling because it was no longer producing double digit gdp growth while the chinese economy has slowed down to between 6 5 and 6 9 percent growth a year this is largely a corrective phase as beijing tries to curb skyrocketing real estate prices battle corruption and reform financial regulation but it is important to look at intra brics growth which has jumped in the past few years and how this has helped members like brazil move from 3 8 per cent growth in 2015 to at least 1 5 per cent forecast growth in 2018 and 2 5 per cent in 2019 brazil s exports to other brics countries during the same period have also increased for example exports to india reached their second highest level in two years at the end of 2017 by the end of the same year brazil s exports to the world jumped 14 per cent china meanwhile is brazil s biggest trading partner agricultural imports from the south american country to it s brics partner are poised to surge this year by the same token china has several fold increased its investments in south africa which is its largest trading partner in africa according to chinese president xi jinping bilateral trade between the two countries has increased 20 times in the past decade while the growth of trade within the bloc is something the naysayers did not anticipate it still is not the greatest weapon in its dossier no internal combustion nor is it the ability to overcome territorial disputes ahead of last year s summit in xiamen china and india ended their quickly escalated confrontation over the 89 km plateau along the china and bhutan border known as doklam in india and donglang in china across which chinese construction workers began to build a road in early june 2017 india sent troops to the bhutan side of the plateau but withdrew them at the end of august thereby ending a tense 73 day stand off with china the two countries realized that they had much more in common to work together for than what separated them having ended the impasse between them and following their meeting at the 9th brics summit the two countries proceeded to mend three years of deteriorating relations in a little reported

acknowledgement of a powerful and strategic symbiosis but even this is not brics greatest forte adapt and expand the greatest advantage that brics has over other economic blocs such as the g7 is not only that it is transnational but that it has flexibility and adaptability to expand and add new members from the strongest emerging markets the entire premise behind brics is that lesser non western powers turned to geo economics shuffling their energies to align political strategy with economic planning the seeds for the brics foundation of powerful political unions shadowing as economic blocs has successfully produced the new development bank which since it s 2014 establishment has already loaned a sum of 5 billion to 21 projects within the bloc with a focus on sustainable and green infrastructure development the next phase of the bank s financing should now turn to emerging markets beyond the bloc the greatest hope for globalization to advance lies not at the feet of europe but at the union of geographically disconnected non western economies who share common denominators of large populations with rapidly growing markets industrialization modernization and an ambition to become global market leaders trump s protectionism and tariffs have given brics a coup de grace a golden opportunity that should not be squandered brics should show the world that it is the champion of multilateralism by embracing one or two new members this year or in the immediate future nigeria turkey egypt indonesia or mexico are ripe for the picking as both china and india are working diligently to open their markets brics must work quickly to tear down barriers and restrictions which could impede the free flow of goods ideas people and services within the bloc brics must now appeal to more people but not by imposing the western economic social and philosophical mantras which have dominated north south relations western economies need not remain the paradigm by which economic vibrancy and viability is measured instead they can incorporate emerging markets into the policy making structure many analysts were perhaps unprepared to accept that post colonial nations which less than 100 years ago where occupied by western powers could now be on the verge of introducing new paradigms to global economic theory thanks to trump the time is now by firas al atraqchi for

beyond following jack s comments anatol will provide an update on the lng market and michael will review our financial results after prepared remarks we will open the call for q a i ll now turn the call over to jack fusco cheniere s president and ceo jack fusco president and ceo thank you randy and good morning everyone i m pleased to be here this morning to review our significant accomplishments from a very successful 2018 to share my optimism for the continued success as we look forward to 2019 and beyond 2018 was a truly remarkable year for cheniere on last year s call i described 2017 as our breakthrough year which is certainly was in 2018 we maintained our momentum achieving excellence in reaching new heights in virtually all phases of our business from commercial success achieved by signing over 7 million tons per year a new long term spas to the fid of corpus christi train 3 in may and the start up of corpus christi train 1 few months later to continued financial discipline and simplification of our corporate structure we ve achieved those and much more and in doing so have cemented our reputation as a reliable full service lng operator which delivers on its promises to its customers employees and stakeholders in 2018 we executed on our strategic growth plans operational plans and financial plans and the results of our execution are apparent in the financial results we reported earlier this morning slide 5 presents some key highlights of the fourth quarter 2018 there are a couple of achievements i d like to highlight from this slide we generated consolidated adjusted ebitda of over 630 million and the the distributable cash flow of approximately 130 million and produced and exported a record 80 cargoes on the quarter almost a cargo a day in addition we reached the commissioning milestone of our first cargo at both train 5 at sabine pass and train 1 at corpus christi as of year end we had exported four commissioning cargoes from train 5 at sabine pass and two from train 1 at corpus christi our substantial commercial momentum continued in the fourth quarter as we signed long term spas with both polish oil and gas company and petronas for over 2 5 million tons per year in aggregate we look forward to successful long term relationships with our newest spa customers and expect these spas to support our growth plans the market for lng contracting remains active and we continue to pursue additional long term commercial arrangements with new and existing counterparts worldwide turning now to slide 6 a look of some of 2018s most notable highlights financial results for the first year 2018 came in at the top end of our guidance ranges for both consolidated adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as we generated more than 2 6 billion in consolidated adjusted ebitda and approximately 600 million in distributable cash flow for the full year michael will cover these results in more detail but our financial performance in 2018 improved throughout the year and we are pleased to deliver full year financial results at or above our upwardly revised guidance range in 2018 we executed two important market transactions that i ll highlight briefly first we closed the merger with cqh in which we opportunistically and economically simplified our corporate structure our corporate structure remains complex and we would prefer to be simpler however we will remain opportunistic and only pursue further simplification transaction to the extent they are economic lng shareholders in addition to the cqh transaction in 2018 we also refinanced the remaining term loans at cqp into the bond market economically addressing the nearest term maturity in our complex and further demonstrating our commitment in managing our balance sheet throughout the corporate structure operationally in 2018 we produced and exported a total of 273 cargoes which required over 1 quadrillion btus of gas to our terminals our teams in gas supply and operations made the significant operational and logistical achievement look easy and their dedication and commitment to excellence are significant contributors to our reputation as a reliable operator strategically 2018 was an incredible success as we made a positive final investment decision on train 3 at corpus christi and originated over 7 million tons per year of new long term spas giving us sufficient visibility on train 6 at sabine pass that enables us to finalize the epc contract an issue limited notices to proceed on that project late last year having that project under way the limited notice to proceed is strategically important for us as we have cost and date certainty on train 6 ahead of a formal fid which is where efforts are concentrated today the fid of train 6 is one of my key priorities for 2019 which i ll address on slide 7 on this slide i have included a few key priorities which highlight that our focus remains centered on growth execution and being disciplined toward the capital we are focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve fid of train 6 which we expect to occur over the coming months as we have previously communicated we expect to finance train 6 with approximately 50 debt and 50 equity which is consistent with our strategy of deleveraging through growth ahead of that fid bechtel is hard at work on train 6 and making excellent progress at its scope of work bechtel now estimates that train 6 is approximately 14 complete highlighted by over that 3300 piles already driven as part of the site preparation beyond train 6 we are focused on progressing stage 3 at corpus christi through the permitting process which we are permitting for approximately 9 5 million tons of additional lng capacity this project is moving through the process very well we expect to have all the required regulatory approvals in place by the end of 2019 we expect to bring three trains into commercial operations during 2019 train 5 at sabine pass and the first two trains at corpus christi as we have done with all the trains to date we expect these three to be brought online safely ahead of schedule within budget completing commissioning and start up as well as commencing long term contracts associated with new trains is a significant undertaking and requires a tremendous amount of work and coordination among cheniere our epc partner bechtel in our foundation customers these efforts are especially critical for 2019 as we will be starting up three trains and commencing long term spas for train 5 at sabine pass train 1 at corpus christi and i am focused on maintaining our track record for seamless transitions from construction to operations the performance test for train 1 at corpus christi has been successfully completed and we expect substantial completion to occur in the next few days last priority i d like to highlight is our plan to communicate the capital allocation policy this is a high priority for the executive team who are working closely with our advisors and our board of directors to ensure we develop a durable flexible policy that enables us to allocate capital the most effective impactful way for our shareholders we look forward to communicating it to the investment community in the coming months as i said earlier 2018 was a remarkable year for cheniere and we are proud of the accomplishments we achieved throughout the year we have many more successes we re pursuing both in 2019 and beyond and my confidence in our ability to continue delivering on our promises underscored our people and the relentless focus on execution that continues to define cheniere and now i ll turn it over to anatol who will provide an update on the market anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks jack and good morning everyone please turn to slide 9 2018 was a banner year for lng in many regards globally 9 trains started service increasing global supply by roughly 30 million tonnes the largest year on year increase since 2009 when qatar began to bring its mega trains online new and expansion trains in australia russia and the u s push total global supplies over the 320 million tonne mark according to preliminary data in the u s exports from our facilities totaled nearly 19 million tons during the year a 33 increase over 2017 the sabine pass train 4 started commercial deliveries in march and train 5 which is currently undergoing commissioning exported its first cargo in november also in november we saw start up of the first greenfield lng terminal in the lower 48 u s as train 1 at our corpus christi facility started producing lng and exported two commissioning cargoes before the end of the year we expect lng production from our facilities and others in the u s to continue ramping up in the coming months and contribute to further enhancing the reliability flexibility and liquidity of the global lng market strong global lng supply growth was met with robust demand in 2018 that led to some late year market rebalancing demand growth in asia absorbed virtually all of the incremental supply the step up in global production especially in the fourth quarter when the global complex added more than 10 5 million tonnes year on year ensured adequate supply availability for asia and the rest of the world as mild winter temperatures kept price spikes in check and supported an uptick in imports into europe which added over 4 million tonnes year on year in 2018 the graph on the top right displays the fourth quarter of 2018 demand compared to that what we saw in fourth quarter of 2017 as you can see china along with the rest of asia had strong year on year increases in imports for the month of november china overtook japan as the world s top importer although the position went back to japan in december total european demand increased nearly 7 million tonnes in the quarter which as i mentioned was partially supported by mild weather in asia new lng supply coming online and high shipping rates that incentivized atlantic source cargoes to target europe i ll come back to weather in europe in just a minute global gas price benchmarks in the fourth quarter saw higher levels and increased volatility compared to the same period in 2016 and 2017 however even with a brief spike in henry hub prices in december the u s benchmark continue to trade at a heavy discount compared to other global gas price indices despite a mild winter and a reduction in the storage deficit seen earlier in the year ttf prices traded more than a 1 50 higher than levels seen during the same time a year ago similarly fourth quarter asian spot prices settled at more than 3 higher on average year on year though the premium decreased over the course of the quarter please now turn to slide 10 more than 20 countries almost half of all lng importing countries had record annual lng import levels in 2018 including china south korea india and pakistan in addition to record import levels china and pakistan also set records for lng demand growth rates in 2018 the graph to the far left highlights how remarkable china s demand has been over the past two years china alone absorb more than 50 of the worldwide incremental supplies in 2018 adding 16 million tonnes above the 2017 level china remains an important demand center for our product and the country s need for natural gas and lng is expected to continue to rise as the country balances its economic growth needs and environmental commitments south korea s steady demand over the last two years has also been impressive demand growth was largely due to low nuclear utilization as well as lower coal fired power generation resulting from policies intended to improve air quality looking ahead to 2019 for south korea lng consumption taxes are set to decrease while coal taxes are set to increase which of course is expected to be supportive of lng demand pakistan which began importing lng in 2015 has shown consistent in growing demand and regasification build out in the early 2020s could make pakistan a significantly larger importer than it is today the middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in asia populous areas of east asia have seen mostly minor cold spells this winter and the month of january finished on an extremely mild note asia s heating degree days an indicative of factor of weather driven demand ran close to average at best for much of the early part of the winter nonetheless prices remained fairly robust compared to last year the graph on the far right shows spot prices in relation to crude oil for the past three years price levels in the first half of 18 were higher than in 2017 and particularly more bullish from june to november probably due to china s early buying ahead of the winter in order to secure more lng and avoid shortages and price spikes in the winter high asian lng storage levels combined with the arrival of new supply in the fourth quarter and a fairly mild winter resulted in more moderate prices in the fourth quarter please turn to slide 11 where i ll highlight the european market lng imports to europe reached record levels in december european lng imports during the first three quarters of 2018 were actually lower year on year but the fourth quarter showed very strong levels for a number of reasons storage levels were at a 17 year low after the 2017 18 winter in europe leaving the region to play catch up throughout the year the relative tightness in the global lng market through the first three quarters left limited opportunities for storage replenishment early buying and mild temperatures in asia left that region adequately supplied and elevated shipping rates high coal and carbon prices and an uptick in global lng production incentivized flows into europe in the fourth quarter nuclear maintenance and domestic supply declines also supported imports the middle graph shows a total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in europe through january 24 europe has also seen mild weather this winter particularly in december making the regions heating degree days below average in the fourth quarter cooler temps in the back half of january have helped bring europe s temperatures closer to average for the season which should help with the weather sensitive demand however given all of the factors encouraging lng flows into europe we do not view the increase is entirely weather driven the graph on the far right displays storage levels on the left and ttf prices on the right axis as mentioned earlier the store situation europe faced coming out of the winter of 2017 exerted upward pressure on ttf prices europe entered the third quarter with storage levels near the bottom of the 5 year range which contributed to upward pressure on ttf prices in the fourth quarter prices were still more than 3 an mmbtu higher the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 although they have moderated particularly after october settlement europe is undergoing a structural shift in the overall dynamics of its gas market which makes it an increasingly attractive region for both our long term and shorter term lng strategies there is debate in europe heightened in recent weeks about limiting coal use and achieving climate targets that could have a significant positive impact on europe s appetite for lng in the longer term in the near term a number of the issues that were in play in the fourth quarter could remain in 2019 potentially resulting in continued robust european lng imports again this year i ll now turn the call over to michael to review our financial results michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks anetol and good morning everyone turning to slide 13 for the fourth quarter we generated net income of 67 million consolidated adjusted ebitda of 634 million and distributable cash flow of approximately 130 million our results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher than forecast lng volumes and revenue and lifting ph margins as well as lower than forecast o m expenses for the full year we generated net income of 471 million consolidated adjusted ebitda of over 2 6 billion distributable cash flow of approximately 600 million as jack mentioned consolidated adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow for the full year were both at the top of the revised guidance ranges we provided on our third quarter call exported 285 tbtu of lng from our liquefaction projects during the fourth quarter of which 21 tbtu were commissioning volumes total volumes exported were higher than exports in the third quarter due to commissioning volumes from sabine pass train 5 and corpus christi train 1 and higher seasonal production from the four trains in operation at sabine pass approximately 72 of the volumes exported during the quarter are 260 tbtu were listed by our third party long term spa customers and the remaining 79 tbtu were lifted by our marketing functions long term spa customer volumes were consistent with prior quarter and marketing volumes were higher due to increased production and commissioning volumes the full year and we exported 976 tbtu from our liquefaction projects of which 21 tbtu were commissioning volumes approximately 77 of total volumes 756 tbtu were lifted by a third party long term spa customers and 220 tbtu were lifted by our marketing functions in the fourth quarter we recognized an income 242 tbtu of lng produced at sabine pass consisting of 263 tbtu loaded during the quarter plus 3 tbtu or one cargo loaded in the prior quarter but delivered and recognized in the current quarter last 25 tbtu or 7 cargoes sold on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the fourth quarter we also recognized an income 40 tbtu or 12 cargoes of lng that were sourced from third parties the full year we recognized an income 973 tbtu of lng produced at sabine pass and 84 tbtu of lng that were sourced from third parties five commissioning cargoes from sabine pass train 5 in corpus christi train 1 totaling 17 tbtu of lng were recognized on our balance sheet as an offset of 140 million to lng terminal construction in progress during the fourth quarter one commissioning cargo exported during the fourth quarter was on the water at year end and will be recognized as an offset to construction in progress during the first quarter of 2019 net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was 67 million or 0 26 per share consistent with the third quarter increased operating income due to additional lng volumes recognized in revenue was offset by increased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps full year 2018 we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of 471 million or 1 90 per share on a diluted basis an increase of more than 860 million from a net loss of 393 million in 2017 increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional trains in operation at sabine pass decreased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased derivative gain and decreased net income attributable to non controlling interests partially offset by increased interest expense net of amounts capitalized during the fourth quarter we amended our existing revolving credit facility increasing total commitments to 1 25 billion and extending the maturity date to december 2022 this undrawn revolving facility enhances our liquidity position and provides a backstop for corpus equity funding obligations turn now to slide 14 where i ll review our 2019 guidance and touch on the highest priorities for 2019 jack mentioned earlier we remain focused on delivering results and today we are reiterating our full year 2019 consolidated adjusted ebitda guidance of 2 9 billion to 3 2 billion a distributable cash flow guidance of 0 6 billion to 0 8 billion we are also reconfirming our full year 2019 cqp distribution guidance of 235 to 255 per unit our actual results could be impacted by changes to train completion timing or lng market pricing before turning the call over to q a i d like to briefly review our top three financial priorities for 2019 first is to achieve financial results within these guidance ranges second priority is to complete the debt financing transaction for 50 of the total cost of sabine pass train 6 inaudible that process and it is an essential step prior to reaching fid jack also mentioned this that our final key priority for this year is to develop and communicate capital allocation strategy a process which has been under way for several months now as we have previously indicated we expect our capital allocation plan to support our ability to invest in growth enable us to maintain investment grade credit metrics at the projects and ensure that consolidated leverage is at an appropriate level and return capital to shareholders in a way most appropriate inaudible our shareholders we expect to communicate this policy to the investment community in the coming months that concludes our prepared remarks thank you for your time and your interest in cheniere operator we are ready to open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we ll now take our first question from christine cho from barclays please go ahead christine cho barclays analyst good morning everyone michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning christine christine cho barclays analyst i know it s early for corpus christi stage 3 and it depends on the contracts but how are you thinking about targeted financing for it especially as you are in the process of developing your capital allocation policy should we also think of it as 50 50 bet equity similar to train 6 michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah christine it s michael that s how we re thinking about it continue to deleverage through growth with no more than 50 debt on all incremental projects and maybe you can bring that down over time christine cho barclays analyst okay and then i think on the last quarter call you said that 2 5 to 3 mtpa was the assumption for early cargoes this year has the contracting for this book increased since last quarter and how should we think about your strategy around this as we move through the year and should we still think 5 margin for the uncontracted portion this is what we should assume michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes this is michael again so i think the number is more like 6 million tonnes i think is of post cod volumes with another 1 5 million on top of that a commissioning volumes which won t hit the p l i don t know exactly how the portfolios evolved over the past few months but certainly we ve been selling one thing to keep in mind is we don t like to sell volumes until we know we have them right until we go through this commissioning process there s always uncertainty about exactly when the train is going to come on so we don t want to get out of our skies having placed a lot of volume prior to getting the train so with that starting to become behind us as jack mentioned corpus passed the performance test recently so we have more certainty there so the guys will definitely be more active in putting those volumes away in terms of market you guys can all see the screen like we can i told you for the unsold piece of our portfolio we were assuming 4 5 to 5 5 margins when we did our budget three or four months ago clearly that has come in probably almost 2 and so we gave you that sensitivity on the last call that said for every dollar move in margin it affect our ebitda by 130 million so you can do that math so if we were in upper half of our guidance range three or four months ago certainly were lower in that range today but still within it christine cho barclays analyst okay thank you so much operator we ll now take our next question from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst good morning just wanted to build on spl 6 a little bit more here and see what else is needed for positive fid seems like a contractual support is largely there is it just lining up the financing and then also looks like the epc contract price 2 5 billion is a bit lower than what you had pressed pl5 and just wondering what drives the deltas there jack fusco president and ceo hi jeremy thanks spl 6 we re extremely excited about as i mentioned on my talking points we ve released bechtel with limited notice to proceed so we ve locked in the price we ve locked in the schedule in regards to that and bechtel is making extremely good progress as you know there s a lot of synergies with having the workforce just roll off of five into six additionally what you re seeing are with the cost of 6 we think it s extremely competitive just like corpus christi train 3 and we were able to utilize not only the synergies of having the workforce already mobilized in the equipment already there to move right into train 6 but also into utilizing some of the existing infrastructure that it affords us having the brownfield site so we ve got the infrastructure that was already built for the first five trains that we ve rolled into train 6 and that s part of the cost reduction michael i don t know if you have anything to add michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean on the financing that we re progressing that as we speak as i said on the last call as jack said we have bechtel working right there full speed ahead we know price we know schedule we don t owe them a full mtpa until all of the summer and so as i said on the last call we re just kind of waiting to see what contracts come in and what the best portfolio is to really attached to that train for financing purposes and since the last call you saw petronas come in it s a very clean fob deal which we like to put down at the project so we have three or four months to see what else comes in and then decide the optimum mix and close that financing but that s not slowing us down in anyway because we re under way on train 6 and then i d add to jack s comment on remember when we built train 5 the first four trains leveraged a lot of infrastructure that we had at the regas facility all the utilities and things like that with train 5 we had to really add all of that and we did that in anticipation of train 6 so train 5 was always going to be the higher cost train train 6 was is far more attractive on a cost perspective because so much infrastructure is in place from the train 5 so yeah just like train 3 jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst that s helpful thanks just wanted to switch gears over to esg seems like this is the greater focal point for the marketplace for investors going forward here and we re just wondering if you could tell us how cheniere thinks about these issues how you re positioning yourself and how you guys see yourselves stacking up versus other energy infrastructure company jack fusco president and ceo so we re very excited here recently organizationally we were able to bring on a fiji george who is from southwest who s got a lot of experience in esg type programs and he s been spearheading our effort as well as chris smith who is our senior vice president of external affairs in washington dc and you all may know chris he was assistant secretary of energy under the previous administrations so we think we need to be a leader in it as you know we feel like we re on the right side of the equation when it comes to esg we think natural gas is the solution it s economic it s secure and it s sustainable and what you see around the world is a policy shift i think it s going to be a secular shift in the way energy is utilized worldwide and i think you re going to see natural gas and liquefied natural gas take a much more prominent role in that well we will be rolling out our esg methodology and program here very very soon anatol do you have anything there anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer no just exactly as you said we re focused we are looking to leverage our position on the gas procurement side as well as our ability to supply this clean reliable fuel to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world achieve that type of carbon dioxide reductions that the u s has enjoyed over the last decade jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst that s all from me thanks for taking my question operator we ll take our next question from michael webber from wells fargo securities mr webber please go ahead your line is open michael webber wells fargo securities analyst thanks hi good morning guys how are you anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer good morning michael webber wells fargo securities analyst jack just wanted to start off with you a market based question overnight we saw tensions escalate in pakistan and india because obviously i have some exposure there to india i m just curious can you maybe you run the risk and the impact your business can you maybe walk us through the impact theoretically of a force majeure there on your import contracts if we saw a replay of 1999 or a broader conflict and then maybe i guess within the context of kind of walking through that volumes just gets put into the spot market and make them on the back end i know it s early but seems pretty pressing so anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes there is no force majeure michael right it s fob so our contract with gail they pick up at the flange as sabine pass and they can take it wherever they want to take it and that s one of the benefits of the u s lng and the cheniere model so from that perspective we don t see anything meaningful one way or the other michael webber wells fargo securities analyst okay that s it wouldn t be applicable to an fob based contracts that basically what you re saying anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer it s not no we would expect them to honor their contract and we would enforce our contract but so far relationship with gail is extremely strong and we will continue to try to meet their needs so michael webber wells fargo securities analyst okay now that s helpful i appreciate that and then maybe just around the competitive dynamics in and around the u s gulf i guess it s been again a bit more crowded in the last quarter or two with fid at golden pass and vg kind of knocking on the door i guess maybe a little bit more insight i guess within the industry in terms of where those deals are getting done do you have a better sense yet around whether you ve been able to price or able to command a premium for your volumes relative to your peers in u s gulf and if so maybe kind of a vague sense on where you think that is anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer so a couple of things one i think when you see a lot of other folks that want to have a position like cheniere and then it just reconfirms that our business model our position is second to none right worldwide and so i m very very excited about that as you know we were a first mover and we ve executed extremely well right you can compare us to just about everybody else in the u s and see that our construction effort has been second to none our operating ability in the hand off from construction operations has been second to none our ability to produce real volume in a growing demand market has been second to none so i feel very good about our ability to execute and i do think our full service model and our ability to deliver anywhere around the world has afforded us a slight premium to were the spot market is clearing today michael webber wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks for the time guys i appreciate it operator we ll take the next question from craig shere from tuohy brothers please go ahead craig shere tuohy brothers analyst good morning guys hi craig michael in may 2018 at your analyst day i think you guided that on a 9 train program that you won t required to think about debt amortization out of operating cash flows at both the mlp spl level and also at the lng corpus christi level to late 2020s can you kind of share what maybe all equity funding of 300 a ton upsizing of all the liquefaction trains and the possible successful addition of a 50 50 corpus christi phase 3 would do to that would push amortization requirements under the 20s and 30s anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes absolutely i don t know what the exact date is that we d look to get into the details on that when we hit the road probably after our next call to roll out capital allocation and train 6 the train 6 numbers and probably add some stage 3 numbers into the whole model but absolutely i mean it s every piece of equity differs that amortization date craig shere tuohy brothers analyst yes speaking of phase 3 since corpus train 3 you signed four agreements with a total of five in a quarter mtpa which obviously is more than you could possibly need for 4 5 6 how much do you feel like you already have in the bag so to speak corpus phase 3 and what minimum percentage of the 9 5 mtpa would you like to train 6 contracted before perhaps an fid next year anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes i mean we definitely have more contracts than we need for train 6 for sure we ve drawn down kind of some of our cmi inventory to service some of that but the plan would be to we would think that piece of our business competitive advantage to keep some capacity there how much do we need on stage 3 i think we re running a couple of cases one where we built the whole thing and one where we built half of it and certainly we re making our way toward at least building half of it but not quite there yet so jack fusco president and ceo and i would say craig we re extremely excited about corpus christi and our ability to expand we think there are no constraints with the site there s no constraints with natural gas pipeline capacity coming into the side the amount of infrastructures is there and then our location to the permian should be a real advantage all the way around so that we re not going to slow down on the growth side i think i ve got some of the best originators in this industry and we re going to capitalize upon that craig shere tuohy brothers analyst that sounds great jack if i could kind of dovetail on the those comments do you see prospects related to corpus phase 3 for signing both supply and off take agreements linked to brent or perhaps a texas based gas inaudible jack fusco president and ceo anatol you want to take that anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks jack thanks greg yes i think one of the things that was surprising in some sense amazing in the lng market in 2018 was that the majority of the contracts that were executed were henry hub linked and obviously it was us and our neighbors at vg that had the that success the world has got comfortable with this as an attractive model it offers liquidity price transparency and it has seen a number of times now when if henry hub has a quick excursion to prices above 3 it comes down very rapidly and continues to be very competitive with brent linked and other contracts we continue to think that that is the right flag to fly your question about alternative indices that s a very long part and in our view of the world isn t ready to price meaningful volume aguadulce ph while it s something that you and we know well just does not have the liquidity transparency term structure that would make it marketable internationally michael webber wells fargo securities analyst that s very helpful very quick last one for michael i think may last year at analyst day you said 1 9 billion of incremental forecast equity funding for corpus christi trains 1 to 3 with things progressing seemingly better than expected any range of how much that might come under michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t think we re ready to i mean train 3 has a long way to go so i would stick with that number for now train 6 we re going to end up with probably close to 300 million of contingency though and so that will get rolled into train 6 to help meet our 50 50 debt equity to train 5 we had excess contingency which will roll into train 6 to achieve our 50 50 debt equity but on corpus side stick with the numbers we put out in may michael webber wells fargo securities analyst great thank you operator will now take our next question from danilo juvane from bmo capital markets danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst thanks and good morning my first question is for michael you have pretty clear visibility to the contractive portion of your cash flow profile just curious with that in mind how you sort of evaluating the various capital allocation decisions going forward michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we do have a lot of visibility again we ll roll that out in a few months probably after our next call will hit the road and talk about it but it s pretty straightforward for us there s three buckets right there is the growth bucket the balance sheet bucket and the shareholder returns bucket and i can tell you we re really excited about the growth so that s going to be a big number as we look at not only train 6 but stage 3 reinvesting in the business is the best use of our money at the returns we think we can generate and then we ll have to decide if we want to do something else on the balance sheet relative to what we ve already said publicly so we re thinking through that and then there s probably some money left over for some kind of shareholder return flexibility is going to be key for us we will keep that in mind as we think about bucket number 3 but look to put some real numbers to that here in the coming months danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst and as you think about bucket number 3 is that something that you think you d be able to actually implement this year or farther out to assuming some sort of a run rate and inaudible michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ll see i mean probably both but we ll see danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst okay i thank you for that other question is for jack you spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about being opportunistic to a cqp simplification i mean it seems that there will be a little bit more difficult to achieve versus what you were able to do with cqh how should we think about how you ultimately end up rolling up the mlp thank you jack fusco president and ceo i think that i said it fairly clearly we re going to be very opportunistic the math doesn t work and we re going to have a complicated structure for the foreseeable future and until we convince all of you that our growth really is there i think we ll get hopefully get you ll comfortable and we can actually execute what we say and that we re a conservative bunch overall but right now the exchange ratio just don t work danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst got you last question from me with respect to stage 3 have we ultimately just abandoned midscale that seems to be let s talk about now there seems to be shift in zones just having sort of conventional trains going forward how should we think about that jack fusco president and ceo no we are moving full speed ahead with our midscale solution right now which is our corpus christi stage 3 sorry not train 3 stage 3 that would filing which we have in front of ferc right now danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst those are my question thank you jack fusco president and ceo thanks operator as a reminder ladies and gentlemen please limit yourself to one question with one follow up and rejoin the queue for additional questions our next questioner comes from jean salisbury from bernstein please go ahead jean ann salisbury bernstein analyst hi good morning how much advanced locking in is there of pricing for spot cargoes have we seen the full effect of the fourth quarter winter gas spike on margins or it will sum up your next quarter anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer well thank you it s anatol it s really a mix as michael said we have three trains coming on with a fair amount of timing uncertainty on cargoes and we re not in the business of going short in the market we as we ve said to you before we do have some tranches obviously we have early cargoes associated with some term deals that we ve executed over the last year as well as some medium term deals for 19 and 20 but for competitive reasons we re not going to get into the specifics of the volumes quarter by quarter jean ann salisbury bernstein analyst okay fair enough and then do you see a risk in 2019 that have everything starts up as scheduled some u s lng facilities won t be running at full capacity for parts of the year anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer it anatol again i really cannot envision that scenario actually i have to say i can t envision the first premise of that scenario either but even if that did play out the probability that on a marginal basis there is no value in exporting a 2 5 henry hub molecule to a strong global market is pretty close to zero to me jean ann salisbury bernstein analyst okay that s all from me thank you operator next question comes from fotis giannakoulis from morgan stanley please go ahead sir fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst yes hi thank you all anatol i have one question for you the last three fids they can be reached without long term spas from the respective parties is this a new trend and how does this change the the long term dynamics of the market and your potential margins and growth initiatives beyond the stage 3 of corpus christi anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks fotis it s not a surprise to you or to us it s a global and competitive market and lots of places have attractive molecules that they want to monetize with eight different capital allocation algorithm and different risk tolerance than we do so we are always expecting what in the u s we may have called a producer push component the lng market calls it the equity lifting model those are projects that we always believed would be able to get off the ground whether that s east africa western canada arctic russia et cetera and where we are expecting fully expecting to compete with them we have been competing with them and there weren t a surprise to anyone in 2018 where we had pretty close to a record year so we love the hand that we re dealt we love as jack said the business model and the track record that we ve built and we re confident that we ll be able to leverage that into continued success but it is a competitive market fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst so from your answer shall i take that your strategy of backing every new expansion with long term spas will remain intact or this new fids might change your risk appetite anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer well look we told you a couple of years ago our model was continued to refine that we think that the range of cmi having the warehouse staff 5 to 20 sort of as the side boards of volume in it is a very good number and we re still comfortable with that and we ve had good success as michael mentioned we ve in essence drawn down that inventory will look to reallocate volumes to that in order to continue to prosecute the type of bridging volume and secure reliable attractive value proposition that we ve been successful with so there is no reason to change what s been working and is expected to continue working for the foreseeable future fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst thank you very much anatol congratulation for the great year anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks fotis operator our next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys two questions one on the last quarterly call you kind of updated the range of potential output our capacity for each training kind of raise the high end can you talk to us about kind of how you get comfortable with hitting that high end and is even upside to that level i d love response on that and then i ve got a follow on about the balance sheet jack fusco president and ceo michael it s jack yeah so from an operating perspective i would say that we are very comfortable now with the upper end of the range that we gave all of you we have some de bottlenecking initiatives that we have plans of achieving this year with some of our turnaround and maintenance schedules and you should expect us to revise our output but i think most of you are probably on genscape and can see our gas flows into our facility and noq hat we re very close to 5 bcf d right now so we re very very pleased with the way our trains have been performing michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and then one quick one on the balance sheet just curious how do you think about let s say once you get train 6 online and that s we re talking a couple years down the road what you think about as a normal credit metrics that you d like to achieve kind of a long run target or a long run goal and whether that is measured on an ffo to debt or debt to ebitda perspective anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer before michael answers that question i just want to make sure already this morning with the l t of train 6 that the price in the schedule are fixed and not a risk for us so we haven t had any cost overruns yet we don t expect to start now on our trains number 8 and 9 so i just want to make sure i got that clear michael lapides goldman sachs analyst understood i ve known you for a long time have i ve not seen you have very many cost overruns in the 12 to 15 years anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer go ahead michael michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer the balance sheet the rating agencies look at it several different ways the projects they care about debt service coverage ratios and then deconsolidated numbers consolidated numbers and for us i think we had we need to keep it simple and just communicate like everybody else which is just a consolidated debt to ebitda number and so that over the long run i think that s what we ll start to look at more and more though the rating agencies are more nuance given our multiple levels of debt michael lapides goldman sachs analyst do have a kind of a mental target in mind of where you d like that debt to ebitdar number to be train 6 is up and running michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer well they are the part of our grant roll out in a few months currently we re at 5 times to 6 times consolidated probably on the upper end of that range from what we said last time so that s what we ll stick with for now michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you michael much appreciated guys operator our final question today will come from alex kania from wolfe research please go ahead alex kania wolfe research analyst thanks i just wanted to touch on the commentary related to maybe the financing package for sabine pass 6 michael i think you talked about thinking about optimizing what contracts you which has that facility are you talking mainly about the cmi contracts that you ve already got secured or maybe are you is there kind of discussions far enough along in another fob type contract that you may want to wait to see play out for you you finalize that michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean we have a free option right now which is that we don t have to give full mtpa summer so yes we just wait and see what happens i mean i like our position now if we had to make a decision tomorrow i don t think we have any problem with that but given that we have free time to wait working hard yes i mean we ll wait and see if anything else comes down the pipe between now and then we have vitol and petronas which you re fob deals and then we have a fair amount of does deals so yes we ll just wait alex kania wolfe research analyst thanks very much michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks alex anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer and thank you all for your support of cheniere operator ladies and gentlemen we will now turn it back to management for additional or closing remarks anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks everyone for joining us today

tupperware nyse tup reported its fourth quarter 2018 earnings on jan 30 and surprised investors with weak financial performance and a 60 dividend cut the company s stock price dived over 27 in the day following the announcement and is down nearly 40 in the past year tup chart tup data by ycharts could tupperware s depressed stock price be a buying opportunity or is the dividend cut a signal that management sees more pain ahead perhaps both statements are true what drove the recent earnings miss tupperware s q4 2018 earnings were weak due to a combination of macroeconomic headwinds stemming from the strong us dollar and company specific issues q4 revenue declined 14 but only declined 7 in constant currency terms q4 eps declined 11 but only declined 6 in constant currency advertisement advertisement a strong us dollar hurts tupperware s earnings because over 90 of the company s sales are generated outside of the united states and tupperware reports its financials in terms of us dollars the reported dollar amount of revenue and earnings are worth less in us dollar terms if the foreign exchange rate in places where tupperware operates becomes relatively weaker vs the us dollar this negative impact from currency exchange rates explains half of the recent quarter s revenue decline another headwind for tupperware has been weakness in emerging market economies 67 of tupperware s sales are generated in emerging market countries such as india china mexico and brazil historically these countries have spurred growth for the company but today these markets are suffering due to a whole host of issues in the recent quarter tupperware saw its sales in asia decline 16 and its sales in south america decline 22 however not all of tupperware s problems can be blamed on external economic forces the company saw its salesforce decline 5 last year tupperware has a direct to consumer business model whereby an independent salesforce distributes the company s products directly to retailers and consumers tupperware is dependent on its direct salesforce to sell its products and a decline in the number of sales people translates to lower product sales there is no doubt that the q4 earnings report was disappointing but much of the negative drivers were due to economic factors that are out of the company s control these economic headwinds could abate or even reverse in the future also shareholders may be happy to hear that the company has a plan to address the company specific issues tupperware image source tupperware a turnaround plan tupperware s turnaround plan is propelled by the dividend cut tupperware cut its dividend from 0 68 per share to 0 27 per share a 60 reduction this reduction saves the company 80 million per year in cash which it plans to invest back into the business advertisement advertisement on the q4 2018 earnings call management announced a plan to invest 100 million over the next 3 years in efforts to grow sales and reduce costs specifically the company wants to deploy technology that will help improve the productivity of its salesforce by spending less time on logistical and administrative duties and more time focused on speaking to customers furthermore tupperware is streamlining its organizational structure and compensation so that there are fewer layers of management and salespeople are better incentivized the company noted that a reduction in management headcount would result in 50 million in annual cost savings beginning in 2020 tupperware has suffered a decline in its salesforce headcount over the past year which has translated into a decline in revenue because tupperware uses a direct to customer salesforce the company must constantly work toward recruiting and retaining productive salespeople for the business to thrive the company believes that the investments it plans to make over the next 3 years will improve the size and the productivity of the salesforce helping to drive revenue growth tupperware s turnaround plan appears very sensible the big question mark is execution if the changes being made do not result in a better salesforce headcount and improved productivity then the company may need to explore a deeper rethink of the brand or business model shoring up the balance sheet in addition to the cost cuts and growth investments announced tupperware will be allocating the remaining savings from its reduced dividend payments to paying down debt and opportunistically repurchasing shares metric financials as of q4 2018 in millions total debt 888 9 2018 adjusted ebitda reported 351 6 debt to ebitda ratio 2 53x source tupperware financial reports advertisement advertisement tupperware carries 888 9 million in total debt and reported 2018 adjusted ebitda of 351 6 million ebitda is a measure of earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is the measure of earnings most commonly used for assessing leverage because it shows a company s capacity to service interest payments taking the ratio of debt to ebitda shows the company has a leverage ratio of 2 53x while tupperware does not have an unsustainable level of indebtedness leverage could become a more serious problem if earnings continue to decline the company is targeting a leverage ratio below 2 0x over the next couple years with 149 million in cash on its balance sheet and over 125 million in cash flow expected for 2019 reducing leverage likely won t be a herculean task the company will be balancing debt reductions with share buybacks last year tupperware announced a 200 million share buyback plan the company executed 100 million of buybacks in 2018 and recommitted to finishing the remaining 100 million of buybacks opportunistically share buybacks give the company more flexibility than dividends sacrificing dividends for a stronger balance sheet is a bitter pill to swallow for shareholders however shoring up the balance sheeting and shifting to a more flexible capital return policy will protect the company ahead of the next economic downturn putting the pieces together the depressed stock price and dividend cut have rattled tupperware s shareholders however there is a silver lining to the story advertisement advertisement much of the weak financial performance over the past quarter and year can be attributed to macroeconomic forces which may abate or even reverse in the future the company specific issues are fixable and tupperware has taken major steps to address the problems the dividend cut is a red flag to the market but it provides the company with the flexibility it needs to turnaround the company and improve its balance sheet despite the dividend cut the stock still yields nearly 4 which could be attractive to prospective investors the deciding factor in the fate of tupperware s stock will be execution the company has reset expectations and laid out a viable recovery plan it will be important to see how the company executes against that plan over the next year to determine if the turnaround will be successful or if greater changes will need to be made more from the motley fool luis sanchez has no

st helier jersey feb 27 2019 globe newswire caledonia mining corporation plc caledonia or the company nyse american cmcl aim cmcl tsx cal announces that following the announcement of a revised monetary policy by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz the export credit incentive eci programme for zimbabwean gold producers will be withdrawn it is estimated this will reduce caledonia s earnings per share calculated on an ifrs basis for 2019 and thereafter by approximately us 5 4 million or 40 to 46 united states cents per share for several years the rbz has operated an eci programme in terms of which zimbabwean gold producers received a premium to the international gold price this premium was initially at a level of 2 5 of gold revenues which has subsequently increased to 10 the eci revenues were received into caledonia s real time gross settlement bank account and were therefore not eligible for remittance outside zimbabwe with a specific allocation of foreign exchange by the rbz the eci revenues were not subject to zimbabwean income tax the removal of the eci programme comes as part of a monetary policy statement which permits bank trading of currency held in local banking system known as rtgs dollars and currency held in foreign currency accounts fca which is capable of being used for payments outside zimbabwe at this stage it is unclear whether this policy will address the increasing inflationary pressure in zimbabwe by creating a transparent and efficient market exchange rate between rtgs dollars and dollars held in fcas the effect on caledonia s earnings per share for 2019 is calculated assuming a gold price of 1 300 for the remainder of the year that blanket achieves the production guidance for 2019 as announced on january 14 2019 of between 53 000 and 56 000

ceo jim nelson james l nelson chief executive officer and president thank you louisa and thanks again to everyone for joining us on today s call it has been a year and a half since i became gnl s ceo and i m very proud of the tremendous progress and growth we ve achieved in our global real estate portfolio it is these achievements that distinguish us in the marketplace and we will continue to build on this positive momentum in 2019 and beyond our team relies on six key drivers which guide management in the operation of global net lease first there is a focus on owning and operating a high quality mission critical diversified portfolio at the end of 2018 gnl s portfolio has grown to over 3 5 billion made up of 342 properties located in the u s and six western european countries this portfolio includes the 23 properties that gnl purchased in 2018 for a combined contract purchase price of 478 million these properties provide additional quality and diversification to gnl s overall portfolio second an important part of gnl s long term strategy is to focus on leases with long durations that are backed by investment grade and credit worthy tenants the company has demonstrated its ability to source and acquire these types of properties which provide safe and durable rental income at the end of 2018 gnl s weighted average lease duration was 8 3 years and it s investment grade and implied investment grade tenant base represents 78 3 of the overall portfolio third gnl pursues a differentiated strategy with both u s and international exposure the company maintains a good balance of u s and western european properties with a 55 7 u s and 44 3 western european mix fourth we utilized proactive asset management to drive long term portfolio value as an example the company recently agreed to opportunistically sell three european assets for a gain and will generate eur72 5 million in proceeds available for reinvestment in the u s and europe fifth an experienced and robust management team the company s capabilities are enhanced through professionals based in london luxembourg charlotte newport and new york with specialists across multiple segments including acquisitions finance accounting legal and property management the company benefits from this group s breadth of knowledge and talent and sixth as a global company we believe gnl has the ability to capitalize on differences between the u s and european markets to deliver superior risk adjusted returns over this past year gnl acquired 478 million of acquisitions with an average cap rate of 7 70 with a focus on u s industrial and distribution properties the company also closed on several different debt financing into both u s and europe including the upsizing of the credit facility by 192 million and the gbp230 million uk debt refinancing at an improved interest rate these financing demonstrate the different sources of capital gnl has access to in order to optimally finance the company s global portfolio now i will begin to review of the key milestones gnl achieved during 2018 chris will then go into more detail regarding our financial performance we anticipate settlement of the outstanding litigation with our former european service provider in connection with this we recorded a 7 4 million reserve which is a one time non recurring expense that affects net income and ffo but has no impact to the company s affo we are extremely pleased with the anticipated resolution turning to several of gnl s key metrics it is clear that the company made significant progress in 2018 from 2017 revenue increased to 282 2 million and 8 8 increase net income attributable to common stockholders was 1 1 million which includes a one time 7 4 million anticipated settlement with our former european service provider adjusted funds from operations or affo increased 4 7 to 147 3 million real estate portfolio increased to over 3 5 billion from less than 3 2 billion investment grade or implied investment grade tenants increased to 78 3 from 76 3 and remaining debt maturity increased to 4 2 years from 3 7 years over the course of 2018 gnl continue to execute on its disciplined long term strategy of acquiring and managing a portfolio of high quality assets net leased on a long term basis to predominantly investment grade and credit worthy tenants in the u s and in western europe during the year gnl acquired 23 properties for a combined contract purchase price of 478 million and sold two properties for gross proceeds of 25 3 million gnl s acquisitions are broken down as

term of 10 1 years and one office property acquired for 54 million with a lease term of 12 years in their first full year within the portfolio these 23 assets will contribute approximately 36 million in additional annualized straight line rental revenue based on existing in place leases the properties were acquired with a combination of cash on hand equity proceeds and debt financing additionally gnl already has 53 million of additional acquisitions under executed loi or psa plus over 200 million of lois currently submitted for potential acquisitions to execute on the company s long term growth strategy gnl accessed the equity capital markets with two common equity offerings and issuances through the atm program in 2018 raising a total of 179 million in common equity capital during

eur11 million premium to the original purchase price of these assets we expect this disposition to result in a recognized gain of approximately 40 million additionally we expect the sale to generate approximately eur72 5 million in net proceeds after debt repayment and the company plans to redeploy those proceeds into accretive acquisitions now i will discuss gnl s fourth quarter activity during the quarter gnl closed on six properties for approximately 212 million these six properties were purchased at a weighted average going in cap rate of 6 67 with a weighted average cap rate of 7 23 and a weighted average remaining lease term of 12 3 years all six of the property served a critical function for the underlying tenants and the buildings are split evenly between industrial and distribution gnl funded the transactions with mortgage debt and cash on hand which includes proceeds from its november public offering the company also entered in a new 10 year 98 5 million mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of 4 85 which was used to pay down the credit facility the quality of gnl s portfolio remains strong in several metrics gnl s investment grade or implied investment grade tenants make up 78 3 of the portfolio up from 76 at the end of 2017 occupancy remained strong at 99 2 at the end of the quarter the geographic mix based on annualized straight line rents sits at 55 7 u s 44 3 europe while gnl s property mix was at 53 office 39 industrial and distribution and a 8 retail the company has continued to increase its exposure to the growing and robust industrial and distribution sector as gnl increased its concentration by 7 of its total portfolio in 2018 gnl s overall portfolio consists of 342 properties and provides predictable consistent cash flow through long term net leases that include contractual rent growth heading into 2019 we will continue to execute on our long term strategy to grow gnl s global and diversified portfolio our demonstrated ability to underwrite transactions with an eye toward long term value is what continues to set gnl apart in the net lease sector with that i ll turn the call over to chris to walk through the operating results in more detail and then i will follow up with some closing remarks chris christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary thanks jim gnl saw improved financial results for both q4 2018 annual and quarterly results in comparison to the prior year for the 2018 year gnl s revenue increased 8 8 to 282 2 million with net income attributable to common stockholders of 1 1 million which includes a one time 7 4 million anticipated settlement with our former european service provider ffo decreased 0 9 to 131 4 million ffo also includes the 7 4 million accrual core ffo increased 10 8 to an 149 1 million and affo was up 4 7 to 147 3 million the company paid common stock dividends to investors of 147 4 million in 2018 up from 142 7 million in 2017 revenues increased primarily due to rental income from acquisitions and rent escalators embedded in existing leases as always a reconciliation of gaap net income to the non gaap measures can be found in our earnings release in the fourth quarter revenue increased 6 9 to 71 2 million on a year over year basis ffo decreased 18 to 28 3 million which included the one time anticipated settlement with our european service provider and our core ffo increased 8 3 to 36 9 million gnl s adjusted funds from operations or affo increased 5 6 to 37 1 million and during the quarter the company paid common stock dividends of 39 1 million i would like to note that gnl s 212 million of acquisitions were all purchased on or after november 14th and four of the six acquisitions were purchased in the second half of december these acquisitions were financed in conjunction with the company s 81 million equity raise in late november 2018 we expect a 2 5 million step up in rental income in q1 2019 or about 0 03 on a per share basis as the company will benefit from the full impact of the 212 million of acquisitions acquired in q4 2018 on the balance sheet gnl ended the fourth quarter with net debt which is debt less cash and cash equivalents of 1 7 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3 1 gnl s weighted average maturity at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4 2 years which is improvement from 3 7 years at the close of the 2017 fourth quarter the components of gnl s debt include 363 9 million on the multi currency revolving credit facility 282 1 million on the term loan and 1 1 billion of outstanding gross mortgage debt this debt was approximately 79 9 fixed rate which is inclusive of floating rate debt with in place interest rate swaps the company has a robust interest coverage ratio of 3 8 times as of december 31st 2018 liquidity was approximately 142 6 million which comprises to 100 3 million of cash on hand and 42 2 million of availability under the credit facility gnl s net debt to enterprise value was 53 3 with an enterprise value of 3 2 billion based on the december 31st 2018 closing share price of 17 62 per common shares and 24 68 per series a preferred shares the net debt to enterprise value would improve to 50 8 if the calculation was based on closing share prices from february 22nd of 19 67 for common shares and 25 17 for preferred shares 2018 was an active year for our accounting and finance teams gnl closed our new debt facilities refinanced in place that an upsized existing facilities across three currencies an amount equal to 165 million eur52 million and gbp230 million financing activity included successfully closed on an eight properties cmbs loan in the amount of 33 million closed an upsizing of its unsecured credit facility of 132 million for the multi currency revolving credit facility portion and eur51 8 million for the senior unsecured term loan facility portion also closed on a gbp230 million syndicated investment facility loan agreement which was secured by all 43 of gnl s properties in the united kingdom this refinancing lowers the cost of borrowings on the uk assets from 3 4 to approximately 3 2 on february 6 2019 gnl entered into a syndicated investment facility loan agreement in the amount of eur74 million the loan is secured by all five finished properties owned by gnl the maturity date of the loan is february 1st 2024 and it bears interest rate at three month euribor plus 1 4 80 of the principal amount of the loan is fixed at 1 8 by the interest rate swap agreement this refinancing significantly lowered the borrowing costs from 2 3 to 1 7 as a quick update to gnl s hedging program we have continued to use our hedging strategy as a way to offset movements in interest rates and local currencies for our european portfolio in regards to currency hedging the company employs disciplined strategy of layering hedges against the two currencies over upcoming quarters to manage some exposure to both currencies with that i ll turn the call back to jim for some closing remarks james l nelson chief executive officer and president thanks chris gnl s portfolio is in great shape with 273 properties in the u s and 69 in the uk and western europe representing 55 7 and 44 3 of rental revenue respectively overall the portfolio was 99 2 leased and as a weighted average 8 3 years with no near term expirations there has been measurable improvement in 2018 across several segments and our steady execution and deliberate focus on high quality acquisitions continues to drive strong results including the following in 2017 gnl acquired 12 properties for 99 million while in 2018 the company acquired 23 properties for nearly 500 million at a going in cap rate of 7 21 and an average cap rate of 7 70 96 of the properties acquired in 2018 include embedded contractual with average annual rent growth of 1 6 per year based on existing in place leases gnl has an attractive and stable 3 1 weighted average cost to debt at year end 2018 along with an improved weighted average remaining lease term of 4 2 years our intentional focus is on building portfolio diversification with a focus on an increased mix of industrial and distribution properties gnl s acquisition activity of nearly 500 million in 2018 led to an increased portfolio concentration of industrial and distribution property as this property type now represents 39 of gnl s portfolio at the end of 2018 up from 32 at year end 2017 the strength of gnl s portfolio is demonstrated by its high level of leases that are leased to or guaranteed by investment grade or implied investment grade tenants as of december 31 2018 that figure had increased to 78 3 up from 72 6 at year end 2015 the year that gnl listed on the new york stock exchange gnl continues to demonstrate a proven ability to source investment opportunities by leveraging direct relationships with landlords and developers to identify off market transactions we believe this allows the company to achieve better than market cap rates at more favorable terms that are generally available this execution generates improved results for the company and its shareholders we will remain proactive and disciplined in our acquisition strategy to identify compelling opportunities to acquire net lease assets with a continued near term focus on u s industrial and distribution facilities we will also remain opportunistic when it comes to selectively adding to our international footprint my last 1 5 years have been exciting and fulfilling and as we move forward toward the future we will continue to drive slow and steady growth to enhance long term value for shareholders with that operator we can open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question today comes from mitch germain with jmp securities please go ahead mitch germain jmp securities analyst thanks for taking question i appreciate it chris if i was to look at i think i saw a leverage based on 4q annualized was 7 9 times but does that include if i looked at the acquisitions as of day one of the quarter and if that s not what would that leverage look like if i assume the full quarter or full year of those acquisitions christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary right so that leverage does not include the acquisitions as if they were on the books as of day one the actual rental income that is reflected in that number is actually less than a third of what the total would be so it s actually 2 5 million more rental income which would be flowing through if they were in place as of the first day of the quarter so it would definitely drop the number from 7 9 too much lower in the 7s mitch germain jmp securities analyst got you got you and i apologize i missed some of your prepared comments where do we stand on liquidity now with regards to your ability to execute on further acquisitions christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary sure so we re actually in a very strong position as of year end we had 100 million in cash 42 million of availability on the credit facility then in january we actually raised 153 million on our atm so with that we then paid down 130 million on the revolver which we can draw as needed we also added some additional properties to our revolver borrowing base which increased our capacity by about 50 million mitch germain jmp securities analyst so what s what s the total capacity of the revolver today in terms of what s the total size and then what s the availability is that a better way to say christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary okay so the total size is up to about roughly 917 million which could fluctuate fluctuate with the fx in terms of where we are with capacity back of the envelop now we have over 250 million mitch germain jmp securities analyst great that s very helpful jim you guys had some real good success in the fourth quarter but even the whole year what changed i mean i think you re probably almost more than four times so what you guys did an acquisition volumes in the year before that what sort of directive what sort of change created the increased activity james l nelson chief executive officer and president well you know we as a strategy for the company we are looking at growing the business doing accretive acquisitions and building a stronger better bigger company so we ve just started executing on all eight cylinders and the acquisition guys found a lot of great stuff we were able to raise money so all things considered everything worked well and we are still moving ahead the way we did last year mitch germain jmp securities analyst great last one for me and again i apologize if i missed it the sale of the asset that was planned for 2019 i believe those in office building in germany is that still on target what created the delay there and where does that stand james l nelson chief executive officer and president we the way we structured the sale was to give us time to have acquisitions in our hand to replace the capital so we look at closing that toward the middle of the year and that will give us time to have a number of acquisitions to put the money back to work very quickly mitch germain jmp securities analyst great and just a follow up on that do you guys ever disclosed the cap rate or the irr on that investment for you guys james l nelson chief executive officer and president we haven t yet mitch germain jmp securities analyst thank you james l nelson chief executive officer and president thanks good to talk to you operator next question comes from bryan maher with b riley fbr please go ahead bryan maher b riley fbr analyst yes good morning james l nelson chief executive officer and president hi bryan bryan maher b riley fbr analyst if you answered partially one of my questions in your closing remarks as to where you re seeing the best opportunities and correct me if i m wrong but it continues to seem to be u s industrial is that really where the focus will be in 2019 james l nelson chief executive officer and president that will be where quite a bit of the focus is yes i mean we are still looking in europe and we underwrite a lot of different types of properties but that is one of our primary focus is to grow that part of our portfolio bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and i m sorry if i missed it but did you give any estimate as to what the acquisition size would be for 2019 in dollar terms james l nelson chief executive officer and president we don t usually give guidance but i think you can take a look back at what we did in 2018 which was a very robust year and we intend to continue in that same vein bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and then just lastly from me and i m really interested in hearing how you think about this when we look at your multiple on ebitda in kind of just under the the mid teens and we look at office reits in the u s trading in the high teens and u s industrial reits trading in the low to mid 20s times and european office trading in the high 20s times ebitda is it frustrating to you with where your stock trades is i guess partially my question but then you continue to issue equity in a kind of low 20s range and so i m trying to figure out how you you kind of rationalize that when i think a case could be made for a mid to high 20s valuation on the stock but you issue stock in the low 20s james l nelson chief executive officer and president well that s where we issued it now because that s where the stock was trading but certainly by having great new analysts like you covering the stock we intend to get the story out to more people and the more people that are aware of the company i think the stock should trade better more people hear the story so i want to thank you for following the company and we do agree with you bryan maher b riley fbr analyst flattery will get you everywhere jim so thank you james l nelson chief executive officer and president okay pal operator operator instructions the next question comes from john massocca with ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst good morning james l nelson chief executive officer and president hi john christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary hi john john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst just trying to kind of i think you touched on a little bit but given all of the equity issuance that happened in january in 4q and potentially also the proceeds you re going to get from the sale of the german asset i mean your leverage is coming down fairly significantly versus where it was even a couple of quarters ago i mean is this kind of a statement of intent to maybe run the company at a lower leverage or is this just really creating kind of essentially pre funding your potential acquisition pipeline for 2019 and that leverage should creep up as maybe some of the things you ve submitted lois on potentially successfully closed on james l nelson chief executive officer and president yes well as you know we re always looking to balance the capital structure so we raised common when we could the market was surprisingly robust last month for the atm so we took advantage of that but we do have a very strong pipeline and we think we can put that money to work fairly quickly john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and kind of with regards to that 200 million out of 53 million we kind of know what it is but that 200 million i mean what maybe the industrial office mix is it 90 10 or something closer to 70 30 i know the primary focus has been industrial but is there some office slipping into that 200 million number james l nelson chief executive officer and president as you know last year we bought an office building for 53 million so that indicates we still if we see a great deal a great tenant long term lease investment grade quality we can execute on it but as we stated our main focus is on industrial distribution we continue to execute on those and i think that you ll see a lot of that going forward john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and then within the existing portfolio obviously lot still up in the air but with a lot of different indicators on brexit i mean any of your existing uk tenants indicated any concerns about their operations or need for the assets they leased from you if there is maybe a hard brexit or brexit is more impactful the kind of that as they look to the risk curve james l nelson chief executive officer and president it s a great question and if you talk to 10 different people you will get 10 different responses on brexit we talked to a lot other people that we work with and i think everybody has a wait and see attitude our assets are performing well we are happy with the assets that we have so i think we ll just wait and see what happens with brexit there may be opportunities that open up for us if there is a hard brexit or but i think we ll wait and see we ll wait and see what happens john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and then one last one as you may be look to kind of refinance some of the other european mortgages you have is the potential kind of benefit you are going to get on rate that you got with the finland s refinancing is that something you would expect on kind of a general basis that something you would expect with additional refinancings you do in europe james l nelson chief executive officer and president in looking at the various rates in the different countries some are lower and some are about the same i think overall we will benefit if you put all of the european financings together we will see a benefit over the previous loans as we saw in the uk john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst in finland i mean is finland maybe typical or is finland kind of an outlier or is it just too hard to tell so vary so much base from country to country james l nelson chief executive officer and president finland was a great rate but remember we re going from individual mortgages to say country specific roughly country specific mortgages so we are getting better rates combining all the properties together and dealing with the bank that way john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that s it from me thank you very much james l nelson chief executive officer and president all right thank you operator the next question is a follow up from bryan maher with b riley please go ahead bryan maher b riley fbr analyst hey jim and chris just two quick follow ups when we look at your leverage it s kind of been hanging out in the low 50s getting a little bit better what is the goal are you comfortable with it hanging out around 50 or do you want to see it get into the mid to high 40s what is your thought process there james l nelson chief executive officer and president well we ve and i think we may have even talked about this before but we look at the quality of our tenants the long term leases the investment grade the high investment grade percentages of our tenants and we re very comfortable with roughly 50 leverage i think that s sort of a rule of thumb when we look at we look at our portfolio we are very very comfortable with where we are and we ll see what happens in the future bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and then my other quick question is when we look at the dividend coverage on a cad payout ratio it s elevated relative to a number of the other reits that we cover not alarmingly so it s a triple net lease situation but where would you like to see that gravitate to as a payout ratio on cad christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think over time it will naturally come down as we add these new accretive properties to the income stream so i think you ll probably see it come down overtime bryan maher b riley fbr analyst right thank you christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary thank you everybody operator this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to james nelson for any closing remarks james l nelson chief executive officer and president yeah just want to thank you all for joining us on today s call there was some great questions and we look forward to this next year with gnl and reporting to you in the next quarter so thank you all for dialing in operator this conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you

for the second straight day investor attention could zero in on capitol hill as fed chair jerome powell takes the mic to address elected officials on the economy he delivered a pretty dovish message yesterday but markets didn t appear to move too much in response other than the powell testimony more below there doesn t appear to be a major theme wednesday as things get started in geopolitics president trump meets with north korea s president today but that arguably hasn t been a market mover lately there s also some tension developing between pakistan and india which could inject a bit of anxiety into things stocks fell yesterday and began the new day with a weaker tone amid mixed action overseas on the earnings front there was some reassuring news from best buy co inc bby this morning the electronics retailer s shares were up 10 in pre market trade after it blew past third party estimates raised its dividend and announced a share buyback program adjusted earnings were 2 72 per share well ahead of the street s expectations according to factset estimates revenue of 14 8 billion was down from a year prior but slightly beat estimates a traditional retailer that still relies on foot traffic bby has been struggling the past year with shares down about 17 before the earnings release lowe s companies inc low shares were also on the rise in pre market trading despite just missing wall street analysts sales estimate the company did beat analyst consensus on earnings per share however and stuck to its 2019 outlook with housing market data generally weak lately shares of home improvement companies like low and home depot inc hd might serve as a barometer for investors weak housing market data continued this week as the pace of home price growth hit a four year low on an annual basis according to the case shiller index reading for the last quarter of 2018 in less impressive earnings news weight watchers international inc wtw shares once soaring with the backing of celebrity spokespeople plunged 35 on the heels of its earnings report the weight loss company was undergoing a revival of sorts but said it had a soft start to 2019 and offered weak guidance still revenue was up 6 to 330 million from a year prior losing steam major u s indices slipped tuesday with a late rally attempt failing to hold and the s p 500 index spx again finishing below 2800 some media reports cited weak home depot hd earnings as the primary instigator but arguably the real problem was a lack of new positive catalysts especially on the china trade front actually there was arguably some good news from overseas tuesday but it didn t seem to get much attention in the markets chances of an abrupt and chaotic brexit receded a bit when prime minister theresa may agreed that parliament should have the option to seek a delay in britain s exit plans according to a new york times report this doesn t necessarily mean things will go more smoothly but it could conceivably push brexit beyond what s now the march 29 deadline giving the markets a little more breathing room the british pound rose on the news while the dollar index continued to retreat from recent highs and is now back to testing the 96 level faangs up again but is anyone paying attention for the third straight day on tuesday faangs looked shiny as four of the five gained ground though gains were mostly light the five stocks all spent much of the day in the green building on progress made friday and monday all five had risen friday and four rose monday a few months ago before the q4 washout this strength in the faangs might have been the leading story of the day however with faangs mostly trailing the s p 500 spx year to date they ve lost their starring role to some extent the narrative has changed over the past few months instead a lot of focus has shifted toward the rally in industrials which fell tuesday but are up 18 since dec 31 what s interesting about this market is the ability of a new group to take leadership it seems like every time the naysayers start questioning whether the rally can continue a sector you didn t count on has stepped in to save the day now there s no guarantee that will keep happening but the way industrials replaced faangs does arguably speak to the market s resilience two of the best performing sectors tuesday were info tech and communication services both of which contain faang stocks the communication services sector could be an interesting area for the rest of 2019 and 2020 given all the competition in the streaming space and the entry of companies like netflix inc nflx into a major film distribution role it shouldn t go unnoticed that roma a film that received 10 academy award nominations was distributed by netflix technical hurdle from a technical perspective tuesday looked like another disappointing day for the bulls after bounding through a number of technical resistance points so far this year the spx seems to be having trouble with the psychological 2800 mark tuesday was the second straight day where the spx traded above that level but then closed below it which technicians might see as a possible sign of weakness and maybe of a rally that s breathing some thin air another level to consider watching is the region around 2814 which the spx neared this week and which is near an intraday high it posted in early november while not every investor watches technical levels it doesn t take too much understanding of support and resistance to see what it might mean if an index keeps bouncing off of one but fails to pierce it yes individual equities are important to watch but sometimes it s equally important to glance up at the overall macro picture because it can influence those individual stocks as well data wise tuesday was another day the housing market might rather forget december housing starts fell more than 11 month over month and were well below analysts consensus projections homebuilding company stocks which have generally been moving higher this year took a step back tuesday however some analysts pointed out that winter can be a slow and choppy time for the industry so perhaps it s worth waiting for spring to get a better picture consumers powell both sound confident looking for a more positive data story it came right after housing starts when consumer confidence for february surprised to the upside this might have partially reflected consumers relief at the end of the government shutdown and strength in the labor market briefing com said it also might give some investors reason to hope for yet another bullish payrolls report at the end of next week it s not universal but people who have jobs often tend to have more confidence about spending fed chairman jerome powell s testimony to congress is scheduled to continue today after powell didn t really make any big waves at the capitol on tuesday see more below in a nutshell powell basically said he continues to see strength in the labor market and didn t sound all that worried about inflation he is concerned about u s debt levels but investors knew that based on his past remarks the market chopped around during powell s testimony but didn t experience any steep drops the yield on the 10 year u s treasury note slipped back under 2 64 near the bottom of its recent range meanwhile the vix continued to climb from recent four month lows tuesday rising back above 15 after falling below 14 last week this combined with the stock market s struggles to climb above resistance and continued strength in treasuries might spell possible caution gathering after weeks of nearly constant rallies across the major stock indices presidential pov someone once called the presidency the bully pulpit meaning it gives one person s voice a lot of influence the reasoning behind that grew pretty evident this week for investors as two tweets by president trump arguably had a big impact on the stock and commodities markets the first was his weekend tweet about delaying a tariff raise on chinese products thanks to trade negotiations going well the shanghai composite rose more than 5 in one day after that announcement the presidential effect occurred for a second time on monday morning when trump tweeted that oil prices were getting too high and warned opec to consider its policy crude subsequently fell 3 and didn t gain back much of that tuesday while this isn t a political column the tweets might be a reminder that more than ever thanks partly to social media it s important to keep one ear turned toward washington to see if anything potentially market moving might be going viral soft touch just over a year ago u s stocks got crushed after a monthly payrolls report showed year over year wage growth near 3 unleashing investor fears of inflation what a difference a year makes as fed chair jerome powell told senators yesterday he s not too concerned about any inflationary impact as wages continue to rise 3 month after month in his question and answer session powell painted the wage growth as a good thing especially with wages growing faster than inflation the fed he said plans to remain patient about policy changes and still expects inflation to be near its 2 goal listening to powell it seems that maybe the fed has realized it can take a different approach after watching inflation stay pretty stable near or even below 2 over the last year despite rising wages or maybe the fed s four rate hikes last year did what it took to keep a lid on price growth even as the economy added jobs at a furious rate and the labor force started to expand a little there s a phrase some economists might use to describe an improving jobs picture accompanied by manageable inflation soft landing one wild card however is that energy prices retreated dramatically late last year removing a huge potential source of inflation pressure crude is up more than 20 from its december lows so the fed is likely to keep an eye on that for signs of a broader price impact mind the gap last year we also heard a lot of concern from economists about the narrowing yield curve which measures the gap between shorter and longer term u s treasury note yields the gap between 10 year and 2 year yields often gets the most attention and it narrowed to single digits as the economy and stock market weakened in q4 some economists worry that a narrowing gap can point toward possible recession and the faltering curve can also weigh on financial sector profits so far this year however the yield curve has retreated from investor consciousness at least a bit and that s in part because it s been so stable as of midday tuesday the gap stood at around 16 basis points not far off of where it s been for some time while that s historically low it s up from the narrowest times last year still some economists would probably like to see it get wider so that the risk of inversion which often accompanies recessions lessens the fed s pause on rate hikes might be helping keep shorter term yields from gaining on longer term ones over the last month the 2 year yield is down 12 basis points while the 10 year has fallen 11 basis points information from tda is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy and is for

ceo jim nelson james l nelson chief executive officer and president thank you louisa and thanks again to everyone for joining us on today s call it has been a year and a half since i became gnl s ceo and i m very proud of the tremendous progress and growth we ve achieved in our global real estate portfolio it is these achievements that distinguish us in the marketplace and we will continue to build on this positive momentum in 2019 and beyond our team relies on six key drivers which guide management in the operation of global net lease first there is a focus on owning and operating a high quality mission critical diversified portfolio at the end of 2018 gnl s portfolio has grown to over 3 5 billion made up of 342 properties located in the u s and six western european countries this portfolio includes the 23 properties that gnl purchased in 2018 for a combined contract purchase price of 478 million these properties provide additional quality and diversification to gnl s overall portfolio second an important part of gnl s long term strategy is to focus on leases with long durations that are backed by investment grade and credit worthy tenants the company has demonstrated its ability to source and acquire these types of properties which provide safe and durable rental income at the end of 2018 gnl s weighted average lease duration was 8 3 years and it s investment grade and implied investment grade tenant base represents 78 3 of the overall portfolio third gnl pursues a differentiated strategy with both u s and international exposure the company maintains a good balance of u s and western european properties with a 55 7 u s and 44 3 western european mix fourth we utilized proactive asset management to drive long term portfolio value as an example the company recently agreed to opportunistically sell three european assets for a gain and will generate eur72 5 million in proceeds available for reinvestment in the u s and europe fifth an experienced and robust management team the company s capabilities are enhanced through professionals based in london luxembourg charlotte newport and new york with specialists across multiple segments including acquisitions finance accounting legal and property management the company benefits from this group s breadth of knowledge and talent and sixth as a global company we believe gnl has the ability to capitalize on differences between the u s and european markets to deliver superior risk adjusted returns over this past year gnl acquired 478 million of acquisitions with an average cap rate of 7 70 with a focus on u s industrial and distribution properties the company also closed on several different debt financing into both u s and europe including the upsizing of the credit facility by 192 million and the gbp230 million uk debt refinancing at an improved interest rate these financing demonstrate the different sources of capital gnl has access to in order to optimally finance the company s global portfolio now i will begin to review of the key milestones gnl achieved during 2018 chris will then go into more detail regarding our financial performance we anticipate settlement of the outstanding litigation with our former european service provider in connection with this we recorded a 7 4 million reserve which is a one time non recurring expense that affects net income and ffo but has no impact to the company s affo we are extremely pleased with the anticipated resolution turning to several of gnl s key metrics it is clear that the company made significant progress in 2018 from 2017 revenue increased to 282 2 million and 8 8 increase net income attributable to common stockholders was 1 1 million which includes a one time 7 4 million anticipated settlement with our former european service provider adjusted funds from operations or affo increased 4 7 to 147 3 million real estate portfolio increased to over 3 5 billion from less than 3 2 billion investment grade or implied investment grade tenants increased to 78 3 from 76 3 and remaining debt maturity increased to 4 2 years from 3 7 years over the course of 2018 gnl continue to execute on its disciplined long term strategy of acquiring and managing a portfolio of high quality assets net leased on a long term basis to predominantly investment grade and credit worthy tenants in the u s and in western europe during the year gnl acquired 23 properties for a combined contract purchase price of 478 million and sold two properties for gross proceeds of 25 3 million gnl s acquisitions are broken down as follows 16 industrial properties acquired for 242 5 million with a weighted average lease term of 12 1 years and six distribution facilities acquired for 181 7 million with a weighted average lease term of 10 1 years and one office property acquired for 54 million with a lease term of 12 years in their first full year within the portfolio these 23 assets will contribute approximately 36 million in additional annualized straight line rental revenue based on existing in place leases the properties were acquired with a combination of cash on hand equity proceeds and debt financing additionally gnl already has 53 million of additional acquisitions under executed loi or psa plus over 200 million of lois currently submitted for potential acquisitions to execute on the company s long term growth strategy gnl accessed the equity capital markets with two common equity offerings and issuances through the atm program in 2018 raising a total of 179 million in common equity capital during 2018 at an average gross price of 20 46 per share the company used these funds to close on 212 million in acquisitions made during the fourth quarter as of 12 31 2018 gnl s total liquidity was 143 million and subsequent to year end gnl raise an additional 153 million in equity capital through its atm program at an average price of 19 69 per share proceeds from the equity issuances will continue to be used to fund new acquisitions and for general corporate purposes as part of our asset management strategy during 2018 gnl disposed of two properties for gross proceeds of 25 3 million which is inclusive of a 3 million lease termination fee the company also entered into a contract to sell three additional properties located in germany for a contract sale price of eur135 million which is an eur11 million premium to the original purchase price of these assets we expect this disposition to result in a recognized gain of approximately 40 million additionally we expect the sale to generate approximately eur72 5 million in net proceeds after debt repayment and the company plans to redeploy those proceeds into accretive acquisitions now i will discuss gnl s fourth quarter activity during the quarter gnl closed on six properties for approximately 212 million these six properties were purchased at a weighted average going in cap rate of 6 67 with a weighted average cap rate of 7 23 and a weighted average remaining lease term of 12 3 years all six of the property served a critical function for the underlying tenants and the buildings are split evenly between industrial and distribution gnl funded the transactions with mortgage debt and cash on hand which includes proceeds from its november public offering the company also entered in a new 10 year 98 5 million mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of 4 85 which was used to pay down the credit facility the quality of gnl s portfolio remains strong in several metrics gnl s investment grade or implied investment grade tenants make up 78 3 of the portfolio up from 76 at the end of 2017 occupancy remained strong at 99 2 at the end of the quarter the geographic mix based on annualized straight line rents sits at 55 7 u s 44 3 europe while gnl s property mix was at 53 office 39 industrial and distribution and a 8 retail the company has continued to increase its exposure to the growing and robust industrial and distribution sector as gnl increased its concentration by 7 of its total portfolio in 2018 gnl s overall portfolio consists of 342 properties and provides predictable consistent cash flow through long term net leases that include contractual rent growth heading into 2019 we will continue to execute on our long term strategy to grow gnl s global and diversified portfolio our demonstrated ability to underwrite transactions with an eye toward long term value is what continues to set gnl apart in the net lease sector with that i ll turn the call over to chris to walk through the operating results in more detail and then i will follow up with some closing remarks chris christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary thanks jim gnl saw improved financial results for both q4 2018 annual and quarterly results in comparison to the prior year for the 2018 year gnl s revenue increased 8 8 to 282 2 million with net income attributable to common stockholders of 1 1 million which includes a one time 7 4 million anticipated settlement with our former european service provider ffo decreased 0 9 to 131 4 million ffo also includes the 7 4 million accrual core ffo increased 10 8 to an 149 1 million and affo was up 4 7 to 147 3 million the company paid common stock dividends to investors of 147 4 million in 2018 up from 142 7 million in 2017 revenues increased primarily due to rental income from acquisitions and rent escalators embedded in existing leases as always a reconciliation of gaap net income to the non gaap measures can be found in our earnings release in the fourth quarter revenue increased 6 9 to 71 2 million on a year over year basis ffo decreased 18 to 28 3 million which included the one time anticipated settlement with our european service provider and our core ffo increased 8 3 to 36 9 million gnl s adjusted funds from operations or affo increased 5 6 to 37 1 million and during the quarter the company paid common stock dividends of 39 1 million i would like to note that gnl s 212 million of acquisitions were all purchased on or after november 14th and four of the six acquisitions were purchased in the second half of december these acquisitions were financed in conjunction with the company s 81 million equity raise in late november 2018 we expect a 2 5 million step up in rental income in q1 2019 or about 0 03 on a per share basis as the company will benefit from the full impact of the 212 million of acquisitions acquired in q4 2018 on the balance sheet gnl ended the fourth quarter with net debt which is debt less cash and cash equivalents of 1 7 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3 1 gnl s weighted average maturity at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4 2 years which is improvement from 3 7 years at the close of the 2017 fourth quarter the components of gnl s debt include 363 9 million on the multi currency revolving credit facility 282 1 million on the term loan and 1 1 billion of outstanding gross mortgage debt this debt was approximately 79 9 fixed rate which is inclusive of floating rate debt with in place interest rate swaps the company has a robust interest coverage ratio of 3 8 times as of december 31st 2018 liquidity was approximately 142 6 million which comprises to 100 3 million of cash on hand and 42 2 million of availability under the credit facility gnl s net debt to enterprise value was 53 3 with an enterprise value of 3 2 billion based on the december 31st 2018 closing share price of 17 62 per common shares and 24 68 per series a preferred shares the net debt to enterprise value would improve to 50 8 if the calculation was based on closing share prices from february 22nd of 19 67 for common shares and 25 17 for preferred shares 2018 was an active year for our accounting and finance teams gnl closed our new debt facilities refinanced in place that an upsized existing facilities across three currencies an amount equal to 165 million eur52 million and gbp230 million financing activity included successfully closed on an eight properties cmbs loan in the amount of 33 million closed an upsizing of its unsecured credit facility of 132 million for the multi currency revolving credit facility portion and eur51 8 million for the senior unsecured term loan facility portion also closed on a gbp230 million syndicated investment facility loan agreement which was secured by all 43 of gnl s properties in the united kingdom this refinancing lowers the cost of borrowings on the uk assets from 3 4 to approximately 3 2 on february 6 2019 gnl entered into a syndicated investment facility loan agreement in the amount of eur74 million the loan is secured by all five finished properties owned by gnl the maturity date of the loan is february 1st 2024 and it bears interest rate at three month euribor plus 1 4 80 of the principal amount of the loan is fixed at 1 8 by the interest rate swap agreement this refinancing significantly lowered the borrowing costs from 2 3 to 1 7 as a quick update to gnl s hedging program we have continued to use our hedging strategy as a way to offset movements in interest rates and local currencies for our european portfolio in regards to currency hedging the company employs disciplined strategy of layering hedges against the two currencies over upcoming quarters to manage some exposure to both currencies with that i ll turn the call back to jim for some closing remarks james l nelson chief executive officer and president thanks chris gnl s portfolio is in great shape with 273 properties in the u s and 69 in the uk and western europe representing 55 7 and 44 3 of rental revenue respectively overall the portfolio was 99 2 leased and as a weighted average 8 3 years with no near term expirations there has been measurable improvement in 2018 across several segments and our steady execution and deliberate focus on high quality acquisitions continues to drive strong results including the following in 2017 gnl acquired 12 properties for 99 million while in 2018 the company acquired 23 properties for nearly 500 million at a going in cap rate of 7 21 and an average cap rate of 7 70 96 of the properties acquired in 2018 include embedded contractual with average annual rent growth of 1 6 per year based on existing in place leases gnl has an attractive and stable 3 1 weighted average cost to debt at year end 2018 along with an improved weighted average remaining lease term of 4 2 years our intentional focus is on building portfolio diversification with a focus on an increased mix of industrial and distribution properties gnl s acquisition activity of nearly 500 million in 2018 led to an increased portfolio concentration of industrial and distribution property as this property type now represents 39 of gnl s portfolio at the end of 2018 up from 32 at year end 2017 the strength of gnl s portfolio is demonstrated by its high level of leases that are leased to or guaranteed by investment grade or implied investment grade tenants as of december 31 2018 that figure had increased to 78 3 up from 72 6 at year end 2015 the year that gnl listed on the new york stock exchange gnl continues to demonstrate a proven ability to source investment opportunities by leveraging direct relationships with landlords and developers to identify off market transactions we believe this allows the company to achieve better than market cap rates at more favorable terms that are generally available this execution generates improved results for the company and its shareholders we will remain proactive and disciplined in our acquisition strategy to identify compelling opportunities to acquire net lease assets with a continued near term focus on u s industrial and distribution facilities we will also remain opportunistic when it comes to selectively adding to our international footprint my last 1 5 years have been exciting and fulfilling and as we move forward toward the future we will continue to drive slow and steady growth to enhance long term value for shareholders with that operator we can open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question today comes from mitch germain with jmp securities please go ahead mitch germain jmp securities analyst thanks for taking question i appreciate it chris if i was to look at i think i saw a leverage based on 4q annualized was 7 9 times but does that include if i looked at the acquisitions as of day one of the quarter and if that s not what would that leverage look like if i assume the full quarter or full year of those acquisitions christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary right so that leverage does not include the acquisitions as if they were on the books as of day one the actual rental income that is reflected in that number is actually less than a third of what the total would be so it s actually 2 5 million more rental income which would be flowing through if they were in place as of the first day of the quarter so it would definitely drop the number from 7 9 too much lower in the 7s mitch germain jmp securities analyst got you got you and i apologize i missed some of your prepared comments where do we stand on liquidity now with regards to your ability to execute on further acquisitions christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary sure so we re actually in a very strong position as of year end we had 100 million in cash 42 million of availability on the credit facility then in january we actually raised 153 million on our atm so with that we then paid down 130 million on the revolver which we can draw as needed we also added some additional properties to our revolver borrowing base which increased our capacity by about 50 million mitch germain jmp securities analyst so what s what s the total capacity of the revolver today in terms of what s the total size and then what s the availability is that a better way to say christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary okay so the total size is up to about roughly 917 million which could fluctuate fluctuate with the fx in terms of where we are with capacity back of the envelop now we have over 250 million mitch germain jmp securities analyst great that s very helpful jim you guys had some real good success in the fourth quarter but even the whole year what changed i mean i think you re probably almost more than four times so what you guys did an acquisition volumes in the year before that what sort of directive what sort of change created the increased activity james l nelson chief executive officer and president well you know we as a strategy for the company we are looking at growing the business doing accretive acquisitions and building a stronger better bigger company so we ve just started executing on all eight cylinders and the acquisition guys found a lot of great stuff we were able to raise money so all things considered everything worked well and we are still moving ahead the way we did last year mitch germain jmp securities analyst great last one for me and again i apologize if i missed it the sale of the asset that was planned for 2019 i believe those in office building in germany is that still on target what created the delay there and where does that stand james l nelson chief executive officer and president we the way we structured the sale was to give us time to have acquisitions in our hand to replace the capital so we look at closing that toward the middle of the year and that will give us time to have a number of acquisitions to put the money back to work very quickly mitch germain jmp securities analyst great and just a follow up on that do you guys ever disclosed the cap rate or the irr on that investment for you guys james l nelson chief executive officer and president we haven t yet mitch germain jmp securities analyst thank you james l nelson chief executive officer and president thanks good to talk to you operator next question comes from bryan maher with b riley fbr please go ahead bryan maher b riley fbr analyst yes good morning james l nelson chief executive officer and president hi bryan bryan maher b riley fbr analyst if you answered partially one of my questions in your closing remarks as to where you re seeing the best opportunities and correct me if i m wrong but it continues to seem to be u s industrial is that really where the focus will be in 2019 james l nelson chief executive officer and president that will be where quite a bit of the focus is yes i mean we are still looking in europe and we underwrite a lot of different types of properties but that is one of our primary focus is to grow that part of our portfolio bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and i m sorry if i missed it but did you give any estimate as to what the acquisition size would be for 2019 in dollar terms james l nelson chief executive officer and president we don t usually give guidance but i think you can take a look back at what we did in 2018 which was a very robust year and we intend to continue in that same vein bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and then just lastly from me and i m really interested in hearing how you think about this when we look at your multiple on ebitda in kind of just under the the mid teens and we look at office reits in the u s trading in the high teens and u s industrial reits trading in the low to mid 20s times and european office trading in the high 20s times ebitda is it frustrating to you with where your stock trades is i guess partially my question but then you continue to issue equity in a kind of low 20s range and so i m trying to figure out how you you kind of rationalize that when i think a case could be made for a mid to high 20s valuation on the stock but you issue stock in the low 20s james l nelson chief executive officer and president well that s where we issued it now because that s where the stock was trading but certainly by having great new analysts like you covering the stock we intend to get the story out to more people and the more people that are aware of the company i think the stock should trade better more people hear the story so i want to thank you for following the company and we do agree with you bryan maher b riley fbr analyst flattery will get you everywhere jim so thank you james l nelson chief executive officer and president okay pal operator operator instructions the next question comes from john massocca with ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst good morning james l nelson chief executive officer and president hi john christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary hi john john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst just trying to kind of i think you touched on a little bit but given all of the equity issuance that happened in january in 4q and potentially also the proceeds you re going to get from the sale of the german asset i mean your leverage is coming down fairly significantly versus where it was even a couple of quarters ago i mean is this kind of a statement of intent to maybe run the company at a lower leverage or is this just really creating kind of essentially pre funding your potential acquisition pipeline for 2019 and that leverage should creep up as maybe some of the things you ve submitted lois on potentially successfully closed on james l nelson chief executive officer and president yes well as you know we re always looking to balance the capital structure so we raised common when we could the market was surprisingly robust last month for the atm so we took advantage of that but we do have a very strong pipeline and we think we can put that money to work fairly quickly john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and kind of with regards to that 200 million out of 53 million we kind of know what it is but that 200 million i mean what maybe the industrial office mix is it 90 10 or something closer to 70 30 i know the primary focus has been industrial but is there some office slipping into that 200 million number james l nelson chief executive officer and president as you know last year we bought an office building for 53 million so that indicates we still if we see a great deal a great tenant long term lease investment grade quality we can execute on it but as we stated our main focus is on industrial distribution we continue to execute on those and i think that you ll see a lot of that going forward john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and then within the existing portfolio obviously lot still up in the air but with a lot of different indicators on brexit i mean any of your existing uk tenants indicated any concerns about their operations or need for the assets they leased from you if there is maybe a hard brexit or brexit is more impactful the kind of that as they look to the risk curve james l nelson chief executive officer and president it s a great question and if you talk to 10 different people you will get 10 different responses on brexit we talked to a lot other people that we work with and i think everybody has a wait and see attitude our assets are performing well we are happy with the assets that we have so i think we ll just wait and see what happens with brexit there may be opportunities that open up for us if there is a hard brexit or but i think we ll wait and see we ll wait and see what happens john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and then one last one as you may be look to kind of refinance some of the other european mortgages you have is the potential kind of benefit you are going to get on rate that you got with the finland s refinancing is that something you would expect on kind of a general basis that something you would expect with additional refinancings you do in europe james l nelson chief executive officer and president in looking at the various rates in the different countries some are lower and some are about the same i think overall we will benefit if you put all of the european financings together we will see a benefit over the previous loans as we saw in the uk john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst in finland i mean is finland maybe typical or is finland kind of an outlier or is it just too hard to tell so vary so much base from country to country james l nelson chief executive officer and president finland was a great rate but remember we re going from individual mortgages to say country specific roughly country specific mortgages so we are getting better rates combining all the properties together and dealing with the bank that way john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that s it from me thank you very much james l nelson chief executive officer and president all right thank you operator the next question is a follow up from bryan maher with b riley please go ahead bryan maher b riley fbr analyst hey jim and chris just two quick follow ups when we look at your leverage it s kind of been hanging out in the low 50s getting a little bit better what is the goal are you comfortable with it hanging out around 50 or do you want to see it get into the mid to high 40s what is your thought process there james l nelson chief executive officer and president well we ve and i think we may have even talked about this before but we look at the quality of our tenants the long term leases the investment grade the high investment grade percentages of our tenants and we re very comfortable with roughly 50 leverage i think that s sort of a rule of thumb when we look at we look at our portfolio we are very very comfortable with where we are and we ll see what happens in the future bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and then my other quick question is when we look at the dividend coverage on a cad payout ratio it s elevated relative to a number of the other reits that we cover not alarmingly so it s a triple net lease situation but where would you like to see that gravitate to as a payout ratio on cad christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think over time it will naturally come down as we add these new accretive properties to the income stream so i think you ll probably see it come down overtime bryan maher b riley fbr analyst right thank you christopher masterson chief financial officer treasurer and secretary thank you everybody operator this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to james nelson for any closing remarks james l nelson chief executive officer and president yeah just want to thank you all for joining us on today s call there was some great questions and we look

release and on our website i caution you that many statements on this call are forward looking based on assumptions about the economy world events housing and financial markets and many other factors beyond our control that could significantly affect future results those listening on the web can email questions to fiscal year 2019 s first quarter results were strong with earnings per share of 0 76 pre tax earnings rising 15 home sales revenue increasing 12 and home sales gross margin improving 50 basis points compared to one year ago fiscal year 2019 s first quarter pre tax income was the highest q1 in over a decade our first quarter contracts were down 31 in dollars and 24 in units we attribute this decline to a difficult year over year comparison contracts were up 36 in dollars and 20 in units in fiscal 2018 s first quarter and the industrywide slowdown that began in the second half of 2018 california s drop was the most dramatic with contracts down 62 against a difficult comparison of up 72 in fiscal year 2018 s first quarter some of this was due to market softening and some was attributable to mix and the life cycle of certain communities companywide on a per community basis contracts tracked more closely to fiscal year 2016 and 2017 s first quarter which were still quite healthy than to the more robust fiscal year 2018 s first quarter although we experienced a year over year decline in contracts each month of the first quarter the decline decreased as the quarter progressed non binding reservation deposits for the first three weeks of february are behind last year but we are encouraged by improving demand trends during the month and especially by our past week s deposits which exceeded last year s same week this is only one week worth of data but it is an important week historically one of the biggest sales weeks of the year nationally the economy remains healthy unemployment is low and housing supply is still tight many of our potential customers have benefited from a strong stock market and enjoyed increased equity in their existing homes mortgage rates have recently decreased to their lowest levels in a year these factors are all generally positive for the homebuilding sector given our focus on the upscale market our strategy has always been to acquire the best land in the most attractive locations we evaluate each community weekly to carefully balance sales pace and home price with our unique land position we intend to continue this balanced approach with our strong balance sheet we continue to evaluate attractive land new markets and builder acquisitions as we pursue our strategy of diversifying our product lines and geographic footprint we recently announced our entry into the metro salt lake city utah and portland oregon markets with our first communities in both markets planned to open this spring we are excited about these markets as they represent our continued expansion in the west our apartment business continues to grow in fiscal year 19 s first quarter we announced three new joint ventures to develop luxury apartment communities in westchester new york atlanta and frisco square a suburb of dallas total cost for the three communities will be about 270 million to build about 1 020 units because we develop our multifamily platform with partners and use project construction loans for about 65 of the cost toll brothers total investment across the three communities is about 24 million we generally get fees and promotes to increase our returns and on occasion we may recognize an upfront gain on the sale of land into the joint venture in q1 we recognized an 8 4 million gain from such a transaction this is a great stand alone business and even better serves as a complement to our for sale homebuilding business we currently have over 18 000 apartment units in various stages of development or lease up we are proud of our tremendous brand this quarter we were once again named by fortune magazine as the world s most admired home building company this is the fifth consecutive year we have been so honored we thank the tremendous team of toll brothers associates who make these recognitions possible with our well located land strong brand and wide variety of communities we believe we are well positioned now let me turn it over to marty martin p connor chief financial officer thanks doug before i address the specifics of this quarter i do want to note that a reconciliation of the non gaap measures referenced during today s discussion to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the back of yesterday s release we exceeded our expectations for earnings this quarter our pre tax income rose 15 on a home sale revenue increase of 12 home sales gross margin came in 50 basis points better than a year ago driven primarily by solid operations and favorable mix interest expense through cost of sales was 2 6 of home sales revenues down 30 basis points compared to a year ago impairments remained modest at 7 6 million in fiscal year 2019 s first quarter we had an sg a margin of 12 3 which is a 110 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2018 s first quarter the improved q1 sg a margin reflects increased revenue and good cost control during the quarter we recognized an 8 4 million net gain on the sale of land to into an apartment joint venture that doug just mentioned and we also had a 12 million gain on the disposition of a golf course we remain focused on maintaining our conservative balance sheet with great liquidity low leverage and a long dated maturity profile we ended fiscal year 2019 s first quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 42 7 on a gross basis and a net debt to capital ratio of 36 both compared to 44 2 and 40 1 at fiscal year 2018 s first quarter end we had more than 1 9 billion of untapped cash and available credit facilities at quarter end our weighted average debt maturity is 5 2 years our weighted average interest rate is 4 65 and we have only 250 million of maturities due in the next 36 months our book value per share at fiscal year 2019 s first quarter end was 33 04 our highest ever and it s up from 32 57 last quarter we are well positioned to take advantage of land opportunities to make acquisitions to reduce our debt or to invest in our company through further share repurchases here s our forward looking income statement guidance for the second quarter of 2019 we expect deliveries of between 1 650 and 1 850 units with an average delivered price of between 860 000 and 890 000 we expect adjusted home sales gross margin of approximately 23 1 of home sales revenues and sg a as a percentage of second quarter home sales revenues of approximately 11 3 we expect other income income from unconsolidated entities and land sales gross profit of approximately 13 million in total we expect the tax rate of approximately 27 5 we are pleased that our community count has grown from 295 a year ago to 317 at the first quarter end and we expect modest community count growth through the balance of the year lastly we expect interest expense to cost of sales to be approximately 2 7 and our weighted average share count for the second quarter to be approximately 148 million shares now let me turn it back to doug douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you marty nicole let s open it up to questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from nishu sood of deutsche bank please go ahead nishu sood deutsche bank analyst thank you i wanted to ask first about you mentioned that the year over year pace the decline lessened as the quarter went on month by month and then also if you re looking at the non binding reservations in february those improved as well can you just give us some numbers around those potentially just to understand where we might be currently douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer nishu thanks for the question i m sorry but we re not going to get into the specifics of the numbers we mentioned a few years ago that we would certainly give some flavor but we re going to get off giving week to week month to month numbers so i think we ve explained it accurately which is each month of the quarter the decrease lessened and for february while we are behind after three weeks a year ago we are encouraged by this past week which exceeded last year nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it may be thinking about it a different way then given that your quarter and in february here as well have covered the period where there has been quite a bit of rate volatility can you talk about your thoughts perhaps about how the movement in rates has affected your buyer and the lessening decline that you re talking about douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so we had a huge move down in rates in q1 the quarter started with a five and an eight rate and the quarter ended with a four and a half rate i m talking about a 30 year fixed conforming no point mortgage that s obviously a dramatic decrease coupled with that the messaging out of the fed that they were going to probably slowdown or eliminate rate increases throughout 19 so i think the combination of the decrease in the rate and the commentary on what was coming was certainly encouraging we absolutely felt on improvement in the quality of traffic in the interest of our buyers i think sales was pretty down through the fall and when surveyed more recently they re excited they feel like a solid spring season is upon them and i think one of the primary drivers of that is that decrease in rates that i talked about martin p connor chief financial officer got it got it and just in terms of incentives can you also just talk about through this bout of volatility obviously happened at a seasonally slow period of time and rates have come back your willingness to use incentives maybe you could just discuss how you re thinking about that and then also the competitive environment in terms of incentives please douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so as we mentioned earlier on this call as i mentioned we buy land in main and main we believe most of our land is unique we look at every community when it comes to pricing pricing of course includes incentives to evaluate what should be done by community and i think we do a very good job of thoughtfully balancing price with pace and with the quality of the land our incentive right now is 3 1 of our sales price and it went up very very modestly as an average nationwide this quarter versus prior quarters nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from stephen kim of evercore isi please go ahead stephen kim evercore isi analyst yes thanks very much guys i just wanted to ask a question regarding your brand and the flexibility of the toll brothers brand is that particularly as it relates to the ability to move it down market and maintain the integrity of the aspirational aspect of the brand can you just give a sense for how flexible you think you can be maybe in terms of putting it in context of price points and what gives you the confidence that you can take it down that far while maintaining the cash that it s always had douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve as you know as we ve talked about we have had and will continue to have a great variety in the price point of our communities from new york city and california that are obviously multi million to jacksonville and boise and other locations that are down in the 300 000 400 000 500 000 i am very confident that we can continue our great brand as we introduce more lower priced communities first of all there won t be that many in the scheme of things right we have 300 to 350 communities and we re talking about something that will probably be less than 10 but more importantly the quality still of the architecture the sales center the sales managers the design and decorating of the home the websites the way we treat our customer the customer experience i am very confident after having watched it be launched in places like phoenix where our average price was up in the 800 000 and we have a new offering down into the threes ph that is doing terrifically well where people are delighted to be buying the toll brothers home in the threes and it s still different from what they re getting from other buyers or other builders in the threes because it s brought to you by toll brothers so it s a good question it s a fair question we re obviously aware of it but i am very confident that we can continue on this business strategy without any dilution to the great toll brand we are building apartments under the toll brothers apartment living name we re building student housing under the toll brothers campus living name it s all condo quality in terms of residents clubs and pools on the roof and finishes of the units themselves and we re actually leveraging the toll brand into that business and never once have i heard a comment out of anybody in the sales office that a buyer was concerned because they saw that we re now in luxury apartments so i m confident we can be wider in scope but still focus on what got us here which is great luxury and just expand it a bit without any issues stephen east wells fargo securities analyst great now i appreciate that full answer second question i had is maybe one more for marty the gross margin in the sg a both kind of surprised us in favorable directions i was kind of curious if you could maybe just tease out was there anything there that would explain why they performed better here in the last when we see the results here a few months after you last spoke martin p connor chief financial officer sure so gross margin essentially remained flat with the fourth quarter i think to address your question specifically the ops team did very well during the quarter and we saw our house costs come in a little bit lower than projected we also benefited a bit from favorable mix including more california deliveries than expected and as it relates to sg a i think we had very efficient cost control from the corporate level as well as out in the field and we had more revenue than we expected stephen east wells fargo securities analyst well do do it every time thanks very much guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you steve operator our next question comes from stephen east of wells fargo please go ahead stephen east wells fargo securities analyst thank you good morning guys doug talking about your progression you ve talked about the recent week i know you don t want to put numbers around it so we ll stay away from that but i guess i m more interested when you look at some of your big markets california the mid atlantic mid atlantic was a big positive surprise in the quarter i just want to understand how those progressed both in the quarter and in february douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so mid atlantic stephen was driven primarily by virginia which is a very large and important market for toll and it s clicked ph the government shutdown didn t have any impact on buyer sentiment we have a terrific management team down there that has redesigned a lot of the communities the product and i m just really proud of how they re operating and the market demand is very solid and that was the primary driver for the good results your question is more specific as to sort of month to month within the quarter it similar to my commentary on the company which is that it improved month to month throughout the quarter and the same is through february stephen east wells fargo securities analyst okay douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer california as i mentioned in my prepared comments it s a really tough comp california was up 72 first quarter of 18 versus 17 and last year we had a number of communities that had just recently opened that had huge pent up demand at the openings i mean we had hundreds and hundreds of people that had already been pre approved for mortgages before we even opened the doors and this five communities out there three in the north and two in the south that combined the 259 contracts a year ago compared to 58 this quarter and when we study those five communities alone they were all new openings they all had huge pent up demand with all these pre qualified buyers waiting for our launch today they are further into the life cycle of the community the backlogs have built so the delivery times have gotten longer we ve obviously had price increases there is still solid demand and that demand has improved through february but it s very different to what it was like a year ago when they had just recently opened stephen east wells fargo securities analyst fair enough all right that s really helpful there and then you were talking a little bit about strategy if i can come back to it i guess a two part question one how important is m a when you look at it moving forward and what are you really wanting to accomplish with it and then you ve got a lot of different initiatives and you went through some of them but gibraltar student housing apartment single family for rent you know hitting the entry level in the active adult as you look at your mix of business where do you want to invest more dollars more time more and then where do you want to pull back a little bit if any of those varied efforts that you have going on douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so the first part was m a and we re interested we have an m a team that that s all they do and right now i d say we probably have as good or better deal flow than we had last year we looked at 30 builders last year we didn t buy any but there was a handful that we re interested in and i d say we re on pace for that or better and nothing certainly to announce but we re in action and the m a market appears to be pretty robust we use m a to enter a new market and we may use m a to enter a different product line or price point those would be the two strategies behind it as for the second part of your question which was all the different business lines that we are now in i m really happy with all of it i mentioned on my prepared comments how delighted i am with and we are with the apartment business the single family for rent is new but it appears to be something that we will be very exciting gibraltar you know it s small right now i mean that company was built to buy distressed portfolios of loans from banks and be a workout restructuring firm it s now a land bank firm we ve had better markets and that team is in place for good markets and bad either land bank or become a workout restructuring firm so you asked has anything shed or downsized absolutely not our primary focus just to finish your questions is still our core luxury homebuilding business that s what gets us up every day and that s where we re going to spend most of our money and be most focused stephen east wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator our next question comes from alan ratner of zelman associates please go ahead alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions first question i believe this time of year in february you guys typically do your national sales event and in the past i think doug you ve kind of downplayed the impact of that in terms of margin but just curious when you look at your improvement in the non binding deposits can you talk about how this year s sales event compared to the last few years and tying on to that just wanted to confirm the 3 1 incentive number is that on orders or closings douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer orders alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst got it douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so the national sales event we do four national sales events every year i guess it s our version of inaudible december to remember it s something that s something that we ve worked hard at and works well and we re able to bring sort of national marketing to it it is a combination of some i d say repurposed incentives in the field and then vendor incentives that are kicked in during these events that is not toll dollars but is the opportunity to upgrade flooring upgrade kitchen cabinets upgrade plumbing fixtures et cetera where the vendors participate with us because they want our backlogs to grow just as we do and the timing of the events last year to this year lined up the february event is our biggest because it s sort of launches the spring selling season in terms of a comparison to a year ago it was slower than last year for the same reasons i gave that overall february to date has been slower and it was more similar to what we saw in the prior year we feel good about where we are right now and we re delighted with the last week of the sales event and how strong the deposits were alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst right i appreciate that doug and then second question maybe for marty obviously only given one quarter worth of guidance but your backlog gives you pretty good visibility to the back half of the year as well so any chance you can just directionally talk about when you look at the homes in backlog expected to deliver beyond 2q is the margin on those homes materially different than the 23 1 you re currently guiding for in 2q martin p connor chief financial officer i think we just weren t comfortable going beyond the quarter at this point alan we ve seen a lot of changes in the marketplace over the last three to six months between demand and interest rates et cetera as it relates to the margin in our backlog i think we just delivered margin that was consistent with three months ago s margin we ve given guidance for three months from now i wouldn t suspect that there s anything dramatically different than the guidance we ve given but we don t want to get any more specific than that alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst okay that s helpful thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from michael rehaut of jpmorgan securities please go ahead michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thanks good morning everyone douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst first question i had was kind of following in on the incentives and the gross margins you re able to be roughly 50 bps ahead of last year in this first quarter and are looking for a similar year over year improvement in 2q with the incentives you said i guess up only slightly on orders in the first quarter perhaps you could kind of describe your pace over price strategy it seems like there is a decent differentiation between yourselves and perhaps some of the other builders that got a lot more aggressive on incentives in the past several months in the face of the slowdown so given your price point given your positioning it seems like you just kind of took at the recent volatility and decided to hold margin over pace is that a fair assessment or and maybe just kind of talk broadly to the approach douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure michael so i had mentioned on the last call that we didn t feel like the months of november december and most of january were months where you would chase sales through big increases in incentives because it s a slow time of the year but that we would reevaluate as the spring season was beginning and i think that is part of what you ve seen and we ll see how the spring season continues to develop and we ve given plenty of commentary already on the start of that season the one difference between toll and many of the other builders is we re not spec builder we don t have finished inventory that is sitting there and needs to move because it s been built you know you can sit on ground and cut the grass and pay the taxes and it s not all that painful but when you re sitting on a finished home you got to make a decision every week inaudible years ago on a finished spec in every week it s sitting there one more week guys what are we going to do we re going to drop the price one more week we got to drop the price it is completed martin p connor chief financial officer and it s difference between having 0 20 of your revenue dollar invested and 0 80 your revenue dollar invested douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so i think that is one significant difference between our business model and some of the other builders we talked about endlessly our land being unique hard to replace and in those that s not everywhere but in those locations we will be more deliberate and more thoughtful on the balance between pace and price michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst all right i appreciate it i guess secondly on the land market the recent pause we ve heard in generally this would apply to perhaps different price points but maybe a touch of softening here or there maybe a little bit of retrading maybe a little bit of easing on some terms have you seen any of that in your core markets and perhaps given your approach going to step in here or there if you ve seen any more opportunities come up in the last few months douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer not really the land market generally lags far behind the overall housing market until land sellers start feeling some pain start feeling pressure they generally stand pretty firm in limited cases we ve had some opportunities to renegotiate some terms but it s still a pretty robust land market out there there is still a lot of competition we have been careful and conservative and certainly tightened some underwriting in certain areas but i wouldn t say there s been any significant amount of retrading or renegotiation with land sellers michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from john lovallo of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions the first one marty the second quarter sg a as a percentage of sales guide of 11 3 seems a bit high just given the fact that your outlook appears to kind of call for flattish revenue on a year over year basis and that would be a pretty good step up on a year over year basis in sg a so anything one time in there that may be shifted from the first quarter into second quarter or how should we think about that outlook martin p connor chief financial officer no i don t think there s anything one time in there i think our g a is going to be almost within 1 million or 2 million in terms of absolute dollars and then the s components offer the touch john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and that would actually fit into the second question here in terms of i think it was last quarter you guys talked about outside realtor commissions being a little bit elevated versus history or at least versus the fourth quarter how did those trend in the first quarter martin p connor chief financial officer i don t think there was any change john in outside realtor commissions and remember that our outside realtor commissions are in our cost of goods sold it s our inside sales teams that are in our s for sg a john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay thank you guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from susan maklari of credit suisse please go ahead susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning susan maklari credit suisse analyst my first question is around you ve spoken in the past about perhaps some easing on the labor side of things which could help us as we think about as this year coming together can you just give us an update on what you re seeing from that front douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure we had modest decrease in building costs in q1 in certain markets we are hearing of contractors are green to some modest price concessions because they have slowed down which is typical of what we see when it s all demand and supply driven so they built up their teams and as our sales slowed a bit they had employees that were not as busy and now we ve had some modest opportunities to take the price down i think that will continue at least for a quarter or two as the sales over the summer and the fall start feeding through into construction our longer term we ll have to see where the markets are but it does appear that we will at least stop the increases and we have some modest decreases martin p connor chief financial officer and that stability and decrease that we ve been able to achieve this quarter shows up in our income statement nine months from now not douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer right susan maklari credit suisse analyst yeah ok my next question is around can you talk to some of the attributes of salt lake and portland what do you found attractive about getting into those markets and why you decided to go greenfield there versus maybe approaching it from an m a perspective douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we looked hard at m a opportunities we got close in one of those markets and so as we were looking we first study a market and decide we want to be here and then we look at how we re going to get there and as we re looking to buy a builder we re also putting a management team in place and looking to buy land so in both locations as we are in the early stages looking at m a opportunities we are beginning to buy land since we have not yet bought a builder in either market and i don t i m not suggesting there s anything cooking we now have a handful of land owned or controlled in both markets the management team is in place models the road is going in models being built so there is the strategy on whether it s m a or greenfield i mean if m a doesn t work we go with greenfield the what we liked about the markets we ve looked at portland from the perspective of the seattle team i guess ever since we got into seattle which is now about six years ago and have been studying and studying that market and to us it s a little it s a mini seattle that is only a couple of hours away it has great job growth it has some limitations on supply because of some pretty tough entitlements and development zones and that s right up our alley because we like markets that have difficult are difficult to get land entitled because we have the patience and the wherewithal to stick with it and when you get it it s gold a lot of the architecture can come right out of seattle our management team has moved down from seattle and so what i m describing i think is a natural progression out of our great success that we ve had in seattle salt lake city is a market we looked at for more than a decade it has changed dramatically in the last three to four years in terms of the diversity of businesses the economy growth it has become a very desirable place to live whether it be as a family moving up and working and what they now call the silicon slope because every city of course has to have a silicon something or whether it s move down location because of the lifestyle associated with salt lake and the mountain towns around it so we re really excited about both opportunities both markets and they will start out slower because they re greenfield but that can also be a more cautious way to go and i am very happy with the land we have the teams we have and stay tuned because we ll open in both locations this spring susan maklari credit suisse analyst all right thanks for all that color good luck douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you susan operator our next question comes from mike dahl of rbc capital markets please go ahead mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and all of the details so far douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst i wanted to ask about just the thoughts on where you see the business at a bit of a higher level i know you re not giving the guidance but clearly some market softness but i think doug overall what you re also speaking to is just a normalization particularly in a place like california where you described kind of some super normal trends that you re comping against so if we re thinking about kind of what you see as quote unquote more normal absorption for this type of market 15 16 17 as we re doing around two sales a month ist that about where you think the market is settling in at do you think there is opportunity for upside and if so how much of that is kind of your mix initiatives versus market recovery douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer mike i can t answer you specifically because i don t have that crystal ball i think i have properly described the difference between this first quarter and the last year i ve also explained that 17 was a really solid year in california and that s what 19 felt more like what i will say is i think we re positioned well with the communities we have and with the future land the land that we own that will become future communities so we re going to have community count growth add in california because of the land that we own and i am confident that like i said we are well positioned last year was a pretty unique year just in terms of the number of communities we opened within a relatively short time frame that had terrific pent up demand at the opening that s not to say that couldn t be repeated but it was certainly a unique year but overall we are positioned well with our holdings and with our brand and i feel good about our future out there mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay got it understood my second question maybe for marty i know that jv land and other category is pretty lumpy and you described some of the contributions to the quarter is there any i think you guys did about 150 million in the full year of 2018 any color you could give us on directionally or magnitude of what to expect for the balance of 2019 beyond the 13 million in 2q martin p connor chief financial officer sure so i think if we walk backwards a little bit last year we did do about 148 million we did around 167 million the year before that which was significantly influenced by our peer house project in brooklyn and the years before that we were right around the 100 million for two or three years in a row so i think we ve mentioned this part of our business as being important to us and being at some sustainable level right now i d put that sustainable level somewhere north of 100 million for this year and south of 150 million for this year this next upcoming quarters is going to be a little bit lower than a pro rata piece of that just because of the lack of any particular transactions that we currently have on the drawing board expected the close mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you operator our next question comes from ken zener of keybanc please go ahead kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning everybody douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst doug and marty obviously i heard read your comments about sequential orders and all that stuff so we will just let that sit my question is more around how your backlog margin in california which is obviously part of your one forward quarter guidance plays out but how that also interacts with what we re seeing as the lower orders from that area and i focus on california because ebit margin i think for fy 18 it s pretty a case 25 versus 15 ebit how you guys describe it but i m just trying to think about how that high margin contribution plays out within the one quarter forward guidance but also how it can play out structurally right two and three quarters down is that order orders begin to kind of flow into there i m trying to think structurally how that can play out any help there would be appreciated thank you martin p connor chief financial officer yeah ken it s marty i think we haven t given much in terms of guidance for the balance of the year but as it relates to your specific question in california i think the backlog we have gives us visibility into some level of stability in california deliveries for the balance of the year kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst you re saying for delivery i m just trying to see if it s as simple as looking at the margin contribution based on kind of what the orders might suggest about martin p connor chief financial officer i would technical difficulty unidentified participant analyst hi thank you for taking my questions i just wanted to look at the overall order asp you know 844 000 obviously there s a lot of mix going on and you re still calling for a 860 000 to 890 000 in the second quarter but just given kind of the recent sales trends and asps on this sales how should we think about trending delivered asps in the second half of this year thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so i think it s helpful to recognize that we sell homes from 300 000 to 3 million and so the movement in any particular quarter of either average delivered price or average selling price is really driven by mix predominantly not price increases or price incentives and so as we look across the balance of the year i think the best estimate you can use is the approximately 900 000 sales price sits in our backlog unidentified participant analyst okay i appreciate that and then secondly just to kind of follow up on the last question because it seems clear and i think marty you mentioned it earlier that california was obviously a benefit from a mix perspective in the first quarter and that would seem to continue in the second quarter but just given that the past two quarters of decline on the order side is it fair to assume that california would be a lower mix as a percentage of revenues in the second half of this year and accordingly what would that mean for margins thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer i think your presumption is directionally accurate but your timeframe is off i think you re going to get into next year before the california volume through the income statement is impactful to margins unidentified participant analyst okay thanks for the detail good luck douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from scott schrier of citi please go ahead scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask about the timing of closings understanding you came in toward the higher end of your guidance for and the next quarter it looks like the guide is a little lower than maybe what analysts were expecting so i m curious was there anything in there that happened understanding 1q 18 was a big orders quarter in your cycle times but was there anything in terms of cycle times or regional implications that we should be considering from the closings timing martin p connor chief financial officer scott i m not sure i can point to anything in particular i do know that the nature of the buildings we are constructing the attached product we are constructing in northern california provides a bit longer backlog and some of the detached single family product around the country so i would say there is some impact of longer cycle times not necessarily abnormally long or longer than our expectations in northern california just because of the 24 and 36 unit buildings that need to be completed before you can deliver one year scott schrier citi analyst got it and then can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the design studios and lot premiums and design studio option premiums and things like that douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so as you know we have almost 30 now design studios around the country in each division where the client goes to pick all their finishes and we encourage that process it s a major part of what distinguishes toll from other builders our upgrades i m not this is not a number just for design studio because some of it is structural changes that occur at the sales center at the community but we are still running at about 160 000 of upgrades which is about 20 of the home price and that number has not changed scott schrier citi analyst got it okay so no real change given market conditions or anything in buyers appetite for options basically douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer that s correct scott schrier citi analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from jade rahmani of kbw please go ahead jade rahmani kbw analyst thank you very much can you provide any additional information on the single family rental investment what s the magnitude and scope of the investment and is it investment in another company which has been reported in the media do you expect to grow it et cetera any color would be helpful douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we would love to give some color but we must apologize that we are under confidentiality at the moment and cannot discuss it so what you read in any builder magazines or elsewhere it did not come from us and we can t comment on it jade rahmani kbw analyst okay just separately in terms of operations can you comment on where current cycle times are running douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer the range and it s so community specific is six or seven to 12 months and again it depends on the size of the home the extent of the backlog the trade base the depth of the trade base but that is the general range martin p connor chief financial officer i think in a perfect world it would be three to four weeks shorter than it is right now but labor constraints have that extended the three or four weeks i mentioned but i think it s the same three or four weeks we ve seen for 18 to 24 months jade rahmani kbw analyst so safe to assume that the next quarter s deliveries reflect orders from the middle of last year martin p connor chief financial officer in some markets that could be from the middle of last year in other markets it could be even shorter or longer than that jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer that s a good average operator our next question comes from jay mccanless of wedbush securities please go ahead jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking my questions just wanted to pick up on that theme given the longer cycle times you guys have and the visibility that should provide you why are you all not comfortable giving full year guidance when you think have pretty decent certainty of what s in the backlog martin p connor chief financial officer well i think jay would given some consideration to that and i think we re just not comfortable at this point we ve seen a lot of changes in rate expectations we ve seen changes in demand that have been pretty significant over the last three and six months and we didn t think it was prudent to give guidance beyond the three months that we gave and we gave pretty good detailed guidance in the three months jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay great the second question i had i m surprised for you guys talking about how interest rates are driving the buyers back to the toll communities because historically with the high amount of cash buyers will generate relative to some of your peers and then also with buyers i think typically putting down more for all houses than the competitors houses it would seem that buyer should your average buyer should be somewhat a need to what rates are doing i mean has there been a large change in the composition of your buyers over the last three to four years inaudible gone into these different product types or is there something else that you re hearing in the field besides rate and price that s making people don t want to buy a home right now douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer no jay my comment i was certainly not comparing our buyer to other buyers in the market you are correct our buyers are less sensitive to rate moves no nothing has changed with our buyer profile over the last few years the average ltv is at 68 for our buyers that get a mortgage and 21 of our buyers are all cash so you re right they are less affected by a move in rate but let s not forget the confidence side of it which is what s really going on let s not forget the headlines when the fed was talking about four rate moves in 19 and the other headlines they talked about the slowdown of the housing market right even though they can afford the house and they are not as sensitive to the rate they re are not immune to the headlines and the fear that they were the fools that bought at the top and so it s a confidence issue more than a specific rate move martin p connor chief financial officer the other thing that overlays that is the they have a bit more invested in the stock market and the fall wasn t the greatest time to have your money there so couple of different factors jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst yeah understood and that s what i was trying to get to is the confidence thing it sounds like it s that more than anything else one other quick one if i could active adult your age targeted communities how are those been trending and what are you all looking to do with that type of business in the 19 douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer they are trending positive we like the business a lot we are absolutely chasing the baby boomer as they downsize and we are expanding the business to many different markets it started in the mid atlantic northeast midwest and we ve now expanded it into the west we have a very large community opening next year in greater phoenix several thousand homes that will have a large component that is active adult that community is called sterling ridge sorry inaudible thank you kira who is sterling if anyone should know the name it s kira sterling martin p connor chief financial officer did we name that after her douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so you will continue to see toll brothers active adult expand jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks again operator our next question comes from megan mcgrath of buckingham research please go ahead megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst good morning thanks both of my questions have been answered just wanted to follow up on two quick things first on california since the life cycle of communities was such a big impact this quarter i want to make sure that we all understand for the remainder of the year is there any other compare upcoming any other sort of big chunk of community openings that make a difficult compare and what s your community opening cadence look like in california for the year douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer community count will be relatively flat so there is nothing unique coming up in the comparison we do have five new communities that we plan to open anticipate opening in northern cal during the balance of the year megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst okay great and then following up on the conversation around sort of the macro factors one thing that you haven t talked about and i d love your opinion on now that we re further along is the tax reform do you think that impacted anything in california and other high tax markets douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we don t hear about it from sales right common sense would suggest that it has to play a part in some buyers decisions particularly as they are now beginning to prepare tax returns and understand the impact but the frontline sales teams are not hearing about that impact so california has always been a very expensive place to live long before salt and thankfully with that sun shining and that beautiful environment and great jobs people that have the money are willing to live there even though it costs a lot those that are not there that s why we have boise and that s why we have reno and that s why we have las vegas and even we re hearing of some buyers that make their way to dallas austin and houston but our core business in the coastal areas where the very affluent live we are not hearing much about it also remember that at certain submarkets of california we have a significant proportion of foreign buyers and they are not paying us taxes and are not impacted by the tax reform martin p connor chief financial officer additionally small business owners saw some relief from tax reform but i guess a lot of this will play out as people file their taxes and see what their situation is over the course of the next month or two megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst great thanks very much douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from buck horne of raymond james please go ahead buck horne raymond james analyst thanks guys wanted to see if you ve given some consideration to your land spending plans for the year i know last year your total land budget was up pretty significantly if you re given your views on the market right now have you kind of tightened up your underwriting and how do you plan on budgeting land acquisition going forward douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer buck we don t budget we don t allocate capital to divisions we stay opportunistic when good deals come in in markets we like we go yes the underwriting has certainly tightened up through the fall in certain locations either because we have a lot of land or we re concerned about some market dynamics but it s really market by market deal by deal if you look at prior years as a guide we have recently spent just north of 1 billion a year on land and i d say at this point fairly early on into 19 we re i think that s a fair estimate buck horne raymond james analyst okay helpful and we haven t talked much about city living so i just wanted to circle back on the city living side and get your thoughts on how the market is reacting to market conditions in new york and i think how the recent building openings have progressed your thoughts on timing of any new buildings coming up douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so the decline in contracts this quarter to last year in city living was driven by 10 provost which is our highrise in jersey city and the sell out of the sutton which was is one of our buildings in manhattan the city living market continues pretty much the same as we ve described in other quarters which is that it s ok it s not strong it s ok we have thankfully bought land and positioned ourselves in locations that are about 2 000 per square foot selling price and that market is ok the margins are high they are still above company average the jersey side which is for us hoboken and jersey city has slowed down a bit which is what i mentioned with 10 provost in jersey city having more sales last year than it did this year with respect to future opportunities and new buildings we continue to look we see deals fairly regularly most land sellers are not realistic in today s value of their land based on today s market conditions but i m still hopeful based on the deal flow that we will pick off one or two here or there that makes sense but we re not going to chase a deal in new york building in inflation it s just not what we do and it s too risky of a business with the price of the land with building these big buildings all at once and so we re going to be very disciplined it has certainly our investment in new york and city living has shrunk significantly over the last few years since we haven t bought new land martin p connor chief financial officer it s the lowest it s been since 2012 buck horne raymond james analyst yeah martin p connor chief financial officer and it gets to your point earlier about how land sellers change their expectation and we see that in new york they have not yet despite a number of years of the market not being as strong as it had been buck horne raymond james analyst great that s very helpful thank you guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from carl reichardt of btig please go ahead carl reichardt btig analyst good morning guys i want to ask about the cancellation rate and it s always low for you and so we re not talking about a lot of units but the change was reasonably significant from last year doug would you attribute that to this idea of the fear factor that you talked about or is that a function of contingencies or inability of folks to sell houses or something else in terms of that increase douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer no carl the increase it s spread out we study we re given reports on the reason people cancel there s not a lot we can read into it it doesn t appear that it was driven by fear or the inability to sell a home or i m worried about job security security or i m worried about the market remember we our average deposit is 75 000 so we take in most locations a lot of money before we start your semi custom home because your home is unique and we deserve that deposit to proceed and build a house that you have specifically designed cancellation as a percentage of beginning backlog is at 2 4 which is pretty consistent with where it s been in the past martin p connor chief financial officer i think we have a bit of a math issue we had a little less sales in the quarter so cancellations as a percentage of sales are up and we have a bigger backlog from where those cancellations can come from so the best way to look at it in a market like this is as a percentage of beginning backlog and it hasn t moved that much carl reichardt btig analyst right fair enough marty thanks and then you talked about the sunny california but the weather out here has been pretty atrocious as in the pacific inaudible in february i mean i m assuming the larger houses are already at dry end but marty are you assuming any kind of a delay impact on closings from this important state for you in the second quarter just based on what we ve seen so far this month douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we are not martin p connor chief financial officer i don t think we are that would be up to the individual teams in terms of what they ve submitted to us in terms of what they expect to close carl reichardt btig analyst all right good deal thanks guys operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to doug yearley for any closing remarks douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you nicole thanks everybody for all of your support have a great

the highest q1 in over a decade our first quarter contracts were down 31 in dollars and 24 in units we attribute this decline to a difficult year over year comparison contracts were up 36 in dollars and 20 in units in fiscal 2018 s first quarter and the industrywide slowdown that began in the second half of 2018 advertisement advertisement california s drop was the most dramatic with contracts down 62 against a difficult comparison of up 72 in fiscal year 2018 s first quarter some of this was due to market softening and some was attributable to mix and the life cycle of certain communities companywide on a per community basis contracts tracked more closely to fiscal year 2016 and 2017 s first quarter which were still quite healthy than to the more robust fiscal year 2018 s first quarter although we experienced a year over year decline in contracts each month of the first quarter the decline decreased as the quarter progressed non binding reservation deposits for the first three weeks of february are behind last year but we are encouraged by improving demand trends during the month and especially by our past week s deposits which exceeded last year s same week this is only one week worth of data but it is an important week historically one of the biggest sales weeks of the year nationally the economy remains healthy unemployment is low and housing supply is still tight many of our potential customers have benefited from a strong stock market and enjoyed increased equity in their existing homes mortgage rates have recently decreased to their lowest levels in a year these factors are all generally positive for the homebuilding sector given our focus on the upscale market our strategy has always been to acquire the best land in the most attractive locations we evaluate

atlanta and frisco square a suburb of dallas total cost for the three communities will be about 270 million to build about 1 020 units because we develop our multifamily platform with partners and use project construction loans for about 65 of the cost toll brothers total investment across the three communities is about 24 million we generally get fees and promotes to increase our returns and on occasion we may recognize an upfront gain on the sale of land into the joint venture in q1 we recognized an 8 4 million gain from such a transaction this is a great stand alone business and even better serves as a complement to our for sale homebuilding business we currently have over 18 000 apartment units in various stages of development or lease up we are proud of our tremendous brand this quarter we were once again named by fortune magazine as the world s most admired home building company this is the fifth consecutive year we have been so honored we thank the tremendous team of toll brothers associates who make these recognitions possible with our well located land strong brand and wide variety of communities we believe we are well positioned advertisement advertisement now let me turn it over to marty martin p connor chief financial officer thanks doug before i address the specifics of this quarter i do want to note that a reconciliation of the non gaap measures referenced

sale revenue increase of 12 home sales gross margin came in 50 basis points better than a year ago driven primarily by solid operations and favorable mix interest expense through cost of sales was 2 6

point improvement over fiscal year 2018 s first quarter the improved q1 sg a margin reflects increased revenue and good cost control during the quarter we recognized an 8 4 million net gain on the sale of land to into an apartment joint venture that doug just mentioned and we also had a 12 million gain on the disposition of a golf course we remain focused on maintaining our conservative balance sheet with great liquidity low leverage and a long dated maturity profile we ended fiscal year 2019 s first quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 42 7 on a gross basis and a net debt to capital

year 2019 s first quarter end was 33 04 our highest ever and it s up from 32 57 last quarter we are well positioned to take advantage of land opportunities to make acquisitions to reduce our debt or to invest in our company through further share repurchases here s our forward looking income statement guidance for the second quarter of 2019 we expect deliveries of between 1 650 and 1 850 units with an average delivered price of between 860 000 and 890 000 we expect adjusted home sales gross margin of approximately 23 1 of home sales revenues and sg a as a percentage of second quarter home sales revenues of approximately 11 3 we expect other income income from unconsolidated entities and land sales gross profit of approximately 13 million in total we expect the tax rate of approximately 27 5 we are pleased that our community count has grown from 295 a year ago to 317 at the first quarter end and we expect modest community count growth through the balance of the year lastly we expect interest expense to cost of sales to be approximately 2 7 and our weighted average share count for the second quarter to be approximately 148 million shares now let me turn it back to doug advertisement advertisement douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you marty nicole let s open it up to questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from nishu sood of deutsche bank please go ahead nishu sood deutsche bank analyst thank you i wanted to ask first about you mentioned that the year over year pace the decline lessened as the quarter went on month by month and then also if you re looking at the non binding reservations in february those improved as well can you just give us some numbers around those potentially just to understand where we might be currently advertisement advertisement douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer nishu thanks for the question i m sorry but we re not going to get into the specifics of the numbers we mentioned a few years ago that we would certainly give some flavor but we re going to get off giving week to week month to month numbers so i think we ve explained it accurately which is each month of the quarter the decrease lessened and for february while we are behind after three weeks a year ago we are encouraged by this past week which exceeded last year nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it may be thinking about it a different way then given that your quarter and in february here as well have covered the period where there has been quite a bit of rate volatility can you talk about your thoughts perhaps about how the movement in rates has affected your buyer and the lessening decline that you re talking about advertisement advertisement douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so we had a huge move down in rates in q1 the quarter started with a five and an eight rate and the quarter ended with a four and a half rate i m talking about a 30 year fixed conforming no point mortgage that s obviously a dramatic decrease coupled with that the messaging out of the fed that they were going to probably slowdown or eliminate rate increases throughout 19 so i think the combination of the decrease in the rate and the commentary on what was coming was certainly encouraging we absolutely felt on improvement in the quality of traffic in the interest of our buyers i think sales was pretty down through the fall and when surveyed more recently they re excited they feel like a solid spring season is upon them and i think one of the primary drivers of that is that decrease in rates that i talked about martin p connor chief financial officer advertisement advertisement got it got it and just in terms of incentives can you also just talk about through this bout of volatility obviously happened at a seasonally slow period of time and rates have come back your willingness to use incentives maybe you could just discuss how you re thinking about that and then also the competitive environment in terms of incentives please douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so as we mentioned earlier on this call as i mentioned we buy land in main and main we believe most of our land is unique we look at every community when it comes to pricing pricing of course includes incentives to evaluate what should be done by community and i think we do a very good job of thoughtfully balancing price with pace and with the quality of the land our incentive right now is 3 1 of our sales price and it went up very very modestly as an average nationwide this quarter versus prior quarters nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from stephen kim of evercore isi please go ahead stephen kim evercore isi analyst yes thanks very much guys i just wanted to ask a question regarding your brand and the flexibility of the toll brothers brand is that particularly as it relates to the ability to move it down market and maintain the integrity of the aspirational aspect of the brand can you just give a sense for how flexible you think you can be maybe in terms of putting it in context of price points and what gives you the confidence that you can take it down that far while maintaining the cash that it s always had douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve as you know as we ve talked about we have had and will continue to have a great variety in the price point of our communities from new york city and california that are obviously multi million to jacksonville and boise and other locations that are down in the 300 000 400 000 500 000 i am very confident that we can continue our great brand as we introduce more lower priced communities first of all there won t be that many in the scheme of things right we have 300 to 350 communities and we re talking about something that will probably be less than 10 but more importantly the quality still of the architecture the sales center the sales managers the design and decorating of the home the websites the way we treat our customer the customer experience i am very confident after having watched it be launched in places like phoenix where our average price was up in the 800 000 and we have a new offering down into the threes ph that is doing terrifically well where people are delighted to be buying the toll brothers home in the threes and it s still different from what they re getting from other buyers or other builders in the threes because it s brought to you by toll brothers so it s a good question it s a fair question we re obviously aware of it but i am very confident that we can continue on this business strategy without any dilution to the great toll brand we are building apartments under the toll brothers apartment living name we re building student housing under the toll brothers campus living name it s all condo quality in terms of residents clubs and pools on the roof and finishes of the units themselves and we re actually leveraging the toll brand into that business and never once have i heard a comment out of anybody in the sales office that a buyer was concerned because they saw that we re now in luxury apartments so i m confident we can be wider in scope but still focus on what got us here which is great luxury and just expand it a bit without any issues stephen east wells fargo securities analyst great now i appreciate that full answer second question i had is maybe one more for marty the gross margin in the sg a both kind of surprised us in favorable directions i was kind of curious if you could maybe just tease out was there anything there that would explain why they performed better here in the last when we see the results here a few months after you last spoke martin p connor chief financial officer sure so gross margin essentially remained flat with the fourth quarter i think to address your question specifically the ops team did very well during the quarter and we saw our house costs come in a little bit lower than projected we also benefited a bit from favorable mix including more california deliveries than expected and as it relates to sg a i think we had very efficient cost control from the corporate level as well as out in the field and we had more revenue than we expected stephen east wells fargo securities analyst well do do it every time thanks very much guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you steve operator our next question comes from stephen east of wells fargo please go ahead stephen east wells fargo securities analyst thank you good morning guys doug talking about your progression you ve talked about the recent week i know you don t want to put numbers around it so we ll stay away from that but i guess i m more interested when you look at some of your big markets california the mid atlantic mid atlantic was a big positive surprise in the quarter i just want to understand how those progressed both in the quarter and in february douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so mid atlantic stephen was driven primarily by virginia which is a very large and important market for toll and it s clicked ph the government shutdown didn t have any impact on buyer sentiment we have a terrific management team down there that has redesigned a lot of the communities the product and i m just really proud of how they re operating and the market demand is very solid and that was the primary driver for the good results your question is more specific as to sort of month to month within the quarter it similar to my commentary on the company which is that it improved month to month throughout the quarter and the same is through february stephen east wells fargo securities analyst okay douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer california as i mentioned in my prepared comments it s a really tough comp california was up 72 first quarter of 18 versus 17 and last year we had a number of communities that had just recently opened that had huge pent up demand at the openings i mean we had hundreds and hundreds of people that had already been pre approved for mortgages before we even opened the doors and this five communities out there three in the north and two in the south that combined the 259 contracts a year ago compared to 58 this quarter and when we study those five communities alone they were all new openings they all had huge pent up demand with all these pre qualified buyers waiting for our launch today they are further into the life cycle of the community the backlogs have built so the delivery times have gotten longer we ve obviously had price increases there is still solid demand and that demand has improved through february but it s very different to what it was like a year ago when they had just recently opened stephen east wells fargo securities analyst fair enough all right that s really helpful there and then you were talking a little bit about strategy if i can come back to it i guess a two part question one how important is m a when you look at it moving forward and what are you really wanting to accomplish with it and then you ve got a lot of different initiatives and you went through some of them but gibraltar student housing apartment single family for rent you know hitting the entry level in the active adult as you look at your mix of business where do you want to invest more dollars more time more and then where do you want to pull back a little bit if any of those varied efforts that you have going on douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so the first part was m a and we re interested we have an m a team that that s all they do and right now i d say we probably have as good or better deal flow than we had last year we looked at 30 builders last year we didn t buy any but there was a handful that we re interested in and i d say we re on pace for that or better and nothing certainly to announce but we re in action and the m a market appears to be pretty robust we use m a to enter a new market and we may use m a to enter a different product line or price point those would be the two strategies behind it as for the second part of your question which was all the different business lines that we are now in i m really happy with all of it i mentioned on my prepared comments how delighted i am with and we are with the apartment business the single family for rent is new but it appears to be something that we will be very exciting gibraltar you know it s small right now i mean that company was built to buy distressed portfolios of loans from banks and be a workout restructuring firm it s now a land bank firm we ve had better markets and that team is in place for good markets and bad either land bank or become a workout restructuring firm so you asked has anything shed or downsized absolutely not our primary focus just to finish your questions is still our core luxury homebuilding business that s what gets us up every day and that s where we re going to spend most of our money and be most focused stephen east wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator our next question comes from alan ratner of zelman associates please go ahead alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions first question i believe this time of year in february you guys typically do your national sales event and in the past i think doug you ve kind of downplayed the impact of that in terms of margin but just curious when you look at your improvement in the non binding deposits can you talk about how this year s sales event compared to the last few years and tying on to that just wanted to confirm the 3 1 incentive number is that on orders or closings douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer orders alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst got it douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so the national sales event we do four national sales events every year i guess it s our version of inaudible december to remember it s something that s something that we ve worked hard at and works well and we re able to bring sort of national marketing to it it is a combination of some i d say repurposed incentives in the field and then vendor incentives that are kicked in during these events that is not toll dollars but is the opportunity to upgrade flooring upgrade kitchen cabinets upgrade plumbing fixtures et cetera where the vendors participate with us because they want our backlogs to grow just as we do and the timing of the events last year to this year lined up the february event is our biggest because it s sort of launches the spring selling season in terms of a comparison to a year ago it was slower than last year for the same reasons i gave that overall february to date has been slower and it was more similar to what we saw in the prior year we feel good about where we are right now and we re delighted with the last week of the sales event and how strong the deposits were alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst right i appreciate that doug and then second question maybe for marty obviously only given one quarter worth of guidance but your backlog gives you pretty good visibility to the back half of the year as well so any chance you can just directionally talk about when you look at the homes in backlog expected to deliver beyond 2q is the margin on those homes materially different than the 23 1 you re currently guiding for in 2q martin p connor chief financial officer i think we just weren t comfortable going beyond the quarter at this point alan we ve seen a lot of changes in the marketplace over the last three to six months between demand and interest rates et cetera as it relates to the margin in our backlog i think we just delivered margin that was consistent with three months ago s margin we ve given guidance for three months from now i wouldn t suspect that there s anything dramatically different than the guidance we ve given but we don t want to get any more specific than that alan ratner zelman associates llc analyst okay that s helpful thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from michael rehaut of jpmorgan securities please go ahead michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thanks good morning everyone douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst first question i had was kind of following in on the incentives and the gross margins you re able to be roughly 50 bps ahead of last year in this first quarter and are looking for a similar year over year improvement in 2q with the incentives you said i guess up only slightly on orders in the first quarter perhaps you could kind of describe your pace over price strategy it seems like there is a decent differentiation between yourselves and perhaps some of the other builders that got a lot more aggressive on incentives in the past several months in the face of the slowdown so given your price point given your positioning it seems like you just kind of took at the recent volatility and decided to hold margin over pace is that a fair assessment or and maybe just kind of talk broadly to the approach douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure michael so i had mentioned on the last call that we didn t feel like the months of november december and most of january were months where you would chase sales through big increases in incentives because it s a slow time of the year but that we would reevaluate as the spring season was beginning and i think that is part of what you ve seen and we ll see how the spring season continues to develop and we ve given plenty of commentary already on the start of that season the one difference between toll and many of the other builders is we re not spec builder we don t have finished inventory that is sitting there and needs to move because it s been built you know you can sit on ground and cut the grass and pay the taxes and it s not all that painful but when you re sitting on a finished home you got to make a decision every week inaudible years ago on a finished spec in every week it s sitting there one more week guys what are we going to do we re going to drop the price one more week we got to drop the price it is completed martin p connor chief financial officer and it s difference between having 0 20 of your revenue dollar invested and 0 80 your revenue dollar invested douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so i think that is one significant difference between our business model and some of the other builders we talked about endlessly our land being unique hard to replace and in those that s not everywhere but in those locations we will be more deliberate and more thoughtful on the balance between pace and price michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst all right i appreciate it i guess secondly on the land market the recent pause we ve heard in generally this would apply to perhaps different price points but maybe a touch of softening here or there maybe a little bit of retrading maybe a little bit of easing on some terms have you seen any of that in your core markets and perhaps given your approach going to step in here or there if you ve seen any more opportunities come up in the last few months douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer not really the land market generally lags far behind the overall housing market until land sellers start feeling some pain start feeling pressure they generally stand pretty firm in limited cases we ve had some opportunities to renegotiate some terms but it s still a pretty robust land market out there there is still a lot of competition we have been careful and conservative and certainly tightened some underwriting in certain areas but i wouldn t say there s been any significant amount of retrading or renegotiation with land sellers michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from john lovallo of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions the first one marty the second quarter sg a as a percentage of sales guide of 11 3 seems a bit high just given the fact that your outlook appears to kind of call for flattish revenue on a year over year basis and that would be a pretty good step up on a year over year basis in sg a so anything one time in there that may be shifted from the first quarter into second quarter or how should we think about that outlook martin p connor chief financial officer no i don t think there s anything one time in there i think our g a is going to be almost within 1 million or 2 million in terms of absolute dollars and then the s components offer the touch john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and that would actually fit into the second question here in terms of i think it was last quarter you guys talked about outside realtor commissions being a little bit elevated versus history or at least versus the fourth quarter how did those trend in the first quarter martin p connor chief financial officer i don t think there was any change john in outside realtor commissions and remember that our outside realtor commissions are in our cost of goods sold it s our inside sales teams that are in our s for sg a john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay thank you guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from susan maklari of credit suisse please go ahead susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning susan maklari credit suisse analyst my first question is around you ve spoken in the past about perhaps some easing on the labor side of things which could help us as we think about as this year coming together can you just give us an update on what you re seeing from that front douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure we had modest decrease in building costs in q1 in certain markets we are hearing of contractors are green to some modest price concessions because they have slowed down which is typical of what we see when it s all demand and supply driven so they built up their teams and as our sales slowed a bit they had employees that were not as busy and now we ve had some modest opportunities to take the price down i think that will continue at least for a quarter or two as the sales over the summer and the fall start feeding through into construction our longer term we ll have to see where the markets are but it does appear that we will at least stop the increases and we have some modest decreases martin p connor chief financial officer and that stability and decrease that we ve been able to achieve this quarter shows up in our income statement nine months from now not douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer right susan maklari credit suisse analyst yeah ok my next question is around can you talk to some of the attributes of salt lake and portland what do you found attractive about getting into those markets and why you decided to go greenfield there versus maybe approaching it from an m a perspective douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we looked hard at m a opportunities we got close in one of those markets and so as we were looking we first study a market and decide we want to be here and then we look at how we re going to get there and as we re looking to buy a builder we re also putting a management team in place and looking to buy land so in both locations as we are in the early stages looking at m a opportunities we are beginning to buy land since we have not yet bought a builder in either market and i don t i m not suggesting there s anything cooking we now have a handful of land owned or controlled in both markets the management team is in place models the road is going in models being built so there is the strategy on whether it s m a or greenfield i mean if m a doesn t work we go with greenfield the what we liked about the markets we ve looked at portland from the perspective of the seattle team i guess ever since we got into seattle which is now about six years ago and have been studying and studying that market and to us it s a little it s a mini seattle that is only a couple of hours away it has great job growth it has some limitations on supply because of some pretty tough entitlements and development zones and that s right up our alley because we like markets that have difficult are difficult to get land entitled because we have the patience and the wherewithal to stick with it and when you get it it s gold a lot of the architecture can come right out of seattle our management team has moved down from seattle and so what i m describing i think is a natural progression out of our great success that we ve had in seattle salt lake city is a market we looked at for more than a decade it has changed dramatically in the last three to four years in terms of the diversity of businesses the economy growth it has become a very desirable place to live whether it be as a family moving up and working and what they now call the silicon slope because every city of course has to have a silicon something or whether it s move down location because of the lifestyle associated with salt lake and the mountain towns around it so we re really excited about both opportunities both markets and they will start out slower because they re greenfield but that can also be a more cautious way to go and i am very happy with the land we have the teams we have and stay tuned because we ll open in both locations this spring susan maklari credit suisse analyst all right thanks for all that color good luck douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you susan operator our next question comes from mike dahl of rbc capital markets please go ahead mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and all of the details so far douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst i wanted to ask about just the thoughts on where you see the business at a bit of a higher level i know you re not giving the guidance but clearly some market softness but i think doug overall what you re also speaking to is just a normalization particularly in a place like california where you described kind of some super normal trends that you re comping against so if we re thinking about kind of what you see as quote unquote more normal absorption for this type of market 15 16 17 as we re doing around two sales a month ist that about where you think the market is settling in at do you think there is opportunity for upside and if so how much of that is kind of your mix initiatives versus market recovery douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer mike i can t answer you specifically because i don t have that crystal ball i think i have properly described the difference between this first quarter and the last year i ve also explained that 17 was a really solid year in california and that s what 19 felt more like what i will say is i think we re positioned well with the communities we have and with the future land the land that we own that will become future communities so we re going to have community count growth add in california because of the land that we own and i am confident that like i said we are well positioned last year was a pretty unique year just in terms of the number of communities we opened within a relatively short time frame that had terrific pent up demand at the opening that s not to say that couldn t be repeated but it was certainly a unique year but overall we are positioned well with our holdings and with our brand and i feel good about our future out there mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay got it understood my second question maybe for marty i know that jv land and other category is pretty lumpy and you described some of the contributions to the quarter is there any i think you guys did about 150 million in the full year of 2018 any color you could give us on directionally or magnitude of what to expect for the balance of 2019 beyond the 13 million in 2q martin p connor chief financial officer sure so i think if we walk backwards a little bit last year we did do about 148 million we did around 167 million the year before that which was significantly influenced by our peer house project in brooklyn and the years before that we were right around the 100 million for two or three years in a row so i think we ve mentioned this part of our business as being important to us and being at some sustainable level right now i d put that sustainable level somewhere north of 100 million for this year and south of 150 million for this year this next upcoming quarters is going to be a little bit lower than a pro rata piece of that just because of the lack of any particular transactions that we currently have on the drawing board expected the close mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you operator our next question comes from ken zener of keybanc please go ahead kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning everybody douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst doug and marty obviously i heard read your comments about sequential orders and all that stuff so we will just let that sit my question is more around how your backlog margin in california which is obviously part of your one forward quarter guidance plays out but how that also interacts with what we re seeing as the lower orders from that area and i focus on california because ebit margin i think for fy 18 it s pretty a case 25 versus 15 ebit how you guys describe it but i m just trying to think about how that high margin contribution plays out within the one quarter forward guidance but also how it can play out structurally right two and three quarters down is that order orders begin to kind of flow into there i m trying to think structurally how that can play out any help there would be appreciated thank you martin p connor chief financial officer yeah ken it s marty i think we haven t given much in terms of guidance for the balance of the year but as it relates to your specific question in california i think the backlog we have gives us visibility into some level of stability in california deliveries for the balance of the year kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst you re saying for delivery i m just trying to see if it s as simple as looking at the margin contribution based on kind of what the orders might suggest about martin p connor chief financial officer i would technical difficulty unidentified participant analyst hi thank you for taking my questions i just wanted to look at the overall order asp you know 844 000 obviously there s a lot of mix going on and you re still calling for a 860 000 to 890 000 in the second quarter but just given kind of the recent sales trends and asps on this sales how should we think about trending delivered asps in the second half of this year thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so i think it s helpful to recognize that we sell homes from 300 000 to 3 million and so the movement in any particular quarter of either average delivered price or average selling price is really driven by mix predominantly not price increases or price incentives and so as we look across the balance of the year i think the best estimate you can use is the approximately 900 000 sales price sits in our backlog unidentified participant analyst okay i appreciate that and then secondly just to kind of follow up on the last question because it seems clear and i think marty you mentioned it earlier that california was obviously a benefit from a mix perspective in the first quarter and that would seem to continue in the second quarter but just given that the past two quarters of decline on the order side is it fair to assume that california would be a lower mix as a percentage of revenues in the second half of this year and accordingly what would that mean for margins thank you douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer i think your presumption is directionally accurate but your timeframe is off i think you re going to get into next year before the california volume through the income statement is impactful to margins unidentified participant analyst okay thanks for the detail good luck douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from scott schrier of citi please go ahead scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask about the timing of closings understanding you came in toward the higher end of your guidance for and the next quarter it looks like the guide is a little lower than maybe what analysts were expecting so i m curious was there anything in there that happened understanding 1q 18 was a big orders quarter in your cycle times but was there anything in terms of cycle times or regional implications that we should be considering from the closings timing martin p connor chief financial officer scott i m not sure i can point to anything in particular i do know that the nature of the buildings we are constructing the attached product we are constructing in northern california provides a bit longer backlog and some of the detached single family product around the country so i would say there is some impact of longer cycle times not necessarily abnormally long or longer than our expectations in northern california just because of the 24 and 36 unit buildings that need to be completed before you can deliver one year scott schrier citi analyst got it and then can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the design studios and lot premiums and design studio option premiums and things like that douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so as you know we have almost 30 now design studios around the country in each division where the client goes to pick all their finishes and we encourage that process it s a major part of what distinguishes toll from other builders our upgrades i m not this is not a number just for design studio because some of it is structural changes that occur at the sales center at the community but we are still running at about 160 000 of upgrades which is about 20 of the home price and that number has not changed scott schrier citi analyst got it okay so no real change given market conditions or anything in buyers appetite for options basically douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer that s correct scott schrier citi analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from jade rahmani of kbw please go ahead jade rahmani kbw analyst thank you very much can you provide any additional information on the single family rental investment what s the magnitude and scope of the investment and is it investment in another company which has been reported in the media do you expect to grow it et cetera any color would be helpful douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we would love to give some color but we must apologize that we are under confidentiality at the moment and cannot discuss it so what you read in any builder magazines or elsewhere it did not come from us and we can t comment on it jade rahmani kbw analyst okay just separately in terms of operations can you comment on where current cycle times are running douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer the range and it s so community specific is six or seven to 12 months and again it depends on the size of the home the extent of the backlog the trade base the depth of the trade base but that is the general range martin p connor chief financial officer i think in a perfect world it would be three to four weeks shorter than it is right now but labor constraints have that extended the three or four weeks i mentioned but i think it s the same three or four weeks we ve seen for 18 to 24 months jade rahmani kbw analyst so safe to assume that the next quarter s deliveries reflect orders from the middle of last year martin p connor chief financial officer in some markets that could be from the middle of last year in other markets it could be even shorter or longer than that jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer that s a good average operator our next question comes from jay mccanless of wedbush securities please go ahead jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking my questions just wanted to pick up on that theme given the longer cycle times you guys have and the visibility that should provide you why are you all not comfortable giving full year guidance when you think have pretty decent certainty of what s in the backlog martin p connor chief financial officer well i think jay would given some consideration to that and i think we re just not comfortable at this point we ve seen a lot of changes in rate expectations we ve seen changes in demand that have been pretty significant over the last three and six months and we didn t think it was prudent to give guidance beyond the three months that we gave and we gave pretty good detailed guidance in the three months jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay great the second question i had i m surprised for you guys talking about how interest rates are driving the buyers back to the toll communities because historically with the high amount of cash buyers will generate relative to some of your peers and then also with buyers i think typically putting down more for all houses than the competitors houses it would seem that buyer should your average buyer should be somewhat a need to what rates are doing i mean has there been a large change in the composition of your buyers over the last three to four years inaudible gone into these different product types or is there something else that you re hearing in the field besides rate and price that s making people don t want to buy a home right now douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer no jay my comment i was certainly not comparing our buyer to other buyers in the market you are correct our buyers are less sensitive to rate moves no nothing has changed with our buyer profile over the last few years the average ltv is at 68 for our buyers that get a mortgage and 21 of our buyers are all cash so you re right they are less affected by a move in rate but let s not forget the confidence side of it which is what s really going on let s not forget the headlines when the fed was talking about four rate moves in 19 and the other headlines they talked about the slowdown of the housing market right even though they can afford the house and they are not as sensitive to the rate they re are not immune to the headlines and the fear that they were the fools that bought at the top and so it s a confidence issue more than a specific rate move martin p connor chief financial officer the other thing that overlays that is the they have a bit more invested in the stock market and the fall wasn t the greatest time to have your money there so couple of different factors jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst yeah understood and that s what i was trying to get to is the confidence thing it sounds like it s that more than anything else one other quick one if i could active adult your age targeted communities how are those been trending and what are you all looking to do with that type of business in the 19 douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer they are trending positive we like the business a lot we are absolutely chasing the baby boomer as they downsize and we are expanding the business to many different markets it started in the mid atlantic northeast midwest and we ve now expanded it into the west we have a very large community opening next year in greater phoenix several thousand homes that will have a large component that is active adult that community is called sterling ridge sorry inaudible thank you kira who is sterling if anyone should know the name it s kira sterling martin p connor chief financial officer did we name that after her douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer so you will continue to see toll brothers active adult expand jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks again operator our next question comes from megan mcgrath of buckingham research please go ahead megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst good morning thanks both of my questions have been answered just wanted to follow up on two quick things first on california since the life cycle of communities was such a big impact this quarter i want to make sure that we all understand for the remainder of the year is there any other compare upcoming any other sort of big chunk of community openings that make a difficult compare and what s your community opening cadence look like in california for the year douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer community count will be relatively flat so there is nothing unique coming up in the comparison we do have five new communities that we plan to open anticipate opening in northern cal during the balance of the year megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst okay great and then following up on the conversation around sort of the macro factors one thing that you haven t talked about and i d love your opinion on now that we re further along is the tax reform do you think that impacted anything in california and other high tax markets douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we don t hear about it from sales right common sense would suggest that it has to play a part in some buyers decisions particularly as they are now beginning to prepare tax returns and understand the impact but the frontline sales teams are not hearing about that impact so california has always been a very expensive place to live long before salt and thankfully with that sun shining and that beautiful environment and great jobs people that have the money are willing to live there even though it costs a lot those that are not there that s why we have boise and that s why we have reno and that s why we have las vegas and even we re hearing of some buyers that make their way to dallas austin and houston but our core business in the coastal areas where the very affluent live we are not hearing much about it also remember that at certain submarkets of california we have a significant proportion of foreign buyers and they are not paying us taxes and are not impacted by the tax reform martin p connor chief financial officer additionally small business owners saw some relief from tax reform but i guess a lot of this will play out as people file their taxes and see what their situation is over the course of the next month or two megan mcgrath the buckingham research group analyst great thanks very much douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from buck horne of raymond james please go ahead buck horne raymond james analyst thanks guys wanted to see if you ve given some consideration to your land spending plans for the year i know last year your total land budget was up pretty significantly if you re given your views on the market right now have you kind of tightened up your underwriting and how do you plan on budgeting land acquisition going forward douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer buck we don t budget we don t allocate capital to divisions we stay opportunistic when good deals come in in markets we like we go yes the underwriting has certainly tightened up through the fall in certain locations either because we have a lot of land or we re concerned about some market dynamics but it s really market by market deal by deal if you look at prior years as a guide we have recently spent just north of 1 billion a year on land and i d say at this point fairly early on into 19 we re i think that s a fair estimate buck horne raymond james analyst okay helpful and we haven t talked much about city living so i just wanted to circle back on the city living side and get your thoughts on how the market is reacting to market conditions in new york and i think how the recent building openings have progressed your thoughts on timing of any new buildings coming up douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer sure so the decline in contracts this quarter to last year in city living was driven by 10 provost which is our highrise in jersey city and the sell out of the sutton which was is one of our buildings in manhattan the city living market continues pretty much the same as we ve described in other quarters which is that it s ok it s not strong it s ok we have thankfully bought land and positioned ourselves in locations that are about 2 000 per square foot selling price and that market is ok the margins are high they are still above company average the jersey side which is for us hoboken and jersey city has slowed down a bit which is what i mentioned with 10 provost in jersey city having more sales last year than it did this year with respect to future opportunities and new buildings we continue to look we see deals fairly regularly most land sellers are not realistic in today s value of their land based on today s market conditions but i m still hopeful based on the deal flow that we will pick off one or two here or there that makes sense but we re not going to chase a deal in new york building in inflation it s just not what we do and it s too risky of a business with the price of the land with building these big buildings all at once and so we re going to be very disciplined it has certainly our investment in new york and city living has shrunk significantly over the last few years since we haven t bought new land martin p connor chief financial officer it s the lowest it s been since 2012 buck horne raymond james analyst yeah martin p connor chief financial officer and it gets to your point earlier about how land sellers change their expectation and we see that in new york they have not yet despite a number of years of the market not being as strong as it had been buck horne raymond james analyst great that s very helpful thank you guys douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from carl reichardt of btig please go ahead carl reichardt btig analyst good morning guys i want to ask about the cancellation rate and it s always low for you and so we re not talking about a lot of units but the change was reasonably significant from last year doug would you attribute that to this idea of the fear factor that you talked about or is that a function of contingencies or inability of folks to sell houses or something else in terms of that increase douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer no carl the increase it s spread out we study we re given reports on the reason people cancel there s not a lot we can read into it it doesn t appear that it was driven by fear or the inability to sell a home or i m worried about job security security or i m worried about the market remember we our average deposit is 75 000 so we take in most locations a lot of money before we start your semi custom home because your home is unique and we deserve that deposit to proceed and build a house that you have specifically designed cancellation as a percentage of beginning backlog is at 2 4 which is pretty consistent with where it s been in the past martin p connor chief financial officer i think we have a bit of a math issue we had a little less sales in the quarter so cancellations as a percentage of sales are up and we have a bigger backlog from where those cancellations can come from so the best way to look at it in a market like this is as a percentage of beginning backlog and it hasn t moved that much carl reichardt btig analyst right fair enough marty thanks and then you talked about the sunny california but the weather out here has been pretty atrocious as in the pacific inaudible in february i mean i m assuming the larger houses are already at dry end but marty are you assuming any kind of a delay impact on closings from this important state for you in the second quarter just based on what we ve seen so far this month douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer we are not martin p connor chief financial officer i don t think we are that would be up to the individual teams in terms of what they ve submitted to us in terms of what they expect to close carl reichardt btig analyst all right good deal thanks guys operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to doug yearley for any closing remarks douglas c yearley chairman and chief executive officer thank you nicole thanks everybody for all of your support have a great

despite solid growth and continuing job gains the us economy will see inflation fall even further below the central bank s two percent goal at least for a time federal reserve chairman jerome powell said on tuesday that forecast added weight to the fed s recent announcements that it will be patient before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate a stance mr powell re emphasised in semi annual testimony before the us senate banking committee recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the longer run goal of 2 per cent for a time he said the us central bank increased the key policy interest rate four times last year but rising uncertainty especially around the us trade confrontation with china amplified concerns about slowing global growth and fears the fed was moving too aggressively and with no sign of rising inflation that prompted the fed to signal clearly for the past several weeks that it would tread carefully many economists now do not expect any increase this year while a few say the next move could be a cut if the economy slows further noting the fed s preferred annual inflation measure sits at 1 7 per cent mr powell said the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook the danger of having inflation continually below the target is that it saps confidence in the fed s ability to impact the economy especially during a slowdown but the muted inflation pressures and risks on the horizon mean this is a good time to be patient and watch and wait and see how the situation evolves he said in response to a question he remained upbeat about the economic outlook saying fed officials generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market to remain strong economic crosscurrents however crosscurrents and conflicting signals pose a potential danger the predominant risks are slowing global growth particularly china and europe which he cautioned can create headwinds for the united states economy brexit and ongoing trade negotiations also are issues the fed will carefully monitor the united states and china have hammered each other with punitive tariffs on more than us 360 billion in two way trade raising prices to producers and consumers and undercutting economic growth the international monetary fund cites the trade war between the world s two largest economies as a major risk to global growth and cut their growth forecast for this year but president donald trump on monday said he expected to hold a signing summit soon with china s leader xi jinping to resolve the issue and he pushed back a march 1 deadline which would have triggered tariffs to more than double on us 200 billion in chinese exports in the us economy low inflation and sluggish wage growth despite net job gains that averaged 223 000 last year and gdp gaining just under three per cent has continued to baffle economists and the fed mr powell noted some signs of stronger wage growth particularly in lower skilled jobs but also said disparities persist in the labour market along racial and ethnic lines and also between rural and urban workers however longer run trends such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes also remain important challenges he said and the united states has a lower share of prime age workers participating in the economy than comparable advanced economies which has the effect of holding back productivity which is needed to boost growth he added mr powell said in addition to programmes to promote worker training and dealing with the opioid crisis that keeps people out of the workforce the government needs policies that do not punish people for going back to work describing a training program for in west virginia where the women who participated lost the meager benefits they were already getting because many us aid programs end as soon as the recipient finds a job they had to take a pay cut to go back to work and they did it anyway which is pretty inspiring mr powell told the senators afp

2018 was an outstanding year for ecopetrol both operationally and financially today we are a more efficient and disciplined company with better technical capacity constantly seeking integrity and operational safety the year s net profit totaled cop 11 6 trillion the highest of the past five years and almost double the figure posted in 2017 additionally the business group s ebitda totaled cop

reserves that began in 2017 at the close of the year the ecopetrol group s net proven reserves totaled 1 727 billion barrels of oil equivalent the reserve replacement ratio was 129 the highest of the past four years average reserve life totaled 7 2 years noting the increase in reserve life for crude from 5 8 to 6 3 years we note our record of increasing proven reserves associated with the results of the recovery factor enhancement program 129 mmboe in which the largest gains occurred at fields such as chichimene castilla and teca we satisfactorily met the annual production goal by achieving 720 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day despite some operational events and public security difficulties in the first quarter the production increase was due to the successful drilling campaign and the use of technology in the enhanced recovery program it is significant that in the fourth quarter we achieved average production of 733 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 2 2 over the same period the previous year and the basis for meeting our 2019 goal we ended the year with a solid cash position of cop 14 5 trillion the year s liquidity position allowed us to prepay the equivalent of

mexico during the gom lease sale 251 round this increasing level of activity is in line with our goals of competitiveness and future profitability in midstream we are continuing to show solid results i note our stable extraction of heavy crude with viscosities greater than 600 centistokes cst a measure of viscosity this past year saw the commissioning of the san fernando apiay system and we expanded the p135 to make the system more robust during the year the bicentenario oil pipeline reversal strategy saw the completion of 53 reversal cycles allowing us to reduce the impact of the attacks and the illegal valves installed on the caño limón coveñas oil pipeline in 2018 thanks to the stable operations and process optimization the downstream witnessed outstanding operating

the previous year throughput composition was 77 domestic crude and 23 imported versus 50 domestic and 50 imported in 2017 the results of the refinery optimization process were positive as reflected in gross refining margin of usd 11 per barrel up 15 4 over 2017 the execution of initiatives to separate light and intermediate crude oils contributed to the barrancabermeja refinery s profitable and efficient production of 221 600 barrels per day up 5 6 over the previous year bioenergy also continued the stabilization phase of its agricultural and industrial operations achieving production of 47 1 million liters of ethanol in 2018 compared to 36 million liters in 2017 operational synergies between the two refineries as well as operating adjustments among the different segments allowed us to offer the country cleaner fuels in december b2 diesel distributed in colombia averaged 16 parts per million ppm of sulfur with 108 ppm in gasoline lower than the current colombian standards of 50 ppm for diesel and 300 for gasoline we fulfill our commitment to supply b2 diesel with a maximum 25 ppm of sulfur in the city of medellín and the area of influence of the aburrá valley and levels as low

yves here while this post makes some important points about carbon pricing i disagree vehemently with the notion that carbon prices and cap and trade are similar and therefore i also differ with the author s assertion that the carbon price is important and not the mechanism for achieving it carbon taxes provide for a fixed price for carbon or one that is predictable for instance rising roughly in line with inflation that allows businesses to plan and encourages them to make investments in carbon output reduction even conservative economists like greg mankiw have strongly favored carbon taxes over cap and trade going back to the 2007 ipcc reports at that time the financial times in an editorial also called for fixing a price on carbon via carbon taxes by contrast aside from the well established difficulty of establishing whether the offset activity actually took place or alternatively did but was used as a offset multiple times is that cap and trade leads to volatile prices in fact the traders have incentives to encourage volatility since that s more profitable if nothing else more volatile markets typically have wider bid asked spreads there have been many reports of price manipulation by carbon traders note that the author bizarrely posits a process where you set quantity in a cap and trade regime and then acts as if that is the same as fixing a price in a market you can set price or quantity but not both that was one of the big criticism of qe that the various central banks targeted quantities when they should have set prices by frank ackerman principal economist at synapse energy economics in cambridge mass and one of the founders of dollars sense which publishes triple crisis originally published at triple crisis we need a price on carbon emissions this opinion virtually unanimous among economists is also shared by a growing number of advocates and policymakers but unanimity disappears in the debate over how to price carbon there is continuing controversy about the merits of taxes vs cap and trade systems for pricing emissions and about the role for complementary non price policies at the risk of spoiling the suspense this blog post reaches two main conclusions first under either a carbon tax or a cap and trade system the price level matters more than the mechanism used to reach that price second under either approach a reasonably high price is necessary but not sufficient for climate policy other measures are needed to complement price incentives why taxes and cap and trade systems are similar a carbon tax raises the cost of fossil fuels directly by taxing their carbon emissions from combustion this is most easily done upstream i e taxing the oil or gas well coal mine or fuel importer who presumably passes the tax on to end users there are only hundreds of upstream fuel producers and importers to keep track of compared to millions of end users a cap and trade system accomplishes the same thing indirectly by setting a cap on total allowable emissions and issuing that many annual allowances companies that want to sell or use fossil fuels are required to hold allowances equal to their emissions if the cap is low enough to make allowances a scarce resource then the market will establish a price on allowances in effect a price on greenhouse gas emissions again it is easier to apply allowance requirements and thus induce carbon trading at the upstream level rather than on millions of end users if the price of emissions is for example 50 per ton of carbon dioxide then any firm that can reduce emissions for less than 50 a ton will do so under either a tax or cap and trade system cutting emissions reduces tax payments under a carbon tax it reduces the need to buy allowances under a cap and trade system the price not the mechanism is what matters for this incentive effect a review of the economics literature on carbon taxes vs cap and tradesystems found a number of other points of similarity either system can be configured to achieve a desired distribution of the burden on households and industries e g via free allocation of some allowances or partial exemption from taxes money raised from either taxes or allowance auctions could be wholly or partially refunded to households either approach can be manipulated to reduce effects on international competitiveness and problems raised with offsets along the lines of credits given too casually for tree planting are not unique to cap and trade a carbon tax could emerge from congress riddled with obscure loopholes which could be as damaging to the integrity of carbon pricing as any of the poorly written offset provisions of existing cap and trade systems more positively speaking either approach to carbon pricing can be carried out either with or without offsets and tax exemptions why taxes and cap and trade systems are different compared to the numerous similarities between the two approaches the list of differences is a shorter one a carbon tax is easier and cheaper to administer in theory a carbon tax provides certainty about the price of emissions while a cap and trade system provides certainty about the quantity of emissions in practice these certainties can be undone by too frequent tinkering with tax rates or emissions caps cap and trade systems have been more widely used in practice the european union s emissions trading system eu ets is the world s largest carbon market others include the linked carbon market of california and several canadian provinces and the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi among states in the northeast numerous critics have pointed to potential flaws in cap and trade such as overly generous poorly monitored offsets many recent cap and trade systems introduced in a conservative era began with caps so high and prices so low that they have little effect leaving them open to the criticism that the administrative costs are not justified by the skimpy results the price must be high enough and the cap must be low enough to alter the behavior of major emitters the same applies of course to a carbon tax starting with a trivial level of carbon tax in order to calm opponents of the measure runs the risk of proving that a carbon price has no effect the correct starting price under either system is the highest price that is politically acceptable there is no hope of getting the prices right due to the uncertain and potentially disastrous scope of climate damages perhaps the most salient difference between taxes and cap and trade is political rather than economic in an era when people like to chant no new taxes the prospects for any initiative seem worse if it involves a new tax this could explain why there is so much more experience to date with cap and trade systems beyond price incentives some carbon emitters for instance in electricity generation have multiple choices among alternative technologies in such cases price incentives alone are powerful and producers can respond incrementally retiring and replacing individual plants when appropriate other sectors face barriers that an individual firm cannot usually overcome on its own electric vehicles are not practical without an extensive recharging and repair infrastructure which is just beginning to exist in a few parts of the country in this case no reasonable level of carbon price can by itself bring an adequate nationwide electric vehicle infrastructure into existence policies that build and promote electric vehicle infrastructure are valuable complements to a carbon price they create a combined incentive to move away from gasoline yet another reason for combining non price climate policies with a carbon price is that purely price based decision making can be exhausting people could calculate for themselves the fuel saved by buying a more fuel efficient car and subtract that from the sticker price of the vehicle but it is not an easy calculation federal and state fuel economy standards make the process simpler by setting a floor underneath vehicle fuel efficiency when buying a major appliance it is possible in theory to read the energy efficiency sticker on the carton calculate your average annual use of the appliance convert it to dollars saved per year and see if that savings justifies purchase of a more efficient appliance but who does all that arithmetic even i don t want to do that calculation and i have a phd in economics and enjoy playing with numbers my guess is that virtually no one does the calculation consistently and correctly on the other hand federal and state appliance efficiency standards have often set minimum levels of required efficiency which increase over time it s much more fun to buy something off the shelf that meets those standards instead of settling in for an extended data crunching session any time you need a new fridge air conditioner washing machine in short the carbon price is what matters not the mechanism used to adopt that price and whatever the price non price climate policies are needed as well both to build things that no one company can do on its own and to make energy efficient choices accessible to all without heroic feats of calculation

tupperware s stock fell over 20 after its recent earnings miss the company has announced a turnaround plan but will it succeed tupperware tup 2 44 reported its fourth quarter 2018 earnings on jan 30 and surprised investors with weak financial performance and a 60 dividend cut the company s stock price dived over 27 in the day following the announcement and is down nearly 40 in the past year could tupperware s depressed stock price be a buying opportunity or is the dividend cut a signal that management sees more pain ahead perhaps both statements are true what drove the recent earnings miss tupperware s q4 2018 earnings were weak due to a combination of macroeconomic headwinds stemming from the strong us dollar and company specific issues q4 revenue declined 14 but only declined 7 in constant currency terms q4 eps declined 11 but only declined 6 in constant currency a strong us dollar hurts tupperware s earnings because over 90 of the company s sales are generated outside of the united states and tupperware reports its financials in terms of us dollars the reported dollar amount of revenue and earnings are worth less in us dollar terms if the foreign exchange rate in places where tupperware operates becomes relatively weaker vs the us dollar this negative impact from currency exchange rates explains half of the recent quarter s revenue decline another headwind for tupperware has been weakness in emerging market economies 67 of tupperware s sales are generated in emerging market countries such as india china mexico and brazil historically these countries have spurred growth for the company but today these markets are suffering due to a whole host of issues in the recent quarter tupperware saw its sales in asia decline 16 and its sales in south america decline 22 however not all of tupperware s problems can be blamed on external economic forces the company saw its salesforce decline 5 last year tupperware has a direct to consumer business model whereby an independent salesforce distributes the company s products directly to retailers and consumers tupperware is dependent on its direct salesforce to sell its products and a decline in the number of sales people translates to lower product sales there is no doubt that the q4 earnings report was disappointing but much of the negative drivers were due to economic factors that are out of the company s control these economic headwinds could abate or even reverse in the future also shareholders may be happy to hear that the company has a plan to address the company specific issues check out the latest tupperwareearnings call transcript a turnaround plan tupperware s turnaround plan is propelled by the dividend cut tupperware cut its dividend from 0 68 per share to 0 27 per share a 60 reduction this reduction saves the company 80 million per year in cash which it plans to invest back into the business on the q4 2018 earnings call management announced a plan to invest 100 million over the next 3 years in efforts to grow sales and reduce costs specifically the company wants to deploy technology that will help improve the productivity of its salesforce by spending less time on logistical and administrative duties and more time focused on speaking to customers furthermore tupperware is streamlining its organizational structure and compensation so that there are fewer layers of management and salespeople are better incentivized the company noted that a reduction in management headcount would result in 50 million in annual cost savings beginning in 2020 tupperware has suffered a decline in its salesforce headcount over the past year which has translated into a decline in revenue because tupperware uses a direct to customer salesforce the company must constantly work toward recruiting and retaining productive salespeople for the business to thrive the company believes that the investments it plans to make over the next 3 years will improve the size and the productivity of the salesforce helping to drive revenue growth tupperware s turnaround plan appears very sensible the big question mark is execution if the changes being made do not result in a better salesforce headcount and improved productivity then the company may need to explore a deeper rethink of the brand or business model shoring up the balance sheet in addition to the cost cuts and growth investments announced tupperware will be allocating the remaining savings from its reduced dividend payments to paying down debt and opportunistically repurchasing shares metric financials as of q4 2018 in millions total debt 888 9 2018 adjusted ebitda reported 351 6 debt to ebitda ratio 2 53x tupperware carries 888 9 million in total debt and reported 2018 adjusted ebitda of 351 6 million ebitda is a measure of earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is the measure of earnings most commonly used for assessing leverage because it shows a company s capacity to service interest payments taking the ratio of debt to ebitda shows the company has a leverage ratio of 2 53x while tupperware does not have an unsustainable level of indebtedness leverage could become a more serious problem if earnings continue to decline the company is targeting a leverage ratio below 2 0x over the next couple years with 149 million in cash on its balance sheet and over 125 million in cash flow expected for 2019 reducing leverage likely won t be a herculean task the company will be balancing debt reductions with share buybacks last year tupperware announced a 200 million share buyback plan the company executed 100 million of buybacks in 2018 and recommitted to finishing the remaining 100 million of buybacks opportunistically share buybacks give the company more flexibility than dividends sacrificing dividends for a stronger balance sheet is a bitter pill to swallow for shareholders however shoring up the balance sheeting and shifting to a more flexible capital return policy will protect the company ahead of the next economic downturn putting the pieces together the depressed stock price and dividend cut have rattled tupperware s shareholders however there is a silver lining to the story much of the weak financial performance over the past quarter and year can be attributed to macroeconomic forces which may abate or even reverse in the future the company specific issues are fixable and tupperware has taken major steps to address the problems the dividend cut is a red flag to the market but it provides the company with the flexibility it needs to turnaround the company and improve its balance sheet despite the dividend cut the stock still yields nearly 4 which could be attractive to prospective investors the deciding factor in the fate of tupperware s stock will be execution the company has reset expectations and laid out a viable recovery plan it will be important to see how the company executes against that plan over the next year to determine if the turnaround will be successful or if greater changes will need to be made

ceo of ecopetrol 2018 was an outstanding year for ecopetrol both operationally and financially today we are a more efficient and disciplined company with better technical capacity constantly seeking

goal by achieving 720 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day despite some operational events and public security difficulties in the first quarter the production increase was due to the successful drilling campaign and the use of technology in the enhanced recovery program it is significant that in the fourth quarter we achieved average production of 733 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 2 2 over the same period the previous year and the basis for meeting our 2019 goal we ended the year with a solid cash position of cop 14 5 trillion the year s liquidity position allowed us to prepay

the new mexico commission dismissed our community solar filing without prejudice we will continue to evaluate our options to determine if a voluntary renewable option can be successfully approved and implemented in the future in new mexico despite the complexity and the number of proposals and initiatives our team faced this year except for retaining obtaining regulatory approval for new mexico community solar facility we accomplished all of our goals on slide 5 i will discuss some of our sustainability and financial accomplishments in august 2018 we issued our first corporate sustainability report as we ve recognized the need to communicate and make public our efforts and achievements regarding environmental and corporate sustainability initiatives the report demonstrates our commitment to transparency and continuous improvement regarding environmental social and governance performance during the year we received the 2018 energy star partner of the year award for our efforts in kilowatt hour savings and increased education regarding energy efficiency in september of 2018 we were awarded the first ever community partner award from the el paso neighborhood association coalition the award was given to the company in recognition of its continued partnership and community outreach efforts with the city s neighborhood associations additionally we achieved our highest customer service ratings in 2018 each year since 2009 we survey our customers to measure their satisfaction with the level of service they receive last year we received the highest ratings since 2009 i would like to thank our customer care team for their dedicated efforts and commitment to providing superior service to our customers turning to our financial accomplishments in may 2018 our board of directors approved a 7 5 increase in the annual cash dividend this illustrates our board s continuous commitment to return value to shareholders in june the company issued 125 million of 10 year senior unsecured notes at the same time the company guaranteed the issuance of 65 million of seven year senior unsecured notes by the rio grande resources trust we utilized the trust to finance our portion of nuclear fuel for palo verde the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes provided additional liquidity as the proceeds were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility additionally in september 2018 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement under the terms of the agreement the company has available 350 million in a revolving credit facility with the term ending on september 13th 2023 also in 2018 we were successful in lowering our texas customer bills through reductions to our texas fixed fuel factor in fact we reduced our texas fixed fuel factor by approximately 34 over the course of 2018 in terms of earnings in 2018 we reported non gaap earnings per share of 2 33 which was approximately 5 higher than prior year and was at the upper end of our 2018 non gaap guidance range building on our accomplishments in 2018 i will now turn to our 2019 objectives on slide 7 in terms of regulatory objectives we anticipate obtaining approval for our texas transmission and distribution cost recovery factor in the second half of 2019 we filed our transmission cost recovery factor on january 25th and plan to file for approval of the distribution cost recovery factor in late march another important objective for 2019 is seeking the necessary regulatory approvals for our new generating resources in the second half of this year also in 2019 we will be filing our next general rate case in new mexico as you may recall we are required to file our next rate case no later than july 31st 2019 we anticipate filing that case using historical test year ended december 31st 2018 and we re already working on putting together our rate filing package another vital regulatory objective is to file a general rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission later this year we plan on filing for recovery of an increased transmission revenue requirement we re still working on the analysis to determine the size and timing of the request another goal for 19 is to seek legislative clarification for ami in texas for the first half of 2019 legislation has been introduced in both the senate and the house during the current texas legislative session which ends in may that would allow the three of remaining non ercot utilities including el paso electric to have the opportunity to seek regulatory approval of an ami deployment plan and related cost recovery if the texas legislation is approved we will then be allowed to develop the business case and then seek regulatory approval in texas and new mexico if successful this would allow us to make investments to modernize our electric grid that will further improve our operational efficiency while expanding customer products and services such as smart pricing options high usage alerts and online energy management tools turning to slide 8 i will briefly cover our 2019 financial and sustainability objectives in 2019 we anticipate raising capital in the equity markets to maintain a balanced capital structure the timing and size of the equity issuance is still being analyzed and we re currently awaiting approval from new mexico commission and ferc in the second quarter of 2019 we anticipate refinancing 100 6 million of the 2009 series a and b pollution control bonds we may remarket the bonds or replace them with senior notes in an equivalent amount as part of our strategic plan we continue to focus our efforts on optimizing our operations and maintenance expenses we will continue to look for improvements to our current processes that may result in lowering our operations and maintenance expenses over the long term turning to our sustainability goals in 2019 employee safety will continue to be an area of focus this year we have set expectations to improve our safety culture recommit ourselves to safety as a core value and reduce the risk of injuries we are increasing training and awareness in particular for our high risk employees who face the most hazards in their jobs we are committed to protecting our most important asset our employees in 2019 we are also working on an initiative to establish our long term goals to further improve our carbon footprint we lowered our carbon footprint by more than 16 over the past three years but we re constantly looking for additional ways to practice sustainability another way we will serve our community is to partner with our customers on dedicated resource options including renewable resources we re currently collaborating with new mexico state university to investigate opportunities regarding renewable energy batteries climate action and microgrid development initiatives our 2019 objectives also include reaching a new collective bargaining agreements with the international brotherhood of electrical workers local 960 which represents approximately 37 of our workforce we look forward to working with our union to reach a new agreement that will allow us to continue to provide our customers with a superior level of service lastly we continue to build out our high level of customer service by improving our engagement efforts through a new through new website and billing options as you can see 2019 will be a busy and challenging year but we re already working hard toward accomplishing these objectives many of our goals are tied to the continuous growth we are experiencing in our service territory nothing highlights the growth in our communities better than the information on the chart we ve provided on slide 9 this chart demonstrates a pattern of consistent and continuous growth in our service territory since 1998 as you can see our megawatt hour sales continue to trend upward on an annual basis in fact we have set a new megawatt hour sales record in 19 out of the last 20 years due to the sustained growth and the demands placed on our system we ve identified the need to plan for upgrades and expansion of our transmission and distribution infrastructure and for additional generation resources to be in place by the year 2023 in terms of the additional resources on slide 10 we have provided an anticipated timeline for the approval and commercial operation date for the resources selected in our rfp on june 20th excuse me on june 30th 2017 epe issued an all source rfp to select additional long term cost effective and reliable electric resources to commence operations by the 2022 2023 summer peak season in december 2018 we announced the winning bids which included the expected energy purchase of 200 megawatts of utility scale solar resources 100 megawatts of battery storage and the construction of a 226 megawatt natural gas combustion turbines at the company s newman power station the selected proposals are subject to the execution of contracts following negotiations with the winning bidders obtaining the applicable environmental and construction related permits and obtaining necessary approvals from the texas and new mexico commissions as you can see on the timeline we anticipate bringing online 100 megawatts of generating capacity in time to meet our peak in 2022 and an additional 276 megawatts in time to meet our peak in 2023 the resource additions in 2022 include excuse me the resource additions in 2023 include the 226 megawatt natural gas combustion turbine at an expected cost of 143 million in addition the company may purchase 50 megawatts to 150 megawatts of wind and solar generated power to provide for fuel diversity and energy cost savings turning to slide 11 we ve provided a timeline for the 2019 texas cost recovery filings as i mentioned earlier on january 25th the company filed its transmission cost recovery factor the company has invested approximately 53 million net of retirements on a texas retail jurisdictional basis in transmission related infrastructure from october 1 2016 through september 30th 2018 that s not currently reflected in rates therefore the company is seeking to recover approximately 8 2 million through a surcharge we currently anticipate receiving approval for the tcrf in the second half of 2019 based on the timelines of other utilities in texas we also plan to file for approval to implement a distribution cost recovery factor in late march 2019 for the costs incurred from october 1 2016 through december 31st 2018 the company will request authorization to recover distribution related infrastructure not currently reflected in rates we also anticipate receiving approval for the dcrf in the second half of this year the timeline is subject to change since this is our first time requesting approval under these recovery mechanisms i will now turn the call over to nathan nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks mary if you ll turn to slide 12 i will briefly cover our key earnings drivers for the year compared to prior year beginning with the negative drivers earnings was lower by 0 46 per share for the year primarily due to net realized and unrealized losses on securities held in our palo verde decommissioning trust funds this chart clearly demonstrates that the decline in the equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2018 had a significant effect on our annual earnings during the fourth quarter of 2018 the us equity markets experienced the greatest overall fourth quarter decline since 2008 as we have discussed on previous calls in 2018 we began recognizing unrealized gains and losses related to equity securities held in our ndt directly in the company s statement of operations as required by one of the recently adopted accounting standards the adoption of this new standard added the potential for significant earnings volatility and this is indeed what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 as such we have started reporting a non gaap financial measure which backs out these gains and losses earnings also declined in the for the year by 0 01 per share due to retail non fuel based revenues this reduction was primarily due to a refund of approximately 200 sorry 28 2 million for the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate due to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 this was partially offset by 7 7 million base rate increase related to the final order issued in our 2017 texas rate case after excluding these items retail non fuel based revenues had a solid increase of 19 8 million due to continued customer growth and favorable weather earnings for the year also declined by 0 11 per share due to increased depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to increased plant balances earnings declined by 0 10 per share due to the palo verde performance rewards of 5 million associated with the 2013 to 2015 performance periods which was recorded in 2017 there was no comparable amount recorded in 2018 we also experienced decline in earnings for the year primarily due to increased operation and maintenance expenses related to outage costs at our rio grande power station i d like to point out that even though o m expenses were higher for the year during the fourth quarter earnings increased by 0 02 due to a decrease in maintenance and outage costs at our newman power station when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 turning to the positive earnings drivers for the year earnings increased by 0 41 per share due to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 that reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 earnings for the year were also positively impacted by decrease palo verde o m expenses primarily due to lower incentive and administration and general benefits as mary mentioned earlier we are pleased to report adjusted earnings of 2 33 per share for the year which was at the upper end of our non gaap earnings guidance range now turning to slide 13 we have provided a comparative analysis of the percentage change in the average number of customers and megawatt hour sales by customer class for 2018 as compared to 2017 we continue to see consistent growth in the average number of customers served during the year the average number of customers served increased by 1 6 over prior year megawatt hour sales also increased in 2018 by 2 4 over prior year this increase was primarily due to a 5 9 increase in the residential customer class favorable weather during the second and third quarter served as a primary driver for the increase in the residential customer class if you will now turn to slide 14 i will discuss the impacts of weather in more detail the chart includes a comparison of normal weather to actual whether recorded in our service territory as you can see heating degree days in 2018 were 27 3 higher than the same period last year but 5 8 below the 10 year average in 2018 cooling degree days were 8 8 higher than 2017 and 10 9 above the 10 year average above normal weather during our second and third quarters helped to boost sales and lead to an all time megawatt hour sales record for 2018 turning to slide 15 i will briefly discuss our capital requirements and liquidity on december 31st 2018 our liquidity was approximately 314 million which consisted of a cash balance of approximately 13 million plus borrowings available on our revolving credit facility our capital our cash capital expenditures in 2018 were 240 million and we expect our 2019 expenditures to be approximately 249 million as mentioned earlier in the presentation in 2018 we credited approximately 28 million to customers for the reduction in our federal corporate income tax rate in terms of cash dividends we paid 57 5 million in cash dividends for the 12 months ended 2018 in addition on january 31st our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 36 per share payable on march 29th 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 15th 2019 if you now turn to slide 16 i would like to provide the latest five year projections for our capital expenditures the revision to our projections is primarily attributable to a reduction for the resources selected in our rfp process partially offset by the inclusion of costs associated with ami over the next five years we currently anticipate spending 1 3 billion which includes the construction of a 228 megawatt hour megawatt natural gas combustion turbines scheduled for completion in 2023 at an expected cost of approximately 143 million the projections also include 85 million of initial costs for the deployment of ami which is comparable to spending by other utilities this estimate is subject to change based on both legislative and regulatory approval turning to slide 17 we are initiating 2019 gaap earnings guidance with a range of 2 25 to 2 80 the midpoint of the range assumes 10 year average weather the gaap guidance range includes 6 3 million to 14 8 million of realized and unrealized net gains for the ndt it is important to point out that so far this year domestic and international equity markets have rebounded from the lower levels that were seen during the fourth quarter of 2018 after removing the estimated realized and unrealized net gains our non gaap guidance range is 2 10 to 2 45 per share as our service territory and our system grows we continue to experience some regulatory lag however utilizing the transmission and distribution cost recovery factors should help minimize the impact also we have discussed on previous calls it is possible that we may record a loss in the first quarter of 2019 due to seasonality of our business that concludes our prepared remarks andrea could you please open this up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we ll go first to julien dumoulin smith at bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning can you hear me nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah good morning julien mary e kipp president and chief executive officer yeah good morning julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey so a few follow up questions if you can first let me just hit some of the details here on the credit side and the equity raise just how do you think about your sort of debt metrics where they are today obviously there s been some commentary already from the agencies but and where do you need to go i know you said that you re not going to be specific today about the total quantum of equity needed but just want to make sure we understand where you are today and where you need to go from a credit perspective and i m assuming that you want to sustain your current respective ratings nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer that s right well you know 2018 we still have free cash flow we still did had a pretty good cash flow in 2018 but as you know we will become a taxpayer in 2019 and that put some pressure on us we re not flowing back the excess deferred taxes yet that will come so and then we see this capex projections being higher in the next few years so obviously maintaining the balanced capital structure is a priority for us and then and we see that as being looking at maintaining like you say the at least the we re at bbb from an s p perspective and that s a real focus is to maintain that and so as we go forward that is a priority and that s why we re really focused on the equity issuances as a possibility for that julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay and then let me come back to this twist as far as i perceive it with respect to the 50 megawatt to 150 megawatts or rather the upside of the procurement rather is maybe the better way to say this right so you d run the rpf you announced those results already but then in the slides here you talk about purchasing it seems like an additional quantum if i if you will can you talk to that a little bit mary e kipp president and chief executive officer yeah this is mary julien i can talk about that a little bit these are actually based on some bids that we received in the rfp process but unfortunately they didn t have capacity associated with them so they didn t meet what was required in the current rfp analysis however what we would we re thinking about doing and obviously a decision hasn t been made yet but what we think is there we could use them as fuel savings essentially and that s where we are in that julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just to be clear here obviously you awarded or you are proposing to award ppas here would this be a potential build on transfer situation and actually maybe even let me broaden this out is the initially awarded rfp capacity potentially a build own transfer situation at all mary e kipp president and chief executive officer you know we re still looking at negotiating the contract so we can t speak to that yet obviously that s something that we would find very desirable so whenever that s possible we ll be looking at that julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst and what s the timeline for that just if you don t mind reminding just in terms of those i know you have this little description broadly this year about when you re getting these contract done but the timeline specifically around the build own transfer bot piece of that maybe mary e kipp president and chief executive officer so we are negotiating contracts right now and we expect them to be done in the first half of the year julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent and then sorry one last one just with respect to the ami effort the timeline there how are you thinking about let s just say assuming you get a supportive legislation this year in the texas legislature what s the timeline to getting an ami program deployed shall we say right so starting from mid year this year onwards mary e kipp president and chief executive officer yeah so assuming that we are able to get the approval of the legislature which is obviously the key first step and we re very hopeful we ll get it because we really think it s a huge benefit to our communities here in texas we would then begin an rfp process and we would expect to conclude that in the second half of the year and then we would have to go in probably during the first half of 2020 to seek approval of a program and then we d start incurring cost in 2020 or 2021 including back office and customer technologies julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it all right excellent i ll leave it there thank you all very much mary e kipp president and chief executive officer thanks julien nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks julien operator operator instructions we ll go next to vedula murti at avon capital vedula murti avon capital analyst good morning mary e kipp president and chief executive officer hey good morning nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer how re you doing vedula murti avon capital analyst good in the 2019 guidance what level of rate relief is assumed with regards to both the with regards to texas as well both the transmission as well as the distribution nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer well we recently filed the transmission cost recovery factor at about an 8 2 million and we see kind of a similar level for the distribution cost recovery factor and then those we it will take about six months we think this is the first time we re through that so we re cautious about how the process works but we think about six months we should be able to work through those process so neither of those really come online until the come on will affect will be implemented until the second half of the year vedula murti avon capital analyst okay because looks like based on the way you ve filed these things it would seem like transmission one should be available for the summer peak while the distribution increase may not be there for the summer peak nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer you know that s why it will be the timing will make it difficult for the transmission to be there for the summer peak we re hoping that the tail end of summer we would be able to get the transmission and then toward the back end of summer would be the distribution mary e kipp president and chief executive officer and the reason for the difference in timing is for the distribution cost recovery factor we have to have our annual earnings monitoring report filed with the commission because one of the criteria for that to seek recovery is you ve to show you re not over earning and which we would not be but we plan to file that as soon as we have that ready and hopefully by the end of march nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer so this year we won t get as much as a benefit out of the transmission distribution cost recovery factor because of first year and we delayed but we re very excited that going forward this is a good way just kind of dig in reduce the regulatory lag that we re experiencing mary e kipp president and chief executive officer especially because a lot of our capex as you ve seen in the slides is going to be on the wire side so we re we think this is a really positive development for the company starting to use these vedula murti avon capital analyst no i certainly appreciate that and understand that but of the 16 million request under the assumption that the this dollars in aggregate are approved but based on the time line how much realistically falls into 19 versus 20 nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer well again i wouldn t get into specifics but those are the general requests and it is the second half of the year vedula murti avon capital analyst okay also in terms of equity what is the in terms of your guidance what s the share count assumption in terms of incremental equity for your 2019 guidance nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah well again we won t get into specifics on that because it is a range and we will we put in like all the guidance includes a lot of factors around that so we won t get into that but we will just because we haven t come down to the detail on the amount of the equity issuance but it was factored in there to some extent vedula murti avon capital analyst also you probably waiting on the request for the approval it was up to 200 million i guess can you help us in terms of timing wise in terms of how the over what years or how are you thinking about that nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah well so the 200 million gives us some flexibility in the timing of when we would go in and again vedula we haven t come up with the specifics but that is that amount we think gives us some flexibility on timing vedula murti avon capital analyst does that flexibility also contemplate the abilities for funding the equity if you re able to reach an agreement with some of the rfp winners to build to buy like as julien was describing nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah well i think that comes back to the what mary was saying that we are looking at some negotiation looking at negotiating those contracts and we probably won t get into too much of the specifics of that vedula murti avon capital analyst okay thank you operator thank you next we ll move to chris ellinghaus at williams capital chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst hey guys how are you nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer hey chris good morning mary e kipp president and chief executive officer how are you chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst good can you give us a little bit of color on what you ve seen in first quarter weather so far nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah it was a little bit better than a little bit colder than last year but a little bit but still below average when it comes to the number of heating slightly below average on the number of heating degree days so it s a little better than last year but still little bit below average chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst okay and can you give us any sense of what you ve seen out of the texas legislature so far in terms of ami mary e kipp president and chief executive officer we had members of our local delegation carry the bill at both the house and the senate so you know it s a political process still and so it s always subject to the human element but we re very very hopeful and we think that our leadership recognizes the benefits from this to our community chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst okay and as far as you gave us some idea of what the dcrf might look like this year are those numbers you think sort of what baseline annual numbers might look like or are you that far behind that these might be a little bit above normal sort of going forward at the moment nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that s right because this includes 24 months to 27 months of capex and so going forward we would see more of an annual amount so those amounts are probably on the higher side of what we would see going forward chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst so maybe like half nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean it depends on our wire spent from year to year but in that kind of range chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst assuming your customer and low growth continues at similar rates that would maybe suggest about half would be what the going forward rate might be mary e kipp president and chief executive officer yeah i think that s fair chris ellinghaus williams capital analyst okay thanks a lot i appreciate it nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks chris mary e kipp president and chief executive officer thank you operator and we ll take a follow up from vedula murti at avon capital vedula murti avon capital analyst yes my understanding is that there is an effort in the with the legislature to empower the puct to be able to use forecasted test years for rate cases to help mitigate regulatory lag i m simply wondering kind of what you re aware about that effort and status and what you think the prospects are nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer well one of the nice things we in new mexico we have the opportunity of using forecast tests so we ve historically not done that quite as much in order to because we still have growth in the service territory and that growth sometimes doesn t get back or you have to give that into the in the filings also when we do look at the looking out to the combustion turbine in 2022 2023 if there is a possibility of picking those up as post year adjustments and that that we could see that as a potential benefit for us so again our growth helps us that forecast test years doesn t benefit us quite as much as some of our peers mary e kipp president and chief executive officer so vedula i haven t heard anything specifically about a future test years in the texas legislature so forgive my ignorance if that is the case what i have heard discussed is the possibility of generation rider i know that some of the other utilities have been trying to get that approved but our main focus really has been on amis we think that s the most beneficial to our customers and our service territory vedula murti avon capital analyst yeah i think i was kind of referring to generation rider probably more broader context but did you if it s we are right now focused particularly on a generation rider i guess what how do you see that right now mary e kipp president and chief executive officer you know i ll go back to what i said on ami it s a political process and a lot of different groups have different interests in that so we ll just have to see where it comes out vedula murti avon capital analyst thank you operator we ll take a follow up from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey sorry guys to follow up here but i just wanted to clarify this how do you think about your earned roe baked into the 19 guidance here again i know you talked about normalized weather but i just want to understand earned roe expectations and how those are established and i m really principally obviously asking more on distribution side than the transition side if we can kind of dig into that nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so again well we are we are having some regulatory lag i would say if you look at the midpoint of our guidance you have an earned roe that s probably right below 9 so a little bit a little bit on the below what on a gaap basis and so that s still we re still struggling with regulatory lag trying to improve that we think again we re not as we mentioned kind of earlier in the q a that we re not really getting a significant benefit of that with the transmission and distribution cost recovery factor this year but that will go forward but again that we still need to work and we re still having some regulatory lag that we need to try to improve on julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it but the average reflected on the distribution side between the two jurisdictions is slightly below 9 on the distribution side nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer well we really don t do it break it out by service but that s our overall gaap our overall earnings is probably around just below the 9 range on a companywide basis julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it all right excellent i just wanted to clarify that nathan t hirschi senior vice president and chief financial officer all right operator and that does conclude the question and answer session i ll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks mary e kipp president and chief executive officer thank you all for joining us on today s call we look forward to seeing you in march at the bank of america merrill

the flexibility to efficiently ramp up and down depending on market conditions with an aim to generate free cash flow in the e p business down to wti prices of 45 per barrel taylor will provide more color in a moment but i want to highlight a few key points regarding 2018 for you this morning as we wrap up the year first our williston basin asset performance remains strong as we completed 28 wells in the quarter and we re able to capture more gas in wild basin in aggregate our fourth quarter volumes averaged 88 300 boes per day in line with midpoint guidance second omp successfully started its 200 million a day gas plant in early december bringing our total processing capacity to about 320 million per day and making omp the second largest natural gas processor in the basin congratulations to the oasis team for a huge win here they did a great job using their subsurface knowledge to anticipate increasing gas production and tightness in gas processing capacity this allowed oasis to stay ahead of the curve in capturing its own production and also led to multiple third party gas contracts to allow others to do the same third in the delaware our delineation program is going well as we continue to integrate this world class asset and prepare for full field development we had a few wins this year in the delaware basin we successfully executed a major development program exceeded our financial expectations expanded our footprint and hit our target exit rate of 6 000 boes per day the team has also done an exceptional job with our service partner so that we can get our work done as well as managing our takeaway capacity while bridging two big takeaway projects that will start hitting in the second half of the year fourth and what proved to be a difficult a d market our team closed approximately 360 million of non core asset sales which have helped high grade our portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet fifth our operating efficiency continues to stand out among our peers page 15 of our investor presentation highlights our recycle ratio which is top tier within our peer group reflecting a combination of strong well productivity cash margins and capital cost efficiency as we turn to 2019 oasis is in a formidable position to generate significant free cash flow driven by top tier capital efficient inventory with our commitment to generate free cash flow at a 50 oil price we lowered our 2019 e p capital plan by 40 compared to 2018 we expect capital efficiency to improve in 2019 driven by improved operating efficiency and lower service cost additionally we ve entered into an arrangement with omp that significantly reduces oasis portion of williston midstream capex in 2019 we have a proven track record of capital discipline and while prioritizing cash flow generation and returns over volume growth we have positioned the company to succeed through volatile market conditions going forward development of the williston will continue to be a significant driver of activity and provides a source of free cash flow to fund delaware activity even with oil price trading well above 50 today we intend to execute on our planned activity for 2019 and will use excess free cash flow to reduce leverage our williston development activity will be concentrated in wild basin with additional completions primarily across indian hills alger and red bank total williston spending is expected to account for about 75 of our drilling and completion budget driving williston production to increase modestly year over year while generating free cash flow that more than funds a slight delaware outspend in the delaware our strategy is centered on delineating our low cost highly economic position understanding the subsurface and holding acreage in 2019 we no longer expect to pick up a third development rig which was originally slated for the second half of the year this decision reflects the current commodity outlook and also drilling efficiencies that allow us to hold our acreage with fewer rigs than originally anticipated i m confident that the delaware asset will be a major value driver for the company for years to come with two core assets in two of the lowest cost oil basins in the united states we have a strong inventory depth allowing us to earn attractive returns with low prices additionally we have differential midstream and services businesses that have been a tremendous competitive advantage we believe oasis is one of the best positioned companies in the sector and represents a uniquely attractive investment opportunity with that i ll turn the call over to taylor taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer thanks tommy in 2019 we expect to spend between 540 million and 560 million of e p and other capital across both basins with about 85 of that capital for drilling and completions the program should deliver production of about 86 000 boes per day to 91 000 boes per day for the full year as well as in the fourth quarter of 2019 essentially in line with the fourth quarter of 2018 our oil cut is expected to average approximately 72 in 2019 which implies a cut of about 71 for the fourth quarter the decline in oil cut versus 2018 reflects a few different factors including the start up of our new gas plant which allows oasis to capture higher volumes a program in the williston that was more focused on wild basin which has a higher gor than our pdp base even though the wild basin wells are some of the best oil producers in the williston and to restrain delaware program which has a higher oil cut in 2018 oasis delivered strong production growth from new wells especially later in the year these high rate wells also have fairly high first year declines which directly impacts our base decline which we now estimate at about 40 exit to exit base declines get shallower in 2020 and beyond and the delaware will steadily become a larger part of the development program as a result overall oil production in 2020 should flatten out or even slightly grow based on maintaining a program and a 50 world that generates free cash flow in the williston we are currently running three rigs but expect to drop to two in the next month or so we quickly adjusted our plan in the fourth quarter and released two rigs so we have effectively adjusted our 2019 plan from five rigs to two rigs likewise our frac activity has gone from three to two crews as a result we expect to complete about 70 gross operated wells this year well productivity and inventory depth remain key strengths in our williston position and as a result our relative well performance is very strong slide 12 of our investor deck highlights our 12 month average cumulative oil equivalent production per 1 000 foot of lateral versus our peers our continued focus on high intensity completion optimization has paid dividends as you can see we re at the top of the pack on a boe and on the oil basis as can see on page 10 and 11 of our deck early delineation results from various step out areas are also encouraging we drilled three wells in painted woods in 2018 which are trending well and validate our view that the area s economic below 45 per barrel while a moderator program is likely to push back painted woods development oasis has a huge advantage in having this deep inventory secured with no drilling obligations separately we continue to monitor third party activity around our south cottonwood and montana positions based on these results these areas are also economical at sub 45 pricing and have been moved into our top tier inventory economics have certainly improved with advanced completion techniques and we are evaluating the possibility of drilling select wells in these areas as part of our 2019 and 2020 programs in the delaware we expect to run two rigs throughout the year completing nine to 11 wells and volumes are expected to increase approximately 50 year over year and exit 2019 at 8 000 boes per day to 9 000 boes per day our prior estimates anticipated about 2 times the capital we have currently budgeted for 2019 which would have resulted in an exit rate of 11 000 boes per day we continue to enhance operations and expect productivity to improve as we progress drilling and design efficiency last year we drilled a three well wolfcamp a spacing test with two in the lower and one in the upper interval which we expect to complete shortly the remainder of the 2019 program will be primarily focused on the wolfcamp a with additional drilling across other zones including the wolfcamp b and c as well as the 3rd bone springs we will also conduct another spacing test with an eight well pad to be drilled in 2019 and completed and brought on production in 2020 as we ve said in the past it is important for us to understand productivity and spacing before beginning full field development operations i would now direct you to slide 5 of our deck as we move on to inventory in the williston we have identified 1 385 gross operated locations with breakeven pricing at or below 45 per barrel which we think about as top tier locations at our 2019 drilling pace this equates to 20 years of low cost inventory in the williston alone this generally represents eight to 10 wells per dsu across this acreage and has been optimized over the past five years that we have been drilling in full field development in the delaware we stand at approximately 600 to 700 gross operated locations which like our top tier bakken have breakeven pricing below 45 per barrel to close our team has done an outstanding job of executing on our plans this year williston development is going well and we continue to drive efficiency and capital productivity in the delaware the team has done a great job of integrating the asset delivering solid well results and progressing our efforts to move closer to full field development with that i ll now turn the call over to michael michael h lou executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks taylor as you ve seen in years past our low cost assets and top notch operational team have delivered strong performance this past year we high graded our asset base further through a series of divestitures and new bolt ons in the delaware we are in a great position to enhance returns drive capital efficiency across our deep portfolio and generate significant free cash flow since 2015 oasis has been dedicated to living within e p cash flow we created omp in 2017 to help finance midstream spending and in 2018 used a portion of divestiture proceeds to expand the d c program during the fourth quarter we sold down oasis interests in bobcat and beartooth devcos for 250 million which resulted in oasis receiving approximately 170 million in cash and 3 95 million in omp common units the cash portion of the sale covered oasis midstream spending in 2018 as we turn to 2019 the current plan calls for oasis to generate approximately 150 million of free cash flow at 50 wti oil price which increases to approximately 230 million at 60 per barrel slide 9 of our investor presentation highlights our free cash flow position and bridges the components of our free cash flow we define free cash flow as stand alone e p ebitda plus oasis ownership of midstream and distributions from omp minus cash interest minus total capex attributable to oasis including midstream the midstream portion of oasis capex is minimized due to a recently approved arrangement between oasis and omp where omp will fund oasis portion of growth capital in our bobcat devco we believe this arrangement is mutually beneficial for both oasis and omp as omp can increase its ownership position at a fair value and oasis is able to focus its spending on its e p business as a result of this strategy oasis ownership in bobcat is expected to decline from 75 to approximately 65 by year end in 2019 oasis continues to expect to fund some midstream capital at the oasis level primarily consisting of select delaware midstream projects as tommy and taylor mentioned omp is performing well and was able to sign additional third party contracts in the fourth quarter of 2018 these incremental deals help protect and diversify omp s revenue stream and omp was able to increase its 2019 ebitda projections despite a reduction in oasis completion activity with our second wild basin gas plant ramping up over the past several months we ve met our expectation for 60 utilization in early 2019 with additional third party deals signed we now expect utilization to ramp up to north of 90 by year end versus 80 at the last update going forward oasis stands to benefit from operational efficiency and flexibility provided by omp s total processing capacity of 320 million cubic feet a day we ll talk in more detail on the omp call shortly and i would also direct you to our omp press release for more color on our continued success on the midstream front on the operational cost front loe per boe ended up averaging 6 44 in 2018 and our exceptional performance allowed us to lower guidance through the year we re expecting loe to be in the 7 per boe to 8 per boe range in 2019 and the increase reflects increased use of esps in the williston and a relatively low production base in the delaware over which fixed cost can be spread williston crude differentials widened somewhat in the fourth quarter particularly in november and december but our marketing team did a fantastic job delivering pure leading differentials against the backdrop of historically high refinery maintenance that occurred in pad 2 as we head into 2019 williston oil differentials have returned to levels seen throughout the first year of last first half of last year in the delaware crude differentials have been volatile but several new haul long haul pipelines coming online over the course of 2019 should debottleneck the area for years to come we currently expect differentials to be in the 1 50 to 3 50 range over the course of the year additionally marketing and transportation and gathering expenses per boe should be in the 2 50 per boe to 3 00 per boe range i want to briefly address the revisions to our financials that you will see in our press release and detailed in our 10 k as i mentioned our marketing team does an outstanding work optimizing our price realizations benefiting our shareholders working interest partners and royalty owners for example given our size and scale in the williston our team engages in low risk paired buy sell transactions within the basin to reduce gathering and transportation expenses we have historically shown all of these transactions on a net basis we will now be showing certain transactions on a gross basis given their characteristics most importantly no restatement of our prior period financial results is required in the revisions we are making to our financial statements although they do increase both revenues and expenses result in no change to our prior period financial results such as ebitda net income and earnings per share liquidity remains strong our total borrowing base is 1 6 billion with 1 35 billion committed with only 468 million drawn as of december 31st oasis had a net debt attributable to oasis to full year 2018 ebitda multiple of under 2 7 times with adjusted ebitda attributable to oasis of 936 million for the year fourth quarter ebitda was adversely impacted by lower oil prices wider differentials and the carryover of approximately 24 million of realized hedge losses from september just to update you on our hedging program we re fairly well hedged for 2019 at around 55 to 60 of our forecasted oil volumes with one third of those volumes swaps and two thirds in collars our 2019 wti collars have an average ceiling of about 72 and four of approximately 54 this strategy protects our capital program in lower price environments while also allowing us to capture more upside should prices continue to recover we have already begun our 2020 program to sum things up 2018 was a great year for oasis as our team executed incredibly well across multiple fronts each of these steps continue to improve our size and scale diversify our asset base increase our top tier inventory while building upon our financial strength as we look to 2019 the solid foundation our team has built through focus on returns and capital efficiency allows us to generate significant free cash flow while maintaining our strong asset base with that i ll hand the call back over to drew for questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from michael hall of heikkinen energy advisors please go ahead michael hall heikkinen energy advisors analyst thanks good morning thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer good morning mike michael hall heikkinen energy advisors analyst i was curious if you could provide just a little additional color on kind of a cadence of completion profile over the course of the year i m just trying to think through obviously with the rig count coming down how that will kind of play into your normal seasonality of completions in the williston and i m trying to square that also with the kind of flat 1q 19 versus 4q 18 yeah just trying to think through how the momentum from the back half of 18 doesn t carryover a little bit into the first quarter 19 taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yeah i think you re thinking about the right way the cadence is like we normally see in the winter is going to be a little slower in the first quarter so for williston 70 wells you re going to have it s not evenly distributed like i said i don t know maybe 10 15 well kind of range and then you can spread the rest of the wells pretty evenly across the last three quarters of the year obviously less completions in the first quarter but we had a number of wells that we brought online 28 wells as tommy talked about and a number that were late in the quarter so some of that spilled over and it would just help us to keep volumes flat into the first quarter and then like we talked about we pickup activity again michael hall heikkinen energy advisors analyst okay and as you kind of think through the oil rate trajectory pointed to 71 oil mix in the fourth quarter 19 which should be kind of down a little bit exit to exit are you growing out of the year so like is there a low point in the year that comes prior to the fourth quarter or are you declining through the course of the year on oil volumes and when would you think you would flatten that out if latter is the case taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yes so we talked about the cuts in the end of last year fourth quarter you re more like 76 and the thing that s going on in williston we re bring we brought on the plant in december so quite a bit more processing capacity there at year end but just for really a month and then you get that full treatment for the whole first quarter at that new plant on so a bit of a dip if you just did the numbers we talked about it went down pretty symmetrical here or there you d be kind of you go 73 72 at the midpoint of the year and then 71 at year end which will imply there is a talk about of a bit of a drop off in oil volumes for williston but then you ve get offset with increasing oil volumes in the delaware so exit to exit all that combined a bit of a drop in oil but then as we also talked about as we get into 2020 the decline profile looks different so you go in 2019 the base decline is about 40 and that as you have less of the new wells actually the production being dominated by new wells that moderates into 2020 and so that s we think that will allow us to keep our oil volumes flat to slightly growing in 2020 relative to the exit of 2019 michael hall heikkinen energy advisors analyst okay that s helpful granularity thanks and then i guess last on my end just maybe bigger picture stepping back as you guys think about 2020 i mean kind of holistically i guess how are you thinking about that in the context of getting back to potentially some growth or is free cash flow really still the emphasis and what sort of activity do you need to have in the delaware in 2020 to keep that acreage position hold taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yeah from you know as far as the acreage hold close to the pace that we re drilling this year can do that for us but what we expect you saw from last year to this year we stepped it up a bit in the delaware and then as you look at going into 2020 likely going to be going into more full development in 2020 or close to that time again the activity level is probably going to pick up again in the delaware overall with respect to the free cash flow generation our expectation is to continue to generate free cash flow certainly in this 50 environment that we re in we can continue to do that and like i said hold volumes flat if you get into a higher price world we have the opportunity to move activity up a bit but again it s going to be focused on continuing to generate free cash flow michael hall heikkinen energy advisors analyst all right and thanks very much taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer as michael talked about that number it s in the deck you can look at the slide that shows that each of the higher price cases we generate more free cash flow and that s on page 9 of the presentation michael hall heikkinen energy advisors analyst got it thanks very helpful guys appreciate it thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer thanks michael operator the next question comes from derrick whitfield of stifel please go ahead derrick whitfield stifel analyst good morning all thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer good morning derrick whitfield stifel analyst definitely want to applaud you guys on a strong and capital disciplined outlook thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer thanks derrick whitfield stifel analyst with respect to the williston could you share with us your thoughts behind the name change from core and extended core to top tier is it simply the results on the former extended core approaching a level that s very similar to past core returns taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yes i know that s you re on the right track people that are too new if you look on the page 5 of the deck you will see that we ve really just got what we re calling top tier than additional upside acreage and the way we had this classified over the past three or four years we had this core and extended core concept and the break between those two core was 40 breakeven or below extended core was 45 and so a 5 difference between those two classifications before there was a lot of these higher intensity stimulations outside the core made sense now as you look thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer 10 and 11 taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yeah i actually direct you to page 10 and 11 the map on page 10 you can see that there s a bunch of these enhanced completions really all over the basin and all over these areas that we re now calling tier 1 and the results of the wells are pretty impressive if you look on page 11 you will see for south cottonwood painted woods and for montana how the more recent completions so there are 2016 plus completions and our recent tests in painted woods compared to all the completions done for all operators in the basins since 2017 and keep in mind most of that activity is in the core so it really compares favorably so we just think that that the highly economic position is expanded over a bigger part of the basin and are going to this single tier concept which we also think is really more in line with our peers derrick whitfield stifel analyst got it that make sense and as a follow up for you taylor speaking to the peer wells you are referencing on slide 11 how close are those designs to what you would consider best practice and could you also speak to the potential timing for your plan enhanced completion test in both montana and south cottonwood taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer so when you look at the peer wells different operators are doing different things most of this activity since 15 has been concentrated in the core and for the most part everybody is going to high intensity completions and they ve got variance of those completions but a lot of that is slick water and then the exact sizes of those kind of change so pretty much everybody has made the shift at this point to high intensity completions cemented liners and also doing plug and perf completions so we think it s pretty representative of what we ve been doing so i think a good competitor in terms of drilling additional wells in montana and south cottonwood we re evaluating that so this year or sometime next year you ll probably see that happen this it s not unlike what we did in painted woods if you guys remember we moved painted woods into an additional tier of inventory moved it up based on third party results we saw in the area and then in 2017 we went in and drilled our own wells and have seen as good or better results than what we saw from competitors so you can expect a similar approach for both south cottonwood and montana derrick whitfield stifel analyst very helpful thanks for your comments taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer you bet operator the next question comes from david deckelbaum of cowen please go ahead david deckelbaum cowen analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my questions thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer hey dave david deckelbaum cowen analyst michael congrats on consummating the deal with omp on the capex agreement i m curious how you re thinking about that going into 2020 and beyond should we think about this as sort of a perpetual structure that you could turn to until you get done with ownership threshold before you would be i guess effectively losing control michael h lou executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks for that david this arrangement is clearly only for this year however what we have said in the past from an oasis standpoint is that we want to spend free cash flow we either want that to go back to the balance sheet at the parent level or go into our e p capital spending program and that s how we continue to think about it so midstream capital for the most part we do want to be spent at the mlp level whether it s through a drop down or it s a capital expenditure arrangement like we settled on now that s kind of how we re thinking about it so we ll see how this continues to work for both sides we think it s a win win for both sides and it will be great and if that continues obviously we can think about that for 2020 and beyond as well david deckelbaum cowen analyst that s helpful appreciate that and then just on the 19 plan and taylor you talked about the oil mix and gave some thoughts on to oil growth going into 2020 and sounds like you would be adding some activity in the delaware and your sort of high level planning now on sort of a 50 world does that come at the expense of williston capital going beyond 2019 or i guess another way at what point do you see that delaware becoming sort of almost an even capital allocation to the williston taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yes so the first question around activity levels and impact on the williston yes if we continue to be at 50 world the program is going to be fairly similar one of the things to keep in mind that if we are in a 50 world you re going to continue to see deflation and so we think that s helpful in being able to execute on a similar program we also would expect that we ll continue to improve our efficiencies and cycle times and bring down costs especially in the delaware and we re early on that asset we ve been operating it now for a year have made good strides but we ve got a path to continue to improve on that and so as we pick up a little more activity in the delaware yes there is going to be some offset in terms of activity if it s the same overall program but there s also benefits of cost deflation and then just overall efficiencies in a lower price world that won t make that as big of impact so it might be otherwise don t it s just directional don t have specific numbers at this point but that s how we d be thinking about it michael h lou executive vice president and chief financial officer and david one thing to add to that is taylor did mention earlier in his prepared remarks about the declines the base declines are starting to flatten as well so overtime you re not going to need as much capital in the williston to continue to maintain production levels there it s got a great inventory base as we ve already talked about and so we think we can maintain that with less and less capital it s going to generate a lot of free cash flow that will originally be reallocated toward the delaware some before it gets to free cash flow itself taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer and then as far as how long is it going to be before you re spending even capital between the two basins well that s a number of years out and just really for us to give a view on that at this point david deckelbaum cowen analyst thank you guys for all the color taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer thanks operator the next question comes from ron mills of johnson rice please go ahead ron mills johnson rice company analyst good morning guys taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer hey ron ron mills johnson rice company analyst taylor maybe for you in the permian especially you talked about some of the tests your are doing can you just provide a little bit more color on what 2019 looks like in terms of additional delineation of the wolfcamp b along with the the 3rd bone springs and is this also the year when you potentially start testing the co development of all three other zones like you did in the upper and lower a tests taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yeah ron it s a good point we are going to do some individual interval test of the wolfcamp c the wolfcamp b bone springs 3 like you talked about but then with the eight well pilot that we talked about drilling eight wells and spacing we will test a number of those different intervals together all in a block to see how they interplay and what spacing will look like going forward and that s important for us as we look to 2020 and beyond and get more of a development program going forward we really want to understand how all those intervals interact in spacing and with the type of stimulation that we re doing ron mills johnson rice company analyst and do you think in terms of timing you will have enough of that data in hand by the end of this year as you look to formulate your 2020 plan or is that something that really transitions over the course of 2020 and you potentially move to more of a full co development program taylor l reid director president and chief operating officer yeah it s going to be early results as we get into 2020 so we might be doing more pad work like that and then getting into really full development later in the year but we ll continue to evaluate it as we go it s important from an efficient resource recovery standpoint but also important from cycle time of capital efficiency you just getting into pad operations is going to really help to continue to bring the cost down ron mills johnson rice company analyst okay great and then michael for you on the free cash flow side what are the what s the plan to use the free cash flow my guess is initially to pay down debt and i guess if that s the case do you kind of have a targeted longer term leverage ratio you d like to achieve with that free cash flow and how do you measure that versus the opportunity to do more or similar bolt ons to what you did in the latter part of last year in the delaware michael h lou executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah right now the way we re thinking about it is we need to continue to increase our financial strength and we ve always kind of talked about a 2 times debt to ebitda level that we re shooting for in a normalized oil price so if you call it a 50 or 55 oil price kind of a normalized basis that s what we re going to shoot for is under that 2 times and so as we think about free cash flow generation what we tried to show where what that might be in a 50 world today you re more like 55 so it might look like in 55 and 60 and in those scenarios trying to be thoughtful around service costs maybe being a little bit different as well in those different environments so you ll notice those don t ratchet up perfectly with necessarily with ebitda as we re kind of adjusting inflation on capex too but really looking at that as kind of bolstering the balance sheet and paying down debt at this point ron mills johnson rice company analyst great colors and milestone ph thank you guys thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer thanks ron operator the next question comes from brad heffern of rbc capital markets please go ahead brad heffern rbc analyst hey morning everyone i guess kind of on the same thing for the 2019 plan can you just talk about what led to this being the plan versus maybe a plan that would have kept oil flat or maybe even a free cash flow neutral plan what are the benefits of this versus the other options michael h lou executive vice president and chief financial officer look we had a big focus i will start i think tommy if you ve something to add but we had a big focus on the minimum being free cash flow neutral and as we continue to work the program it became apparent that we could really keep our volumes flat and generate free cash flow and we just thought it was a great use of proceeds the capital efficient inventory in the basins really allow us to put a program like this out which we think is tremendous thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer yeah i think having being in position to where we can keep volumes flat on an aggregate basis and generate free cash flow that we can bank to lay off financial alternatives versus operational alternatives it s a great place to be we ve talked about it for a long time and just make sure that you get the dollar going to the next optimal place and as michael mentioned i think in the short term it s all going back to the balance sheet and providing more firepower brad heffern rbc analyst okay thanks for that and i guess obviously as you slowdown that lengthens the inventory life to some extent does that make you have a greater desire to potentially prune some of the longer dated inventory thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer we ll see how the market is it gives you flexibility for sure brad heffern rbc analyst okay thanks thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer you bet operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to tommy nusz for any closing remarks thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer thanks drew to sum it up oasis continues to execute on our long term plan with our deep low cost inventory in the williston driving capital efficiency and allowing for free cash generation in a low price environment in the delaware we continue to delineate our position and accretively grow our footprint while preparing for full field development we have the team and the strategy in place to succeed and we look forward to delivering for all of our stakeholders thanks again for joining our call operator the conference has now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect duration 47 minutes call participants michael h lou executive vice president and chief financial officer thomas b nusz director and chief executive officer taylor l

worst was over in the past years the damage on the economy has revealed itself particularly in the industrial sector mining and tourism these sectors shed alarming number of jobs with many companies failing the drought experienced across the country two years ago made matters worse as agricultural output shrank markedly the drought also had direct effects on tourism particularly in south africa s premier destination of cape town land wealth as south africa is still a new democracy there is a lot of reconstruction to take place this includes economic expansion and expanding economic participation in particular by the majority of south africa s previously disadvantaged groups who in the main are africans africans make up just over eighty per cent of the population and it is estimated that their economic participation is below ten per cent land ownership by africans or black people in general is estimated at 7 per cent with the bulk owned by corporations and individuals classified as white land is seen as an economic driver and economic multiplier by the african national congress the african national congress resolved to make land a key piece of economic reforms to eradicate poverty and rampant inequality a key feature of the economic malaise in south africa is its massive unemployment of young people with over fifty seven percent of youth estimated to be unemployed the official unemployment rate is twenty seven percent the wage disparities are still defined by race where white households out earn black people by up to eight times the level of unemployment amongst black university graduates is destabilizing south africa s economy is currently in recession having moved back to decline in industrial and agricultural output with a negative growth rate in two consecutive quarters the opposition party leader mmusi maimane of the democratic alliance da announced his proposed economy intervention package which i reviewed as a recipe for further disaster in our economy da laid out its plans for the economy as it launched its 2019 election campaign in johannesburg on september 22 the party believes some workers rights must be walked back to enable worker choice not to partake in wage bargaining agreements this implies the da sees wages too high and prohibiting hiring this assertion is not supported by evidence as south africa has had to introduce minimum wage law to mitigate the poverty wages paid to workers across industries fiddling with workers rights and removing the workers ability for collective bargaining and employment equity are in any event unlawful and unconstitutional in terms of south africa s legal framework this will be regressive and would produce low wage jobs and institutionalize them once again this will counter the progressive minimum wage bill before the president this together with calls for privatisation of some state owned companies was an expected feature from the da mr maimane repeated the same tired song that the government cannot go on living beyond its means this is simple and pedestrian common sense he will insist on cuts on spending which will ensure we remain in a prolonged recession not the same economics austerity measures and deficit obsession are some of the reasons the economy has contracted home economics and national economics are not the same at home if you spend less your income is more however in national economics your expenditure is your income if you cut expenditure you are inadvertently cutting your ability to grow your income the focus on cutting public debt means you are focused on cutting gross domestic product and everything else that is associated including employment cutting of public debt lends the economy to rely on private debt which in turn means greater risk for financial bubbles like mortgage bubbles and so forth in south africa we have agreed that the levels of consumer debt are unsustainable hence the measures to assist low income earners with debt relieving legislation enabling the restructuring of consumer debt fiscal consolidation or tightening always leads to pressure on private debt due to the tightness in money supply south africa requires a different cause as articulated in the anc national conference that elected president cyril ramaphosa as our president our focus should be on how much growth our public expenditure is relative to gdp growth it is also important for treasury to slow the aggressive relaxation of exchange controls a growth commission is needed policy makers must also remember that south africa has monetary sovereignty we have our own currency reserve bank and should always prefer to borrow in our own currency rather than a foreign currency we have our own lender of last resort we should start there first before being at the mercy of international markets south africa has the three components needed to stabilize the economy we have our own economy our own treasury and reserve bank this means the government is capable to act in similar ways as the uk or us governments that is the government can get into debt with itself i e quantitative easing this deals better with the issue of public and private debt the government must consider issuing bonds to our own reserve bank there is a problem with the structural issues relating to how the south african reserve bank operates the country s monetary policy goals ought to target employment growth and inflation in equal measure as is it would appear the south african reserve bank places inflation above all else there are other structural matters to attend to beyond the monetary policy having established a panel to advise on land reform perhaps a proposal to president ramaphosa to institute a growth commission that must report back to him after 30 days of its establishment is something to seriously consider the growth commission would look into all these matters including interest rates reduction the easing of monetary policy monetary policy mandate and goals and quantitative easing and so forth the suggested growth commission should include persons such as joseph stiglitz steve keen tito mboweni ben bernanke nico kelder cheng xiaonong cui zao haroon bhorat ben turok and chris malikane simon wren lewis and others the growth commission could also be given a task of assisting the presidential panel on land with the framing of the best outcome principles for expropriation of land without compensation without negatively affecting the banking and financial sector it is important that the commission has international bias in its form because south africa has only one impediment that it is african led and for the financial market to trust that proper thought has gone into the plan the country unfortunately requires to widen its net in terms of influence the attitude of the dark and chaotic continent has not left the psyche of our international partners the country currency is also highly politicized by the global markets an economy that has locked its most productive and majority population out is not likely to succeed solutions to the current crisis must not be squandered as they present an opportunity for grand plans and reform bo mbindwane is senior researcher at majembeni and cassandra insights former national security advisor to south african police the views expressed in

ll turn it over to marcel to get started marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer thanks lisa good afternoon and thank you for joining the call we are pleased to be able to discuss what we believe was a very successful fourth quarter and full year 2018 for the company in many regards but before i turn to specific achievements and results for the quarter and the year i believe it s important and informative to revisit the pillars of our company s strategy we laid out in detail at our investor day in may 2016 as we review our performance as a company and as a management team over the past several years the first pillar of our company strategy is a transaction oriented mindset with a focus on diversification quality and portfolio enhancement since well before our listing in february 2015 and continually so since that time we have transformed our portfolio through transactions since our listing four years ago we have not only continue to improve our overall portfolio metrics such as revpar ebitda per key geographic diversification and projected competitive supply increases but most importantly we have improved the growth profile of the company as we look to the future we have accomplished all of this through primarily single asset and small portfolio transactions while the smaller deal sizes less headline grabbing than a large portfolio transaction would be our execution has been strategic as it has allowed us to be thoughtful and methodical about each trade and enable us to match our acquisitions with dispositions and smart capital allocation decisions our transaction strategy has allowed us to buy assets at attractive pricing without the need to pay significant premiums for large portfolios or companies each of our acquisitions has been directly on strategy as a result of our acquisition activity since our investor day we have doubled our exposure to luxury hotels and resorts up to 26 from 13 and further enhanced our geographic and brand mix we have acquired these assets at significant discounts to replacement cost and most importantly our acquisitions have provided us with significant opportunities to drive asset values through our asset management and project management expertise as we unlock revenue growth potential and identify expense efficiencies meanwhile our dispositions have focused on assets that generally shared one or more of the following characteristics one significant directly competitive supply additions two substantial near term capital requirements without an appropriate projected return three hotel operations that we believe are at or near optimization from an asset management perspective or unfavorable ground lease terms and or five assets that are not closely aligned with our strategy of owning uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts in top 25 us lodging markets and key leisure destinations we continue to executing on this transaction strategy throughout 2018 and during the fourth quarter specifically and i will discuss the details of the four exciting transactions we completed during the quarter shortly the second pillar of our company strategy is an emphasis on a conservative leverage profile and a healthy balance sheet throughout various lodging cycles our net debt to adjusted ebitda multiple has fluctuated from 3 1 times to 4 2 times since our listing in early 2015 we believe this to be an appropriate and conservative range for this part of the lodging cycle especially when considering that we have no preferred equity outstanding additionally we have lengthened our debt maturity schedule improved our mix of fixed and floating rate debt and further streamlined our balance sheet by now wholly owning all 40 hotels in our portfolio through our capital allocation efforts in 2018 we ended the year at 3 6 times net debt to adjusted ebitda over half a turn below where we began the year at a time where the lodging reit balance sheets range greatly from 1 times to over 9 times net debt to ebitda we believe our balance sheet is at an optimal level providing flexibility to continue our portfolio enhancement should opportunities present themselves and lastly aggressive asset management initiatives and leveraging our relationships with both brands and managers is the third pillar of our company strategy we have some of the strongest relationships in the industry with the best brand and third party management companies in the business due to continued evolution of our portfolio over the past four years we have maintained a significant relationship with marriott while expanding our relationships with hyatt ihg through kimpton and accor through fairmont we are excited to have also recently welcomed hilton back as an operator of one of our hotels through the acquisition of what is now the waldorf astoria atlanta buckhead we believe that our asset management initiatives and the expertise of the management companies operating our assets day to day drive optimal results at our hotels while the composition of our portfolio continues to evolve we have been able to improve same property hotel ebitda margins each of the four years since our listing despite a same property revpar decline in 2016 and modest revpar growth in 2017 and 2018 we believe this is reflective of the effectiveness of our asset management platform overall and our property optimization process in particular over the past three years we have completed 27 parks resulting in recommendations that have helped to drive meaningful improvements in revenues and expense controls we look forward to continuing this successful program now let s move to our fourth quarter and full year results during the quarter we had net income attributable to common stockholders of 100 million adjusted ebitdare was 75 7 million and adjusted ffo per share was 0 58 our same property portfolio revpar grew 1 6 in the fourth quarter and our same property hotel ebitda margin increased by 47 basis points for full year 2018 we had net income attributable to common stockholders of 193 7 million our adjusted ebitdare of 299 8 million was near the high end of the guidance range we provided in november and adjusted ffo per share was 2 22 a 7 8 increase over last year and above the high end of the guidance range we provided for 2018 at the beginning of the year we are pleased to have provided this ffo per share growth in 2018 as we continue to focus on a balance between earnings growth and enhancing the quality of future growth profile of the company we continue to be pleased with our operators focus on expense controls as evidenced by our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018 marked another year of hotel ebitda margin growth for our same property portfolio accomplished with a modest 1 2 revpar growth total same property operating expenses were only up 1 3 resulting in same property hotel ebitda margin improvement of five basis points for the full year we believe this is an impressive result in the current operating environment we continue to work with our operators to find opportunities for efficiencies and we are particularly pleased with the performance of our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions as we integrated each into our portfolio our transaction activities in 2018 were successful continuation of our focus on upgrading our portfolio we were a net seller for the year but only modestly so as our activities were relatively balanced between acquisitions and dispositions we completed nearly 800 million in transactions including four acquisitions totaling approximately 360 million and three dispositions for a total of 420 million we were pleased with the pricing and execution of these transaction we added four luxury hotels to the portfolio and sold three lower tier hotels bringing our total portfolio mix based on room counts to 26 luxury 72 upper upscale and 2 upscale we have previously discussed the sale of aston waikiki beach hotel in the first quarter and the acquisitions of the ritz carlton denver and fairmont pittsburgh in the third quarter during the fourth quarter we acquired two additional luxury hotels with significant upside potential and sold two select service hotels with more limited growth opportunities from an operational perspective in november we completed the acquisition of park hyatt aviara resort golf club spa and carlsbad outside of san diego california for 170 million or approximately 520 000 per key this pricing represents a significant discount to replacement cost and to the prices paid for a comparable resource in the surrounding areas and nationwide in recent years as we detailed in our earnings release this morning we anticipate spending between 50 million and 60 million at the resort over the next several years barry will provide further detail on our capital plans later in the call as many of you may know the resort was built as a four seasons resort about 20 years ago and as such it is very well built the opportunity here lies with the lack of capital invested at the property over many years we believe that the necessary cosmetic upgrades will allow the resorts to regain its proper positioning and successfully compete with its competitive set once again leading to significant increases in revpar and operating margins we are excited to have acquired this high quality assets located on 222 acres of fee simple land and a desirable coastal california location we acquired the resorts through a competitive process and believe that our transaction experience and ability to underwrite thoroughly and expeditiously were determining factors and thus being able to add this outstanding resort to our portfolio in december we completed the acquisition of a 127 room luxury hotel in the buckhead area of atlanta for 53 5 million immediately upon completion of this acquisition we rebranded the hotel as waldorf astoria atlanta buckhead and engaged hilton as the operator of the hotel simultaneously with this acquisition we purchased a freestanding restaurant that as part of the same mixed use developments for 7 million the restaurant is currently leased and operated as del frisco s grille as i mentioned before we are excited to have added hilton back into our portfolio as manager and believe strongly in the value that the waldorf astoria brands will be able to add to the asset while the hotels are in good physical condition we intend to complete a number of roi projects to further enhance the appeal of the properties food and beverage facilities and rooms product over the next couple of years in 2019 our focus for this hotel will be on working with hilton to optimize revenue and expense strategies also during the quarter we completed the sale of two of our select service hotels hilton garden inn washington d c and residence inn denver city center for a combined sales price of 220 million which equates to a 14 1 times multiple on the blended trailing 12 month hotel ebitda we took advantage of strong private buyer interest in these two assets in markets where we recently added high quality luxury hotels through the acquisitions of the ritz carlton pentagon city and the ritz carlton denver by selling the two hotels at attractive valuations we further strengthened our balance sheet while effectively trading assets with what we believe to be more limited upside for assets with significant value enhancement opportunities our focus is on unlocking the value potential of our hotels and resorts which in turn should lead to greater revpar margin improvements higher ebitda per key and ffo growth we believe that the hotels we added in 2017 and 2018 provide a significantly greater opportunity to increase value than the assets we have sold over the past few years meaningful top and bottom line improvement opportunities exist at the four properties we acquired in 2018 through a combination of capital expenditures revenue optimization strategies and expense controls it is worth noting that all four of the hotels we acquired in 2018 were previously owned by financial institutions that were not lodging dedicated investors resultingly we believe we have intriguing and ample opportunities to optimize operations at these assets under our ownership and through our strong relationships with hyatt marriott fairmont and hilton as outlined in our earnings release this morning despite the many positive improvements we have made in our portfolio through our transactions and our well received capital expenditures we expect another year of relatively modest revpar growth in 2019 relative to 2018 this is primarily due to the current overall economic climate as well as elevated supply growth in many markets the midpoint of our guidance results in adjusted ebitdare and adjusted ffo which are down slightly compared to last year our expectations for improved performance at recently renovated hotels and newly acquired properties are being offset by expense growth resulting from higher wage and benefit costs and greater real estate tax and insurance expenses atish will discuss these factors in more detail shortly we continue to be excited about the long term growth opportunities embedded in our portfolio as a result of the recent moves we have made as well as our strong balance sheet we believe the company is well positioned for earnings growth in the years ahead with that i ll turn the call over to barry barry bloom president and chief operating officer thank you marcel as a reminder all the portfolio information i ll be speaking about is reported on a same property basis for the 40 hotels owned at year end which includes our two fourth quarter acquisitions same property revpar grew 1 6 for the quarter driven by a 2 5 increase in adr as occupancy declined by 62 basis points food and beverage continued to be a strength in our portfolio of 2 1 for the quarter and continued to be driven by strong contribution from in house groups across the portfolio and in particular at our larger group oriented hotels overall we achieved 1 9 increase in same property total revenues for the quarter when looking at our top 10 markets based on 2018 hotel ebitda which have changed this quarter as a result of our fourth quarter transactions our top performers were napa up 15 8 phoenix up 8 5 boston up 6 7 and santa clara up 4 3 our napa hotels benefited from strong market growth over a weak 2017 which was impacted by the northern california wildfires our phoenix scottsdale hotels performed well as a result of strong group business which laid the foundation for transit compression boston had strong occupancy in the quarter as hotel commonwealth benefited from the red sox postseason activity and a world series win additionally other top 10 markets posting revpar gains for the quarter included san francisco and dallas which achieved growth on top of the double digit revpar growth achieved in the fourth quarter of last year the worst performing of our top 10 markets for the quarter were san diego down 2 2 due to softer in house group activity and orlando down 1 has elapsed a strong fourth quarter in 2017 when the market benefited from post hurricane demand for the full year our same property portfolio experienced 1 2 revpar growth driven entirely by adr which was up 1 4 while occupancy remained essentially flat group room revenue for the year was up almost 2 compared to last year with transient and contract business also up by less than 1 for the full year 2018 the strongest of our top 10 markets were phoenix up 6 2 santa clara up 6 and atlanta up 5 1 other strong markets included pittsburgh new orleans and salt lake city in total 15 of our 26 markets experienced positive revpar growth in 2018 our most challenged market for the year was santa barbara which was down 11 as the market recovered slowly from the mudslides in late 2017 and early 2018 and the absorption of new supply which will continue into 2019 as marcel discussed earlier we continue to be pleased with our margin performance 2018 marked four consecutive years of margin growth in our same property portfolios at year end for the year same property ebitda margin grew five basis points with total expenses up only 1 3 despite a 2 5 increase in wages and benefits and a 5 3 increase in real estate taxes and insurance as you re able to find incremental savings elsewhere in particular we were extremely pleased with the integration of our 2017 acquisitions into our asset management platform on average the four hotels we acquired in 2017 grew margin almost 140 basis points on revpar growth of 2 8 these properties i ll went through are detailed property optimization process we ve identified numerous revenue and cost saving initiatives including aligning food and beverage pricing within each property standardizing guest room amenities and collateral implementing charges or revisiting pricing for certain guest services such as roll away beds these pops provide us with a detailed playbook we follow on each acquisition and our proven performance reiterates our unique ability to find operational efficiencies at hotels new to our platform and gives us confidence to our investment thesis for each of our 2018 acquisitions which to date have exceeded our initial underwriting expectations during 2018 we completed reviews at eight hotel through our property optimization process we identified nearly 3 million in potential net benefits at those properties bringing our total approximately 11 million of properties we currently own since we began this program in 2014 and resulting nearly 7 million of annualized net benefit in 2019 this dedicated in house team will complete visits at our four new acquisitions as well as fully implement a program we call pop 2 0 which revisits properties that have been visited previously and focuses on both retention of previous savings as well as identification of new opportunities in addition to these internal opportunities we expected a number of brand driven initiatives will help improve portfolio performance the continued focus and implementation of resort and destination fees further implementation and collection of cancellation fees lower chain service costs stronger brand loyalty programs and operating initiatives and support of sustainability strategies will also helped to offset wage and benefit increases in the portfolio i would now like to turn to a quick review of our capital projects completed last year before discussing our exciting upcoming capital plans for hyatt regency grand cypress and park aviara in 2018 we spent 108 million in capital expenditures we completed guest room renovations at seven current hotels and resorts andaz savannah hotel monaco denver hyatt regency grand cypress lorien hotel spa marriott chicago at medical district marriott dallas city center and westin oaks houston as well as at hilton garden inn in d c and residence inn denver both which were sold in the fourth quarter in addition we completed major meeting space renovations at westin galleria in houston marriott woodlands and hyatt regency scottsdale and significant food and beverage outlets upgrades and additions at hotel monaco chicago riverplace in portland marriott san francisco airport waterfront and westin galleria in addition to completing the guest room renovation at hyatt regency grand cypress in september we commenced construction of the 25 000 square foot ballroom and 32 000 square feet of pre function and support space as a reminder this new facility is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 with approximately 25 5 million of capital lease spent in 2019 as part of a total project cost of 32 million as of december 2018 below grid infrastructure and the ground floor slab had been completed the final phase of the resorts meeting space upgrade a comprehensive 7 million renovation of the existing meeting space is scheduled to begin in 2020 the resorts management team is enthusiastic about the quantity and quality of business they re putting on the books for this new facility which will have some of the highest quality finished space in this very competitive market now turning to park aviara resort golf club spa we d like to discuss our plans for the resort which are an integral part of our overall investment thesis the capital plan for the resort is expected to total between 50 million and 60 million will include a transformational renovation of the property and its amenities this renovation will include a straightforward yet complete renovation of guest rooms and corridors including casegoods and softgoods renovation and reconcepting of food and beverage outlets and the renovation of the meeting spaces and pre function areas including identification and creation of new meeting space within the resort the lobby and public areas will be improved to provide more open visitors and better flow throughout the property in addition substantial upgrades will be made to the spa and golf facilities as well as exterior landscaping outdoor meeting space and pool features and amenities as marcel discussed the properties originally developed the four seasons resort and opened in 1997 as would be expected the construction of the property is solid and the resort has a great foundation for us to work with because the resort is in such good physical shape in terms of the building and infrastructure this transformational renovation is focused primarily on guest facing areas with a scope as noted we expect to drive significant roi we are confident in the overall renovation budget having spent the last few months with an outstanding team of designers the hotel s management team and hyatt s corporate team with whom we have worked on many successful roi driven renovations over the past few years this transformational renovation will modernize resort and enhance appeal to the broad range of market segments that it has the potential to serve we believe strongly that this renovation will be very well aligned with the park hyatt brand and its customers will position the resort extremely well against its competitive set enabling it to regain much of the market share it has lost over time the renovation is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019 we are targeting completion in the first quarter of 2021 the total renovation spend we anticipate spending approximately 15 million for the project this year with that i will turn the call over to atish atish shah executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you barry i will cover two topics today first i will discuss our 2019 outlook and then i will turn to a brief review of our balance sheet for full year 2019 we expect adjusted ebitdare to decline by approximately 4 million relative to 2018 as reflected by the midpoint of our guidance range at 296 million as compared to last year we expect better hotel operating results and lower expected g a expense offsetting that is a 3 million net transaction activity headwind the three hotels we sold last year contributed approximately 19 million to ebitda in 2018 the four hotels we acquired last year are expected to earn 16 million of incremental ebitda in 2019 relative to 2018 in addition we received a net 5 million in non recurring business interruption insurance proceeds in 2018 taken together the net effect of these ins and outs yields adjusted ebitdare that is expected to be slightly down year over year at the midpoint of our guidance range we expect 1 5 revpar growth in 2019 we re expecting revpar growth above 4 at our hotels and resorts in san francisco houston napa and key west hotels that were under renovation last year in markets such as dallas and denver are also expected to show better than average revpar growth across the portfolio we expect displacement due to renovations to be less of a drag to revpar than it was in 2018 for the year we expect a 20 basis point negative impact to revpar versus 90 basis points in 2018 for 2019 we expect disruption to occur mostly in the first quarter but at a much lower level than in last year s first quarter as a reminder in 2018 we had 220 basis points of impact in the first quarter followed by 50 basis points and 75 basis points of impact in the second and third quarters respectively and not much impact in the fourth quarter the supply growth forecast in our competitive markets continues to decline on an overall rooms weighted basis supply growth in our market tracks is expected to be approximately 2 5 in 2019 that number has come down from last year due both to our transaction activity and new hotel developments taking longer to be built and open some markets such as savannah and portland are expected to experience higher levels of supply growth other markets such as chicago and boston will be more challenged due to lower citywide convention demand than last year however as we look across our most significant markets such as orlando houston and phoenix our positioning gives us confidence in our outlook this year has started off well as our revpar grew 3 4 in january we are on track to post even higher revpar growth in february the super bowl in atlanta as well as renovation comparisons over last year are expected to make very strong top line in the first quarter relative to 2018 turning to the group side of the business we began the year with about two thirds of our expected full year group revenue as definite as a reminder group represents approximately 35 of our rooms revenue at year end 2018 our 2019 group revenue pace relative to last year is up approximately 2 for a top 15 group hotels which together represent 75 of our definite our 2019 group revenue pace was up over 3 turning briefly to other revenues we are expecting growth in this area to be higher than revpar growth we expect to see food and beverage revenue growth outpaced revpar growth as it did in 2018 one of the key drivers of this is improved banquet and catering revenue as a result of our mix of group business as the same property hotel ebitda margins we expect these to be approximately flat in 2019 versus 2018 we expect continued success in finding margin growth opportunities to offset a more difficult expense environment as barry and marcel each mentioned we grew margins last year for hotels acquired in 2017 and expect those opportunities to continue for newly acquired hotels offsetting this will be expense increases that we together with other hotel owners are facing in particular as to expenses of a more non operational natures we are seeing continued inflation in certain areas we expect property tax expense to grow almost 7 we expect property and liability insurance expense to grow nearly 10 given that our portfolio continue to evolve last year we would like to provide some additional detail about the seasonality of our earnings we expect to earn approximately 30 of our hotel ebitda in the second quarter followed by nearly 25 each of the first and fourth quarters and just over 20 in the third quarter as to business interruption insurance we have reached final settlements on all but one of our outstanding claims we have one remaining outstanding claims still open at hyatt centric key west resort spa but we are not expecting significant proceeds given that business there is quickly returning to more normalized levels moving to adjusted ffo we are currently projecting to earn between 231 million and 247 million it reflects the adjusted ebitdare that i just discussed in addition we expect a 2 million increase in interest expense due to new financings and higher interest rates as compared to last year on a per share basis this results and guidance of 2 02 to 2 16 of adjusted ffo per share this is based on a 114 4 million weighted average diluted shares and units outstanding for the full year now i ll move to my second topic our balance sheet during 2018 we continue to improve our balance sheet profile subsequent to year end we completed the final drawn our new unsecured term loan the outstanding balance on the loan is now 150 million pro forma for this draw approximately 80 of our debt is fixed or hedged to fixed this compares favorably to year end 2017 at which time a little over 70 of our debt had fixed rates our weighted duration is currently 4 8 years finally in a rising rate environment our weighted average interest rate is 3 9 which is roughly 20 bps higher than it was at year end 2017 at year end we had net debt to adjusted ebitda of 3 6 times that was over half a turn below the leverage ratio at the beginning of 2018 we continue to have well staggered debt maturities having addressed all 2019 loan maturities and all but one small 2020 loan maturity our balance sheet is strong with approximately 150 million of available cash at present we have 30 unencumbered assets that together represent approximately two thirds of our annual hotel ebitda we continue to believe that our balance sheet strength can support our strategic goals turning to the equity capital markets front we finished 2018 having sold over 135 million of common stock through the atm at a weighted average price of 24 02 while we did not buy back stock last year we continue to believe share repurchases can be a good tool to drive shareholder value as evidenced by our track record on this front that concludes our comments andrea could we move to the q a session and take our first question at this time questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question will come from david katz of jefferies please go ahead david katz jefferies analyst hi good afternoon everyone marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer good afternoon david david katz jefferies analyst hi i wanted to ask just a strategic question and i ll admit that i got on just a few minutes late so i apologize if i missed it but it has really has been a pretty busy year with the amount of buying and some selling should we think about the story transitioning a little bit to harvesting what you ve planted at this point in the portfolio or do you expect that there s more activity that may be coming our way the rest of this year marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer thanks david as i started our prepared remarks and as you mentioned you may have joined a little bit late dave i did start with an outline again of kind of the three pillars of our company s strategy as we ve outlined them a number of years ago and obviously transaction activity to enhance portfolio quality over time in the hands of the growth profile of our earnings over time is a very significant pillar of that strategy and it s something that we ve to your points very active over the past few years what we want to do go forward is make sure that we maintain a very strong balance sheet that gives us optionality to the extent we find interesting opportunities out there i do believe that s through our activities internally on renovations on assets where we ve done a lot of work over the last couple of years and through the acquisitions that we ve made over the last few years we ve set ourselves up very well for the next few years and as we continue to look ahead we ll look at opportunities to continue and to enhance that overall portfolio quality and it will really depend on what we see out there from an opportunity standpoint david katz jefferies analyst so if i can just follow that up i appreciate you repeating yourself for me but is there a weight on the performance of the portfolio if i were to just play devil s advocate for a moment based on the fact that there is a number of new hotels and some construction going on is there a weight on the portfolio for a period of time and when might that weight lift if in fact there is one marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well we obviously talk a little bit about renovation impact throughout the portfolio which was frankly a little bit more elevated last year we had about 90 basis points of impact through renovations on our revpar growth for this year as we sit here today it s about 20 basis points and it s actually a lower number of assets where we have renovations going on this year we just have a couple of bigger projects and the ones that barry discussed as it relates to grand cypress with the ballroom that we re adding which will review as a real roi opportunity for us and then obviously the work that we ll be doing at aviara so we think that those are going to be great growth vehicles for us going forward but we certainly are looking to benefit and harvest the improvements that we ve made at the assets that we frankly touched over the last two or three years david katz jefferies analyst got it okay thank you nice quarter operator our next question comes from michael bellisario of baird please go ahead michael bellisario baird analyst good afternoon everyone marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer good afternoon michael bellisario baird analyst marcel can you maybe give us your updated view on larger scale m a opportunities and how you approach that maybe from both angles marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer as i also pointed out in my comments at the start of the call we were very pleased with how we ve been able to grow our portfolio through very very targeted acquisitions that are right on strategy for us so we haven t found frankly from our perspective at larger scale opportunities on a portfolio from a portfolio standpoint or a company standpoint that we have found more attractive than kind of building through the strategy that we have maintained over the past few years and i ve obviously stated in the past that we ve done frankly everything as a management team as it relates to transactions either that s one off transactions portfolio transactions company transactions that we ve been very well versed and being on both sides of those type of transactions in the past and our view is it hasn t changed over time our view is always that we re looking to drive long term shareholder value and that s where our focus will remain on any side of any transaction in the future michael bellisario baird analyst got it and then as you think about the single asset acquisitions kind of what does the pipeline look like today and then how are the pricing expectations changed at all recently given the recent market volatility marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well i probably sound somewhat like a broken record sometimes when these questions come up as it relates to this because i don t think the pipeline is necessarily terribly deep currently we re not seeing just a kind of a wealth of opportunities out there but we continue to look at a fair number of things that are out there and historically we ve been able to find those opportunities even at a time where maybe the pipeline has been a little bit lighter so i haven t seen a dramatic change there i think over the past few months we haven t really seen an enormous shift one way or the other as far as the depth the pipeline goes and or pricing expectations as you know there have been a few transactions in the space recently of some larger transactions and some transactions that happened with some of our peer reits where it appears that pricing is staying relatively stable michael bellisario baird analyst that s helpful and then just last one on san francisco i know you mentioned kind of better than portfolio average growth there but can you maybe help us think about your properties in that area and then kind of the compression that you re expecting to get at those hotels outside of the cbd barry bloom president and chief operating officer yes sure michael so when we talk about san francisco as the market it s the one hotel the marriott san francisco airport waterfront distinguished from napa which we talk about separate it s a separate market considered by sgr and then santa clara also separate market but speaking specifically about the san francisco airport marriott property we do expect good growth there this year it s a little it will be a different a little different growth and more muted growth then you ll see from the downtown hotels but it follows for us three years of significant revpar growth in 16 17 and 18 where we never saw decline in fact continuing to grow revpar significantly in 16 and then on a more moderate basis in 17 and 18 so it plays a little bit different market there we do get compression downtown for sure but our primary business is serving the mid peninsula a quarter on we expect good growth there but not necessarily a huge amount of compression from the downtown business any greater than what we saw historically looking back three or four years kind of pre inaudible on your renovation marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer what i will add to that is that as barry points out napa is a bit of a separate market for us but as you can see from our growth there in the fourth quarter we are lapping some of the disruption that we saw in the prior year we re certainly expecting some good growth and the compression to come out of san francisco to help us with those assets as well michael bellisario baird analyst that s helpful thank you operator our next question comes from thomas allen of morgan stanley please go ahead thomas allen morgan stanley analyst hi on houston you guys highlighted you expect revpar to be up over 4 in 2019 can you just talk about that kind of gives and takes there thank you barry bloom president and chief operating officer yes sure so as you know houston has been a very evolving story for us over the past few years i think at this point to talk specifically about the galleria i mean we are virtually done with our renovation and repositioning work there we got a very light lobby refresh and some meeting space to do in the oaks tower but the galleria has been done now for over a year the oaks guest rooms have been completed now for a few months and we re seeing very strong ramp up we are executing the business plan that we d always set out to do which is really become the leading high volume corporate or large volume corporate accounts and return the property to its positioning in the group market that really hadn t been able to enjoy due in part to both relatively dated interiors and field of the hotel as well as what the market went through so we re seeing strong demand in the galleria market across the board in virtually every segment and look to take advantage of that this year woodlands despite some supply we ve got some decent growth there obviously excess of 4 as atish referenced in part we had a significant meeting space renovation last year which took that s a very large amount of meeting space in the hotel that took us offline for meetings for a period of time we certainly did it during the slowest time of the year but the market is reacting very well to the renovated meeting space as well as to we know we ll be lapping that renovation and some which gives a lot more opportunity to drive group business to that hotel this year marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer the only other point i would add thomas is if you look at the earnings from those hotels back in 2014 they were making close to 40 million and last year they made just under 30 million so there s a lot of upside potential and certainly where we re happy with the overall positioning and we think we re set up well for multiple years of outperformance just to get back to that peak level that we reached several years ago thomas allen morgan stanley analyst that s helpful thank you and then just on the renovation commentary so you had 90 bps of renovation headwinds last year you say you have a incremental 20 bps of impact on growth this year but spend less on capex and what you are to spending on seems to be like grand cypress you re building a new ballroom right and that s going to displace more than aviara or you didn t own most from last year so marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer yes hold on one second thomas so it s not incremental what we re saying is last year we had 90 basis points of impact on a full year basis this year we have 20 basis points that s not incremental though relative thomas allen morgan stanley analyst it s on the growth rate right marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer it s on our overall revpar that s what we re saying so it s actually 70 basis points less disruption in 19 than in 18 okay got it sorry for that if that was confusing but thomas allen morgan stanley analyst no we re on the same pace now thank you marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer okay got it operator our next question comes from bryan maher of b riley fbr please go ahead bryan maher b riley fbr analyst yes good afternoon so we were a little surprised by the strong f b can you give us your view on that coming more from kind of transient leisure are you seeing it strengthen your group bookings and what are your expectations for that to continue on into 2019 marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer thanks bryan we talked about this a few times last year and i think we certainly have continued to see a trend as we ve bought larger group hotels in particular the 2017 acquisitions of hyatt regency scottsdale hyatt regency grand cypress that we have a real ability and opportunity to grow particularly the group banquet side of the equation that s where most of the growth is coming from we continue to have decent performance in our restaurants and i think we ve right sized and have our restaurant setup and are renovating them the right way to be decent total restaurants but i think the real growth you re seeing in food and beverage is all driven almost exclusively on the group meeting and catering side we re seeing a lots of opportunities as the economy strengthen a little bit for the year to up sell groups for our management companies to up sell our groups into more expensive meals additional beverage packages things like that then that we were i think we were also surprised by through the year and continue to see growth through the year but we re fairly confident and are now seeing it more so than last year which was a lot of last minute additions we re seeing that being booked in the contracts in our booking pace for 2019 so feel pretty good about that trend continuing bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and then how are you thinking about margins as it relates to your activity marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well i mean we re obviously grateful that our growth in food and beverage is coming through banquets which are certainly by far the most profitable portion of that business we did a tremendous job last year on controlling food and beverage expense and part of that is a reflection of the shift from restaurant business to banquet business so in fact overall food and beverage expense in the portfolio was virtually flat last year on close to 2 revenue growth in food and beverage looking at the portfolio overall bryan maher b riley fbr analyst and then just lastly a little surprise not to see some buyback activity and kind of the depths of december how are you guys thinking about that when the stock kind of bounce below 18 i know it only stay there for you know maybe a week or 10 days but what was the thought process internally not to deploy capital to buyback shares at that time marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer yes that s a great question and i think that dynamic that you mentioned is a relevant one i mean as we looked at that activity in that period of volatility in december it was just very short lived that you saw that move down i think philosophically our position on this hasn t changed and we have a really good track record i mean we bought back in 2016 and 2017 over 5 million shares for 15 a share so our track record is strong we have a remaining authorization of nearly 100 million we think it s a good tool but specifically with regard to the fourth quarter i mean what you had is that period of volatility at the very end of the year and there was a lot of uncertainty in the market i think with the shutdown looming and entering a blackout period for us and other companies so i think that factored into the thinking but overall we still feel like it s a great tool to have and we certainly feel like there s value there bryan maher b riley fbr analyst okay thank you marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from brian dobson of nomura instinet please go ahead brian dobson nomura instinet analyst hi good afternoon so thanks for that color on supply growth within your areas of operation so i understand that s decelerating because of the shift in your portfolio distribution but does it appear to you that any of that supply growth deceleration is coming from an actual same store supply growth deceleration in those markets that you re operating in marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer yes i think what s happening is as we look across our markets and our track specifically at new projects we re seeing that they re taking longer to be built and to open so you re seeing that reflected in our numbers so if you looked at supply growth for 19 about a year ago it would have been roughly 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher so in the 2 7 to 2 8 range for 19 now we look at it and it s about 2 5 so as i mentioned some of that is because certainly the transactions that we ve done but it s also because projects are taking longer to get built and open brian dobson nomura instinet analyst and what would you attribute that longer timeline that longer project timeline to marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well our sense is that it s construction labor construction costs availability of construction labor i mean those factors i mean we re not in the business obviously of building hotels but that s the sense we get from the operating teams and our knowledge of these markets brian dobson nomura instinet analyst and as you re out in the market bidding for assets and looking at assets who do you see your competitors being right now what types of companies marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well frankly it s a mix it really depends on which particular opportunity you re looking at and in some cases our sense is that we re competing with some of our peers sometimes you re competing with more private equity type investors it generally depends a bit on geographic locations on whether someone has exposures in certain markets whether something is a 100 strategic fit for us versus our peers some of the properties that we bought last year absolutely fell into both buckets we know that some of our peers look at and then looking around at some of the assets and we know that in other cases that would probably deliver more between us and private buyers but there s good robust group of people that are looking for a great type of acquisitions obviously so many times in our mind it comes down to your experience and expertise and being able to underwrite expeditiously being able to refocus on those opportunities that you think are just great strategic fits and try to put all your effort into being able to buy those particular assets brian dobson nomura instinet analyst okay excellent thank you very much marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from bill crow of raymond james please go ahead william crow raymond james analyst yeah thanks good afternoon guys marcel or maybe this is barry which brands given that you have a presence in your ownership of many of the different brands that are out there which brand families are doing the best job of lowering customer acquisition costs and other ownership costs who is really kind of moving the needle marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer because you gave us the option of either me or barry answering i ll let barry answer that william crow raymond james analyst there you go barry bloom president and chief operating officer so i think we are continue to see that evolve and i think every brand has their our own idea of kind of how to do that a little bit differently i mean we certainly as you know the largest brand family in our portfolio is marriott we certainly think they spend the most time thinking about that and that we believe that ultimately part of them being the largest brand family and having the most brands and most points of distribution they will be able to drive lower costs and we are fairly confident we re going to see some of that this year i think certainly we re going to see some benefit this year we think and started seeing late last year from the kimpton ihg transaction as specifically as it relates to brand costs and cost of distribution we also similarly we think hyatt does a good job they re very focused on it it s an area certainly where they probably have more room to catch up in some of the other brands but we know through our involvement with them through the hotels we own our involvement on their own advisory council that they are spending a lot of time focus on as well so it s very hard to say kind of who is best today and i think we re really starting to converge toward a better world in terms of that as these companies have really listened we think well to owner feedback and know that s where they re going to satisfy owners going forward is by focusing on those costs often reducing them and getting the right kind of distribution at better pricing william crow raymond james analyst all right marcel i m not going to let you off the hook though here s my argument it seems like your risk tolerance may have increased a little bit with the aviara acquisition just given the combination of luxury high price per key late cycle economically enlarging and then this 50 million capex spend over a couple of years you really bet more on kind of a 2022 or 2021 outlook is that fair and did the returns that you re expected on this particular asset are they higher than what you ve looked for in other maybe straighter down the middle of the fairway sort of acquisitions that you ve done marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer it s a fair question bill from our perspective a lot of the things you actually talked about are great opportunities we actually think that the cost per key for these asset when you re thinking about 222 acres of fee simple lands outside of san diego at 520 000 a key is very attractive when you look at it compared to the resorts in that area and as i said in my comments when you look at resorts of that elk nationwide so we believe that we got into the assets that are really attractive basis i also pointed out some of the other things that are attractive to us we bought it from a financial institution that isn t enlarging focus and clearly has not had the same kind of asset management expertise and oversight that we can bring to that asset the type of renovation that we re doing here even though it s 50 million to 60 million it s very much cosmetic in nature it s the kind of stuff that we believe is our bread and butter we have that very experienced project management team that has done these type of projects and frankly more complicated projects in the past through so we think this all lines up very well for what we can do very well and where we can actually really move the needle working with hyatt was obviously very strong relationship for us where we have tremendous experience renovating assets and executing on that and really moving the needle operationally great opportunity for us so from a risk tolerance standpoints we view this as just a very much an untapped opportunity where there s a lot of upside and we know was a competitive process to acquire this hotel so we certainly weren t alone and feeling that way so from that perspective as you talk about the cycle we think that luxury resorts are well positioned at this time because of the lack of new supply that s been added in that space we ve clearly moved our portfolio more upscale over time and we think there are just a lot more levers for us to pull to actually create value as opposed to some of the assets that we sold where we feel like we ve been able to optimize most of those operations already william crow raymond james analyst okay fair enough atish i guess i m letting you off the hook that s it from me atish shah executive vice president and chief financial officer okay fair enough you ll get me next time i m sure william crow raymond james analyst yeah i m sure thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to marcel verbaas for any closing remarks marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer i would like to thank all of you again for joining our call i would like to reiterate how pleased we were by our activity and results in 2018 we continue to believe we are a good allocators of capital demonstrated by the significant progress in improving the quality of our assets executing on projects to enhance long term value of the company and positioning the balance sheet to once again be opportunistic so we look forward to sharing our progress in 2019 as we continue to execute against our strategy operator the conference is

tenaris looks to have steady innings ahead tenaris s a nyse ts is a luxembourg based provider of steel pipe products to the upstream energy companies across the world i expect any potential rise in input costs to be offset by ts s initiatives to expand margin through rig direct solutions and increasing differentiation through service quality improvement i expect the u s market recovery and international markets to drive tenaris s growth in the medium term ts s management has turned its focus on international energy growth that is undergoing in some regions around the world in january 2019 ts acquired shares of a saudi arabia based pipe company in february it announced setting up of a jv in russia for a welded pipe plant tenaris has negative net debt which is a big plus for a company of this size the uncertainties for ts remain the project deferrals in the offshore energy markets tariff hikes for steel products and uncertainty over steel prices in the past year ts s stock price has gone down by 22 and underperformed the spdr s p 500 etf spy which increased by nearly 2 during this period analyzing tenaris s q4 2018 and fy2018 performance in q4 2018 tenaris s top line and the bottom line remained steady compared to q3 2018 while on a year over year basis its performance became stronger from q3 to q4 its revenues increased by 11 while from q4 2017 to q4 2018 the revenue growth was even higher 32 up tenaris s geographic growth diverged among the regions the middle east africa led the pack with 22 6 quarter over quarter growth followed by north america 5 2 however revenues from europe softened 11 7 down followed by south america 5 7 down ts has been growing its focus on the middle east market ts s strategy is likely to see sustained growth in the near term in that region north america however continues to slow down over the past year due to various industry headwinds ts s revenues and ebitda benefited from the completion of the zohr pipeline in q4 in q4 2018 ts delivered the second pipeline in the zohr field in egypt ts started offering the export pipeline in zohr in early 2018 eni e is developing the offshore natural gas project here during fy2018 ts accelerated deliveries of three pipelines in the eastern mediterranean offshore product wise ts s tubular products and services were the primary growth drivers 10 up sequentially the company s higher sales of octg products in the u s canada and mexico contributed to the growth however operating income fell in octg sales after the company fully amortized the residual value of the customer relationships in maverick tubes ts has recently received an award to supply the casing on a rig direct basis in a multi year project this includes bluedock connector and wedge and dopeless premium connection technologies in response to the energy market growth in north america ts is consolidating its rig direct strategy and enhancing its relationship with the major customers in the unconventional shale plays rig direct is ts s integrated product and service model to cater to an expected rise in demand ts is ramping up octg production in its bay city facility it has restarted the process to provide additional finishing capacity as well as increased production at the hickman facility in fy2018 60 of ts s octg products were fitted with rig direct facility as a result of such continuous initiatives ts s fy2018 revenues increased by 45 compared to fy2017 while its operating income jumped by 161 during this period ts s strategies and expansion initiatives during 2018 ts consolidated the service in the u s and canadian markets the company s strategy involves extending relation with customer and increasing differentiation through improving service quality in the gulf of mexico many upstream are related to tiebacks which require integration of existing field into discovery and new development these deepsea projects require sophisticated and new technology and so ts s offshore pipeline products will see increased demand in that region outside of north america ts has provided its services in indonesia in the emirates in guyana and brazil in january 2019 ts acquired a 48 share of saudi steel pipe company for 141 million the company located in saudi arabia owns plants with 360 000 tons per year of welded steel pipe production capacity following the acquisition of a welded pipe mill in saudi arabia ts now has three plants in that region saudi arabia is one of the largest markets of octg and line pipe products because of the region s vast energy resources saudi steel pipe company s products and services complement ts s co rental offerings in russia the tenaris severstal joint venture project is located in surgut which is considered to be a significant crude oil producing area the jv was announced on february 5 2019 the place is also located far from the local mill which will require ts s pipeline the plant will have an annual production capacity of 300 000 tons in other regions tenaris sees lng greenfield projects in mozambique and infill drilling and replenishment in australia also over the past couple of months upstream energy activities picked up in china and india in brazil under the new government there has been renewed interest in investing in exploration development offshore by the national oil company petrobras pbr and other private companies although it may take some time for growth to materialize there in mexico the e p companies are undertaking spending cut on new acreage and seismic data in mexico the situation may remain so until the prospect of investment in those areas become clearer there is a growing trend in mexico in restricting exploration spending pushing deals into 2019 the upstream customers typically prefer to wait to purchase data until the government makes a formal public announcement in december 2018 mexico s new president andrã s manuel lã³pez obrador ordered a 3 year moratorium on new license rounds in mexico this can significantly reduce ts s growth prospect in that region risks in ts s growth prospect tenaris s risk factors include the new united states mexico canada agreement or usmca which could be replacing the north american free trade agreement or nafta the deal among other agreements seeks to cap automobile exports to the united states from canada the other factor to affect ts s outlook is the u s china trade war and its fallout on tariff structure in march 2018 the u s imposed section 232 under this rule a 25 tariff was levied on all steel imports and 10 on all aluminum imports into the u s the sanction impacts all carbon products including pipe fittings and flanges although it is not clear how much the effect will be in likelihood tenaris s margin could be adversely affected by their impositions the rise in steel and iron ore price is also negative for ts ts uses steel scrap dri hot briquetted iron pig iron and ferroalloys as input for seamless steel pipe products in the past year the u s iron and steel price index has increased by 11 according to federal reserve economic data however according to this report steel price may weaken in 2019 following lower demand from china currency instability and a slowdown in global economic growth net debt and cash flow position ts s aggregate cash flow from operations or cfo was 610 million in fy2018 which was a significant improvement compared to fy2017 when its cfo was negative the increase in the cfo was led primarily by ts s higher revenues in fy2018 versus fy2017 the company s capex was 349 5 million during the year ts s net debt was negative as of december 31 as a result of cash cash equivalents balance exceeding total debt ts s net debt was negative 377 million as of december 31 which was a decline compared to a year ago when its net debt was negative 557 million being a net debt negative company is an attractive feature when energy price nose dives the company s earnings dip and servicing of debt becomes difficult ts is better equipped to survive a downturn compared to many of its ofs industry peers between cash equivalents and short term and long term investments the company s liquidity stood at 1 03 billion as of december 31 excluding investment in non consolidated companies ts had 509 million of short term borrowings as of december 31 given ample liquidity there is no near term repayment or financial risks what does ts s relative valuation say tenaris is currently trading at an ev to adjusted ebitda multiple of 10 3x based on sell side analysts ebitda estimates as pulled from thomson reuters ts s forward ev ebitda multiple is 9 2x this is lower than its average ev ebitda multiple of 15 1x from fy2013 to fy2018 ts s forward ev to ebitda multiple contractions versus its adjusted trailing twelve months ev ebitda is less steep than the industry peers average multiple compression as noted in the table above this is because analysts expect ts s ebitda to improve less sharply compared to the rise in the peers average in the next four quarters this would typically reflect in a lower current ev ebitda multiple compared to the peers average ts s ttm ev ebitda multiple is lower than its peers vlowy tmst and x average of 12 1x for estimates i have used data provided by thomson reuters analysts rating on ts according to data provided by seeking alpha fourteen sell side analysts rated ts a buy in february including strong buys while nine of the sell side analysts rated ts a hold one of the sell side analysts rated ts a sell the analysts consensus target price for ts is 34 2 which at ts s current price yields 27 returns what s the take on ts tenaris will continue to remain invested in the north america growth story for the foreseeable future in this regard it is increasing its production in the bay city facility however ts s management has turned its focus on international energy growth that is undergoing in some regions around the world in january 2019 ts acquired shares of a saudi arabia based pipe company in february it announced setting up of a jv in russia for a welded pipe plant tenaris has negative net debt which is a big plus for a company of this size the uncertainties for ts remain the project deferrals in the offshore energy markets tariff hikes for steel products and uncertainty over steel prices i expect any potential rise in input costs to be offset by ts s initiatives to expand margin through rig direct solutions and increasing differentiation through service quality improvement i expect the u s market recovery and international markets to drive tenaris s growth in the medium term

the 2020 us presidential race has begun in earnest with a number of democratic contenders announcing their bids including massachusetts senator elizabeth warren the key issues she intends to focus on are according to her website to end washington corruption rebuild the middle class strengthen democracy ensure equal justice for all under the law and to provide a foreign policy for all few would argue that these are not worthwhile slogans but do they mean much more an end to washington corruption is promised by every aspiring presidential candidate most notably donald trump with his drain the swamp cries during his own path to the presidency ensuring equal justice for all is an understandable goal for a former harvard law professor but it is not clear whether it will have any significant impact on the us population or the world at large providing a foreign policy for all argues for a reconsideration of trump s nafta 2 0 and bringing back us troops from overseas wars important but perhaps of more significance to the rest of the world than for americans themselves the two remaining issues are to strengthen democracy and to rebuild the middle class the two are related but maybe not in the way that warren has presented them regardless they are crucial to ensuring that the us maintains its pre eminence and leadership in the world in the case of strengthening democracy warren has argued against the gerrymandering of voter districts and the influence of powerful lobbyists she claims that after decades of largely flat wages and exploding household costs millions of families can barely breathe studies such as those in ganesh sitaraman s book the crisis of the middle class constitution argue that a strong and sizeable middle class is a prerequisite for liberal democracy to flourish as in the us s constitutional system economic inequality is not just a matter of fairness or economic efficiency it is central to the survival of democracies but the struggle of the middle classes is not just a us phenomenon the mckinsey global institute in a recent study found that between 65 and 70 of the population in 25 advanced economies had total income that was flat or had fallen in 2014 compared with 2005 today s younger generation is at risk of ending up poorer than their parents the report declared addressing the problem requires consideration of the causes and not a superficial cure for the symptoms of ailing democracy it is not clear that warren has addressed these as her solutions appear to have a focus on putting power back in the hands of workers and unions her objective is to increase worker participation in decision making by letting their workers elect at least 40 of the company s board members to give them a powerful voice in decisions about wages and outsourcing this by itself will not create more middle class jobs even with as she advocates a new era of strong antitrust enforcement so giant corporations can t stifle competition depress wages and drive up the cost of everything from beef to internet access middle class problems in common with the middle classes in other developed economies those in the us face two major structural challenges both of which lead to rising inequality and the disappearance of middle class jobs the first is the rise of emerging markets where educated workforces at lower wage levels than developed markets provide an economic arbitrage in whole sectors particularly manufacturing the second is the rise of automation the internet and artificial intelligence ai in its widest forms these are also serving to destroy large numbers of low level and even mid level service jobs in areas such as banking law and insurance the rise of emerging markets is something to celebrate however as their rising prosperity is also an enabler for rising prosperity in developed markets the issue that has not been addressed is how rising prosperity in developed markets should be redistributed across the population it is rising inequality within developed markets rather than a narrowing of the gap with emerging markets that politicians need to address automation and ai in a recent paper by nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz and anton korinek the authors explore another challenge posed by automation and ai income distribution if redistribution is too costly it may be impossible to compensate the losers of technological progress and they will oppose progress much as the famed luddites who destroyed machinery at the dawn of the first industrial revolution presidential candidates such as elizabeth warren must understand and address these challenges it is somewhat disappointing that warren has so far only addressed them in a cursory manner both should be regarded as unambiguously positive but as korinek and stiglitz warn while individuals and economies more broadly may be able to adjust to slow changes this may not be so when the pace is rapid in an economy characterised by winner takes all economics it is not surprising that ideas such as a universal basic income have been promoted by tech leaders from mark zuckerberg to elon musk warren has made a start in addressing the issues through arguing for greater redistribution of wealth by stopping giant tax giveaways to rich people and giant corporations instead declaring that she would start asking the people who have gained the most from our country to pay their fair share her proposals include an ultra millionaire tax on the 75 000 richest families the proceeds of which she pledges to use to build an economy that works for everyone including universal childcare student loan debt relief and healthcare tackling inequality in the us is key to restoring the health of democracy and the middle classes in the us perhaps this provides opportunities for the likes of warren
