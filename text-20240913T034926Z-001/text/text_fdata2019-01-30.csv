by gary alexander this bull market is intact we never reached a 20 correction in the s p 500 on a closing basis last christmas eve brought us down 19 8 from the september 20 peak but that was the second time that this bull market retreated over 19 without touching 20 the other close call was 19 4 in 2011 economist ed yardeni calls this â relief rally 62â of the bull market he also recalls that this is the sixth correction of 10 or more and 8th correction of 9 8 or more since the bull market began in march 2009 graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary furthermore the market has now recovered to its levels of january 1 2018 as 2018 began graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary what we saw in december was madness â the delusion of crowds mitch zacks summarized the results of several research reports into the behavior of institutional investors as markets fell in summary he wrote what they discovered is that one of the main reasons large institutional portfolio managers sell during market corrections is because stock prices are falling read that again institutional investors sold because prices were falling this active decision means institutional investors were largely reacting to price movements instead of changing fundamentals â which is the precise opposite of what long term investors should doâ if youâ re a long term investor as i am you tend to ride out these storms we donâ t lose any real money by holding on just theoretical daily price tags the market will recover it always does but institutional investors feel the need to â do somethingâ to â protect their gainsâ by selling but they seldom get back in the market before a rapid increase shuts off their options for buying at a lower price than they sold so they miss out on the rapid gains while long term investors never have to worry about â re entryâ prices gold is a better portfolio balancer than cash or bonds the s p 500 is still up 24 8 since election day november 8 2016 but it has risen so fast in the last month that maybe some diversification is due so let me put in a kind word for gold as portfolio ballast gold is a portfolio balancer it tends to â zigâ while stocks or bonds â zag â gold had a strong december while stocks were tanking but it has also continued to rise in early 2019 while stocks were recovering last friday gold hit a 7 month high of 1 303 up over 10 from its 2018 low of 1 176 set last august 17 in that same time span stocks were mostly trending downward as were most other commodities here is a comparison of gold upper left vs a smaller rise in silver upper right vs outright declines in the price of crude oil and copper bottom charts over the same time frame since july 2 showing goldâ s unique quality as a â crisis hedgeâ in world affairs by contrast crude oil and copper are driven mostly by industrial demand and silver is a â hybridâ metal with most of its supply coming as a by product of other metals and most of its demand coming from industry with limited investor demand as â poor manâ s gold â graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary these prices and charts are in u s dollar terms with the dollar strong itâ s important to note that gold is still down 32 from its peak of 1 920 in 2011 but gold has also recently reached or is about to reach an all time high price in 72 other global currencies among those currencies are the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chilean peso indian rupee iranian rial japanese yen mexican peso norwegian krone russian ruble south african rand swedish krona and turkish lira even in u s dollar terms gold has averaged 8 annual gains since y2k january 1 2000 a rate of increase which far exceeds inflation prevailing interest rates or any major stock market index over the last 19 years gold is up 349 vs only 81 for the s p 500 or 115 for the dow jones industrials stocks and gold will go up or down vs each other in any given year but it usually pays to own gold in a well balanced portfolio i have always tried to maintain a 5 10 portfolio position in precious metals goldâ s role in u s monetary history in late january we can also celebrate goldâ s central role in u s monetary history around this date on january 24 1848 james marshall discovered gold on john sutterâ s mill at the junction of the american and sacramento rivers in california in 1847 the year before the california gold strike the total u s production of gold was only 43 000 ounces mostly as a by product of base metal mining but 1848 yielded a 1 000 gain to 484 000 ounces that total quadrupled again in 1849 to 1 935 000 ounces and it peaked in 1853 at 3 144 000 ounces this gold changed american history in many ways on january 24 1894 the treasuryâ s gold reserve dipped dangerously below 100 million the warning bell for the upcoming panic of 1894 so wall street investment bankers underwrote a 50 million issue of gold bonds selling them to the public and restocking gold in the treasury back to 107 million later in 1894 another 50 million bond issue was underwritten by drexel morgan but then on january 24 1895 gold reserves hit a new low of 68 million then 45 million on january 31 this caused a gold shortage which was remedied in the nick of time by a new gold discovery up north klondike gold on january 30 1934 congress passed the gold reserve act giving president roosevelt authority to set the price of gold on his birthday no less on january 31 he devalued the dollar 41 by raising the price of gold 69 from 20 67 to 35 per ounce fdr also nationalized most gold supplies for the next 41 years it was a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and 10 000 fines to hold this inert metal on friday january 18 1974 the first gold oriented investment conference debuted in new orleans under the sponsorship of the late jim blanchard bunker hunt attended that seminar according to jim blanchardâ s memoirs â confessions of a gold bug â hunt probably hatched his idea of cornering the silver market at that seminar although the plan took six years to reach fruition in early 1980 on the following monday january 21 1974 gold hit a record 161 31 and silver hit a record 3 97 an ounce in london but it was still illegal for americans to own gold until it was legalized on december 30 1974 on friday january 18 1980 silver hit 50 an ounce for one day resulting partly from inflation fears but mostly from a cornering of the silver market by the hunt brothers on the same day gold hit 750 on its way to a then record high of 850 on monday january 21 1980 gold would not exceed 800 for 28 years but gold was over 800 for just a single day in 1980 and it was over 700 for only three or four days this one day spike to 850 was goldâ s one day â spike â so anybody who analyzes goldâ s long term performance by beginning with this spike high price for comparison purposes is trying to mislead you gold will seldom beat stocks over a long 25 year time frame but gold is not designed to compete with stocks i view gold as competing with cash or bonds as a wealth protection anchor in a prudent portfolio graphs are for illustrative and

anders corr tokyo china s increasingly belligerent approach to regional and international politics and trade is causing investors importers and exporters to diversify risks away from china and into other markets apple recently lost over us 70 billion from its market capitalization as stock of the company which is heavily invested in china s consumer market and manufacturing crashed 10 with the pressure of apple s weaker than expected earnings forecasts in china china had threatened consequences to u s companies like boeing and apple from the trade war and sure enough those consequences are real the strategy moreover stretches back to the founding of china in 1949 as evidenced by britain s leading recognition of the country in order to save its position in shanghai hong kong and elsewhere since the hu jintao era there is statistical evidence that china uses trade to try and wrest political concessions in the form of other countries foreign policies businesses in japan south korea and norway have been hit by china for their government s policies on defense and human rights issues rising business risks in china sharply rising risks to investment in china since donald trump became united states president in 2017 have made not only american but japanese companies increasingly look elsewhere for opportunities vietnam is one such location accelerating an already strong outlook for the japan vietnam trade and investment relationship vietnamese prime minister nguyen xuan phuoc will be making investor pitches at the world economic forum in davos in late january he told bloomberg news on january 20 that vietnam expects growth in the range of 6 6 to 6 8 and that it would keep the currency stable he said vietnam would be encouraging foreign business friendly policies and free trade we are ready to grab the opportunity he told bloomberg we are trying to increase exports in both quantity and quality of our products especially in which we have advantages such as seafood commodities footwear and electronics he looks to exports to grow the economy above 6 provide more jobs and avoid the middle income trap professor junaid shaikh and vietnam s vice director of the industry and trade information center dinh thi bao linh explained it this way in 2017 since the recent advances of china and its ambition in the south china sea big countries like the united states japan and india have considered vietnam a key partner in their new asia strategies they added along with the economic integration and trade liberalization vietnam is opening its market with 100 million consumers and also many export opportunities to international business and investors in their 2019 q1 country risk report on vietnam fitch solutions predicted that vietnam will seek increasingly close relations with the u s and potentially india and japan in the defense sphere as a hedge against china s rising power in the region my clients interested in vietnam investments increasingly think that president trump s trade war with china has created vietnam growth opportunities china s general belligerence against south korean and japanese companies translated to u s investments means that u s investors are looking to move their operations elsewhere including to vietnam the same logic applies to japan whose relations with china are even more strained judging by the number of military contacts over the east china sea and which has much more pre existing foreign direct investment fdi in vietnam than does the united states china increasingly links positive trade and investment relations to political concessions given by the u s japan australia and south korea when those political concessions are not forthcoming china treats foreign companies in its market as hostages pressure is applied to vulnerable company profits in the hopes that their representatives in home capitals will use their political influence to effect the foreign or trade policy that beijing seeks apple ceo tim cook tried to reverse president trump s trade war and for good reason as the trade war gained steam apple s revenue forecasts in china dipped and the company lost 10 of its stock value this may help china s diplomacy in the short term but in the long term it just causes capital flight even chinese investors are fleeing china vietnam benefits as china alternatives sought the money has to go somewhere and vietnam s leadership is hungry for investment and willing to make concessions to foreign investors the country enjoys 6 7 gdp growth low inflation export oriented markets strengthening diplomacy that will lead to more exports and has a cheaper yet comparatively skilled labor market fdi foreign direct investment is perhaps the strongest long term indicator of a positive economic relationship between two countries as fdi includes long term sunk costs that would be most threatened by a downturn in bilateral relations investors typically put their money where the risk return ratio is expected to be good for a long period in 2000 japanese fdi flow to vietnam was just us 39 million balance of payments basis net that number hit a record us 3 3 billion in 2013 and then dropped to a still substantial us 1 4 billion in 2015 it has since risen to us 2 billion in 2017 japanese fdi flow to vietnam has increased as a percentage of all japanese fdi flow as well in 2000 it was just 0 12 a number that increased to 1 19 in 2017 in that year japan had 397 fdi projects licensed in vietnam that totaled in dollar terms more than any other country at us 9 2 billion in total registered capital according to the general statistics office of vietnam imports and exports between japan and vietnam are also strong in 2017 japan exported usd 15 billion to vietnam and imported us 18 5 billion this us 3 5 billion balance of trade in vietnam s favor means that vietnam exports more to japan than japan exports to vietnam that makes japan a valuable source of foreign exchange for vietnam and it gives vietnam a strong incentive to be a good trade partner to japan durability of japan vietnam business relations indeed an asian economic journal study published in 2017 found that japanese multinational enterprises in vietnam have a particularly strong chance of surviving compared to mnes from many other nations especially when they partner with state owned enterprises and have a large ownership share the amount of japan vietnam trade is rapidly increasing with a year on year increase of 12 0 on japanese exports to vietnam and 14 1 on imports from vietnam year on year change october 2018 vietnam trade is truly a growth market for japan which can increasingly shift business to the country as commitments in china are wound down there is plenty of room for more growth as japanese exports to the country are still only 2 2 of total exports and imports are only 2 8 of total imports an example of japanese fdi in vietnam is the nghi son power station south of hanoi in thanh hoa province the coal fired power plant is in an economic zone created in 2005 that required substantial power electricity of vietnam awarded japan s marubeni corporation the us 1 2 billion contract for the 600 megawatt first phase of the plant in 2010 construction began immediately and the first two 300 megawatt units powered up in june 2013 and june 2014 respectively multinational projects in vietnam in march 2013 vietnam s ministry of industry and trade awarded a second contract for a 1 320 megawatt phase two plant to a japanese korean consortium that included marubeni corporation and korea electric power company kepco after the plant is built the companies will operate it for 25 years and then ownership will revert to vietnam funding for the us 2 3 billion contract was finalized in april 2018 with the japan bank for international cooperation jbic and export import bank of korea each providing a us 560 million loan and a group of banks from japan malaysia and singapore providing the rest a construction start rapidly followed in july 2018 with the plant planned for operations in 2022 economic reforms suit investment international investment and trade is sufficiently important to vietnam that it is making major reforms to its economy in accordance with advice from its japanese and other trade partners as well as international organizations like the world trade organization wto liberalization of vietnam s fdi policies date to its first fdi law introduced in 1987 and amended in 1992 1996 and 2000 japanese fdi increased substantially after that date as detailed above a unified law of investment instituted equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors and was instituted in 2006 this in compliance with vietnam s joining of the wto in january 2007 and the 2009 japan vietnam free trade agreement fta and economic partnership agreement epa led to a 700 increase in annual japanese fdi flow to vietnam between 2006 and the peak in 2013 as the market matured under the epa a 0 tariff rate was applied to 456 items including construction stones aluminum steel sugar equipment machinery vehicle parts during the first quarter of 2018 vietnam s ministry of finance produced 10 draft decrees related to preferential tariff rates in 2018 2020 for its 10 ftas these included vietnam s fta with japan most goods started enjoying 0 import tariffs on january 1 2018 other goods will see a gradual reduction of tariffs until 2022 that will increase the vietnamese manufacturing sector s substantial imports of japanese intermediate industrial inputs that feed the production process vietnamese prime minister nguyen x phuanuc met with japanese foreign minister taro kano in hanoi september 11 2018 at the world economic forum on asean 2018 hosted by vietnam the prime minister recommended increased economic linkages between the two countries at the meeting and for japan to increase its activities in vietnam s mekong region in 2019 in accordance with the asean japan comprehensive economic partnership existing 5 import taxes will be removed in vietnam for various commodities future challenges there will be continued bumps in the road of japanese investment and trade with vietnam these include issues with corruption infrastructure labor disputes and the economic slowdown in china but japanese investors have consistently increased fdi flows to vietnam since 2015 in addition japanese officials are working with their vietnamese counterparts to continue the process of gradual improvement to vietnam s political and economic conditions that began over 30 years ago a chinese economic slowdown should be seen as a long term opportunity not a short term cost to economic growth in vietnam and japan with the china trade war gathering steam pressure to divert global investment from china to other markets will only increase the fdi and trade flow with vietnam japan s pioneering vietnam investments over the years will increase as will japan s benefit from other international investors following its lead into the mekong area courtesy japan forward com
listen to the article taking a page out of their radical progressivist playbook the democrats plan hyperinflation to finance massive spending increases and new entitlements in fact many democrats are embracing the ideas of economist stephanie kelton or modern monetary theory however even liberal nobel prize winning economist paul krugman calls kelton s ideas a blueprint for hyperinflation in particular kelton believes that the government will never go bankrupt because the treasury can print all the money it wants so the government can supposedly spend all the money politicians want consequently kelton s theory is now the biggest idea in washington the huffington post claims just how will the democrats plan hyperinflation the democrats plan hyperinflation by increasing the money supply the week s james pethokoukis claims as a result the democrats plan to make kelton s ideas function as national policy particularly democrats will issue an unlimited amount of debt to pay for programs such as basic income free college tuition medicare for all and a jobs guarantee astonishingly kelton believes the government can pay for all that without raising taxes through the printing of more and more money conversely krugman believes that this practice will cause an inflation rate of 12 a month or 144 a year this will destroy your money because 1 will be worth 1 44 after merely a year of such hyperinflation as a consequence a 62 000 annual salary will be worth 7 740 per year under modern monetary policy notwithstanding the u s department of health and human services sets the poverty rate for a family of four at 25 750 a year because of this modern monetary policy will impoverish most americans why wall street and the democrats plan hyperinflation krugman also thinks that the monthly inflation rate from unlimited government spending could exceed 400 specifically an item on the mcdonald s dollar menu could cost 40 000 after only 10 months of modern monetary theory under these conditions most investments including savings bonds and real estate will lose most of their value yet some investments like stocks gold silver and cryptocurrencies could grow in value under hyperinflation for this reason many investment bankers speculators hedge fund managers and stock investors like inflation therefore many people on wall street may welcome kelton and her economic ideas democrats blueprint for hyperinflation could lead to hunger riots and civil war notably modern monetary theory is currently being employed in venezuela where it is a spectacular failure for instance venezuela is experiencing widespread hunger because millions of people cannot afford food moreover one third of venezuelans eat only one meal a day because that is all they can afford the miami herald reports hyperinflation leads to food shortages because prices increase faster than families incomes consequently people cannot afford to buy food beyond hunger hyperinflation leads to civil unrest and crime for example a national guard unit from a poor neighborhood in venezuela s capital of caracas mutinied recently the herald states additionally riots killed 16 people and injured 228 protesters in venezuela last week newsweek claims hyperinflation could lead to civil war in venezuela because two men claim to be president socialist incumbent nicolás maduro claims to have won the last presidential election nonetheless rival socialist juan guaidó also claims to be president democrats blueprint for hyperinflation could turn america into venezuela hyperinflation is destroying venezuela because of two decades of uncontrolled spending by maduro and his late predecessor hugo chavez presently the international monetary fund imf estimates venezuela s inflation rate at one million percent in essence the democrats blueprint for hyperinflation could change america into venezuela remarkably venezuela was the richest country in south america until they elected chavez in 1998 nevertheless the venezuelan economy shrank by 30 between 2013 and 2017 due to hyperinflation the imf calculates furthermore venezuela s gross domestic product gdp shrank by 18 in 2018 now a cup of coffee in venezuela costs two million bolivars forbes contributor garth friessen estimates meanwhile statista asserts that the average cup of coffee costs 3 12 in new york which is one of america s most expensive cities to clarify the bolivar is venezuela s national currency named for simón bolívar bolívar was the general who led venezuela s revolution against spanish imperialism in the 19th century democrats plan hyperinflation despite the venezuelan catastrophe the democrats are still planning hyperinflation through modern monetary policy despite the venezuelan disaster as an illustration democratic presidential candidate and u s senator kamala harris plans to pay every american family a 500 per month basic income as a tax refund harris s rival u s senator kirsten gillibrand d new york wants a jobs guarantee and a green new deal a jobs guarantee offers all unemployed people a 15 an hour government job with health insurance in addition the green new deal is yet another massive spending program that serves to switch america from fossil fuels to green energy and then there s democratic frontrunner bernie sanders of course he wants the government to pay all of the costs of healthcare and college for every american democrats could implement the blueprint for hyperinflation in 2021 currently republicans can block the democrats blueprint for hyperinflation because they control the u s senate and the white house however the 2020 elections are just around the corner if democrats wind up controlling both the senate and the white house then they would be able to implement their blueprint for hyperinflation as early as january 2021 ultimately america could experience the democrats plan for hyperinflation with very little time to brace for the chaos you

multi year program to sell land adjacent to its orlando florida headquarters and also disposes of other excess land and facilities periodically these activities are not part of its primary business operations additionally amounts recognized in any given period are not indicative of amounts that may be recognized in any particular future period for this reason these amounts are excluded as indicated the company excludes significant charges related to casualty losses caused by significant weather events fires or similar circumstances it also excludes any related gains resulting from the settlement of associated insurance claims while these types of events can and do recur periodically they are excluded from indicated financial information due to their distinction from ongoing business operations inherent volatility and impact on the comparability of earnings across periods the company periodically records exit costs accounted for using the applicable accounting guidance for exit or disposal cost obligations and other amounts related to rationalizing its supply chain operations and other re engineering activities including the exit of businesses and upon liquidation of operations in a country the recognition in income of amounts previously recorded in equity as a cumulative translation adjustment also the company excludes the impact of changes in tax laws on cumulative deferred taxes from items previously recorded as cumulative translation adjustments the company believes these amounts are similarly volatile and impact the comparability of earnings across periods therefore they are also excluded from indicated financial information to provide what the company believes represents a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company believes that excluding from reported financial information costs incurred in connection with a change in its capital structure that is of a nature that would be expected to recur sporadically also provides a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company accounts for its operations in argentina and venezuela using hyper inflation rules under gaap due to volatility in changes in exchange rates the company s non gaap measures exclude for analysis and predictive purposes the impact from devaluations on the argentine peso and the bolivar denominated net monetary assets and other balance sheet positions that impact near term income since they appear in the income statement at the exchange rate at which they were originally translated rather than the exchange rate at which current operating activity is being translated the company has also elected to present financial measures excluding the impact of amortizing the purchase accounting carrying value of certain definite lived intangible assets primarily the value of its fuller trade name recorded in connection with the company s december 2005 acquisition of the direct selling businesses of sara lee corporation the amortization expense related to these assets will continue for several years similarly in connection with its evaluation of the carrying value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill the company has periodically recognized impairment charges the company believes that these types of non cash charges will not be representative in any single reporting period of amounts recorded in prior reporting periods or expected to be recorded in future reporting periods therefore they are excluded from indicated financial information to also provide a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes as the impact of changes in exchange rates is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons the company believes the presentation of results on a local currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve readers ability to understand the company s operating results and evaluate performance in comparison with prior periods the company presents local currency information that compares results between periods as if current period exchange rates had been the exchange rates in the prior period the company uses results on a local currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance the company generally refers to such amounts as calculated on a local currency basis as restated or excluding the impact of foreign currency these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a local currency basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with gaap in information included with this release the company has referred to adjusted ebitda and a debt adjusted ebitda ratio which are non gaap financial measures used in the company s credit agreement the company uses these measures in its capital allocation decision process and in discussions with investors analysts and other interested parties and therefore believes it is useful to disclose this amount and ratio the company s calculation of these measures is in accordance with its credit agreement and is set forth in the reconciliation from gaap amounts in an attachment to this release however the reader is cautioned that other companies define these measures in different ways and consequently they may not be comparable with similarly labeled amounts disclosed by others tupperware brands corporation fourth quarter 2018 sales force statistics unaudited sales all units reported inc dec vs q4 17 restated inc

tupperware brands foreign exchange translation impact update other than updating for changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company does not intend to update forward looking information except through its quarterly earnings releases unless it expects diluted earnings per share for the current quarter excluding items impacting comparability and changes versus its guidance of the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to be significantly below its previous guidance non gaap financial measures the company has utilized non gaap financial measures in this release which are provided to assist readers understanding of the company s results of operations these amounts exclude certain items that at times materially impact the comparability of the company s results of operations the adjusted information is intended to be indicative of the company s primary operations and to assist readers in evaluating performance and analyzing trends across periods these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap the non gaap financial measures include sales adjustments to remove the impact of the 2017 closure of beauticontrol and the combination of the naturcare and tupperware businesses in japan effective the beginning of 2018 on comparisons related to profit the non gaap financial measures exclude gains from the sale of property plant and equipment and insurance settlements related to casualty losses other income in connection with real estate related operations inventory obsolescence and operating losses in conjunction with decisions to exit wind down or significantly restructure businesses along with asset sales related to exited or restructured businesses certain asset retirement obligations re engineering including the exit of businesses and fixed asset impairment charges pension settlements and significant discrete impacts of new tax laws upon adoption while the company is engaged in a multi year program to sell land adjacent to its orlando florida headquarters and also disposes of other excess land and facilities periodically these activities are not part of its primary business operations additionally amounts recognized in any given period are not indicative of amounts that may be recognized in any particular future period for this reason these amounts are excluded as indicated the company excludes significant charges related to casualty losses caused by significant weather events fires or similar circumstances it also excludes any related gains resulting from the settlement of associated insurance claims while these types of events can and do recur periodically they are excluded from indicated financial information due to their distinction from ongoing business operations inherent volatility and impact on the comparability of earnings across periods the company periodically records exit costs accounted for using the applicable accounting guidance for exit or disposal cost obligations and other amounts related to rationalizing its supply chain operations and other re engineering activities including the exit of businesses and upon liquidation of operations in a country the recognition in income of amounts previously recorded in equity as a cumulative translation adjustment also the company excludes the impact of changes in tax laws on cumulative deferred taxes from items previously recorded as cumulative translation adjustments the company believes these amounts are similarly volatile and impact the comparability of earnings across periods therefore they are also excluded from indicated financial information to provide what the company believes represents a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company believes that excluding from reported financial information costs incurred in connection with a change in its capital structure that is of a nature that would be expected to recur sporadically also provides a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company accounts for its operations in argentina and venezuela using hyper inflation rules under gaap due to volatility in changes in exchange rates the company s non gaap measures exclude for analysis and predictive purposes the impact from devaluations on the argentine peso and the bolivar denominated net monetary assets and other balance sheet positions that impact near term income since they appear in the income statement at the exchange rate at which they were originally translated rather than the exchange rate at which current operating activity is being translated the company has also elected to present financial measures excluding the impact of amortizing the purchase accounting carrying value of certain definite lived intangible assets primarily the value of its fuller trade name recorded in connection with the company s december 2005 acquisition of the direct selling businesses of sara lee corporation the amortization expense related to these assets will continue for several years similarly in connection with its evaluation of the carrying value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill the company has periodically recognized impairment charges the company believes that these types of non cash charges will not be representative in any single reporting period of amounts recorded in prior reporting periods or expected to be recorded in future reporting periods therefore they are excluded from indicated financial information to also provide a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes as the impact of changes in exchange rates is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons the company believes the presentation of results on a local currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve readers ability to understand the company s operating results and evaluate performance in comparison with prior periods the company presents local currency information that compares results between periods as if current period exchange rates had been the exchange rates in the prior period the company uses results on a local currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance the company generally refers to such amounts as calculated on a local currency basis as restated or excluding the impact of foreign currency these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a local currency basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with gaap in information included with this release the company has referred to adjusted ebitda and a debt adjusted ebitda ratio which are non gaap financial measures used in the company s credit agreement the company uses these measures in its capital allocation decision process and in discussions with investors analysts and other interested parties and therefore believes it is useful to disclose this amount and ratio the company s calculation of these measures is in accordance with its credit agreement and is set forth in the reconciliation from gaap amounts in an attachment to this release however the reader is cautioned that other companies define these measures in different ways and consequently they may not be comparable with similarly labeled amounts disclosed by others tupperware brands corporation fourth quarter 2018 sales force statistics unaudited sales all units reported inc dec vs q4 17 restated inc

reserve continues to raise interest rates and trim its enormous balance sheet as a result economic forecasters are lowering their growth outlook for 2019 while the risks of recession are rising in all likelihood those warning signs should put a damper on business investment state of the national debt sky s the limit steven pressman colorado state university as a candidate trump promised to eliminate america s national debt in eight years through faster economic growth how s he done so far not so good the debt has climbed from 20 trillion when trump took office to 21 5 trillion at the end of 2018 the budget deficit or the difference between government revenues and spending is what changes the national debt after falling continuously from 1 4 trillion in 2009 at the end of the great recession to 585 billion in 2016 the u s budget deficit has risen during the trump presidency it hit 779 billion in 2018 the highest level since 2012 and is expected to reach 900 billion this year the two main forces driving this are greater spending on the military and disaster relief and the 2017 tax cut which reduced corporate income taxes by 92 billion the trump administration and the republicans who pushed for the tax cut promised that economic growth would increase tax revenues and offset the losses most economists including me were skeptical that corporate tax cuts would substantially increase investment and economic growth so far the data supports the skeptics the greatest problem however is that budget deficits should fall during economic expansions this provides more policy flexibility whenever the next recession hits during recessions tax receipts fall and government spending rises pushing up the deficit the appropriate fiscal policy response increase the budget deficit even more becomes harder the larger it already is state of trade uncertainty and trade wars james lake southern methodist university american trade with the world is crucial to the u s economy exceeding 25 percent of gross domestic product but with uncertainty over tariffs trade wars and trade agreements keeping u s businesses on their toes the state of trade is in flux the raw numbers tell a mixed story after increasing for six straight quarters the brunt of strong foreign retaliation over trump s tariffs pushed u s exports down 1 24 percent in the third quarter of 2018 the latest data available it s the biggest fall since the depths of the great recession in 2009 at the same time imports jumped that quarter as u s companies wary of higher tariffs on chinese goods stocked up imports from china surged 11 1 percent the most since 2011 as a result america s trade deficit with the world one of the president s most cited metrics and a reason he s fighting his trade wars widened to a 10 year high the trump administration has spent the better part of the past year escalating its war of words and tariffs with china with tit for tat trade barriers being hurled back and forth trump s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods were set to ratchet up from 10 percent to 25 percent in january until he and chinese president xi jinping agreed to a three month truce to come to a deal the deadline is march 1 but rather than leading to chinese concessions trump s strong arm negotiating tactics have led to a new suit this month against the u s at the world trade organization and despite continuing to push hard on chinese telecom giant huawei there s now talk that the trump administration s tariff stance may be softening all of this uncertainty together with the higher tariffs are starting to hurt markets as well as companies like u s manufacturing bellwether caterpillar and iconic motorcycle maker harley davidson another major area of concern has been the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement which lasted some 18 months and resulted in a deal that looked strikingly similar to the original there were some modest changes for the dairy and auto industries but by and large it was the same old agreement nevertheless congress still needs to actually vote on the new deal known as the u s mexico canada agreement and newly empowered democrats are talking about reopening the deal to demand stronger labor and environmental protections and unsurprisingly trump is once again threatening to withdraw from the pact altogether so more uncertainty ahead for u s business workers and consumers state of health care high mortality higher costs david bishai john hopkins university in his inaugural address trump vowed to end american carnage if carnage is measured in american mortality things are are not getting better unfortunately u s life expectancy fell to 78 6 years at the end of 2017 the latest data available this continues a slide from 2015 the first time it has shown a sustained three year fall in four decades according to the centers for disease control comparable countries like canada the u k france and germany continue to see life expectancy climbing well above 80 one of the big reasons is the opioid epidemic which is estimated to have cost the economy 1 trillion from 2001 to 2017 every state in the union is seeing epidemics of drug overdoses suicide and alcohol related deaths despite better access to health insurance states that expanded access to health insurance showed slower growth of drug overdose mortality and increased access to rehabilitative treatment for addiction the affordable care act helped cut the share of uninsured americans from 17 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2015 where they have remained better insurance also brings access to services that have lowered death rates from congenital malformations heart disease and cancer yet the aca is not a panacea and has not prevented lethal epidemics from sweeping the nation this is especially frustrating because americans spend 18 percent of gdp on health care or 10 739 for every man woman and child so the problem isn t spending it s how we spend it research and real world examples are showing how communities bringing together multiple groups outside of health care to pursue various approaches can lead to promising results examples include cutting overdose death rates in dayton ohio and wilkes county north carolina that s the best way to finally stem the flow of american carnage
china s increasingly belligerent approach to regional and international politics and trade is causing investors importers and exporters to diversify risks away from china and into other markets apple recently lost over usd 70 billion from its market capitalization as stock of the company which is heavily invested in china s consumer market and manufacturing crashed 10 with the pressure of apple s weaker than expected earnings forecasts in china china had threatened consequences to u s companies like boeing and apple from the trade war and sure enough those consequences are real the strategy moreover stretches back to the founding of china in 1949 as evidenced by britain s leading recognition of the country in order to save its position in shanghai hong kong and elsewhere advertisement since the hu jintao era there is statistical evidence that china uses trade to try and wrest political concessions in the form of other countries foreign policies businesses in japan south korea and norway have been hit by china for their government s policies on defense and human rights issues rising business risks in china sharply rising risks to investment in china since donald trump became united states president in 2017 have made not only american but japanese companies increasingly look elsewhere for opportunities vietnam is one such location accelerating an already strong outlook for the japan vietnam trade and investment relationship vietnamese prime minister nguyen xuan phuoc will be making investor pitches at the world economic forum in davos in late january he told bloomberg news on january 20 that vietnam expects growth in the range of 6 6 to 6 8 and that it would keep the currency stable he said vietnam would be encouraging foreign business friendly policies and free trade we are ready to grab the opportunity he told bloomberg we are trying to increase exports in both quantity and quality of our products especially in which we have advantages such as seafood commodities footwear and electronics he looks to exports to grow the economy above 6 provide more jobs and avoid the middle income trap advertisement professor junaid shaikh and vietnam s vice director of the industry and trade information center dinh thi bao linh explained it this way in 2017 since the recent advances of china and its ambition in the south china sea big countries like the united states japan and india have considered vietnam a key partner in their new asia strategies they added along with the economic integration and trade liberalization vietnam is opening its market with 100 million consumers and also many export opportunities to international business and investors in their 2019 q1 country risk report on vietnam fitch solutions predicted that vietnam will seek increasingly close relations with the u s and potentially india and japan in the defense sphere as a hedge against china s rising power in the region my clients interested in vietnam investments increasingly think that president trump s trade war with china has created vietnam growth opportunities china s general belligerence against south korean and japanese companies translated to u s investments means that u s investors are looking to move their operations elsewhere including to vietnam advertisement the same logic applies to japan whose relations with china are even more strained judging by the number of military contacts over the east china sea and which has much more pre existing foreign direct investment fdi in vietnam than does the united states china increasingly links positive trade and investment relations to political concessions given by the u s japan australia and south korea when those political concessions are not forthcoming china treats foreign companies in its market as hostages pressure is applied to vulnerable company profits in the hopes that their representatives in home capitals will use their political influence to effect the foreign or trade policy that beijing seeks apple ceo tim cook tried to reverse president trump s trade war and for good reason as the trade war gained steam apple s revenue forecasts in china dipped and the company lost 10 of its stock value this may help china s diplomacy in the short term but in the long term it just causes capital flight even chinese investors are fleeing china vietnam benefits as china alternatives sought advertisement vietnam is one among the many likely beneficiaries of that capital flight the money has to go somewhere and vietnam s leadership is hungry for investment and willing to make concessions to foreign investors the country enjoys 6 7 gdp growth low inflation export oriented markets strengthening diplomacy that will lead to more exports and has a cheaper yet comparatively skilled labor market fdi foreign direct investment is perhaps the strongest long term indicator of a positive economic relationship between two countries as fdi includes long term sunk costs that would be most threatened by a downturn in bilateral relations investors typically put their money where the risk return ratio is expected to be good for a long period in 2000 japanese fdi flow to vietnam was just usd 39 million balance of payments basis net that number hit a record usd 3 3 billion in 2013 and then dropped to a still substantial usd 1 4 billion in 2015 it has since risen to usd 2 billion in 2017 advertisement japanese fdi flow to vietnam has increased as a percentage of all japanese fdi flow as well in 2000 it was just 0 12 a number that increased to 1 19 in 2017 in that year japan had 397 fdi projects licensed in vietnam that totaled in dollar terms more than any other country at usd 9 2 billion in total registered capital according to the general statistics office of vietnam imports and exports between japan and vietnam are also strong in 2017 japan exported usd 15 billion to vietnam and imported usd 18 5 billion this usd 3 5 billion balance of trade in vietnam s favor means that vietnam exports more to japan than japan exports to vietnam that makes japan a valuable source of foreign exchange for vietnam and it gives vietnam a strong incentive to be a good trade partner to japan durability of japan vietnam business relations indeed an asian economic journal study published in 2017 found that japanese multinational enterprises in vietnam have a particularly strong chance of surviving compared to mnes from many other nations especially when they partner with state owned enterprises and have a large ownership share advertisement the amount of japan vietnam trade is rapidly increasing with a year on year increase of 12 0 on japanese exports to vietnam and 14 1 on imports from vietnam year on year change october 2018 vietnam trade is truly a growth market for japan which can increasingly shift business to the country as commitments in china are wound down there is plenty of room for more growth as japanese exports to the country are still only 2 2 of total exports and imports are only 2 8 of total imports multinational projects in vietnam an example of japanese fdi in vietnam is the nghi son power station south of hanoi in thanh hoa province the coal fired power plant is in an economic zone created in 2005 that required substantial power electricity of vietnam awarded japan s marubeni corporation the usd 1 2 billion contract for the 600 megawatt first phase of the plant in 2010 construction began immediately and the first two 300 megawatt units powered up in june 2013 and june 2014 respectively in march 2013 vietnam s ministry of industry and trade awarded a second contract for a 1 320 megawatt phase two plant to a japanese korean consortium that included marubeni corporation and korea electric power company kepco after the plant is built the companies will operate it for 25 years and then ownership will revert to vietnam advertisement funding for the usd 2 3 billion contract was finalized in april 2018 with the japan bank for international cooperation jbic and export import bank of korea each providing a usd 560 million loan and a group of banks from japan malaysia and singapore providing the rest a construction start rapidly followed in july 2018 with the plant planned for operations in 2022 economic reforms suit investment international investment and trade is sufficiently important to vietnam that it is making major reforms to its economy in accordance with advice from its japanese and other trade partners as well as international organizations like the world trade organization wto liberalization of vietnam s fdi policies date to its first fdi law introduced in 1987 and amended in 1992 1996 and 2000 japanese fdi increased substantially after that date as detailed above advertisement a unified law of investment instituted equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors and was instituted in 2006 this in compliance with vietnam s joining of the wto in january 2007 and the 2009 japan vietnam free trade agreement fta and economic partnership agreement epa led to a 700 increase in annual japanese fdi flow to vietnam between 2006 and the peak in 2013 as the market matured under the epa a 0 tariff rate was applied to 456 items including construction stones aluminum steel sugar equipment machinery vehicle parts during the first quarter of 2018 vietnam s ministry of finance produced 10 draft decrees related to preferential tariff rates in 2018 2020 for its 10 ftas these included vietnam s fta with japan most goods started enjoying 0 import tariffs on january 1 2018 other goods will see a gradual reduction of tariffs until 2022 that will increase the vietnamese manufacturing sector s substantial imports of japanese intermediate industrial inputs that feed the production process vietnamese prime minister nguyen x phuanuc met with japanese foreign minister taro kano in hanoi september 11 2018 at the world economic forum on asean 2018 hosted by vietnam the prime minister recommended increased economic linkages between the two countries at the meeting and for japan to increase its activities in vietnam s mekong region in 2019 in accordance with the asean japan comprehensive economic partnership existing 5 import taxes will be removed in vietnam for various commodities advertisement future challenges there will be continued bumps in the road of japanese investment and trade with vietnam these include issues with corruption infrastructure labor disputes and the economic slowdown in china but japanese investors have consistently increased fdi flows to vietnam since 2015 in addition japanese officials are working with their vietnamese counterparts to continue the process of gradual improvement to vietnam s political and economic conditions that began over 30 years ago a chinese economic slowdown should be seen as a long term opportunity not a short term cost to economic growth in vietnam and japan with the china trade war gathering steam pressure to divert global investment from china to other markets will only increase the fdi and trade flow with vietnam japan s pioneering vietnam investments over the years will increase as will japan s benefit from other international investors following its lead into the mekong area advertisement author anders corr
calling the precise time of the next global economic recession is notoriously difficult however the same might not be true of calling how severe the next recession might be when it eventually occurs this would particularly seem to be the case in today s context of excessively high global debt levels global asset price bubbles and the generalized mispricing of credit market risk those considerations coupled with the lack of adequate policy instruments to respond to the next global economic recession would suggest that when the next recession does occur it will be much more severe than the average post war recession among the more disturbing vulnerabilities of today s global economy is the large amount of debt that was spawned by many years of ultra unorthodox monetary policy by the world s major central banks indeed according to the imf today s global debt to gdp level is 250 percent or around 30 percentage points higher than it was on the eve of the 2008 2009 great economic recession handling a very high debt level in the midst of a recession will be a major challenge for policymakers it might lead to a wave of defaults that could cause financial market distress that in turn would risk deepening the recession that challenge would be substantially compounded if that debt proved to be owed by debtors of dubious creditworthiness sadly there are all too many reasons to fear that years of unorthodox monetary policy and low interest rates has led to a marked deterioration in lending standards as former fed chair janet yellen has recently cautioned the size of the risky u s leveraged loan market has approximately doubled from 600 billion on the eve of the 2008 2009 recession to more than 1 2 trillion at present at the same time there has been a very large increase in lending to corporations of dubious creditworthiness in the emerging market economies particularly troubling is the fact that more than 3 trillion of that debt is in u s dollar denominated terms which will be difficult for those companies to repay if the world economy were to weaken and the u s dollar were to strengthen an important reason to be more concerned about high debt levels today than we might have been in 2008 is that the mispricing of global debt in the current economic cycle is much more pervasive than it was back then in 2008 that mispricing was largely limited to u s mortgage lending whereas today it seems to be across the board and around the world this would seem to set us up for considerable financial market dislocation should we get a serious repricing of risk to more normal levels and the bursting of asset price bubbles in the global equity and housing markets examples of credit risk mispricing include the u s high yield debt market and the emerging market corporate debt market borrowing rates in both of those markets reached levels that did not nearly compensate the lenders for default risk mispricing was also in evidence in the sovereign debt markets of very highly indebted countries like italy where until recently the italian government could borrow long term at interest rates very close to those in the united states yet another reason to be concerned that the next recession is likely to be more severe than an average recession is that the united states would seem to be less well equipped now than it was in 2008 to fight the next recession with interest rates still relatively low and with considerable political resistance to another round of quantitative easing the federal reserve would seem to have very much less room for policy maneuver than before similarly with the u s budget deficit already bloated by the very large trump tax cut at a time of cyclical strength there would seem to be little room for another fiscal stimulus package when the next economic downturn occurs the 2008 2009 great economic recession caught global policymakers flatfooted a coordinated global policy economic response was also required to get the world economy out of that recession it is hoped this time around global policymakers will be better prepared for the next recession than before by the time that the next recession comes around one must also hope that the trump administration will be taking a more constructive stance with respect to the need for global economic policy coordination however judging by the administration s america first policy to date i would not recommend holding one s breath for that to happen desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney

artemis is now 60 years old and started working when she was a teenager she has been in formal employment for 38 years with a few brief interruptions and is still working her salary is not as good as it used to be she no longer receives basic benefits such as medical care and her chances of retiring are zero due to the peculiarities of mexico s legislation she has worked in both the public and private sectors and the law does not allow her to accumulate those years of work to provide her with an income during retirement the increased labour flexibility resulting from various legal reforms in the last 20 years has left a significant percentage of mexican workers in a precarious situation the situation is drastic absolutely all rights have been lost given the lack of employment opportunities people seeking work do not pick and choose they simply take what they are given even if it comes without benefits or the most basic social security says josé alfonso bouzas a member of the economic research institute of the national autonomous university of mexico the largest in the country and an expert in labour law the researcher explains that the situation is not simply the result of the recent legal reforms it is the reality on the ground that has been deviating from the legal rules since the 1980s outsourcing was already a reality before the law was reformed for example and although safeguards were put in place to protect workers the authorities themselves issued instructions not to apply them because there was a significant level of disgruntlement among employers mexico was already a labour haven the many years of stagnant economic growth that followed the 2008 2009 crisis have stymied the much needed increase in sources of well paid employment and the low wages on the mexican market have been the greatest draw for foreign investment in the country s manufacturing sector especially within the framework of the north american free trade agreement nafta in 2012 the mexican congress approved one of the various labour reforms that has made contractual arrangements more flexible trial periods initial training part time contracts and although the possibility already existed subcontracting or contracting through third parties outsourcing was regulated with a view to opening up sources of employment and improving productivity the mexican constitution adopted in 1917 was internationally recognised as being a trailblazer in the field of social rights but in the view of manuel fuentes one of the best known labour lawyers in the country the federal labour law which regulates the relationship between workers and employers in the private sector has commodified that relationship severely weakening social rights according to a study about to be published by the human rights commission of mexico city prepared by consultant germán reyes gaytán and made available to equal times precarious employment relationships are already a reality in mexico as illustrated by the level of unemployment informal work the loss of purchasing power and the lack of labour justice aleida hernández cervantes also a researcher at the national university explains that job insecurity and uncertainty the lack of protection and the inability to take part in determining working conditions are all features that point to the existence of precarious work the many and varied features of precarious employment include temporary contracts of varying duration lack of clarity regarding the identity of the employer and difficulties exercising union rights she says this is also reflected in the new oecd employment strategy released by the organization for economic cooperation and development on 4 december which states that while growth requires policies that promote flexibility in labour and product markets these are not sufficient to deliver positive outcomes in terms of the quantity and quality of employment and inclusion millions of mexicans are no longer even looking for work there is none the official unemployment figures are deceptive while unemployment fell from 4 94 per cent to 3 88 per cent between 2013 and 2016 the indicator for people who had stopped looking for work was 16 09 per cent the study of the human rights commission points to the alarming fact that in 2016 out of an economically active population eap of 53 68 million people 2 1 million were unemployed and another 5 8 million not only had no work but had stopped seeking employment for various reasons in addition the international labour organization ilo in its 2017 labour overview of latin america and the caribbean noted that the reduction in the unemployment rate in mexico was not the result of greater job creation but rather a decrease in the labour force participation rate this situation could be made worse by the austerity measures already being implemented by the new government headed by leftist president andrés manuel lópez obrador plans have been announced for example to dismiss 2 000 workers from the senate of the republic 64 per cent and 3 000 from the chamber of deputies the agency in charge of collecting taxes called for 1 000 voluntary resignations whilst trying to avoid forking out the statutory redundancy pay the social security institute for public sector workers the issste has announced 3 000 job cuts and its counterpart in charge of private sector workers has also announced restructuring plans although no precise figures have as yet been provided jobs in the public education sector are to be cut by 30 per cent and the list goes on with regard to salaries according to information quoted by former congresswoman araceli damián mexico has fallen behind other countries over the last 20 years with the average wage in the manufacturing industry in china having tripled between 2005 and 2016 reaching us 3 60 an hour whilst in mexico it fell from us 2 20 to us 2 10 an hour and while real wages in most latin american countries increased according to the aforementioned ilo report in mexico they declined the new oecd jobs strategy points out that mexico has the lowest wages of all member countries with average gross hourly earnings of us 4 60 compared with the overall oecd average of us 16 60 on 17 december 2018 the new government announced an increase in the minimum wage from us 4 39 a day to us 5 10 which represents a 16 per cent rise and a doubling of the minimum wage in areas close to the us border around eight million workers 6 66 per cent of the population will benefit from this rise informal sector employment according to the analysis of the human rights commission shrank slightly from 27 03 per cent in 2013 to 26 3 per cent in 2016 the percentage nonetheless continues to be a serious cause for concern reports the study as it reflects a constant and alarming level of precarious employment in the form of part time jobs casual or informal jobs or unpaid work in family businesses which are the only options available to many workers in mexico given the lack of decent employment opportunities outsourcing and the erosion of health insurance access to health care used to be one of the basic social guarantees available to those living off their labour the experts who drew up the report of the human rights commission note that in the past the idea that salaried employment would not be coupled with access to health care would have been inconceivable today health insurance is no longer a given for a significant portion of the workforce in salaried or formal employment in 2013 the number of formal workers without access to health services was approximately 15 08 million out of the little more than 33 million people in employment and despite the rise in the number of salaried workers the number of people without health care also rose the number of salaried workers was 35 26 million in 2016 but 15 97 million of them did not have access to medical care the hiring of workers through third parties has also contributed to the rise in precarious employment the study published by the human rights commission indicates that this method of hiring has increased more markedly in recent years rising from 8 6 per cent of people employed in 2004 to 16 per cent in 2014 according to official data the problem is that a significant percentage of these employment intermediaries do not report the workers actual wages to the tax authorities in order to lower the costs of their services or to the institutions in charge of social security thus also reducing the contributions they have to pay to these authorities although this may be seen as beneficial for the workers too as the amounts they have to pay in taxes and social security contributions is also less it is not in fact the case given that benefits such as the christmas bonus or sick pay are calculated on the basis of the wages reported it is for this reason that a senator who is also a union leader recently announced his intention to promote a legal reform to prohibit outsourcing raising concerns among employers young people and the new administration the employment and minimum wage survey conducted by the centre for social studies and public opinion cesop of the mexican chamber of deputies reported that 72 per cent of workers in the country said their situation had deteriorated in the last three years as a result of the cuts in employee benefits and wage income out of the 45 per cent of workers who reported having a job 19 9 per cent said they received the legally established benefits 16 2 per cent received no benefits at all 6 1 per cent received higher benefits than those established by law and 2 6 per cent had some benefits but were hired under contractual arrangements that did not establish a relationship with their employer the 2018 wage observatory report conducted by the ibero american university an institution run by jesuits recognised for their concern for social and human rights reports that 50 6 per cent of young people between the ages of 15 and 29 receive no benefits of any kind and 66 per cent of the young salaried population has no social security the labour flexibility trend has been growing in mexico since hiring arrangements were relaxed under the 2012 federal labour law reform leading to a state of permanent precariousness among young workers which is on the rise says the report in 2017 only 13 6 per cent of young people had access to paid leave christmas bonuses or credits for housing an additional problem is the young people who are not in employment education or training known as neets not in education employment or training the new government has launched a special programme young people building the future aimed at training this population group for work employer backed protection unions this growing precariousness has to a large extent been obscured by so called union leaders from big confederations such as confederación de trabajadores de méxico ctm and conferederación regional de obreros y campesinos croc labour expert manuel fuentes characterises the role of trade union leaders in mexico as follows the union leaderships headed by caciques have no respect for the will of the workers for them they are masses and objects like anything else the leaders are part of cliques with total control over their union s money and assets their electoral processes and even the will of the workers under the threat of putting them out of work or simply telling employers not to recruit them or to get rid of them on any pretext or to suspend their union rights or dismiss them without justification they also resort to threats beatings and even murder in some cases the union caciques manage to take control of the institutions where their members are employed this setup dominating the mexican trade union movement was built up over 70 years during which the main labour unions were organically linked to the pri the party that ruled the country during most of the last century followed by the right wing national action party from 2000 to 2012 national university researcher aleida hernández cervantes points out that this relationship between the mexican state and trade unions did not give the grassroots any say in the decisions of the public authorities as it was only the union leaders who ensured their inclusion in the governing coalition by mobilising and controlling the rank and file to ensure support for the governors in office while the exercise of rights such as unionisation internal union organisation and strikes was limited she argues that although the links between the corporate unions and the mexican state have not yet been dismantled there are various signs that they are being weakened the fall in unionisation rates is one sign of this weakening by 2012 the union membership rate was just 8 8 per cent of the total economically active population and 13 9 per cent of salaried workers one of the reasons behind this is the proliferation of individual contracts that prevent workers from joining trade unions she says the employer backed protection unions have also contributed to undermining workers representation through genuine trade unions an estimated 90 per cent of the collective agreements which should be the product of collective bargaining between the unions and the employer registered with the labour authorities are collective employer protection agreements resulting from sham negotiations between a fake union and the employer which chooses the organisation on the basis of its unconditionality such organisations are referred to as protection unions because they are formally set up and registered with the labour authorities with the purpose of providing a service to companies seeking to avoid genuine collective bargaining explains the researcher there is a mix of light and darkness on the current labour scene in addition to the increase in the minimum wage and scholarships for young people who are neither working nor studying ordered by the new president the supreme court has ruled that domestic workers have the right to social security the mexican senate also recently ratified ilo convention 98 which guarantees the right to freedom of association in contrast to this government employees are already being dismissed in their thousands

american economic sanctions have been the worst crime against humanity since world war two america s economic sanctions have killed more innocent people than all of the nuclear biological and chemical weapons ever used in the history of mankind the fact that for america the issue in venezuela is oil not democracy will surprise only those who watch the news and ignore history venezuela has the world s largest oil reserves on the planet america seeks control of venezuela because it sits atop the strategic intersection of the caribbean south and central american worlds control of the nation has always been a remarkably effective way to project power into these three regions and beyond from the first moment hugo chavez took office the united states has been trying to overthrow venezuela s socialist movement by using sanctions coup attempts and funding the opposition parties after all there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état united nations human rights council special rapporteur alfred de zayas recommended just a few days ago that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as a possible crime against humanity perpetrated by america over the past five years american sanctions have cut venezuela off from most financial markets which have caused local oil production to plummet consequently venezuela has experienced the largest decline in living standards of any country in recorded latin american history prior to american sanctions socialism in venezuela had reduced inequality and poverty whilst pensions expanded during the same time period in america it has been the absolute reverse president chavez funnelled venezuela s oil revenues into social spending such as free 6 healthcare education subsidized food networks and housing construction in order to fully understand why america is waging economic war on the people of venezuela one must analyse the historical relationship between the petrodollar system and sanctions of mass destruction prior to the 20th century the value of money was tied to gold when banks lent money they were constrained by the size of their gold reserves but in 1971 u s president richard nixon took the country off the gold standard nixon and saudi arabia came to an oil for dollars agreement that would change the course of history and become the root cause of countless wars for oil under this petrodollar agreement the only currency that saudi arabia could sell its oil in was the us dollar the saudi kingdom would in turn ensure that its oil profits flow back into u s government treasuries and american banks in exchange america pledged to provide the saudi royal family s regime with military protection and military hardware it was the start of something truly great for america access to oil defined 20th century empires and the petrodollar agreement was the key to the ascendancy of the united states as the world s sole superpower america s war machine runs on is funded by and exists in protection of oil threats by any nation to undermine the petrodollar system are viewed by washington as tantamount to a declaration of war against the united states of america within the last two decades iraq iran libya and venezuela have all threatened to sell their oil in other currencies consequently they have all been subject to crippling u s sanctions over time the petrodollar system spread beyond oil and the u s dollar slowly but surely became the reserve currency for global trades in most commodities and goods this system allows america to maintain its position of dominance as the world s only superpower despite being a staggering 23 trillion in debt with billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground and with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela should not only be wealthy but her people the envy of the developing world but the nation is essentially broke because american sanctions have cut them off from the international financial system and cost the economy 6 billion over the last five years without sanctions venezuela could recover easily by collateralizing some of its abundant resources or its 8 billion of gold reserves in order to get the loans necessary to kick start their economy in order to fully understand the insidious nature of the venezuelan crisis it is necessary to understand the genesis of economic sanctions at the height of world war two president truman issued an order for american bombers to drop fat man and little boy on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki killing 140 000 people instantly the gruesome images that emerged from the rubble were broadcast through television sets across the world and caused unprecedented outrage the political backlash forced u s policy makers to devise a more subtle weapon of mass destruction economic sanctions the term weapons of mass destruction wmd was first defined by the united nations in 1948 as atomic explosive weapons radioactive material weapons lethal chemical and biological weapons and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above sanctions are clearly the 21st century s deadliest weapon of mass destruction in 2001 the u s administration told us that iraq had weapons of mass destruction iraq was a terrorist state iraq was tied to al qaeda it all amounted to nothing in fact america already knew that the only weapons of mass destruction that saddam had were not nuclear in nature but rather chemical and biological the only reason they knew this in advance was because america sold the weapons to saddam to use on iran in 1991 what the u s administration did not tell us was that saddam hussein used to be a strong ally of the united states the main reason for toppling saddam and putting sanctions on the people of iraq was the fact that iraq had ditched the dollar for oil sales the united nations estimates that 1 7 million iraqis died due to bill clinton s sanctions 500 000 of whom were children in 1996 a journalist asked former u s secretary of state madeleine albright about these un reports specifically about the children america s top foreign policy official albright replied i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it clearly u s sanctions policies are nothing short of state sanctioned genocide over the last five years sanctions have caused venezuelan per capita incomes to drop by 40 percent which is a decline similar to that of war torn iraq and syria at the height of their armed conflicts millions of venezuelans have had to flee the country if america is so concerned about refugees trump should stop furthering disastrous foreign policies that actually create them under chavez venezuela had a policy of welcoming refugees president chavez turned venezuela into the wealthiest society in latin america with the best income equality another much vilified leader who used oil wealth to enrich his people only to be put under severe sanctions is muammar gaddafi in 1967 colonel gaddafi inherited one of the poorest nations in africa however by the time he was assassinated gaddafi had turned libya into africa s wealthiest nation perhaps gaddafi s greatest crime in the eyes of nato was his quest to quit selling libyan oil in u s dollars and denominate crude sales in a new gold backed common african currency in fact in august 2011 president obama confiscated 30 billion from libya s central bank which gaddafi had earmarked for the establishment of an african central bank and the african gold backed dinar currency africa has the fastest growing oil industry in the world and oil sales in a common african currency would have been especially devastating for the american dollar the u s economy and particularly the elite in charge of the petrodollar system it is for this reason that president clinton signed the now infamous iran libya sanctions act which the united nations children s fund said caused widespread suffering among civilians by severely limiting supplies of fuel access to cash and the means of replenishing stocks of food and essential medications clearly u s sanctions are weapons of mass destruction not so long ago iraq and libya were the two most modern and secular states in the middle east and north africa with the highest regional standards of living nowadays u s military intervention and economic sanctions have turned libya and iraq into two of the world s most failed nations they want to seize libya s oil and they care nothing about the lives of the libyan people remarked chavez during the western intervention in libya in 2011 in september 2017 president maduro made good on chavez s promise to list oil sales in yuan rather than the us dollar weeks later trump signed a round of crippling sanctions on the people of venezuela on monday u s national security adviser john bolton announced new sanctions that essentially steal 7 billion from venezuela s state owned oil company at that press conference bolton brazenly flashed a note pad that ominously said 5 000 troops to colombia when confronted about it by the media bolton simply said president trump stated that all options are on the table america s media is unquestionably the most corrupt institution in america the nation s media may quibble about trump s domestic policies but when it comes to starting wars for oil abroad they sing in remarkable unison fox news cnn and the new york times all cheered the nation into war in iraq over fictitious weapons of mass destruction whilst america was actually using sanctions of mass destruction on the iraqi people they did it in libya and now they are doing it again in venezuela democracy and freedom have always been the smoke screen in front of capitalist expansion for oil and the western media owns the smoke machine economic warfare has long since been under way against venezuela but military warfare is now imminent trump just hired elliot abrams as u s special envoy for venezuela who has a long and torrid history in latin america abrams pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the iran contra affair which involved america funding deadly communist rebels and was the worst scandal in the reagan era abrams was later pardoned by george bush senior america s new point man on venezuela also lied about the largest mass killing in recent latin american history by u s trained forces in el salvador there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état a un human rights council rapporteur alfred de zayas pointed out that america s aim in venezuela is to crush this government and bring in a neoliberal government that is going to privatise everything and is going to sell out a lot of transitional corporations stand to gain enormous profits and the united states is driven by the transnational corporations ever since 1980 the united states has steadily devolved from the status of the world s top creditor country to the world s most indebted country but thanks to the petrodollar system s huge global artificial demand for u s dollars america can continue exponential military expansion record breaking deficits and unrestrained spending america s largest export used to be manufactured goods made proudly in america today america s largest export is the u s dollar any nation like venezuela that threatens that export is met with america s second largest export weapons chief amongst which are sanctions of mass destruction garikai chengu is an ancient african

the state of the union is back on after speaker of the house nancy pelosi said she invited president donald trump to address congress and the nation on feb 5 earlier she had disinvited the president from giving the speech in the house on the scheduled date of jan 29 while we await trump s address we asked three economists to give us their own assessments of the state of the union as well as the president s performance so far each picked a theme state of the national debt sky s the limit steven pressman colorado state university as a candidate trump promised to eliminate america s national debt in eight years through faster economic growth how s he done so far not so good the debt has climbed from us 20 trillion when trump took office to 21 5 trillion at the end of 2018 the budget deficit or the difference between government revenues and spending is what changes the national debt after falling continuously from 1 4 trillion in 2009 at the end of the great recession to 585 billion in 2016 the u s budget deficit has risen during the trump presidency it hit 779 billion in 2018 the highest level since 2012 and is expected to reach 900 billion this year the two main forces driving this are greater spending on the military and disaster relief and the 2017 tax cut which reduced corporate income taxes by 92 billion the trump administration and the republicans who pushed for the tax cut promised that economic growth would increase tax revenues and offset the losses most economists including me were skeptical that corporate tax cuts would substantially increase investment and economic growth so far the data supports the skeptics the greatest problem however is that budget deficits should fall during economic expansions this provides more policy flexibility whenever the next recession hits during recessions tax receipts fall and government spending rises pushing up the deficit the appropriate fiscal policy response increase the budget deficit even more becomes harder the larger it already is state of trade uncertainty and trade wars james lake southern methodist university american trade with the world is crucial to the u s economy exceeding 25 percent of gross domestic product but with uncertainty over tariffs trade wars and trade agreements keeping u s businesses on their toes the state of trade is in flux the raw numbers tell a mixed story after increasing for six straight quarters the brunt of strong foreign retaliation over trump s tariffs pushed u s exports down 1 24 percent in the third quarter of 2018 the latest data available it s the biggest fall since the depths of the great recession in 2009 at the same time imports jumped that quarter as u s companies wary of higher tariffs on chinese goods stocked up imports from china surged 11 1 percent the most since 2011 as a result america s trade deficit with the world one of the president s most cited metrics and a reason he s fighting his trade wars widened to a 10 year high the trump administration has spent the better part of the past year escalating its war of words and tariffs with china with tit for tat trade barriers being hurled back and forth trump s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods were set to ratchet up from 10 percent to 25 percent in january until he and chinese president xi jinping agreed to a three month truce to come to a deal the deadline is march 1 but rather than leading to chinese concessions trump s strong arm negotiating tactics have led to a new suit this month against the u s at the world trade organization and despite continuing to push hard on chinese telecom giant huawei there s now talk that the trump administration s tariff stance may be softening all of this uncertainty together with the higher tariffs are starting to hurt markets as well as companies like u s manufacturing bellwether caterpillar and iconic motorcycle maker harley davidson another major area of concern has been the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement which lasted some 18 months and resulted in a deal that looked strikingly similar to the original there were some modest changes for the dairy and auto industries but by and large it was the same old agreement nevertheless congress still needs to actually vote on the new deal known as the u s mexico canada agreement and newly empowered democrats are talking about reopening the deal to demand stronger labor and environmental protections and unsurprisingly trump is once again threatening to withdraw from the pact altogether so more uncertainty ahead for u s business workers and consumers state of health care high mortality higher costs david bishai john hopkins university in his inaugural address trump vowed to end american carnage if carnage is measured in american mortality things are are not getting better unfortunately u s life expectancy fell to 78 6 years at the end of 2017 the latest data available this continues a slide from 2015 the first time it has shown a sustained three year fall in four decades according to the centers for disease control comparable countries like canada the u k france and germany continue to see life expectancy climbing well above 80 one of the big reasons is the opioid epidemic which is estimated to have cost the economy 1 trillion from 2001 to 2017 every state in the union is seeing epidemics of drug overdoses suicide and alcohol related deaths despite better access to health insurance states that expanded access to health insurance showed slower growth of drug overdose mortality and increased access to rehabilitative treatment for addiction the affordable care act helped cut the share of uninsured americans from 17 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2015 where they have remained better insurance also brings access to services that have lowered death rates from congenital malformations heart disease and cancer yet the aca is not a panacea and has not prevented lethal epidemics from sweeping the nation this is especially frustrating because americans spend 18 percent of gdp on health care or 10 739 for every man woman and child so the problem isn t spending it s how we spend it research and real world examples are showing how communities bringing together multiple groups outside of health care to pursue various approaches can lead to promising results examples include cutting overdose death rates in dayton ohio and wilkes county north carolina that s the best way to finally stem the flow of american carnage david bishai professor of health economics johns hopkins

investment and economic growth so far the data supports the skeptics the greatest problem however is that budget deficits should fall during economic expansions this provides more policy flexibility whenever the next recession hits during recessions tax receipts fall and government spending rises pushing up the deficit the appropriate fiscal policy response increase the budget deficit even more becomes harder the larger it already is state of trade uncertainty and trade wars james lake southern methodist university american trade with the world is crucial to the u s economy exceeding 25 percent of gross domestic product but with uncertainty over tariffs trade wars and trade agreements keeping u s businesses on their toes the state of trade is in flux the raw numbers tell a mixed story after increasing for six straight quarters the brunt of strong foreign retaliation over trump s tariffs pushed u s exports down 1 24 percent in the third quarter of 2018 the latest data available it s the biggest fall since the depths of the great recession in 2009 at the same time imports jumped that quarter as u s companies wary of higher tariffs on chinese goods stocked up imports from china surged11 1 percent the most since 2011 as a result america s trade deficit with the world one of the president s most cited metrics and a reason he s fighting his trade wars widened to a 10 year high the trump administration has spent the better part of the past yearescalating its war of words and tariffs with china with tit for tat trade barriers being hurled back and forth trump s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods were set to ratchet up from 10 percent to 25 percent in january until he and chinese president xi jinping agreed to a three month truce to come to a deal the deadline is march 1 but rather than leading to chinese concessions trump s strong arm negotiating tactics have led to a new suit this month against the u s at the world trade organization and despite continuing to push hard on chinese telecom giant huawei there s now talk that the trump administration s tariff stance may be softening all of this uncertainty together with the higher tariffs are starting to hurt markets as well as companies like u s manufacturing bellwether caterpillar and iconic motorcycle maker harley davidson another major area of concern has been the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement which lasted some 18 months and resulted in a deal that looked strikingly similar to the original there were some modest changes for the dairy and auto industries but by and large it was the same old agreement nevertheless congress still needs to actually vote on the new deal known as the u s mexico canada agreement and newly empowered democrats are talking about reopening the deal to demand stronger labor and environmental protections and unsurprisingly trump is once again threatening to withdraw from the pact altogether so more uncertainty ahead for u s business workers and consumers state of health care high mortality higher costs david bishai john hopkins university in his inaugural address trump vowed to end american carnage if carnage is measured in american mortality things are are not getting better unfortunately u s life expectancy fell to 78 6 years at the end of 2017 the latest data available this continues a slide from 2015 the first time it has shown a sustained three year fall in four decades according to the centers for disease control comparable countries like canada the u k france and germany continue to see life expectancy climbing well above 80 one of the big reasons is the opioid epidemic which is estimated to have cost the economy 1 trillion from 2001 to 2017 every state in the unionis seeing epidemics of drug overdoses suicide and alcohol related deathsdespite better access to health insurance states that expanded access to health insurance showed slower growth of drug overdose mortality and increased access to rehabilitative treatment for addiction the affordable care act helped cut the share of uninsured americans from 17 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2015 where they have remained better insurance also brings access to services that have lowered death rates from congenital malformations heart disease and cancer yet the aca is not a panacea and has not prevented lethal epidemics from sweeping the nation this is especially frustrating because americans spend 18 percent of gdpon health care or 10 739 for every man woman and child so the problem isn t spending it s how we spend it research and real world examples are showing how communities bringing together multiple groups outside of health care to pursue various approaches can lead to promising results examples include cutting overdose death ratesin dayton ohio and wilkes county north carolina that s the best way to finally stem the flow of american carnage
klaus schwab impresario of the world economic forum released a manifesto in the run up to this year s annual meeting at davos switzerland in which he called for a contemporary equivalent to the postwar conferences that established the liberal international order after the second world war leaders from across the globe came together to design a new set of institutional structures to enable the post war world to collaborate towards building a shared future he wrote the world has changed and as a matter of urgency we must undertake this process again schwab went on to call for a new moment of collective design for globalization s alleged fourth iteration creatively labeled globalization 4 0 klaus schwab impresario of the world economic forum released a manifesto in the run up to

leaders from across the globe came together to design a new set of institutional structures to enable the post war world to collaborate towards building a shared future he wrote the world has changed and as a matter of urgency we must undertake this process again schwab went on to call for a new moment of collective design for globalization s alleged fourth iteration creatively labeled globalization 4 0 schwab is not the first to make this kind of appeal since the financial crisis there have been repeated calls for a new bretton woods the conference in 1944 at which in schwab s words leaders from across the globe came together to design a financial system for the postwar era establishing the international monetary fund imf and the world bank in the process it was the moment at which u s hegemony proved its most comprehensive and enlightened by empowering economist statesmen foremost among them john maynard keynes to lead the world out of the postwar ruins and the preceding decades of crisis under washington s wise leadership even rancorous europe moved toward peaceful and prosperous integration this is a story with wide support in places like davos it s also one that deserves far more scrutiny its history of the founding of the postwar order is wrong more important its implicit theory about how international order emerges through a collective design effort by world leaders coming together to reconcile their interests is fundamentally mistaken what history actually suggests is that order tends to emerge not from cooperation and deliberation but from a cruder calculus of power and material constraints bretton woods may have been a conference of experts and officials but it was first and foremost a gathering of a wartime alliance engaged in the massive mobilization effort of total war the conference met in july 1944 in the weeks following d day and the final soviet breakthrough on the eastern front as a wartime rather than a postwar meeting disagreements were minimized though the conference was about the future order of the international economy and though the aim of the talks was to link national economies back together the building blocks were centralized state controlled war economies the bretton woods negotiators were government officials not businessmen or bankers as they had done since the collapse of the global financial system in the early 1930s central bankers played second fiddle to treasury officials the americans who were bankrolling the allied war effort called the shots the basic monetary vision of bretton woods was to create order by establishing fully convertible currencies at fixed exchange rates with the dollar pegged to gold but the tough conditions of the bretton woods monetary architecture set by the united states proved far too demanding for war weakened european economies when britain the least damaged economy in europe tried to implement free convertibility of pounds into dollars its attempt collapsed at the first hurdle in 1947 the social democratic labour party government in london quickly moved to stop the subsequent drain of precious dollars by reimposing exchange controls and tightening import quotas meanwhile the grand design for a free trade order embodied by the havana charter and the international trade organization fell afoul of the u s congress and was thus stopped in its tracks the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt was its cumbersome and slow moving replacement the talk of a connection between the present and the bretton woods moment is legitimated perhaps above all by the claimed continuity of the imf and the world bank which were duly set up in december 1945 but beyond institutional titles this supposed continuity is largely false within a year of the founding of its key institutions almost the entire global agenda of bretton woods was put on ice already in 1946 the soviet union absented itself from the formation of the imf and the world bank with the cold war paralyzing the u n institutions that had originally been intended to frame bretton woods what emerged under u s hegemony was a far narrower postwar order centered on the north atlantic the marshall plan of 1948 was not so much a complement to bretton woods as an acknowledgement of its failure for true liberals in both the united states and europe who hankered after the golden age of globalization in the late 19th century the resulting cold war economic order was a profound disappointment the u s treasury and the first generation of neoliberals in europe fretted against the u s state department and its interventionist economic tendencies mavericks such as the young milton friedman true advocates of free markets in the way we take for granted today demanded a bonfire of all regulations they insisted that rather than exchange rates being fixed currencies should be allowed to float with their value defined by competitive markets in the 1950s friedman could be dismissed as eccentric the reality of the liberal order that supposedly came into existence in the postwar moment was the more or less haphazard continuation of wartime controls it would take until 1958 before the bretton woods vision was finally implemented even then it was not a liberal order by the standard of the gilded age of the 19th century or in the sense that davos understands it today international mobility of capital for anything other than long term investment was strictly limited liberalization of trade also made slow progress the gradual abolition of exchange controls went hand in hand with the lifting of trade quotas only when these more elementary limitations on foreign trade were removed did tariff negotiations become relevant gatt s lumbering deliberations did not begin making major inroads until the kennedy round of the 1960s 20 years after the end of the war and rising global trade was a mixed blessing huge german and japanese trade surpluses put pressure on the bretton woods exchange rate system this was compounded in the 1960s by the connivance of u s treasury and u k authorities in enabling wall street to sidestep financial repression and launch the unregulated eurodollar market based in bank accounts in london by the late 1960s barely more than 10 years old bretton woods was already in terminal trouble and when confronted with demands for deflation u s president richard nixon reverted to economic nationalism between 1971 and 1973 he unhitched the dollar from gold and abandoned any effort to defend the exchange rate sending the dollar plunging and helping to restore something closer to trade balance if our own world has a historic birthplace it was not in 1945 but in the early 1970s with the advent of fiat money and floating exchange rates the unpalatable truth is that our world was born not out of wise collective agreement but out of chaos unleashed by america s unilateral refusal any longer to underwrite the global monetary order as the tensions built up in the 1960s exploded foreign exchange instability contributed to a historically unprecedented surge in inflation across the western world we now know that this era of inflationary instability would be concluded by the market revolution and what ben bernanke dubbed the great moderation but once again hindsight should not blind us to the depth of the crisis and uncertainty prevailing at the time the first attempts to restore order were not by way of the market revolution but by the means of corporatism direct negotiations among governments trade unions and employers with a view of limiting the vicious spiral of prices and wages this promised a direct control of inflation by way of price setting but its effect was to stoke an ever greater politicization of the economy with left wing social theorists diagnosing a crisis of capitalist democracy the trilateral commission warned of democratic ungovernability what broke the deadlock was not some inclusive conference of stakeholders the stakeholders in the 1970s were obstreperous trade unions and that kind of consultation was precisely the bad habit that the neoliberal revolutionaries set out to break the solution as u s federal reserve chair paul volcker s recent memoirs make embarrassingly clear was blunt force wielded by the fed volcker s unilateral interest rate hike the sharp revaluation of the dollar deindustrialization and the crash of surging unemployment dealt a death blow to organized labor and tamed inflationary pressure the volcker shock established so called independent central bankers as the true arbiters of the new dispensation they put paid to what margaret thatcher referred to as the enemy within but the global victory of the liberal order required a more far reaching struggle the world of the market revolution of the 1980s was still divided between communism and capitalism between first second and third worlds the overcoming of those divisions was a matter of power politics first and foremost negotiation second the united states and its allies in europe raised the pressure on the soviet union and after a period of spectacularly heightened tension mikhail gorbachev chose to de escalate unwittingly precipitating the union s collapse the truth is that the postwar moment that the davos crowd truly hankers after is not that of 1945 but the aftermath of the cold war the moment of western triumph it was finally in 1995 that the bretton woods vision of a comprehensive world trade organization was realized a sanitized version of this moment would describe it as a third triumph of enlightened technocracy after bretton woods and the defeat of inflation this was the age of the washington consensus but as in those previous moments its underpinnings were power politics at home the humbling of organized labor abroad the collapse of soviet challenge and the decision by the beijing regime to embark on the incorporation of china into the world economy since 2008 that new order has come under threat from its own internal dysfunction oppositional domestic politics and the geopolitical power shift engendered by truly widespread convergent growth the crisis goes deep it is not surprising that there should be calls for a new institutional design but we should be careful what we wish for if history is anything to go by that new order will not emerge from an enlightened act of collective leadership ideas and leadership matter but to think that they by themselves found international order is to put the cart before the horse what will resolve the current tension is a power grab by a new stakeholder determined to have its way and the central question of the current moment is whether the west is ready for that if not we should get comfortable with the new disorder
this post is also available in italian american economic sanctions have been the worst crime against humanity since world war two america s economic sanctions have killed more innocent people than all of the nuclear biological and chemical weapons ever used in the history of mankind the fact that for america the issue in venezuela is oil not democracy will surprise only those who watch the news and ignore history venezuela has the world s largest oil reserves on the planet america seeks control of venezuela because it sits atop the strategic intersection of the caribbean south and central american worlds control of the nation has always been a remarkably effective way to project power into these three regions and beyond from the first moment hugo chavez took office the united states has been trying to overthrow venezuela s socialist movement by using sanctions coup attempts and funding the opposition parties after all there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état united nations human rights council special rapporteur alfred de zayas recommended just a few days ago that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as a possible crime against humanity perpetrated by america over the past five years american sanctions have cut venezuela off from most financial markets which have caused local oil production to plummet consequently venezuela has experienced the largest decline in living standards of any country in recorded latin american history prior to american sanctions socialism in venezuela had reduced inequality and poverty whilst pensions expanded during the same time period in america it has been the absolute reverse president chavez funnelled venezuela s oil revenues into social spending such as free 6 healthcare education subsidized food networks and housing construction in order to fully understand why america is waging economic war on the people of venezuela one must analyse the historical relationship between the petrodollar system and sanctions of mass destruction prior to the 20th century the value of money was tied to gold when banks lent money they were constrained by the size of their gold reserves but in 1971 u s president richard nixon took the country off the gold standard nixon and saudi arabia came to an oil for dollars agreement that would change the course of history and become the root cause of countless wars for oil under this petrodollar agreement the only currency that saudi arabia could sell its oil in was the us dollar the saudi kingdom would in turn ensure that its oil profits flow back into u s government treasuries and american banks in exchange america pledged to provide the saudi royal family s regime with military protection and military hardware it was the start of something truly great for america access to oil defined 20th century empires and the petrodollar agreement was the key to the ascendancy of the united states as the world s sole superpower america s war machine runs on is funded by and exists in protection of oil threats by any nation to undermine the petrodollar system are viewed by washington as tantamount to a declaration of war against the united states of america within the last two decades iraq iran libya and venezuela have all threatened to sell their oil in other currencies consequently they have all been subject to crippling u s sanctions over time the petrodollar system spread beyond oil and the u s dollar slowly but surely became the reserve currency for global trades in most commodities and goods this system allows america to maintain its position of dominance as the world s only superpower despite being a staggering 23 trillion in debt with billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground and with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela should not only be wealthy but her people the envy of the developing world but the nation is essentially broke because american sanctions have cut them off from the international financial system and cost the economy 6 billion over the last five years without sanctions venezuela could recover easily by collateralizing some of its abundant resources or its 8 billion of gold reserves in order to get the loans necessary to kick start their economy in order to fully understand the insidious nature of the venezuelan crisis it is necessary to understand the genesis of economic sanctions at the height of world war two president truman issued an order for american bombers to drop fat man and little boy on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki killing 140 000 people instantly the gruesome images that emerged from the rubble were broadcast through television sets across the world and caused unprecedented outrage the political backlash forced u s policy makers to devise a more subtle weapon of mass destruction economic sanctions the term weapons of mass destruction wmd was first defined by the united nations in 1948 as atomic explosive weapons radioactive material weapons lethal chemical and biological weapons and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above sanctions are clearly the 21st century s deadliest weapon of mass destruction in 2001 the u s administration told us that iraq had weapons of mass destruction iraq was a terrorist state iraq was tied to al qaeda it all amounted to nothing in fact america already knew that the only weapons of mass destruction that saddam had were not nuclear in nature but rather chemical and biological the only reason they knew this in advance was because america sold the weapons to saddam to use on iran in 1991 what the u s administration did not tell us was that saddam hussein used to be a strong ally of the united states the main reason for toppling saddam and putting sanctions on the people of iraq was the fact that iraq had ditched the dollar for oil sales the united nations estimates that 1 7 million iraqis died due to bill clinton s sanctions 500 000 of whom were children in 1996 a journalist asked former u s secretary of state madeleine albright about these un reports specifically about the children america s top foreign policy official albright replied i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it clearly u s sanctions policies are nothing short of state sanctioned genocide over the last five years sanctions have caused venezuelan per capita incomes to drop by 40 percent which is a decline similar to that of war torn iraq and syria at the height of their armed conflicts millions of venezuelans have had to flee the country if america is so concerned about refugees trump should stop furthering disastrous foreign policies that actually create them under chavez venezuela had a policy of welcoming refugees president chavez turned venezuela into the wealthiest society in latin america with the best income equality another much vilified leader who used oil wealth to enrich his people only to be put under severe sanctions is muammar gaddafi in 1967 colonel gaddafi inherited one of the poorest nations in africa however by the time he was assassinated gaddafi had turned libya into africa s wealthiest nation perhaps gaddafi s greatest crime in the eyes of nato was his quest to quit selling libyan oil in u s dollars and denominate crude sales in a new gold backed common african currency in fact in august 2011 president obama confiscated 30 billion from libya s central bank which gaddafi had earmarked for the establishment of an african central bank and the african gold backed dinar currency africa has the fastest growing oil industry in the world and oil sales in a common african currency would have been especially devastating for the american dollar the u s economy and particularly the elite in charge of the petrodollar system it is for this reason that president clinton signed the now infamous iran libya sanctions act which the united nations children s fund said caused widespread suffering among civilians by severely limiting supplies of fuel access to cash and the means of replenishing stocks of food and essential medications clearly u s sanctions are weapons of mass destruction not so long ago iraq and libya were the two most modern and secular states in the middle east and north africa with the highest regional standards of living nowadays u s military intervention and economic sanctions have turned libya and iraq into two of the world s most failed nations they want to seize libya s oil and they care nothing about the lives of the libyan people remarked chavez during the western intervention in libya in 2011 in september 2017 president maduro made good on chavez s promise to list oil sales in yuan rather than the us dollar weeks later trump signed a round of crippling sanctions on the people of venezuela on monday u s national security adviser john bolton announced new sanctions that essentially steal 7 billion from venezuela s state owned oil company at that press conference bolton brazenly flashed a note pad that ominously said 5 000 troops to colombia when confronted about it by the media bolton simply said president trump stated that all options are on the table america s media is unquestionably the most corrupt institution in america the nation s media may quibble about trump s domestic policies but when it comes to starting wars for oil abroad they sing in remarkable unison fox news cnn and the new york times all cheered the nation into war in iraq over fictitious weapons of mass destruction whilst america was actually using sanctions of mass destruction on the iraqi people they did it in libya and now they are doing it again in venezuela democracy and freedom have always been the smoke screen in front of capitalist expansion for oil and the western media owns the smoke machine economic warfare has long since been under way against venezuela but military warfare is now imminent trump just hired elliot abrams as u s special envoy for venezuela who has a long and torrid history in latin america abrams pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the iran contra affair which involved america funding deadly communist rebels and was the worst scandal in the reagan era abrams was later pardoned by george bush senior america s new point man on venezuela also lied about the largest mass killing in recent latin american history by u s trained forces in el salvador there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état a un human rights council rapporteur alfred de zayas pointed out that america s aim in venezuela is to crush this government and bring in a neoliberal government that is going to privatise everything and is going to sell out a lot of transitional corporations stand to gain enormous profits and the united states is driven by the transnational corporations ever since 1980 the united states has steadily devolved from the status of the world s top creditor country to the world s most indebted country but thanks to the petrodollar system s huge global artificial demand for u s dollars america can continue exponential military expansion record breaking deficits and unrestrained spending america s largest export used to be manufactured goods made proudly in america today america s largest export is the u s dollar any nation like venezuela that threatens that export is met with america s second largest export weapons chief amongst which are sanctions of mass destruction garikai chengu is an ancient african historian he has been a scholar at harvard stanford and columbia university contact him on garikai chengu gmail com

president donald trump plans to deliver an aspirational and visionary state of the union address on feb 5 calling on congress to work with him on bipartisan issues like infrastructure and health care the speech was delayed by a week after speaker of the house nancy pelosi disinvited trump until he ended the partial government shutdown meanwhile we asked four economists to give us their own assessments of the state of the union as well as the president s performance so far each picked a theme state of business investment strong growth but trouble looms ellen hughes cromwick university of michigan business investment the lifeblood improving the nation s standard of living has been one of the big economic bright spots fueling strong growth in the past couple years combined with a healthy labor market solid spending on new plants equipment and intellectual property are all achievements in this near decade long expansion without it expanding possibilities and the promise of new horizons for the next generation could be lost signs suggest the party is about to end u s inflation adjusted business investment in plant equipment and intellectual property jumped 5 6 percent in the first three quarters of 2018 putting it on pace for the fastest year since 2014 that s being fueled by record corporate profits us 2 3 trillion in the third quarter they surged 7 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2018 the most in the same period since 2012 the biggest gains in investment are in energy telecommunications automotive and technology sectors while the trump administration may want to claim credit for the investment by pointing to its tax overhaul from late 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was not responsible for the strong investment rather it was healthy financial markets strong global economic growth and rising corporate profits that deserve most of the credit indeed the pace of business investment was similarly strong in 2017 with no notable improvement after the tax law passed that december and a recent survey showed that the vast majority of businesses said they did not change their hiring or investment plans as a result of the tax cut looking forward trouble seems to be brewing in terms of business conditions china s and europe s economies are slowing and financial conditions are tightening as equity markets wobble and the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and trim its enormous balance sheet as a result economic forecasters are lowering their growth outlook for 2019 while the risks of recession are rising in all likelihood those warning signs should put a damper on business investment state of the national debt sky s the limit steven pressman colorado state university as a candidate trump promised to eliminate america s national debt in eight years through faster economic growth how s he done so far not so good the debt has climbed from 20 trillion when trump took office to 21 5 trillion at the end of 2018 the budget deficit or the difference between government revenues and spending is what changes the national debt after falling continuously from 1 4 trillion in 2009 at the end of the great recession to 585 billion in 2016 the u s budget deficit has risen during the trump presidency it hit 779 billion in 2018 the highest level since 2012 and is expected to reach 900 billion this year the two main forces driving this are greater spending on the military and disaster relief and the 2017 tax cut which reduced corporate income taxes by 92 billion the trump administration and the republicans who pushed for the tax cut promised that economic growth would increase tax revenues and offset the losses most economists including me were skeptical that corporate tax cuts would substantially increase investment and economic growth so far the data supports the skeptics the greatest problem however is that budget deficits should fall during economic expansions this provides

dairy and auto industries but by and large it was the same old agreement nevertheless congress still needs to actually vote on the new deal known as the u s mexico canada agreement and newly empowered democrats are talking about reopening the deal to demand stronger labor and environmental protections and unsurprisingly trump is once again threatening to withdraw from the pact altogether so more uncertainty ahead for u s business workers and consumers state of health care high mortality higher costs david bishai john hopkins university in his inaugural address trump vowed to end american carnage if carnage is measured in american mortality things are are not getting better unfortunately u s life expectancy fell to 78 6 years at the end of 2017 the latest data available this continues a slide from 2015 the first time it has shown a sustained three year fall in four decades according to the centers for disease control comparable countries like canada the u k france and germany continue to see life expectancy climbing well above 80 one of the big reasons is the opioid epidemic which is estimated to have cost the economy 1 trillion from 2001 to 2017 every state in the union is seeing epidemics of drug overdoses suicide and alcohol related deaths despite better access to health insurance states that expanded access to health insurance showed slower growth of drug overdose mortality and increased access to rehabilitative treatment for addiction the affordable care act helped cut the share of uninsured americans from 17 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2015 where they have remained better insurance also brings access to services that have lowered death rates from congenital malformations heart disease and cancer yet the aca is not a panacea and has not prevented lethal epidemics from sweeping the nation this is especially frustrating because americans spend 18 percent of gdp on health care or 10 739 for every man woman and child so the problem isn t spending it s how we spend it research and real world examples are showing how communities bringing together multiple groups outside of health care to pursue various approaches can lead to promising results examples include cutting overdose death rates in dayton ohio and wilkes county north carolina that s the best way to finally stem the flow of american carnage

sec i ll now turn the call over to robert robert bryant chief executive officer good morning everyone today i m pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year and key operational highlights and a few changes we ll be making to our financial reporting basis and presentation consistent with our evolution as a public company and based on shareholder feedback our fourth quarter results net our previously communicated ranges for 2018 guidance on both the top and bottom lines with fourth quarter organic net sales growth of over 2 and adjusted ebitda of 235 million we also exceeded our free cash flow expectations for the fourth quarter which generated a full year result of 362 million compared to our october guidance range of 330 million to 350 million customer demand and overall business trends remained generally consistent with our last quarterly update in october we saw ongoing organic net sales growth in our refinish and industrial end markets strong continued price recapture in performance coatings that offset input inflation and positive volume in north america light vehicle we also saw the first reported quarter in over a year with positive price mix in transportation which is the first step and showing progress on our global efforts to offset variable cost inflation in this segment we anticipate ongoing stability in each of these items looking forward into 2019 on the flip side we witnessed ongoing auto production slowness in china as well as signs of reduced overall business activity in europe overall we re satisfied with our 2018 results especially considering the headwinds from inflation foreign exchange and light vehicle pricing some of these headwinds will persist including expected inflation impact to the p l at least through the first half of 2019 but we re encouraged that we seem to be passed the peak in some aspects to the inflation effect while fx impact appear sequentially stable turning to slide 3 i d like to review some highlights from the quarter we grew q4 net sales by 2 7 year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange including substantial benefit from improved price and mix in the period net sales in performance coatings increased an impressive 6 4 before fx with comparable growth from both refinish and industrial end markets this growth came largely from improved price mix in the period volumes were stable globally but with some regionally specific variations including some slowing in europe within both end markets in transportation coatings net sales decreased in the low single digit with split between the light vehicle and commercial vehicle end markets one encouraging aspect in this segment was the reported increase in price mix at 0 8 which was the first positive transportation price mix metric in the last nine quarters that would included some mixed benefits in the period we also saw some volume growth in north america though this was more than offset by lower demand in china and continued production curtailment in europe still being attributed to a large extent by a mission testing headache associated with the transition from diesel to gasoline engines shifting to adjusted ebitda we achieved 235 million for the quarter even sequentially though below last year s 245 million driven by double digit inflation and variable costs at the adjusted ebitda level and somewhat slower light vehicle volumes offset partially by price mix benefits this was coupled with the impact of foreign exchange drop through and inflation from in sources including logistics and packaging contained in operating expense adjusted ebitda margins for q4 decreased to 20 3 from 21 1 with pressure from transportation coatings margins offset to a large extent by increased margins in performance coatings we re really pleased that the combination of improved price mix in performance coatings and the combination of productivity across axalta enabled us to hold margins largely constant in 2018 at 20 1 versus 20 3 in 2017 while we clearly still have a lot of work to do to offset inflation impacts that we ve accrued over the last two years in transportation coatings we saw modest initial progress this quarter and hope to show continued results in 2019 based on ongoing discussions with customers for the full year 2018 axalta reported net sales of 4 7 billion up 6 7 excluding the impact of foreign currency coming largely from strong price and mix contribution as well as the inclusion of 3 5 from m a activity net income had a more favorable comparison due to the absence of restructuring charges and other tax reform impacts in the prior year while adjusted net income increased 5 from 2017 adjusted ebitda of 937 million for 2018 increased 6 from 885 million in 2017 this result was produced in spite of the significant headwinds from inflation as well as incremental fx headwinds that emerged during the course of the year turning to slide 4 briefly looking at the end market highlights for the quarter refinish net sales growth of 6 3 ex fx was solid driven principally by positive price mix with sales growth from all regions business conditions in europe were slower versus prior periods in north america growth was constrained somewhat by lower mainstream coatings and refinish accessory sales in the period but which also contributed to a richer mix overall refinish demand globally appears broadly stable based on our run rates and indication from body shop customers as well as sell through indication from our distribution partners we ve also been successful in offsetting inflation with price actions to date our industrial coatings end market also grew in the quarter with a 6 6 net sales increase ex fx including contribution from all regions except latin america which remains mixed price mix remains a bright spot in industrial with low to mid single digit realization in the quarter we re on track to offset accumulated inflation by mid year 2019 at least to compensate for much of the accumulated inflation impacts for the last two years we had a very good year overall for industrial in 2018 demand seems broadly stable but we have seen some indications of slowing in certain markets in china latin america and europe already reflected in our fourth quarter volumes that said we continue to project modest growth from industrial in 2019 including new product introductions light vehicle net sales were down 3 9 for the quarter ex fx volumes were down mid single digits with decreases seen in asia latin america and emea offset partially by further north america growth the china market downturn continued though it is encouraging to hear that the chinese government is now considering potential supportive measures which have been helpful in the past to stimulate consumer behavior emea continues to see production impacted by the wltp engine technology changeover which is expected to continue into early 2019 but then stabilized global production forecast for 2018 were reduced again from growth of 0 7 to a decline of 1 since our last earnings call more than half of the 1 7 million unit forecast reduction came from china with europe driving a significant portion of the remainder commercial vehicle net sales decreased 3 3 ex fx in the fourth quarter consistent with the third quarter heavy duty truck demand remains quite strong in the americas though we have seen more signs of slower demand from europe in the fourth quarter price mix was down slightly in the period on the topic of price cost gap in transportation coatings we ve undertaken several efforts in 2018 to achieve offset the variable cost inflation and our most recent dialogue with certain customers have been impactful we believe we ll see progress regarding average selling prices this year and we continue to push for this outcome importantly even with lower oil prices recently we remain significantly impacted by variable cost inflation and we do not expect near term release in many of our inputs due to tight demand conditions across numerous raw material baskets and impacts of trade tariffs we also continue to focus on cost reduction actions in transportation coatings to help cover the price cost gap regarding our balance sheet and cash flows fourth quarter free cash flow was 220 million to drive full year free cash flow to 362 million above our guidance range that we offered in october we finished the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 3 4 times on capital deployment we repurchased 254 million worth of shares the full year with 106 million completed during the fourth quarter total spend on m a for the year was 110 million and we noted additional discretionary capital was used in 2018 in line with our prior guidance to invest in internal high return investment opportunities with some of our key strategic customers next i d like to touch briefly on a few operating highlights first we made early progress on relocating production from our belgium plant including engineering work and new construction starts in new locations we also opened new research technical centers in three locations globally and initiated new powder coating capacity upgrades in two locations to support growth plans in our industrial end markets in terms of innovation investment we introduced over 250 new products across axalta beating our target here for the third year in a row highlights in the fourth quarter include the launch of new refinish products to complement and enhance our mainstream brands while continuing with good success to launch and convert over 250 body shops in asia and north america to our new cromax ez premium waterborne basecoat system in our industrial end market we launched the new steel conduit lining for the electrical wiring market called strenx transportation coatings we continued the launch of our hyper dura 3000 ph product line which is a single component primer with improved performance for certain substrates we also continued to gain share this quarter with our consolidated systems and oem applications with new wins in latin america and europe regarding our focus areas for 2019 we continue to concentrate first on growth across our business and profitably gaining share in each market that we serve today second we re squarely focused on execution and working toward even more refined targets related to overall customer satisfaction as an organization we are committed to profitable growth improving operating execution and increased accountability across the company to deliver on our goals my mantra to our leadership is focused on simplicity nimbleness a focus on fewer but more critical initiatives and decision making based on appropriate metrics with a long term investment mindset i believe that if we move quickly with our customers interest first and with a focus on building a sustainable and competitive model we will continue to win in our markets for many years to come lastly beginning in first quarter 2019 we will be shifting our reported basis and presentation to earnings per share and adjusted ebit metrics we will continue to offer guidance and results on an adjusted ebitda basis as well for a period of time after carefully evaluating the change it seems an appropriate time given the maturity of our company to adopt this approach and also based upon feedback from shareholders we ve also begun to move our internal incentive compensation plans away from adjusted ebitda to adjusted ebit and earnings per share to better align all aspects of the business including capital allocation with that i will now turn the call over to sean who will share some further detail on our financial results sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks robert and good morning everyone turning to slide 5 fourth quarter net sales before foreign currency impacts increased 2 7 year over year including 6 4 growth in our performance coatings segment and a decrease of 3 7 for transportation coatings segment acquisition contribution this quarter was 0 4 as all 2017 acquisitions have now been fully locked ph this fourth quarter result clearly represents two separate parts with negative volume of 2 1 largely driven by decrease in transportation coatings and positive price mix contribution driven principally by performance coatings though we know that our light vehicle end market and transportation coatings also reflected positive price mix in the quarter fx translation shifted to a 2 5 headwind in the third quarter and remained largely consistent in the fourth quarter with a 3 3 impact with euro weakness versus the dollar still the primary driver coupled with continued weakness in a broad set of emerging market currency fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 235 million was in line sequentially with the third quarter and 4 lower than the prior year adjusted ebitda margins decreased 70 basis points to 20 3 in the fourth quarter the quarterly results reflect lower transportation coatings net sales significant headwinds from input cost inflation notable fx headwinds and higher overall inflation elements such as freight logistics and packaging within other operating expenses offset by positive progress and price mix in the quarter turning to slide 6 performance coatings q4 net sales increased 6 4 year over year excluding a 3 fx headwind constant currency growth was driven primarily by a 6 5 increase in average price mix as well as 0 6 contribution from m a refinish produced 6 3 constant currency net sales growth in the fourth quarter driven principally by improved price mix in the period with product mix being a notable contributor to the result in this period axalta s refinish end market saw a net sales growth in all regions in the fourth quarter though organic volume growth was constrained we believe in part due to cautious distributor behaviors in select markets while body shop demand remain steady according to our collected feedback measured by body shop served axalta continued to gain market share both in the fourth quarter and for the full year industrial net sales before fx headwinds increased 6 6 year over year in the fourth quarter and this growth was mostly organic as acquisition contribution was negligible industrial top line growth was helped by solid mid single digit positive price mix contribution from all regions for the quarter volumes were also modestly positive which included strong ongoing growth in north america and good growth in asia pacific offset somewhat by decreases in latin america and slower performance in europe which appears to be feeling some economic deceleration as a region in the recent period performance coatings delivered q4 adjusted ebitda of 172 million a 4 year over year increase with strong price mix benefit offset to a large extent by variable cost inflation additional inflation from freight logistics and packaging within other operating costs and modest volume in fx headwind effects q4 adjusted ebitda margins of 22 7 were up 10 basis points year over year underscoring sustained improvements since the low of 19 7 in the first quarter of 2018 this comes as a result of price action and mix improvement as well as productivity actions as we work to offset raw material inflation in our markets with minimal delay through the cycle 2018 was a great success story for performance coatings in this aspect turning to slide 7 transportation coatings net sales decreased 3 7 year over year in the quarter excluding currency headwinds of 3 7 segment volumes decreased 4 5 slightly offset by favorable price mix impacts resulting from early traction in this area as robert previously noted light vehicle fourth quarter net sales decreased 3 9 excluding a 4 fx headwind volumes decreased mid single digits with ongoing growth in north america more than offset by lower volume from emea and asia pacific as the wltp issue plus regional slowing in europe and china continues to pressure global automotive markets average price and mix were up slightly in the quarter however we are encouraged by indications of additional pricing benefits expected to come through in 2019 commercial vehicle q4 net sales decreased 3 3 before fx headwinds of 2 2 this moderate reduction reflects ongoing strength of north america commercial truck and other commercial markets more than offset by slower business days ph in both emea and china consistent with what we noted in our last quarterly update while china has little impact on our results in commercial vehicle slowdown in europe has been more meaningful global forecast for heavy duty trucks have decreased modestly for 2019 since our last call most impactfully for china while the overall market dynamics we re seeing have not changed notably over that period transportation coatings generated q4 adjusted ebitda of 63 million compared with 80 million in q4 2017 though up slightly sequentially from third quarter adjusted ebitda margins were 15 7 in the period down from 18 5 in q4 2017 the lower margin comparison was driven primarily by significant and largely uncovered variable cost inflation witnessed over the last two years coupled with some impact from lower volumes in the period however adjusted ebitda margin increased for the third quarter is 15 2 on slide 8 i ll briefly comment on our consolidated 2018 results the year was clearly challenged in several respects by the combination of substantial raw material and other variable cost inflation as well as by fundamental headwinds in china and to some extent europe later in the year that said our overall results were still quite solid we saw high single digit net sales growth powered by strong price mix contribution in performance coatings which was critical to offsetting inflation impacts in combination with productivity efforts we managed the whole adjusted ebitda margins largely constant while growing adjusted ebitda by nearly 6 so while 2018 was a year of notable headwind we navigated through and produced the result that approximated the low end of our earlier communicated expectations from last february especially considering the rapid and unforecasted shift in fx rates around the middle of this year excluding foreign currency we produced net sales growth in line with our plan and adjusted ebitda came just below the low end of our original guidance in spite of higher variable cost inflation than we had anticipated in early 2018 and also less pricing offset in light vehicle than we had expected turning to slide 9 cash and cash equivalents totaled 694 million at year end total reported debt was 3 9 billion resulting in a net debt balance of 3 2 billion versus 3 3 billion at technical difficulty our net leverage ratio was slightly improved to 3 4 times largely driven by the benefit of a higher cash position q4 free cash flow totaled 220 million compared to 196 million in the same quarter a year ago the year over year increase was driven by improved net working capital outcomes especially from better receivable collections partly offset by higher upfront customer incentive payments that we addressed in detail last quarter and modestly lower adjusted ebitda as a side note on free cash flow we ve also included 3 million of cash inflows from investing activities which will equate to 9 million for the full year 2019 which relates to the interest associated with our foreign currency swaps we executed in 2018 to fix our interest rates on 475 million of our term loan principal we will include this within our free cash flow metric going forward consistent with our other cash interest payments our working capital to full year net sales ratio at year end was 10 2 compared with 10 a year ago which is in line with our targeted levels of 10 to 11 turning to slide 10 we provided an update of our financial guidance for 2019 which we preliminarily shared with you on our 2019 outlook call in december most elements remain unchanged and as robert mentioned we ve added new elements of guidance that corresponds with our shift in external reporting to an adjusted ebit and adjusted eps basis one note the adjusted ebit and adjusted eps metrics exclude 25 million in accelerated depreciation associated with the previously announced mechelen belgium plant closure for net sales and adjusted ebitda our guidance remains consistent we ve included an assumption of low single digit inflation from variable input costs at the cost of goods sold level our guidance also continues to assume an impact from tariffs of about 30 million ph regarding taxes we are revising our adjusted effective income tax rate slightly to 20 to 22 from 20 to 23 for the full year with the increase from 2018 largely due to the lower forecasted excess benefits for stock based compensation which were approximately 200 basis points in 2018 as well as the negative impact associated with year two of us tax reform and slight impact of mix on jurisdictional earnings as a reminder this us ph tax represents the adjusted tax rate corresponding to adjusted net income regarding phasing of adjusted ebitda in 2019 we expect that first quarter to reflect approximately 20 to 21 of total 2019 adjusted ebitda the remaining quarters should be closer to an even spread though with moderate building as we move through the year this phasing assumes ongoing carryover of impact from higher raw materials and other inflation with the greatest impact on the first quarter as well as a more challenging comparison of china versus the stronger first quarter 2019 this concludes our prepared remarks we ll now be pleased to answer any questions operator please open the lines for q a questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john roberts with ubs please proceed with your question john roberts ubs analyst thank you robert price mix was up 6 5 in auto refinish i assume the raws are up similarly and the auto oem coatings area are roughly approximate whatever i have a hard time seeing you get anywhere close to the amount of price in auto oem that you ve got in auto refinish so do you need additional restructuring there to get your margins back in auto oem rather than just price robert bryant chief executive officer if we look at the margin profile of both of those businesses obviously they are they are two very different businesses with different market characteristics and different market structures in order to return to the peak profitability that we that we had before we do need to continue to raise prices we also need to continue our flow of new products for those for those customers and need to continue to create value for our customers from a pure cost perspective we have taken several cost measures in that in that business and we ll continue to take cost measures in that business as necessary depending on the development of the market from this point forward john roberts ubs analyst okay and then just as a follow up what was the fx headwind at the ebitda level a lot of your rise are linked to the us dollar so i don t i don t think you see as much of a benefit on the cost side when currency is unfavorable as you see a hit in the revenue side sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we we haven t historically disclosed the actual fx impact at the bottom line but it s fair to assume the fx headwind from top line fall through at a consistent margin from an ebitda perspective john roberts ubs analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of don carson with susquehanna financial please proceed with your question donald carson susquehanna financial analyst yes thank you just want to go back to your inflation comment so so overall what was the inflation in raw materials in 2018 what are you expecting in 2019 and i think you mentioned that with industrial you expect to close that price cost gap by by mid year sort of on the transportation side can you comment more specifically when you would see that price cost gap closing or or do you think it can fully close robert bryant chief executive officer so on the first part of your question related to raw materials as we highlighted we saw we saw low double digit inflation on a year over year basis 2018 compared to 2017 our current assumption based on our outlook and current oil prices as well as other supply considerations is for low single digits in 2019 obviously that can change and evolve as the year goes on and as we see the price of oil move up and down as well as some of the other some of the other supply considerations and then regarding regarding transportation margins in that business i mean our our goal long term is to get those margins back to where they were historically obviously there are cycles that any business that any business goes through both from a demand perspective as well from a raw material perspective but at the end of the day the important thing for us and for our customers is that we continue to innovate with our products and that we continue to innovate with our services and if we do that i m confident that we ll continue to be rewarded with an appropriate margin level in that business donald carson susquehanna financial analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities please proceed with your question michael harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning robert bryant chief executive officer good morning michael harrison seaport global securities analyst i was just wondering if you can maybe give a little bit more detail on the volume weakness that you saw in the refinish business it sounds like you mentioned that was related to some caution among distributors just wondering where that was happening and if you re seeing some of the macro weakness maybe start to weigh on demand at the consumer level maybe lower propensity to to get repairs done given given some of the the macro uncertainty robert bryant chief executive officer mike we continue to see that global demand appears steady but there was a general lack of urgency at the distributor level that drove a slightly lower outcome in q4 we see this as a normal quarterly fluctuation in the market but not really any change to underlying underlying end market demand as we ve highlighted any given quarter you can have movements up and down in axalta s case in particular particularly in north america we did see slightly negative volumes due to slower mainstream and accessories sales but we had strong pricing and that led to a mid single digit net sales result for that business so i think we re very happy with the results of that business globally as well as in north america as an additional data point a couple of our largest body shop customers did see volumes and net sales up in the fourth quarter and we know that one of our competitors and an accessory supplier have highlighted slower sales however we believe that this appears to be more related to channel inventory as opposed to any type of end market demand at least from what at least from what we re seeing michael harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks for that additional color and then also just wondering if you can give us an update on what you ve been seeing in the industrial wood coatings business i know that in china there have been some signs of slowing but i think that business is primarily north american for you any any update on that business robert bryant chief executive officer as you point out our business currently is is defined in the americas region so that s predominantly the us and in mexico we did see due to some of the some of the macro trends we did see volumes pull off just a little bit within core markets in the us but we did have wood price increases that continued as a lot of our contracts are largely indexed to raw materials so overall we re quite happy with the result michael harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your question christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you you hit almost ph a little on the volume side but can you just give us a kind of a broader state of the union on refinish just breaking out kind of the price i guess you already hit on volumes but also market share trends and whether or not you think there are any upcoming kind of structural changes in the industry that we should be aware of thank you robert bryant chief executive officer chris overall we continue to see the refinish market for us perform perform quite well as you know on a on a full year basis we had good sales growth as i said in the mid in the mid single digit range we saw a stable marketing conditions overall we continue to win shops and gain share in north america in particular and also also in europe as we look forward in 2019 we re expecting relatively stable markets around the world with growth in every region the only the only two call offs there might be might be china and latin america where we might see a little bit lower or i d just say more modest volume growth but overall if you look at the underlying dynamics of the refinish business we feel very good about that business and we don t see any any major any major changes occurring at least at this juncture christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst great and once again you mentioned this a little on the raw basket but just can you hit on the just a few product hdds ph within the resin basket understanding there are few moving targets just what you see in the various regions in epoxies isocyanates and some of the input that caused issues in 18 and also are you seeing any still seeing any residual effects on previous force majeures just any comments on that would be appreciated thank you robert bryant chief executive officer so for 2019 at least for the first quarter resins overall we expect to see prices potentially be slightly down it does it does vary whether we re talking about whether we re talking about epoxy or polyesters or monomers but overall the overall basket we could you see that be slightly down in isocyanates at least for the first quarter we would expect prices to continue to be up predominantly due to hdi in solvents if oil prices continue with their current levels we would start to see some solvent our solvent prices come down a little bit given how closely related that is to the price of oil and then for monomers overall we re expecting prices to be to be up there are some products that could potentially be down but when you look at the overall weighting of what s in that basket for us the monomers category we expect to be up with regard to pigments pigments finally which we do do see some flattening in prices there at least through the through the first quarter and then finally in additives we see prices that we expect to continue to move up predominantly due to tariffs and also china regulations christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of robert koort with goldman sachs christopher evans goldman sachs analyst hi good morning guys it s chris evans on for rob you cited price mix benefits frequently in your prepared remarks just curious how much mix versus price did you see in the segments in the fourth quarter and maybe could you give a little bit more color on the origin or sustainability of this improved mix robert bryant chief executive officer so it was probably a 50 50 split between price mix there was certainly richer mix on refinish and i think what we saw a little a bit in the distribution behavior some other ph buy in the fourth quarter they bought some of the higher priced product which obviously impacted our mix benefit there and part of the reason why you saw volumes down a little bit in the distribution channel but by and large we re not expecting a bigger mix shift year over year heading into 2019 christopher evans goldman sachs analyst great and then maybe if you could reflect back on the net contributions you ve witnessed in 2018 from productivity and cost reductions and just curious how relevant productivity might be in your 2019 guidance sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer our axalta way program continues to be an important element in terms of how we manage the company and also the contributions that it makes from a financial perspective we exceeded the 50 million in savings that we had projected to achieve in 2018 and as we look at the remaining 150 million in that program we expect to see that somewhat ratably over the next three years for us christopher evans goldman sachs analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve byrne with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you drilling in a little further on this price mix balance is refinish the business we have the most potential to push mix and how much longer term opportunity do you have there robert you mentioned the the new the new waterborne coatings or refinish coatings for asia how much of that market over there is still solvent borne and what kind of an opportunity longer term is that for you robert bryant chief executive officer so on the i ll take the second part of your question and i ll let i ll let sean take the first part of your question so for china as we look at that as we look at that market we expect to continue to see that that market migrate over time from solvent borne to waterborne technology it s still predominantly solvent borne market and given that the multinationals have the best waterborne technology there are some locals that have waterborne technology but it s not at the same level as the large multinationals that would continue to be a benefit for axalta as we move as we move forward now that being said the premium end of the market in china which is where we historically have been quite strong is one area of focus the other area of focus is the mainstream and the economy markets where again we continue a strong push in those markets in terms of building out distribution putting feet on the street and most importantly having the right products at the right price point and with the right positioning to meet the needs of our customers in those segments sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer and i think mix longer term yeah when we where we see global room for volume improvements partially in the economy and mainstream space so we re not necessarily expecting richer mix over the long term but when you go region by region and you look at the mso space here in north america but they really value some of our more productive systems i mean you could see some richer mix coming through in 2019 steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just a question on your auto oem business how many employees do you have that are in these oem paint lines and when they slow is that your cost burden to bear or they do or you directly compensated for those employees sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer so for competitive reasons we don t want to provide too much information in that regard but just generally we have over over a 1 000 employees around the world that actually work on our oem customer paint lines and or involved in the support of those of those paint lines as volumes as volumes come down there are opportunities to pullback on that on that sales force or on that sales support area if and when it was ever it was ever required steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of p j juvekar of citi please proceed with your question p j juvekar citigroup analyst yes hi good morning robert bryant chief executive officer good morning p j p j juvekar citigroup analyst robert you and your competitor have had some destocking issues in the distributor channel in refinish where do we stand on distributor inventories today and how do you get visibility for your planning purposes for for demand from distributed distributor channels robert bryant chief executive officer it s hard to have i mean i think as axalta we have pretty good visibility into how much product we have with our distributors in general not necessarily each and every point of distribution that they have that visibility we have we don t necessarily have visibility into competitor levels or other products like accessories that are in this warehouses when we visit of course we might happen to take a glance over and see how much inventory might be there but for the most part we don t have a lot of visibility about that overall from an industry perspective what i would say from an axalta perspective is last year as you know i should say in 2017 we made several several changes there and adjusting many of our commercial policies and that resulted in distributors carrying and pulling down inventory levels so at this juncture from an axalta perspective most of our of our distributors are carrying the amount of axalta product that they need for the foreseeable future given some of this commercial changes as well as some of the limits that we placed on the ability to privy ahead of price increases certainly that has ameliorated that aspect of the of the supply chain however if there is consolidation within distribution that would be i guess the primary remaining element that could result at some point in the future in actual reduction in total inventory held at distribution but i think again the important the important thing here is to look at distribution is what happens in the middle what happens at the end with the end consumer is what s most important for the long term health of the business p j juvekar citigroup analyst thank you and a question for sean sean as a new cfo how do you think about your net leverage of 3 4 times and we are late in the economic cycle some economies have slowed down so what s your comfort level in terms of leverage and what should we expect for 2019 in terms of buyback and share repurchases thank you sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so today where we sit we are very comfortable with the free cash flow profile and where our leverage sits where we are now targeting is 2 5 times so we ll continue to build cash we re not necessarily looking to actively pay down debt when you think about our overall debt profile we re at slightly below 3 8 so pretty healthy interest rate there so again not a huge return by paying down debt when we think about share buyback we did slightly over 100 million just in the fourth quarter we ll continue to be opportunistic but we re not going to set targets for 2019 we want to continue to remain flexibility and value all the potential items in the pipeline around m a internal projects as well as share buyback from a capital deployment perspective p j juvekar citigroup analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of our arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning guys robert bryant chief executive officer good morning arun arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst good morning i just want to go back to the guidance range i expect that you d probably narrow that as you go through the year as you did in 18 but maybe can just help us confirm what would push you to the upper or lower end i mean is it fair to assume given some of your comments on weakness are rising in china and europe recently that you re expecting now to be closer to the lower end also is it fair to assume that volume is unlikely to surprise to the upside so it would be more like price and cost that will be the main lever that would push you to the upside thanks robert bryant chief executive officer i think it s always it s fairly consistent with prior years the overall the overall macro environment is certainly the most important variable from a from an overall demand perspective although it effects it effects cost but it also effects volume and certainly the discussions that are ongoing with china and the trade discussions there and i think if you see those get resolved favorably and quickly we believe that we could see greater demand out of china across a multitude of product lines the other element of course is always raw material inflation we assumed a level of raw material inflation slightly above the current levels at least from a brent perspective and then from an oil forecast then we have layered in what we believe will continue to be some of the supply constraints as well as the impact from at least phase i of the tariffs now if we go to phase ii of course that could change things quite a bit so the overall raw material basket and then our ability to push through price increases to offset that if that s in excess of what we see in the budget would be another element and then finally the last element of course is is foreign exchange arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and then also just wanted to touch on this if you didn t already if i missed it but the cost reductions that you targeted for 2019 is that 50 million is there a potential that you could find more in case there is a greater slowdown to stay within your ebitda range sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so currently we are targeting the 50 million and that s largely offsetting inflation at this point but if we see any sort of slowdowns or potential slowdown as far as getting price in the lv space there is more potential opportunity we would aggressively go after arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst perfect thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas with jp morgan please proceed with your question jeffrey zekauskas jp morgan analyst hi thanks very much in your your sales guidance for 2019 you estimate 2 to 3 growth i would expect that that would be your price and so your best case is that your volumes are flattish is that correct on a consolidated basis sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer so jeff it s primarily priced but there is an aspect of volume growth in their modest but there is an aspect jeffrey zekauskas jp morgan analyst so in terms of the deployment of your cash flow in 2016 and 2017 you really were pretty aggressive in making acquisitions and then when 2018 came along there was something in the first quarter but there really haven t been any acquisitions since then and you ve really elevated your share repurchase outlays is that because the acquisition pipeline thinned out or acquisitions became more expensive or was it that your own stock became more expensive more inexpensive and you wanted to be opportunistic can you talk about the shift in cash flow deployment robert bryant chief executive officer jeff we continue to focus on m a both small bolt on transactions as well as more as well as more transformative transactions and we do have a we do have a good pipeline of deals that being said we have been we have been selective in the transactions in the transactions that we have pursued and we ve also been focused on integrating well the acquisitions that we have made thus far so we have been also pretty disciplined in terms of in terms of valuations not that valuations have been unreasonable but a few of the major assets that have come to market in the past six months to nine months many of those have been in public auction or auction scenarios and we felt that some of the prices that were required and some of the prices that were eventually paid for some of those assets did not generate a return that we found satisfactory so i think we re going to continue to be disciplined on capital deployment the larger that the larger spend on our share on our share our share repurchase program that really fundamentally is linked to the fact we had 675 million program to date we purchased about 312 million against that so we didn t want to show progress on our share repurchase program especially given the lower stock price it became very attractive to buyback our stock and that s the way that the share repurchase program was structured it was structured to be highly opportunistic so we were offsetting dilution but if we did see the stock price go down the share repurchase program would kick in and would accelerate the volume of purchases which is exactly what the program did jeffrey zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you robert what are you seeing on your auto oem price increases and what level of competitor support you are seeing in the marketplace robert bryant chief executive officer what i d say is we issued a press release toward the end of last year where we highlighted that we were going to be going out to the market with price increases that we had made pretty much all of the efforts that we could make internally from a cost reduction perspective without starting to cut into muscle and bone in that business that would potentially compromise the long term health of that business so i think we supported our customers by trying to right size our cost structure as much as we possibly could but we reached a point where we had to go out with price increases and so that is indeed what we have done and you start to see some of the results of that in our q4 results and i d expect that you would that you would see that moving forward david begleiter deutsche bank analyst okay and just on refinish robert look like your volumes they were down in 2017 they were roughly flat in 2018 what s the level of confidence in actually growing volumes in refinish in 2019 robert bryant chief executive officer well i think big picture you have to remember you have to remember a couple of things right first we re always working with our customers i mean it s not about the volume of the paint it s about the value that we re creating and the net sales that we re generating so we re always working with our customers to help them use less paint and to make them more efficient number one number two as we continue to the shift from solvent borne to waterborne waterborne just uses a lower volume and uses less paint than solvent borne so structurally you will see volume decrease slightly over time just given the nature of the business now we capture that through price and we also capture that more focused on capturing just the service element of what we do not only in oem but also in the refinish business but if we if we look at the customer wins that we ve had around the world and if we look at the number of body shops that we have in the axalta network and given some of the paint management systems and the color matched systems that we have we have pretty good insight to the number of shops that we are servicing we ve actually seen a net shop gain that is higher than that stage ph of our competitors and we have also experienced some important customer wins over the last 12 months that will begin to materialize in our numbers in 2019 so i think overall we feel very good about the refinish business david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of aleksey yefremov with nomura instinet please proceed with your question aleksey yefremov nomura instinet analyst thank you good morning everyone just to piggyback on the refinish volume question and thanks for for the explanation robert maybe is there a metric that we can use to assess sort of the underlying level of demand other than the number of shops maybe is there do you have like a number of cars painted or something similar to assess the demand level christopher mecray vice president investor relations treasury and strategy aleksey there this is chris there really isn t a global metric that adequately captures the entire market so there is hesitancy to provide something of that type for any given region that we might be able to source or capture because while that might be accurate for any given country it really wouldn t it really wouldn t capture the global picture so we stay away from trying to quote specific market metrics because it could be misleading it is a big global business we sell in over 130 countries we have a desperate business across both premium and mainstream products out there but what holds up and what s persistent is the growth in population the growth in middle class leading to increased car park leading to increased miles driven globally and so there is a structural driver there underlying everything else all this discussion about waterborne versus solvent bone and other things within given markets is in that broader context of market growth aleksey yefremov nomura instinet analyst so so maybe just to follow up again do do you think the actual area painted by axalta in the refinish business is it growing flat declining christopher mecray vice president investor relations treasury and strategy do you mean geographic area aleksey yefremov nomura instinet analyst no i mean we i don t know square square feet of panels painted in 2009 2018 versus 2017 and so forth christopher mecray vice president investor relations treasury and strategy well we wouldn t have visibility on a fine metric like that but we do know for example that broader trends like the removal of a bumper to repair lead to the painting of the entire bumper whereas a years ago they might just bang out a dent and paint that section so there are some things like that that happened in the market but no we don t have we don t have a fine point metric like that to capture it aleksey yefremov nomura instinet analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi with baird please proceed with your question ghansham panjabi baird analyst hi guys good morning i guess just a quick question on industrial obviously volumes were positive during the fourth quarter which was encouraging given just what we have seen from the macro standpoint did you see any deterioration toward the end of the quarter as customers perhaps scale back on inventories just give us some more context on how volume stays for that business during the quarter robert bryant chief executive officer we have to remember that industrial for us is the multitude of market it s wood it s oil it s energy solutions it s our general industrial business it s powder coating so it does vary a little bit a little bit by market the one business where we did see a little softening through the quarter was in the was in the north america wood business for us that would be the main area that i think we would call out and highlight but again as we ve mentioned before our industrial business even though it s 1 2 billion 1 3 billion business for us globally given the size of the addressable market we still have a lot of room to grow and we have a very good team that s executing extremely well so i think our our general outlook on industrial continues to be quite positive ghansham panjabi baird analyst okay and then just just to clarify sean s point on 2 5 times net debt to ebitda being target from a balance sheet standpoint should we interpret that as the priority for 19 being debt pay down or is that sort of a longer term target and we should still expect m a and sort of share buybacks as the year unfolds thanks so much robert bryant chief executive officer yeah unfortunately debt pay down won t help us with our net leverage ratio only with the gross the gross leverage ratio so i think what you would expect to see there is given how low our cost of debt is it doesn t really make a lot of sense to pay down gross debt in this environment it makes more sense to build out cash and then selectively deploy that cash to the highest to the highest return projects across the company that being said if we do see rates move up more considerably i ll remind everyone that we are fairly significantly hedged or capped out across the majority of our debt portfolio so we are in a very in a very good position so we wouldn t expect to do much debt pay down in 2019 unless again we were to see a spike in rates or a dramatic change in the macro environment when you look at something like interest rate coverage we are in a very very healthy position even when you run certain downside scenarios on on the business that being said if there are momentary aberrations in the debt markets where we have the opportunity to do something creative and potentially break down our gross debt level we ll take advantage of those ghansham panjabi baird analyst thanks for clarifying operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning a question on europe obviously the wltp situation is is sort of shading volume there do you have any sense when that sort of expires or runs its course sort of what do you think the underlying volume trends are going to be like in that market in 2019 robert bryant chief executive officer if you look at europe overall for 2018 at least according to ihs the from a build or production perspective the market was down about 1 about 1 2 and i think the current forecast that they have for europe is to be flat on the year at 0 and embedded in that in that assumption is the belief that wltp will work its way through the system and then as it as it does your inaudible production return to more normal rates unaffected by wltp that being said i think with all the activities that the macroeconomic environment in europe today i think our view on on at least light vehicle in that market and also commercial vehicle for 2019 is fairly cautious at this point vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay if i could just ask a follow up robert when you talked about changing the you re going to show ebit instead of ebitda did you did you say i thought you maybe said something about that you re going to change the way you add back incentive comps in other words maybe you re not going to add back stock based compensation anymore was that was that correct sean lannon senior vice president and chief financial officer so that s accurate robert also commented on the fact we are changing our incentive compensation target internally for management to align with our externally reported numbers but you re exactly right stock based compensation will no longer be added back for ebit reporting going forward vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you very much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen our final question for this morning will from the line of duffy fischer with barclays please proceed with your question duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning fellows just first question on p l sg a was down almost 25 in q4 what were the drivers there and can we extend those lower levels going forward into this year robert bryant chief executive officer yeah so duffy two points that kind of get back to apples to apples so in 2017 there was about 43 million in there related to severance and one time elements around the merger and acquisition talks with akzo and nippon and then there was an 18 7 million reclass out of sg a up in the cogs in 2018 so that drives your entire difference between 17 and 18 so you roughly have a flat 17 versus 18 comparison when you normalize for those but as far as extrapolating the result for the fourth quarter yes i mean that should be a normal run rate as a percentage of net sales duffy fischer barclays analyst okay great and then if you go to the cash flow statement the prepaid expenses and other line has eaten roughly almost 250 million in cash over the last two years should we think about that as coming back in cash at some point getting released or is that more like an investment that we should think about that earning 10 12 15 and so that s actually running through the p l today robert bryant chief executive officer so what you re seeing in that line item are these upfront customer incentive payments that we talked about in length last quarter i mean you saw an uptick from the run rate historically it s been running around 80 million you saw a bigger uptick this year because of a few bigger customers where we give the incentives to but as far as the cash coming back end that will be coming in through price over time it won t be coming through that line item but it will be coming back through ar collections as we get more price with those customers duffy fischer barclays analyst great thanks guys operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr bryant for any final comments robert bryant chief executive officer thank you for everyone for joining today appreciate your your interest in axalta and look forward to talking with you again when we have our q1 results operator thank you this concludes today s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation

a hallowed chamber for an important address ap photo j scott applewhite the state of the union is back on after speaker of the house nancy pelosi said she invited president donald trump to address congress and the nation on feb 5 earlier she had disinvited the president from giving the speech in the house on the scheduled date of jan 29 while we await trump s address we asked three economists to give us their own assessments of the state of the union as well as the president s performance so far each picked a theme state of the national debt sky s the limit steven pressman colorado state university as a candidate trump promised to eliminate america s national debt in eight years through faster economic growth how s he done so far not so good the debt has climbed from us 20 trillion when trump took office to 21 5 trillion at the end of 2018 the budget deficit or the difference between government revenues and spending is what changes the national debt after falling continuously from 1 4 trillion in 2009 at the end of the great recession to 585 billion in 2016 the u s budget deficit has risen during the trump presidency it hit 779 billion in 2018 the highest level since 2012 and is expected to reach 900 billion this year the two main forces driving this are greater spending on the military and disaster relief and the 2017 tax cut which reduced corporate income taxes by 92 billion the trump administration and the republicans who pushed for the tax cut promised that economic growth would increase tax revenues and offset the losses most economists including me were skeptical that corporate tax cuts would substantially increase investment and economic growth so far the data supports the skeptics the greatest problem however is that budget deficits should fall during economic expansions this provides more policy flexibility whenever the next recession hits during recessions tax receipts fall and government spending rises pushing up the deficit the appropriate fiscal policy response increase the budget deficit even more becomes harder the larger it already is state of trade uncertainty and trade wars james lake southern methodist university american trade with the world is crucial to the u s economy exceeding 25 percent of gross domestic product but with uncertainty over tariffs trade wars and trade agreements keeping u s businesses on their toes the state of trade is in flux the raw numbers tell a mixed story after increasing for six straight quarters the brunt of strong foreign retaliation over trump s tariffs pushed u s exports down 1 24 percent in the third quarter of 2018 the latest data available it s the biggest fall since the depths of the great recession in 2009 at the same time imports jumped that quarter as u s companies wary of higher tariffs on chinese goods stocked up imports from china surged 11 1 percent the most since 2011 as a result america s trade deficit with the world one of the president s most cited metrics and a reason he s fighting his trade wars widened to a 10 year high the trump administration has spent the better part of the past year escalating its war of words and tariffs with china with tit for tat trade barriers being hurled back and forth trump s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods were set to ratchet up from 10 percent to 25 percent in january until he and chinese president xi jinping agreed to a three month truce to come to a deal the deadline is march 1 but rather than leading to chinese concessions trump s strong arm negotiating tactics have led to a new suit this month against the u s at the world trade organization and despite continuing to push hard on chinese telecom giant huawei there s now talk that the trump administration s tariff stance may be softening all of this uncertainty together with the higher tariffs are starting to hurt markets as well as companies like u s manufacturing bellwether caterpillar and iconic motorcycle maker harley davidson another major area of concern has been the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement which lasted some 18 months and resulted in a deal that looked strikingly similar to the original there were some modest changes for the dairy and auto industries but by and large it was the same old agreement nevertheless congress still needs to actually vote on the new deal known as the u s mexico canada agreement and newly empowered democrats are talking about reopening the deal to demand stronger labor and environmental protections and unsurprisingly trump is once again threatening to withdraw from the pact altogether so more uncertainty ahead for u s business workers and consumers state of health care high mortality higher costs david bishai john hopkins university in his inaugural address trump vowed to end american carnage if carnage is measured in american mortality things are are not getting better unfortunately u s life expectancy fell to 78 6 years at the end of 2017 the latest data available this continues a slide from 2015 the first time it has shown a sustained three year fall in four decades according to the centers for disease control comparable countries like canada the u k france and germany continue to see life expectancy climbing well above 80 one of the big reasons is the opioid epidemic which is estimated to have cost the economy 1 trillion from 2001 to 2017 every state in the union is seeing epidemics of drug overdoses suicide and alcohol related deaths despite better access to health insurance states that expanded access to health insurance showed slower growth of drug overdose mortality and increased access to rehabilitative treatment for addiction the affordable care act helped cut the share of uninsured americans from 17 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2015 where they have remained better insurance also brings access to services that have lowered death rates from congenital malformations heart disease and cancer yet the aca is not a panacea and has not prevented lethal epidemics from sweeping the nation this is especially frustrating because americans spend 18 percent of gdp on health care or 10 739 for every man woman and child so the problem isn t spending it s how we spend it research and real world examples are showing how communities bringing together multiple groups outside of health care to pursue various approaches can lead to promising results examples include cutting overdose death rates in dayton ohio and wilkes county north carolina that s the best way to finally stem the flow of american carnage this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article
should we worry about the size of the trade deficit how do we bring back american manufacturing why aren t wages growing more quickly on this episode economics professor and bbc presenter linda yueh discusses how 12 of the world s greatest economists might respond to these questions and more linda yueh is an adjunct professor of economics at the london business school an associate fellow at chatham house and a tv and radio presenter for the bbc her latest book is what would the great economists do how twelve brilliant minds would solve today s biggest problems what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation you can download the episode by clicking the link above and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis i want to start out with a question about the premise of the book which looks at the great economists throughout history and what they would say about today s problems this book comes out at a time when it seems like we are rejecting expertise we are rejecting what great economists of the past would have said you see this in the rise of populism when there s the idea of we ve had enough of experts and you have just written a book about experts how is the book being received and did the rejection of expertise at all drive your thinking about why to write this book yueh yes it was exactly that thought i thought we re facing so many big challenges whether it s how do you increase wages do we face a slow growth future or what drives innovation and it occurred to me that obviously looking at these issues for some time that there s a lot we can learn from history it s like that mark twain saying history doesn t repeat itself but it often rhymes so the first time secular stagnation this concept that we may be facing a stagnant future was coined was in the 1930s when alvin hansen was worried about an aging population so that was really the motivation for the book we ve got some really deep seeded problems and i wanted to see if we can learn from some of the greatest thinkers in economics and more importantly how they engaged with similar but not identical issues during their day and brought us to this period of relative prosperity despite our economic problems so i certainly thought that was worth looking at looking at their wisdom looking at their failures looking at their disagreements but most importantly seeing how economists can engage with the big questions of the day because that s the other thing the great economists shared in common none of these economists were literally sitting in a room writing a book they were debating the big issues of the day for david ricardo it was defeating mercantilism in the 19th century this idea that you need to have trade surplus he said no you need to improve the competitiveness the efficiency of your own economy similarly joseph schumpeter is best known for the concept of creative destruction but actually his best known book is called capitalism socialism and democracy in other words these economists were really engaging in the big issues of the day which is probably what made them great i want to pick through some of the economists and what they would say about today s problems before i do as you went through these dozen economists who do you feel like you learned something about that surprised you probably what surprised me the most was how hard they were on themselves personally we think of adam smith the father of economics robert solow creator of the growth model and as you mentioned part of the book consists of their biographies which are just fascinating these thinkers have changed the world and yet adam smith was so disappointed that he didn t produce more in his lifetime and he was so unhappy with what he wrote later in his life that he wanted everything he wrote burned after his death joseph schumpeter creative destruction creator you know really a transformative person he gave himself 50 percent on his productivity every week that s probably what surprised me the most successful people are really hard on themselves you just mentioned adam smith it s interesting that he wrote the wealth of nations just as the world was moving into the first stage of the industrial revolution something that he didn t really recognize at the time and yet his book was extremely popular and relevant throughout the industrial revolution until today and now we re sort of moving into a post industrial revolution to a digital economy what did you find in smith that you think is particularly applicable for today really thinking about how governments can intervene and set up policies and institutions that are not distortionary because of the premise of his invisible hand so that s very familiar to a lot of people this idea that supply and demand will determine prices and quantities but adam smith wasn t actually a laissez faire economist like those that came after him in fact he was very focused on the ways in which government should provide some things and that they needed to for instance to tax but that they needed to do it in a non distortionary away so in his words and he effectuated this policy when he was the customs official for scotland he was a scottish economist he said you have to tax the tipple of the rich the same as the poor so in other words in a non distortionary fashion if you think about today when we do live in a post industrial predominantly services based economy his chapter becomes about whether governments should rebalance the economy and we hear a lot about should governments be going in to promote some sectors versus others right there seems to be a new interest in the idea of industrial policy i imagine partially it s because of the great recession and financial crisis led people to think more generally about how we are growing economies and if we are growing them in sustainable ways and i would think also sort of the success of china you know year after year with very high growth rates that at least maybe opened up some people s perceptions that maybe the government can pick winners and losers and maybe it can choose which sectors to boost yeah i think industrial policy or the new term you hear a lot now industrial strategy in the last 10 years for especially america and the uk where services are very dominant has been revisited because for instance germany and france have bigger manufacturing sectors as a share of their economy so i think that s where the policy focus certainly comes in and interestingly i think for adam smith he would argue that if you wanted to do that you should look at the policies and see whether or not it s promoting fair competition so in other words look at your tax policy look at your strategy and if it is an efficiently operating market and we know lots of markets don t actually operate that efficiently then should governments intervene because there s lots of examples of where governments haven t done so well and yet the countries that i mentioned germany and france have put a lot more support behind high end manufacturing so if there are ways in which the tax system isn t quite as efficient as it needs to be vis a vis different sectors then you should look at that but jim i would just add that adam smith as you said he very much began to witness the industrial revolution he had a real affinity for manufacturing he described services which is of course the biggest part of all advanced economies as full of buffoons and opera singers but i just wonder if he might change his mind if he could see that services could be commoditized today let s stick with adam smith for just another moment what would he think of the idea and you certainly hear this a lot in the united states from people concerned about manufacturing that maybe we need the government to create new manufacturing hubs or high technology hubs that we can give a certain tax structure or a regulatory structure and we can work with universities or government funded centers for manufacturing so this idea that if policymakers view it as a failure oh there s not enough manufacturing or not enough manufacturing in a particular sector we can insert it by government intervention what do you think of these sorts of ideas yes so i write about advanced manufacturing which is something that the us has seen a huge burst of and it is in part due to government policy if you look at a state like tennessee it s got the biggest car factory in north america and of course that area has a history of having government support like oak ridge national lab which is a very well known high tech r d center i think adam smith is not against government intervening he s against government intervening inefficiently or in a distortionary kind of way so for instance we know that markets are not free and the playing field is not level and i m not just talking about within the us because all of this is in a globalized world so would promoting advanced manufacturing which is actually pretty consistent with the united states s strengths in innovation high skill labor and high productivity workers is that something that is providing just a boost and then you can see the sector take off and of course you judge it and it s too early to judge perhaps but you ll judge it later on as to whether or not these policies disadvantage other sectors but one thing i will add about advanced manufacturing it looks like manufacturing has been reshored as in came back to the united states over the past few years and it s mostly in advanced manufacturing but adam smith i think would certainly point out that that wasn t due to explicit government policy that had to do with rising wages in places like china the shale revolution that reduced energy costs high productivity and automative manufacturing in other words automation means that as factories come back it doesn t mean that the jobs are going to come back so what you see is that manufacturing jobs in the us are still below the level in 1950 even though manufacturing output has picked up in my book i relate one example where i spoke to the ceo of stanley black decker he made his first power tool in the united states for decades he said that wage costs and the reason he did it was because wage costs once you take into account productivity and unit labor costs and things like energy and transport it costs the same to produce a power tool in the united states as it does in china and he gets the added boost of a made in america sign on his box and finally i think the other thing to stress is when we re talking about automation and a lot of these big companies advanced manufacturing means they invest a lot in r d so there s also a heavy component of services right in a lot of high end manufacturing so some companies rolls royce for instance you know them for their cars but they make more money servicing their engines than actually selling the engines that s called the servicification of manufacturing so once you take that into account then isn t what the united states is actually promoting is a highly productive high end technological services economy with high manufacturing you re mentioning sort of the reshoring of jobs which is a great lead in to get into david ricardo i think if you would listen to politics in the united states over the past two years you would think that dave ricardo got it all wrong if you look at the current us trade policy at least the president s view of trade there is a belief that the last 200 years of thinking about trade and free trade is wrong we got it all wrong and the united states needs to go in a different direction so what would ricardo make of the current trade debate i think that it s fascinating that s exactly what i write about which is do trade deficits matter so david ricardo is the father of international trade he was sort of a disciple of adam smith the story is actually that he made a lot of money as a stockbroker by betting the right way in the battle of waterloo he ended up becoming bored as you do i guess when you re wealthy and happened to pick up adam smith s wealth of nations when he was on vacation and he taught himself economics and he wrote the model of comparative advantage which basically argued that countries should make sure that they were specializing in what they re relatively less inefficient at in other words a country could be more productive than you in everything but you d still produce something you would try to really tailor what you produce to what you were relatively better at and that was more important than the mercantilist doctrine of the day which is that countries should aim for trade surpluses ideally finding gold and silver and bringing it back that s a real surplus so he was instrumental in the repeal of the corn laws of 1846 which is a highly protectionist piece of agricultural legislation and that paved the way to his model of free trade and globalization and really leading into the world that we see today which is very interconnected so i think if you looked at ricardo s model i think he would certainly point out that if you want to get your trade position improved so say if you look at parameters like if your current account deficit is more than 3 percent of gdp even the imf will take a look at that then what you need to focus on isn t just whether or not trade is free as in his model presumes a level playing field you also importantly have to look at the capabilities of your economy how productive are you how efficient are you are you specializing in things that suit your comparative advantage and if you can get the fundamentals of the domestic economy right that goes a long way for your trade position which is a reflection of your domestic strengths and weaknesses and so i think those two things would be what he would focus on probably one of the most well known economic studies in recent years has been david autor s work on china and trade and what he calls the china trade shock the idea that when china joined the world trade organization in 2000 there s a flood of manufactured goods and in the united states some regions did very very badly and didn t really bounce back so if ricardo was presented with the china trade shock paper by david autor what would he make of that how would he respond i think integrating china into the world economy is probably something that was as his wife described a shock to the global system but i think probably in both those areas that i mentioned a moment ago david ricardo would focus on one is america de industrializing as all advanced economies are so if you look at the effect of course china has had an effect in terms of the offshoring of jobs but the evidence points to technology in particular automation really having a bigger effect in terms of deindustrialization and we discussed how actually manufacturing is actually getting more sophisticated so historically china was one issue and i think the second thing he would point to is despite the fact we describe trade as free trade isn t actually free trade is about opening up your markets so china joined the world trade organization in 2001 and that really accelerated its integration into the world economy and there are areas in which china does have a comparative advantage it s got one fifth of the world s population so in terms of low end manufacturing i think it s hard to argue that that isn t necessarily free but obviously in other areas china s market is more closed so coming back to what this means for us workers yes china s integration was a shock especially having the world s most populous nation enter into global value chains that s bound to affect manufacturing in advanced economies but the other thing that david ricardo s model pointed out is there will be losers from trade so the question again comes back to if there are those that you expect to be left behind because of comparative advantage then has enough been done to help them transition into new work and that s historically what s happened with you ve had both technology and trade shocks governments haven t done enough they redistribute as in they help some workers through transfers of funds but as we all know people who lose their jobs because of these factors these shocks they want to be equipped for new jobs and i think that s really what you need to be focused on instead of ricardo let s say adam smith was presented with the china trade shock paper would it be sort of a similar response that he would understand that not everybody even if the country as a whole as an aggregate is better off is going to be better off and then that s where government has a role well it s interesting that you mention adam smith because ricardo was his disciple but ricardo disagreed with adam smith on what drives trade adam smith unlike ricardo believed in absolute advantage so he believed that countries traded in terms of what they were absolutely better at so i think given china s low cost advantage in low end manufacturing i think certainly that s something that adam smith would agree with ricardo on but i think in terms of adam smith s focus on workers your really good subtle point here is that adam smith actually very much worried about the health of his workers the well being of manufacturing workers he thought that doing repetitive tasks would make people quite stupid that was his concern and so i think all of these economists were not just concerned with efficiency per se not necessarily through their theories but certainly in their writings you do see that they very much focus on the individual so adam smith s book the theory of moral sentiments i think really goes into this area and then of course his disciples known as the neoclassical economists so people like the cambridge economist alfred marshall they created welfare state capitalism so they changed the capitalist system from the industrial revolution and by the 20th century they had created a welfare state which was actually meant to redistribute and help those who were left behind so it has evolved but i think if we look at the present day i don t necessarily think there s an answer a good answer to what to do to help workers who have been left behind so in the kind of welfare state days capitalism days in the early 20th century there was a focus on the deserving poor making sure that any policies didn t disincentivize work i think that s still there but i think if you look at the loser from globalization it s certainly an issue that i write about in another chapter as well in the epilogue that some more policies need to be examined otherwise it causes a backlash just as just as adam smith was sort of doing his work just as we moved into the industrial revolution karl marx his work was done in the middle of it and one criticism of marx is that he did not see the vast abundance that would be created by the industrial revolution particularly in the second half of the industrial revolution of the 19th century but in china marx certainly could not have predicted that kind of developmental path for a country but here we have a country which still is kind of capitalist in some areas has grown immensely richer over the past four decades by adopting some capitalist methods and techniques but yet also likes to still consider itself a communist country what does marx make of the chinese developmental model yeah in the chapter can china grow rich i essentially conclude that karl marx would find it difficult to recognize china today because china s growth since 1979 has injected market forces particularly incentive based policies in order to really reform the communist centrally planned economy so politically it s still communist but economically the centrally planned economy that existed between 49 and 79 has been significantly dismantled through injecting market forces i m not sure karl marx would recognize that but then again karl marx like many economists if the facts don t fit his theory he changes his theory so if marx were to see china today i wonder if he would come up with something else the example i m thinking of in karl marx s original theory is that capitalism would lead to an uprising or revolution and the trigger for that event was a crisis so he got very excited with friedrich engels about the panic of 1873 a us financial crisis that spread around the world it sounds familiar and that s when unemployment first appeared in the dictionary karl marx was convinced that this was the crisis that was going to lead to revolution and lead to communism and then when it didn t happen and that was known as the long depression he decided that what would cause a real communist revolution was inequality so he was convinced that income inequality in particular would be what would trigger the revolution that would finally get countries to be communist by the way he was very much disappointed in his own lifetime and he never lived to see communism in china or even the creation of the soviet union and the bolshevik revolution and so he i think he would not recognize the china of today and he didn t see his ideas come to fruition really in any major economy during his lifetime it s a recurrent theme in the book the idea of economic growth both how to get economies to grow faster and how to make sure that growth benefits people broadly and as we mentioned earlier one of the economists is joseph schumpeter who again is known for creative destruction and was sort of a hero of entrepreneurial capitalism but somebody who didn t give a lot of policy ideas during his career in fact there s a quote and i only have this at the tip of my tongue because i just recently reread a biography of him people would ask him for policy ideas and he would say do you think i m running a drug store that i just hand out pills policies like pills we mentioned earlier the idea of secular stagnation the idea that you know economies are kind of stuck in this slow growth rut but what would schumpeter say and advocate for today what would he tell policymakers who want to have faster growth today you re absolutely right you wouldn t find him offering policy advice because he was part of the austrian school he really viewed economics as tools faced and analytical and it was really meant for others to draw policy conclusions from it in fact that was one of the reasons why schumpeter was never quite as influential as john maynard keynes whose general theory was published in 1936 and essentially dominated the scene because keynes was all about answers like how would you end the great depression and how you restore full employment schumpeter on the other hand was doing his detailed studies of innovative companies and he wasn t offering policy solutions i think schumpeter would probably look at today and say just like in his day yes you ve got superstar companies but if you also have institutions that support innovation then you will see tons of competitor firms that will emerge so that s the process of creative destruction he never worried about monopolies or superstar firms he said those are the ones who had funds to invest in r d and innovation is what generates growth and technological change so in his day he was writing at the time of us steal these huge companies the trustification of american industry and he noticed there were hundreds of startups competing with these big companies until eventually you have the destruction part a lot of firms go under and then the strong remain so i think he would probably view today s innovations in terms of startup costs in the digital space as very low as compared to those in his day like the rail industry or steel industry he would probably see the kind of startups that populate the landscape today and say that s exactly what we ought to be promoting more creative destruction would he be concerned about the big tech companies because now there s this sort of growing concern that we have about monopoly and particularly in technology that we have these massive companies that people just can t imagine them ever not being sort of massive tremendously important companies and even though google and apple even though they re spending a lot of money on r d there s still in some quarters the idea that they need to be regulated or broken up so would schumpeter want to break up these big technology companies i think joseph schumpeter would probably not worry he wasn t worried about monopolies in his day so long as the institutions promoted competition so that s not to say the industries don t need to be regulated but if it s competitive then he would say don t worry about monopoly power because an efficient market means that no monopolies will last forever and he charted industries and companies that had risen and had fallen in the united states and continental europe so i think his view would be so long as the market was competitive and any regulation would have to focus on competitiveness in the chapter what drives innovation i look at smartphones today they re everywhere right ten years ago jim the biggest smartphone makers in the world were nokia and blackberry produced by research in motion today it s samsung and huawei has just overtaken apple and so in the span of a decade that landscape has completely changed the churn rate in terms of big companies on the s p 500 their life spans are now on average much shorter suggesting there s actually more competition in terms of this very low cost of starting out so i think something like three quarters of those companies in the s p 500 won t be there in a couple of decades at the current turn rate so i think he would point to all of that and say yeah if it is properly regulated don t worry about it some of the economists in the book i think just to the average listener of this podcast are very familiar keynes milton friedman certainly adam smith to listeners who don t know who joan robinson is who s john robinson and why is she in this book so joan robinson was a very influential economist a great economist she made her name in the 1930s as a disciple of john maynard keynes she was rare in that women in those days weren t widely awarded economics degrees even if they took the same course work as men but robinson s rise was really very very quick and her work has a lasting impact on one of the big issues of our time which is why are wages so low why don t wages track productivity in a number of countries so robinson wrote a textbook based on keynesianism that focused on the short run and imperfect competition so her concept of monopsony which is monopoly in labor markets basically showed that workers don t get paid the value of their marginal output if the labor market isn t perfectly competitive so you can see the relevance of her work today because that helps to explain the divergence between productivity and wages and she also writes about things like disguised and hidden unemployment so if you want a full time job and you have a part time job then your wages are going to be low and you re counted as employed but really she said that was hidden unemployment so the u6 measure of unemployment picks up some of that as well as discourage workers and other things so robinson was hugely influential in this area which i think is still one of the biggest issues that we face and was certainly a big issue in the 1930s just to wrap up i started out by asking what surprised you about these economists and also noting this general skepticism i think partially because the financial crisis about the expertise of these economists you ve had an opportunity to watch what s going on in the global economies since the great financial crisis but you ve also had the opportunity to step back and take a renewed look at some of the great economists of the past has that process changed your thinking about anything or given you new ideas about what policymakers should or should not be doing going forward probably two things i think the first thing is that economists have always disagreed so it is a question of looking at competing schools of thought so we ve discussed austrian economists versus neoclassical economists one of the things one of the big rivalries that i write about is john maynard keynes versus friedrich hayek and there is a rap battle on youtube which has over 6 million views so it s kind of like hamilton where they rap out the views of keynes versus hayek over the causes of the great depression and it was so popular that they made a sequel over the causes of the great recession so i think the first thing to take away is that economists will disagree and that s a good thing for policymakers because you can take their analysis and the evidence that they use and you can use that to make a judgment economics is an analytical tool and it helps you make a more informed judgment and i think the second thing that i took away is that the great economists were great because they embraced the big questions of the day even if the answers weren t tidy the ideas of these great economists have transformed entire societies so i mentioned globalization taking hold in the latter part of the 19th century the creation of welfare state in the 20th century the fall of the berlin wall in the late 1980s i think we re now at a point in the 21st century where we also have to look again at economic models and theories and engage with the big questions even if they don t fit neatly into one set of models or one set of theories it is about thinking how our society should be constituted and how to improve prosperity for all of us so i really admire these great thinkers and as we discussed before i was really struck by how they were really hard on themselves and the final thing i think to touch on is most of the economists who invested lost their fortunes so i just wouldn t look to them for investment advice but in terms of analysis yes

howard schultz the former starbucks ceo considering a run at the white house as an independent candidate believes the federal debt is the nation s greatest threat thinks america cannot afford to give all its citizens free health care and has argued for cuts to government entitlement programs such as social security and medicare schultz appeared on cnn for a town hall event on tuesday night as he considers his presidential bid but was not specific about his solutions to a number of policy issues including how he would improve the department of veterans affairs and what the top tax rate on earners should be i will fix the va because it s about leadership it s about character and it s also about the temperament of humility to listen to people who are smarter than you who have more experience than you to help solve this problem schultz said advertisement schultz s aides have not responded to numerous requests for clarity on his call to go after social security and medicare refusing to answer questions about whether he believes the retirement age for social security should be raised or if the medicare eligibility age should be higher than 65 schultz has attacked a number of tax proposals that have become increasingly popular on the democratic left including rep alexandria ocasio cortez s proposed 70 percent marginal tax rate on those earning above 10 million and sen elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on those with more than 50 million in assets the former starbucks ceo has characterized his potential presidential run as appealing to a moderate silent majority of voters disaffected with both political parties whom he sees as veering to the left and the right leaving open the center others say that silent majority does not exist schultz has embraced social liberalism on a number of issues including promoting diversity in corporate culture and lgbt rights while also rejecting democratic plans such as medicare for all and the republican tax law of 2017 as prohibitively expensive on immigration schultz has said he opposes trump s proposed wall along the u s mexico border and believes in protecting the 800 000 immigrants brought to this country as children known as dreamers advertisement we re living at a most fragile time schultz said sunday on cbs s 60 minutes not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what s necessary on behalf of the american people and are engaged every single day in revenge politics here are some of the policies that schultz has promoted that he may believe can power him to the white house the debt is the greatest threat to america the federal government s debt burden has ballooned to 21 trillion with debt as a share of the overall u s economy expected to rise to 105 percent by the end of 2029 according to a report published monday by the congressional budget office annual federal deficits are nearing 1 trillion or around 4 percent of the total economy the cbo said that s a historically high number given that deficits typically fall in periods of low unemployment and economic growth which the united states is currently experiencing advertisement schultz has said he would make reducing the deficit one of his top priorities as president calling it the greatest threat domestically to the country hanging over the cloud of america and future generations budget hawks have applauded schultz s stance on the government s red ink with some saying that both parties have abandoned fiscal discipline republicans talk about deficit reduction and worsen the red ink and democrats are competing with each other for who can add the worst debt said brian riedl a budget expert at the manhattan institute a right leaning think tank it s nice to have somebody in the race talking about making difficult decisions to keep the country from going bankrupt but many liberals reject the notion that the deficit poses an imminent danger to the nation as economists point out that both interest rates and the current risk of inflation remain low advertisement environmental activists have in particular scoffed at the notion that the debt rather than climate change is the biggest threat to america one of the greatest problems facing america an oligarchy that has little incentive to actually solve the crises of skyrocketing inequality structural racism and the climate change said waleed shahid communications director at justice democrats a left wing group share this article share a poll from the pew research center found just 48 percent of americans believe the deficit should be a top priority for the president and congress with the economy health care and terrorism leading the pack instead he opposes proposed higher taxes on the wealthy despite his calls to reduce the deficit schultz has blasted as unrealistic plans by ocasio cortez d n y and warren d mass to raise trillions in tax revenue from the wealthy to pay for federal programs like health care infrastructure and education advertisement i m not considering this to win the twitter primary schultz told axios in explaining his opposition to the liberal firebrands plans i believe that lifelong democrats and lifelong republicans are looking for a home and they re not spending hours and hours on twitter two left leaning economists found that warren s wealth tax would raise close to 3 trillion over 10 years while ocasio cortez s could raise close to 1 trillion schultz would personally pay an additional 91 million in taxes under warren s wealth tax according to a calculation based on forbes ranking of the richest americans his wealth still would have grown by about 25 percent under warren s tax from 2017 to 2018 ernie tedeschi a former economist in the obama administration said on twitter conservatives have attacked both plans as likely to discourage entrepreneurial risk taking and private enterprise america has had marginal tax rates well over 70 percent for much of the 20th century while several european countries such as switzerland have wealth taxes advertisement medicare and social security schultz has called for reducing the federal debt by targeting entitlement programs but he s been vague about the details the two biggest entitlements are social security and medicare we have to go after entitlements schultz has said it s not about redistribution it s about facing these hard truths and dealing with significant problems schultz s aides did not respond to questions to identify how much the former starbucks ceo would want to cut medicare or social security social security keeps 22 million americans out of poverty including 1 1 million children with an average benefit of 18 000 said alex lawson executive director of social security works an organization that supports the program lawson pointed to federal statistics showing social security is expected to remain flat as a percentage of gross domestic product through 2090 advertisement there s been a notorious and outrageous propaganda campaign waged by billionaires who see 2 9 trillion sitting in trust for u s workers lawson said schultz can t stand that wall street can t get their greedy little hands on that pot he opposes medicare for all plans schultz has also attacked democratic politicians who have embraced medicare for all a proposal to nationalize the health insurance industry medicare for all would move every american to a single government run insurer that charges no deductibles or premiums doing so would significantly increase government expenditures by as much as 33 trillion over a 10 year period according to one conservative think tank s estimate it would offer health insurance to the americans who lack it and prevent millions more from being forced into medical bankruptcy advertisement such a plan would require enormous tax increases to finance although supporters maintain that they would be offset by zeroing out every family s spending on premiums and deductibles supporters also say medicare for all would lower overall health care spending in america even though government spending on health care would increase that s not correct that s not american schultz said when asked about sen kamala d harris s d calif embrace of the plan what s next what industry are we going to abolish next the coffee industry
washington beijing afp the next round of united states china trade talks will resume on wednesday jan 30 and thursday in washington to try to find a way out of the tariff battle between the two powers here is a look at all the negotiators representing presidents xi jinping and donald trump liu he china s economic pilot mr liu he 67 leads the chinese negotiating team an influential economic adviser to beijing since president xi came to power mr liu emerged from the shadows last february when he was sent to washington to try to avert the trade war with president trump he then was appointed to the post of vice premier in march responsible for steering chinese economic policy his profile contrasts with the usual resume of a top chinese official he is an economist who graduated from the prestigious us university harvard seen as pragmatic mr liu is considered the leader of the recent movement towards rebalancing the chinese economy to rely on domestic consumption services and technological innovation for growth rather than exports yi gang reformist central banker mr yi gang 60 governor of the people s bank of china pboc is a prominent member of the delegation mr yi who speaks english fluently spent 15 years in the us where he earned a phd in economics from the university of illinois and then taught at a us college he joined the chinese central bank in 1997 and became deputy governor in 2008 before taking the top leadership role last year a post under tight government control associated in recent years with the gradual liberalisation of lending rates and the easing of the tight yuan exchange rate mr yi is distinguished by his statements very favourable to the free market even defending increased openness to foreign investors robert lighthizer mr trump s trade adviser us trade representative robert lighthizer 71 is leading the american negotiating team taking over from commerce secretary wilbur ross and treasury secretary steven mnuchin who did not deliver on a breakthrough mr lighthizer stays out of the limelight but shares president trump s mistrust of china and believes it poses a threat to us economic power and he has emerged as the us strongman in the ongoing trade negotiations determined to force changes in beijing s economic policies he led the contentious talks to revamp the north american free trade agreement nafta between the us canada and mexico now dubbed the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca his goal in the talks is to force the asian giant to put an end to trade policies the us deems unfair especially the theft or forced transfer of american technology obliging us firms to form joint ventures with local partners and state subsidies for industry prior to being named us trade representative in may 2017 mr lighthizer was a specialist in international trade law for more than 30 years and is a veteran of trade negotiations with japan in the 1980s peter navarro hardline anti china voice mr peter navarro 69 a harvard trained economist has long railed against the threat from beijing he has advised mr trump since his upstart presidential campaign after he gained mr trump s attention with his 2011 book death by china painting the country as a serial trade cheater subsidising export oriented industries and manipulating its currency he pushed mr trump to renegotiate nafta and vigorously defended the punitive tariffs imposed on us imports of steel and aluminium a protectionist measure that prompted the departure of mr trump s former chief economic adviser mr gary cohn who was more pragmatic than dogmatic and highly respected by financial markets at the end of 2016 mr trump appointed mr navarro as head of the newly created white house national trade council however his outspoken comments in previous meetings and reports that he sparred with other us officials caused him to be left on the sidelines of some talks steven mnuchin more moderate in the spring of 2018 us treasury secretary steven mnuchin led the us delegation sent to beijing to advance trade negotiations but with little success his influence in the talks seems to have decreased significantly since then seen as counter balancing mr navarro s hardline stance this 56 year old former goldman sachs executive supports free trade and offers a more moderate voice on china he said on tuesday that he expected significant progress at this week s talks
introduction ohio s general assembly creates laws and funds the government to carry them out resources are appropriated through the state budget which reflects the general assembly s legislative priorities state legislators will debate the 2020 21 operating budget in the first half of the coming year and sign it into law by july 1 2019 this chartbook reviews the basics of the ohio budget and looks at funding trends over time budget analysis generally focuses on the general revenue fund grf which funds government operations and public services ohio s major taxes such as the sales and income tax fund the majority of the grf but since 2005 when the corporate profits tax was phased out and deep income tax cuts initiated among other changes tax revenues have fallen as a share of the economy despite economic growth today the state brings in 6 billion less in annual tax revenues than it would have before the 2005 tax overhaul and all of the tax cuts since that time as revenue growth has been constrained so has funding of public services there are growing gaps between need and funding in education human services public transit and local government dependence on federal revenues has grown presenting dangers as congress considers slashing federal programs following deep federal tax cuts in 2017 many programs in the current budget bill house bill 49 for state fiscal years fy 2018 19 were cut as revenue projections dropped during the budget discussions but revenues have improved in july 2018 ohio transferred another 657 5 million to the rainy day fund so it now has 2 7 billion near the maximum officials predicted in july that there would be another 368 million in addition to what is in the current budget there s more money available but not nearly enough for all of the investments ohio needs the backdrop ohio s economy as 2019 starts the nation is in the tenth year of economic recovery and ohio s economy is beginning to strengthen after many years of weak growth compared to the nation 2018 was a year of strong job growth but not in all communities there are 115 000 more ohioans living in poverty in 2017 than before the recession this is the consequence of policy choices instead of making investments to bring more people into the middle class the nation and the state have relied on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy income inequality has spiked between 1973 and 2015 86 percent of pre tax pre transfer income growth went to the wealthiest 1 percent the tax filers earning more than 99 percent of all ohioans many ohio jobs today have very low median wages of the 10 most common ohio occupations three pay less than the federal poverty line for a family of three nine pay less than twice that level and remain within the range at which people can and do access assistance from food banks poverty hurts the health and well being of ohioans ohio ranks 44th among states for the health and well being of our citizens and 47th for how the health of our lower income residents compares to higher income residents public policy can make a difference for example education matters people with college degrees have seen wages rise over time but those without have seen wages fall the state has a goal of boosting the share of working age ohioans with a post secondary degree or certificate but to reach this goal lawmakers must remove financial barriers by investing to lower tuition and restore need based financial aid to pre recession levels it will take meaningful investment to rebuild eroded programs in this report we track trends in state investment in public services ohioans need and conclude with recommendations to broaden opportunity for ohio and ohioans state budget overview the budget process begins with the governor in the winter governor dewine just began his term so the march 15th deadline to deliver the executive budget proposal to the house of representatives is later than usual the house will turn it into legislation introduce it as a bill and refer sections to committees to review the committees will invite the public to testify after the house passes the bill a senator will introduce it in the senate which will repeat the process and pass its own bill representatives from both houses will then meet in conference committee to reconcile differences between the bills so they can be passed as identical bills the governor must then sign it before midnight on june 30th so it can go into effect by the beginning of the fiscal year on july 1st ohio s current two year operating budget totaled 64 2 billion in fiscal year fy 2018 and is estimated to total 67 9 billion in fy 2019 132 1 billion in for both years the all funds budget is made up of four primary funds figure 1 the general revenue fund grf makes up 41 percent of the state budget it includes some federal revenues as well as state taxpayer dollars excluding the federal funds state grf dollars make up 34 percent of the total all funds budget federal funds including those in the grf make up 37 percent of the budget and are the biggest single source of funds in the state budget special purpose taxes and fees make up 18 percent of ohio s budget these funds are raised from specific sources and dedicated to specific uses like the money from hunting or fishing licenses which is used to stock ponds and maintain shooting ranges fiduciary or pass through funds make up 11 percent of the state budget these funds are collected by the state but distributed to other entities for example the state collects all sales taxes and distributes funds back to counties and transit agencies that levy a local sales tax on the state sales tax base paying for government tax revenues ohio s biggest revenue source is the sales tax followed by the state personal income tax then business and other smaller tax sources figure 2 shows the changing profile of ohio s revenue system since 2006 following a major overhaul of the state tax system today the sales tax the blue bar has replaced the personal income tax green bar as the largest source of funding for state government the growth in the business taxes red bar in 2018 compared to 2010 does not reflect a tax hike or growth in collections but a change in use these funds were redirected from revenue sharing with local governments and back into the state s coffers ohio s overall state and local tax levels are slightly below the national average in 2016 ohio was 27th among the states and the district of columbia in state and local tax revenues per capita 472 less than the national average of 4 946 and 31st with state and local tax revenues as a share of personal income at 9 1 percent the national average is 9 9 percent in 2005 policymakers abolished the corporate income tax and the business tangible personal property tax and replaced them with a tax on gross receipts that brings in half as much in total revenue they ended the estate tax which had been paid only on estates worth more than 338 333 but the biggest changes were to the personal income tax policymakers cut income tax rates by a third since 2005 in 2013 they created a state level deduction for income from limited liability companies and other businesses known as passthrough entities and then expanded it to include a tax cut for such income over 250 000 it is now costing ohio more than 1 billion a year based on current tax rates state resources in the grf including local government funds and lottery profit transfers have declined in value since 2006 figure 3 shows that state grf dollars are 2 65 billion lower in 2018 than in 2006 a decline of 9 6 percent when adjusted for inflation figure 3 also shows that the share of ohio s gross domestic product made up of state revenues in the grf declined by 18 3 percent between 2006 and 2018 figure 3 as ohio s economy has grown resources that should be available to provide excellent schools safe and well maintained parks and beaches drug treatment and other critical services have instead fallen due to deepening cuts to the personal income tax elimination of business taxes and rapid expansion of tax breaks and loopholes changes in ohio s tax structure benefitted the most affluent had little impact on those in the middle and left the poorest paying more although proponents claimed they would kickstart the economy since the 2005 cuts ohio s job growth and median wages have in most years trailed the nation s policy matters worked with the institute on taxation and economic policy itep to understand the impact of tax cuts since the 2005 cuts by 2018 the state received 6 billion a year less in state revenues than it would have before the cuts these revenues could have been used to strengthen schools reduce public college tuition fund public transit and more figure 4 shows how changes to ohio s personal income tax structure increased taxes for people at the bottom of the income scale but reduced them dramatically for the top 1 percent of tax filers the state income tax bill on the wealthiest 1 percent of ohioans has fallen on average by more than 40 000 a year for this tiny group of affluent tax filers this enormous saving was doubled by the 2017 federal tax cut which gives the same group another 40 000 in federal tax cuts in calendar year 2018 ohio s state and local tax system ranks 13thamong the states in unfairness according to an itep analysis figure 5 shows that the wealthiest pay only about half of what the poorest pay in share of income devoted to state and local taxes the 20 percent of ohioans earning the least pay an average of 12 3 percent of their income in state and local taxes primarily sales and property taxes while the one percent of ohioans earning the most pay just 6 5 percent nearly half of what the most affluent pay is in the state personal income tax the only tax provision that offsets the unfairness in the ohio state and local tax structure the ohio tax code is upside down with the lowest income families paying the highest share of their income in state and local taxes this contributes to structural racism in our tax system with more black and latinx families paying higher shares of income in state and local taxes compared to white families ohio s income tax unlike other major taxes is graduated it has seven brackets each incrementally higher than the former so the highest rate 4 997 percent is applied only to income greater than 217 400 in 2018 the top rate has been reduced from 7 5 percent enacted under governor voinovich in the 1990s when job growth was strong in a tax break known as the llc loophole the general assembly also reduced taxes on business income from what are known as passthrough entities which include limited liability companies sole proprietorships and s corporations among others profits from this type of organization are taxed under the individual income tax as they pass through to their owners today owners of these entities do not have to pay ohio income tax on the first 250 000 in passthrough income and only pay a 3 percent tax rate on such income over and above that a rate lower than the 4 997 percent top income tax rate in ohio as a result the llc loophole drains more than 1 billion annually from state revenues based on current rates this tax break was touted as a tool to spur creation of new firms and jobs but it has failed even as it costs the state dearly the vast majority of those receiving the break save less than 1 000 a year nowhere near enough to hire a new employee unfairness in a state and local tax structure can be offset by a well designed state earned income tax credit eitc also known as the working family tax credit this tax credit is a powerful anti poverty program in 2016 it lifted 265 000 ohioans out of poverty refundable eitcs reward work improve health education and employment outcomes throughout life balance tax inequality and boost local economies ohio like most states has a state eitc pegged to the federal credit yet ohio s eitc remains one of the weakest in the nation due to design flaws that prevent it from helping most low income working families ohio s credit is nonrefundable has an income cap and is smaller than the average credit offered by other states refundability which is used in business tax credits allows tax filers to receive the difference of their credit and taxes owed the income cap is restrictive the credit does not even fully eliminate state income tax liability for many eligible families who earn over 20 000 a year the average state eitc is set at about 27 of the federal tax credit more than twice that of ohio s 10 percent credit table 1 shows that ohio s credits helps few of the state s poorest workers spending through the tax code tax breaks and loopholes ohio spends billions of dollars through the tax code on tax expenditures also known as tax breaks or tax loopholes figure 6 such expenditures have soared well above inflation in recent years tax breaks are estimated by the ohio department of taxation as revenues foregone by lawmakers if not for the special breaks granted by the general assembly the state would collect revenues on these in the 2018 19 budget there were 129 tax expenditures listed in the state tax expenditure report which is part of the executive budget the state foregoes more than 9 billion a year in tax breaks more than state grf dollars spent on medicaid more than what the state sends to the school districts ohio s tax expenditures have grown by 1 4 billion since 2012 an increase of 18 5 percent adjusted for inflation tax expenditures unlike budget expenditures are not carefully reviewed by legislators for efficiency and effectiveness in 2016 the legislature unanimously embraced legislation to review tax breaks but the first round of reviews was weak three brief hearings were held on 5 5 billion dollars in annual state and local tax breaks staff analysis was so limited that the original purpose of some of the tax breaks was not known and no testimony was provided by proponents on more than half of the items four of the six lawmakers on the tax expenditure review committee terc criticized the process but in the end the majority of lawmakers voted in favor of simply continuing all 5 5 billion in tax breaks without modification and further scrutiny or review the committee did recommend that the general assembly consider hiring staff to aid in the next phase of the review a recommendation that should be approved in the upcoming budget state government investments as tax breaks and cuts have drained ohio s coffers our ability to invest in people families and communities has declined figure 8 shows the trendlines in ohio s state source grf spending adjusted for inflation the red line shows state source grf expenditures adjusted for inflation fell by 2 2 billion in 2018 compared to 2006 a decline of 8 4 percent ohio includes some federal dollars in the grf about 10 billion in medicaid dollars the green line in figure 6 shows grf expenditures including federal funds adjusted for inflation total grf expenditures including federal funds rose by 730 million 2 3 percent the black line in figure 7 shows the level of the all funds budget including grf federal funds special purpose funds and fiduciary passthrough funds adjusted for inflation the all funds budget rose by 4 billion between 2006 and 2018 an increase of 6 5 percent figure 8 shows how state dollars are allocated among major categories in the grf two views are presented one shows allocation of state dollars alone in the grf and the other includes all funds including the federal medicaid dollars ohio places in the grf state funded investments total 24 1 billion in 2018 and 25 billion in 2019 these figures are not adjusted for inflation in terms of state source funds k 12 education and higher education are the biggest share making up 54 percent of total state source spending when federal funds are included the grf totals 31 7 billion in 2018 and 33 3 billion in 2019 with federal funding shown medicaid stands out as the largest single category making up 44 percent of state and federal grf investments a statutory limit on state spending from the general revenue fund grf known as the state appropriation limitation sal limits the growth of most grf appropriations to 3 5 percent or the sum of the inflation rate plus rate of population change combination rate whichever is greater since 2006 executive budget proposals have been hundreds of millions of dollars below the sal or in some cases well over a billion dollars below major categories of investment and selected programs within those categories are reviewed below education education is the largest investment in ohio s general revenue fund primary and secondary education funding make up 43 9 percent of the grf early education public preschool is largely funded out of the department of education as well higher education makes up another 10 5 percent together they comprise 54 4 percent of ohio s grf primary and secondary education total state source grf funding for primary and secondary education grew by 316 4 million 3 1 percent between 2006 and 2018 adjusted for inflation this does not include federal stimulus dollars used in the grf for education during the recession but it does include money from the lottery profits education fund lpef which grew by about the same amount 316 1 million adjusted for inflation between 2006 and 2018 figure 9 shows a different view the trend in state grf funds for k 12 education that were distributed to the 612 public school districts this trendline includes state monies but also federal stimulus funds and tax replacements promised by the state to schools when local business property taxes were eliminated over a decade ago from this perspective 2018 funding for ohio s public school districts adjusted for inflation is just about flat when compared with 2006 and has fallen by over a half billion dollars from a high in 2010 over time policymakers restored the deep 2012 13 cut but not equally in all places in the first year of the current budget for example it was projected that in 2018 258 school districts would see a funding increase 203 would have no change and 149 would get less funding patterns in 2019 were projected to look about the same but with more districts staying flat problems of unequal funding in poorer areas remain even after years of court battles the largest source of funding for ohio s schools is local property tax dollars not included in figure 9 because of wide variation in property value among communities the way schools are funded does not meet ohio constitutional standards for uniform educational opportunity for students the outcome of overreliance on unequal local resources is on average unequal achievement with implications for lifetime opportunity an analysis of the performance index score on ohio s 2018 school district report cards found students in districts with the highest property value per pupil scored 33 percent higher on the performance index on average than districts with the lowest property value per pupil the state has known about the problem for a long time but has not corrected it despite a long running court case dating back to the 1990s since 1999 increase in state and local revenues in the poorest quintile of 604 public school districts studied by the ohio education policy institute is only slightly higher than in ohio s wealthiest school districts urban districts lose resources to charter schools some of which perform very poorly charter schools are often run by for profit enterprises but funded by state revenues sent to the public school district where they are located they are concentrated in cities ohio allocated 935 5 million to charter schools in 2018 and 937 million in 2017 just over 11 percent of total funding for school districts in those years charters served just 6 65 percent of ohio students in school year 2016 17 early education research has shown that children with early education learn to read better are more likely to graduate from high school make more money and achieve a higher standard of living and well being ohio is among the bottom half of states in terms of state investment in public pre school but has boosted funding in recent years children of families earning less than double the poverty line are eligible for public pre school slots this eligibility is the same level at which families can get help and need help from ohio s food banks in ohio 41 percent of children under 18 two out of five children live in families at this income level figure 10 shows ohio doubled funding for public pre school yet ohio s public preschool programming reaches a tiny share of eligible children in 2013 just 4 817 ohio 3 and 4 year olds two percent of those eligible attended state supported public pre school and ohio ranked 39thamong the 50 states and the district of columbia for number of kids in public pre school by 2017 there were 15 942 ohio children or 5 7 percent and state ranking rose to 32nd an improvement but far below the national average of 19 percent in addition to state funded pre school there are federally funded preschool services for special education and the federal head start program in 2017 13 1 percent of income eligible 3 year olds in ohio compared to 16 1 percent nationally and 26 3 percent of income eligible 4 year olds compared to 43 8 percent nationally were enrolled in one of ohio s state and or federally funded public pre school options including special education and head start higher education lawmakers boosted investment in higher education before the recession cut it during the recession and never restored funding state support for the ohio department of higher education has fallen by a half billion dollars 16 8 percent in the grf adjusted for inflation since 2006 figure 11 shows that while lawmakers were committed to making college affordable in 2009 they cut need based financial aid sharply during the recession and never restored it to previous levels education makes a significant difference in earnings inflation adjusted median wages fell from 15 64 in 1979 to just 10 35 an hour in 2017 for ohioans who haven t finished high school and wages fell from 16 00 to 15 02 over the same time period for those with just a high school diploma but for those with at least a college degree median wages rose from 21 38 to 26 30 ohio ranks 25th among states in high school graduation 37th among states in bachelor s degree attainment and 30th among states in postgraduate education ohio has made some progress in boosting college graduation in 2011 31 8 percent of ohioans over 25 had a degree a share that rose by 4 9 percent to 36 7 in 2017 compared to 40 5 percent nationally lawmakers set a college degree attainment goal of 65 percent of working age ohioans by 2025 that requires more state support for higher education the high cost of ohio s public universities and community colleges is holding the state back ohio ranks 45th least affordable state for college in terms of net expenses as a share of family income collectively ohioans owe 57 billion in student debt the state has one of the highest rates of student debt per capita in the nation to reduce the cost of higher education policymakers should boost investment in the state s share of instruction ssi which supports direct classroom education ssi has fallen by almost 2 percent adjusted for inflation since 2006 more ohioans need help paying for college and lawmakers should restore cuts to ohio s need based financial aid program policymakers should also begin to move toward free community college health and human services the second largest set of expenditures in the ohio grf budget are for health and human services accounting for 25 3 percent of state source expenditures in the grf budget figure 12 medicaid accounts for 17 7 percent of grf state source expenditures in 2018 and health and human services 8 6 percent medicaid ohio has a great network of world class hospitals and outstanding children s hospitals but poor health outcomes the health policy institute of ohio ranks ohio 46th among the states in health value concluding ohioans are living less healthy lives and we spend more on health care than people in most other states much of this has to do with barriers to health associated with poverty toxic stress from economic instability lack of access to healthy foods and green space unsafe neighborhood conditions substandard housing and more with so many structural barriers keeping ohioans unhealthy access to health care is especially important it also means a need for greater access to public health and human service programs designed to promote economic stability and targeted investments in areas of concentrated poverty to reduce health damaging neighborhood conditions medicaid ohio s largest insurer provides health insurance to ohioans who live in or near poverty across all programs it covers about 3 million a quarter of all residents ohio is among the states with the highest share of insured residents 94 percent in part because of medicaid expansion which covers working ohioans who make low wages the budget appropriates 27 07 billion in fy 2018 across all funds state tax dollars special purpose funds and federal funds of that 14 82 billion are in the grf most of that is federal money the state share is 5 09 billion approximately 63 percent of this spending will be reimbursed by the federal government which reimburses more than 90 percent of funding for medicaid expansion figure 12 shows that the trendline in state share of medicaid in the grf has been flat over time adjusted for the overall rate of inflation not medical inflation which is much higher federal funding rose on an inflation adjusted basis with the medicaid expansion in 2014 medicaid expansion funds the largest share of medication assisted treatment for substance abuse disorders in ohio the most effective and cost effective treatment ohio has the second highest drug overdose death rate in the nation some state lawmakers want to eliminate medicaid expansion although it brings more than 4 billion in federal funds into the ohio economy supporting health employment and jobs in every county others including governor elect mike dewine want new eligibility requirements that mandate a set number of hours per week of work or community engagement census data shows 95 percent of all working age enrollees in medicaid already work are disabled or are otherwise fully engaged as caregivers for children or disabled people similar requirements in other programs and in other states show they reduce access to health care because of uncertain scheduling in low wage work lack of sick leave and administrative difficulty of proving many kinds of disabilities the mandates will not eliminate medicaid expansion but will greatly reduce it ohio has privatized much of medicaid today 89 percent of medicaid services are provided through private managed care organizations compared to 30 percent nine years ago according to the governor s office of health transformation the privatized system has been criticized for lack of transparency in the administration of drug purchasing and pricing enriching for profit companies at the expense of taxpayers as a result this year ohio medicaid is implementing tighter fiscal oversight and control of these enormous contracts other health and human services on an inflation adjusted basis spending on health and human services other than medicaid declined in the grf by 270 million since 2006 when republican governor taft was in power a drop of 12 9 percent figure 13 health and human services are often thought of as safety net programs but they go way beyond that providing job training and work supports like public childcare services for seniors protective services for children and the elderly and other programs that help many ohioans human services excluding the medicaid line items in the grf make up 8 6 percent state source grf expenditures many important programs addressing pressing needs of residents are provided by six sister agencies in addition to the ohio department of medicaid examined below the ohio department of aging administers state and federally funded programs that serve seniors there is little non medicaid spending in the general revenue fund for the ohio department of aging funding in some programs for seniors has dropped sharply the senior community services line is a good example of this state dollars for this program draw down federal funds to support older people living in their own homes including home meals and congregate group meals state grf funding dropped by 5 8 million in 2018 compared with 2006 adjusted for inflation a 45 percent decline figure 14 funding for the alzheimer s respite program also dropped by 2 5 million over the same time period a decline of 51 percent these cuts occurred even as the state has focused on helping elderly people stay in their own homes in the community as they get older where they and their families need help like with home delivered meals or alzheimer s respite state and federal dollars fund adult protective services which protects seniors from physical emotional or financial abuse as well as neglect and self neglect it is funded through the ohio department of job and family services and counties provide the service during the past five years the state provided millions of dollars in one time funds to improve the system and boosted ongoing funding for county operations this was a step in the right direction but even so funding has been inadequate while more than 20 000 people were helped under the program in 2018 an estimated 105 000 to over 200 000 elderly ohioans are abused many professionals are newly required to report suspected financial exploitation of seniors this will expand the need for investigations lawmakers designated fines on perpetrators to cover the expense but such fines will not expand services as much as is needed policy matters ohio found the service is underfunded by about 20 million the ohio department of developmental disabilities administers services for people who are developmentally disabled and opportunities for ohioans with disabilities ood the former rehabilitation services commission administer services for people who are ill or physically disabled and served by social security disability insurance medicaid funding has been substantially increased for the department of developmental disabilities rising by 131 million not adjusted for inflation in the grf of the current budget compared to the prior budget period but non medicaid state source grf funding fell by 20 7 million again not adjusted for inflation over the same period figure 15 shows that over time and adjusted for inflation state source grf funding has fallen by 78 6 a decline of 50 percent figure 15 shows that state grf funding for opportunities for ohioans with disabilities has also been reduced by 14 6 million in grf funding also cut almost in half since 2006 figure 15 reduction in funding to county developmental disability boards accounted for almost half of the decline in grf funding to the ohio department of developmental disabilities some of this is budget re arrangement some dollars have been absorbed into medicaid lines the most harmful cuts to county boards of developmental disabilities came through loss of tax reimbursements these had been promised to make up for lost local tax revenues due to state elimination of a local business property tax but were mostly phased out in the 2012 14 budget county developmental disability levies lost an estimated 60 million a year state source grf funding for opportunities for ohioans with disabilities ood has also declined in addition ohio lawmakers eliminated disability financial assistance a program operated by the ohio department of job and family services to support very poor people waiting for a determination for social security disability insurance the average wait can be up to 20 months in ohio so to someone unable to work because of illness or disability this small program was a lifeline the ohio department of health collects data on births deaths infant mortality and other public health statistics and oversees programming laboratory services water and sewer and other programs affecting public health state grf funding for this agency has declined by 24 million adjusted for inflation since 2006 a decline of 26 5 percent figure 16 the ohio department of job and family services administers temporary assistance for needy families tanf programs including cash assistance and public childcare protective services for children and elderly people programs that support foster care kinship care and adoption child support workforce training services unemployment compensation and other programs the federal tanf program funds what is thought of as basic welfare or cash assistance programs in 2016 and on a national basis only 23 of every 100 eligible families received tanf cash assistance when tanf was created in 1996 68 families received cash assistance for every 100 in poverty in 2018 ohio s 836 4 million federal tanf block grant was matched with 464 1 million in state dollars for a program total of 1 3 billion dollars 1 percent of the all funds budget and 1 8 percent of the state source grf figure 17 shows how tanf dollars are used in the state spending plan for 2018 19 the largest share of tanf funding supports the public childcare program more than a third of tanf dollars 36 percent fund public childcare the next largest category of funding is for administration of ohio s county based human services infrastructure like in nine other states health and human services in ohio are delivered through a county system not by state employees actual cash assistance for the neediest which is the basic purpose of the funding accounts for just 1 of every 5 spent by the agency ohio s cash assistance program ohio works first provides aid to families with children earning no more than 50 percent of the federal poverty level those in deep poverty it also supports children who are not living with their own parents but with foster families or in the child protective system figure 18 shows that while poverty rose during the recession and did not drop to pre recession levels the number of people in poverty who are helped by ohio works first has dropped sharply the red line shows people living in poverty percentage on right number on left vertical axes while the blue and green bars show the adults and children receiving assistance work requirements in the tanf program contributed to the sharp decline in aid to adults in addition ohio restricts federally funded cash assistance to 36 months although the federal funds can be given for up to 60 months as a result many who need help the most do not get it estimates say 191 000 ohioans live on 2 00 a day or less a level of deep poverty applied in the evaluation of underdeveloped nations despite the high need over the years ohio has built up an estimated half a billion dollars in unspent tanf funds tanf money plays an important role in funding for public childcare between tanf and the child care and development block grant most funding to subsidize the cost of child care for low income working parents is federal figure 19 shows that increased funding was appropriated for public child care assistance during the recession but dropped by 83 million adjusted for inflation 10 3 percent between 2011 and 2018 eligibility for the program has dropped to be accepted into the program today a family of family of three can make no more than 27 024 this is lower than in 49 other states state payments to providers in the public child care program are set at a low percentage of market rate as a result quality can suffer as required by the federal child care and development block grant the state implemented a program called step up to quality providers can boost their reimbursement rates by implementing quality improvements and becoming certified under the program however not enough providers are enrolling in the program to meet legislative requirements without initial increase in base pay some providers struggle to afford improvements required to qualify for step up to quality policymakers have to make a significant investment to expand access and improve quality in public childcare many working parents can t take advantage of the half day pre school enrichment programming legislators should restore the eligibility level to match that of public pre school 200 percent of poverty the department of mental health and addiction services is at the center of the response to ohio s addiction epidemic that claimed 5 111 lives in 2017 ohio had the second highest drug related death rate among the states that year as this report went to press in late january the columbus dispatch reported that a provisional count found a 20 percent decline in drug deaths in ohio from july 2017 to june 2018 the biggest decline in the nation legislators have increased funding to address the crisis and progress has been made but addiction continues to be a difficult and persistent problem funding for services related to the drug epidemic includes federal state and local money and straddles many agencies medicaid ohio s largest single insurer provides half the funding to fight the drug epidemic the kasich administration estimated that of the 939 million in state dollars that addressed the addiction crisis in 2016 650 million 69 percent came from medicaid services the ohio department of mental health and addiction services also provides significant funding particularly for community based wrap around services other state agencies addressing the crisis include the ohio department of job and family services the attorney general s office public health public safety and more local governments contribute as well 76 of ohio s 88 counties have a property tax levy that helps fund mental health and addiction services figure 20 shows that grf funding dropped sharply but has rebounded between 2013 and 2018 by 74 8 million 22 9 percent adjusted for inflation at the same time medicaid expenditures for behavioral health have increased the expansion of medicaid has allowed far more people to get treatment and is at the heart of efforts to stem the drug epidemic on the other hand funding for community mental health and addiction services has been cut by the state s elimination of business personal property taxes and the promised tax reimbursements this took scores of millions of dollars on an annual basis from community mental health levies the drug crisis requires help from various public services coroners offices are swamped children s services are overwhelmed as parents become addicted and children are neglected although half of ohio s counties have local children s service levies these local funds also were hard hit by the loss of tax reimbursements and lost an estimated 39 1 million between 2010 and 2013 in the very tight 2018 2019 budget lawmakers pulled together nearly 200 million to address the range of services strained by the drug crisis figure 21 money was siphoned from existing programs millions of dollars were taken from revenue sharing with cash strapped cities which are on the front lines of the epidemic of the roughly 3 million medicaid clients in ohio 26 percent have been diagnosed with a mental health or substance abuse condition the state privatized medicaid contracting most care to five managed care organizations over the past year behavioral health has been placed under the managed care umbrella as well payments to providers are down by scores of millions of dollars as providers and managed care organizations adjust to the new billing system mental health care providers worry that changes in how medicaid claims are paid for could lead to limited programming options mental health personnel are being laid off even as the drug epidemic continues to claim lives throughout the state local government and public transportation local government ohio is a home rule state cities and villages are responsible for the health and safety of residents municipalities may adopt policies to meet their needs as long as they do not conflict with state law ohio s courts and health and human services are largely administered and funded by the state s 88 counties since the great depression ohio has provided flexible funding for local governments through revenue sharing to support different needs in different regions since 2006 counties cities townships and villages have lost 1 4 billion a year adjusted for inflation figure 22 governor kasich and state legislators began cutting funding in the 2012 13 budget they cut the primary revenue sharing program the local government fund lgf almost in half and redirected the lgf allocation for cities to other uses they phased out reimbursements for taxes that had been repealed and eliminated local tax sources important revenue sources for local governments maintenance of streets roads and bridges motor fuel and gasoline excise taxes have grown too slowly and have even fallen in some places the state has used the deep and ongoing cuts to local government to fill its own rainy day fund even as lawmakers gave new income tax cuts and greatly expanded tax breaks figure 22 illustrates the downward trend in local government funding across many funding sources including some that increased like casino revenues in addition to the losses shown in figure 21 the state cut revenues to counties and transit agencies by repealing the sales tax on medicaid managed care organizations mcos and replacing it within the base of the insurance tax the change did not cover the losses for local governments that levy a sales tax as a result of the state s narrowing of the sales tax base counties and transit agencies that piggyback a local tax on the state base lost a collective 207 million a year there were temporary transition funds in the current budget but no aid for 2019 and after problems in local government financing spill over into the safety and court systems while uniform financial information prevented an ohio supreme court task force from providing a definitive overview of public finance across the system the task force recommended a greater share of funding come from the state instead of splitting the cost with local governments the county commissioners association of ohio has focused on the need for the state to restore its earlier commitment to pay a larger share of the cost of indigent legal defense which has climbed steeply in the past 14 years this is part of a larger problem of underfunding of public defense in its 2017 annual report the ohio public defender s office stated public defense in ohio is estimated to be underfunded by over 35 million dollars annually the agency remains dramatically underfunded and understaffed given the number of clientele and the needs of the indigent defense system at risk is the most fundamental principle of our justice system fairness public transit the state woefully underfunds ohio s public transportation systems the ohio department of transportation estimated in 2015 that the state should be contributing 125 million to local public transit to meet market demand and replace obsolete equipment a sum that should rise to 185 million a year by 2025 lawmakers appropriate only about 38 million a year for bus and passenger rail services through the operating budget and the transportation budget in 2015 public transit across ohio failed to meet demand by 37 5 million rides for example an estimated 1 million people in rural ohio could be helped by expanding services to areas without public transportation governor kasich s task force to reduce reliance on public assistance identified lack of transportation as a leading barrier to employment cars are costly to own and operate and can be prohibitively expensive for low income households due to ohio s lack of investment in public transportation services over multiple decades too many struggle to get to work school and other places they need to go the state has reduced grf investment in local public transit by 45 6 million adjusted for inflation or about 71 2 percent from 2000 through 2018 figure 23 as state grf funding dropped flexible federal highway funds were used to backfill starting with stimulus dollars in the recession the eight transit agencies that levy a sales tax face a collective loss of 38 6 million a year starting in 2019 because of removal of the medicaid managed care organization tax mco tax from the state sales tax base the 2018 19 budget included transition funds which partially compensated for mco tax loss in 2018 and 2019 but there is no permanent solution in fact the funding loss faced by just these eight agencies matches the entire state appropriation through the transportation budget highway flex funds and the operating budget for local bus service in 2018 corrections funding for ohio s correctional system the department of youth services and the department of rehabilitation and correction combined has fallen by 195 3 million since 2006 in inflation adjusted dollars 9 14 percent figure 24 shrinking the state s prison system is a worthy goal efforts to reduce incarceration have been made through policies and initiatives including targeted community alternatives to prison the failed citizen s ballot initiative issue 1 and ongoing legislatives effort to preserve some of the most compelling aspects of issue 1 smarter criminal justice approaches can reduce costs but budgetary reductions must follow not precede population reductions of the 195 3 million reduction almost half 94 8 million adjusted for inflation came from the department of youth services a 31 3 percent drop in expenditures that reflects policy changes that increased community supervision and closed institutional facilities community supervision is a far better approach with young offenders and this reduction shows how smarter policy can improve outcomes and reduce costs a little over half 100 5 million adjusted for inflation came from the department of rehabilitation and correction odrc and reflects a 5 7 percent drop in grf funding since 2006 although recent budgets have increased spending on locally administered community corrections programs the problem of overcrowding has not been solved in 2008 ohio s prison system peaked with nearly 51 300 people incarcerated in 2017 despite a small decline the system was still at 132 percent capacity and housed around 49 000 inmates all other spending the rest of the spending in the state operating budget makes up 8 percent of the state funded services in the general revenue fund this includes operations of the ohio department of commerce the development services agency the department of agriculture the department of natural resources the ohio environmental protection agency the adjutant general and others many but not all of these departments rely heavily on fees and federal dollars it also includes funding for the general assembly the governor s office the attorney general the secretary of state the auditor and other statewide offices figure 25 shows that adjusted for inflation in 2018 ohio is spending 72 million less among all the agencies grouped in the all other services category than it was in 2006 adjusted for inflation a decline of 3 6 percent summary and conclusion over the last 14 years ohio lawmakers used state resources for income and corporate tax cuts and boosted spending on tax breaks for special interests as a result investment in important foundations for the economy and the future like higher education has fallen instead of increased to meet new needs in the modern workplace state funds sent to school districts and used for human services has either stagnated or fallen since 2006 thanks to cuts in revenue sharing with local governments the state simultaneously doled out big tax cuts for the wealthy while boosting the its own rainy day fund federal funds are increasingly used to backfill in services like increasing use of tanf funds for public child care for low wage workers a precarious position for many ohioans who rely upon them as congress keeps trying to dismantle federal health and human service programs aspirational goals for improvement in a number of areas have been set but without money for implementation the goal to nearly double the share of ohioans with a college degree is not backed by resources to get there lawmakers should restore need based financial aid so ohio s colleges and universities can lower tuition which remains out of reach for many especially for families of low and modest income lawmakers have passed new rules to protect elderly residents from financial exploitation through county adult protective service programs but have not dedicated the estimated 20 million it would take to fund those services at the scale needed in ohio they have added new funding for early education but only for a limited number of part day preschool slots moreover eligibility is not aligned with the public childcare program so many poor working families cannot use it funding sent to ohio s public school districts has not kept up with inflation with some communities suffering more than others ohio s major urban districts are especially harmed because poorly performing charter schools are by law concentrated in the cities charter schools are often run by private for profit management companies but funded by public dollars after years of tax cuts ohio s state and local revenue system is unfair families that earn the lowest wages pay an average 12 3 percent of their income in state and local taxes while the richest 1 percent who have benefitted the most from ohio s infrastructure workforce judicial system pay just 6 5 percent this also translates into racial inequity with more black and latinx families paying a higher share of their income in state and local taxes on average than other racial groups years of inadequate funding has made life harder for working people and their families ohio s biggest occupational groups retail janitorial food service leisure and hospitality leave a small family with income so low that they are eligible for and in need of public assistance yet state support for public assistance and work supports like public transit has fallen adjusted for inflation not because labor market conditions have improved but because lawmakers cut funding tax cut proponents said they d jumpstart the state s economy yet growth in ohio s employment base has been more sluggish than the nation in most years since the recession tax breaks cost the state more than 9 billion per year but have not resulted in good jobs and rising income the state s growing reliance on federal funds like medicaid is tenuous not only because of threats from congress but because ohio s legislators in the general assembly maneuver to downsize or eliminate the medicaid expansion which has brought jobs health coverage and expanded federal funding for needed services in ohio the challenge for the incoming administration will be rebuilding restoring and aligning public services after years of weak investment lawmakers can pay for the programs that build strong families and communities by restoring income tax cuts to the most affluent and closing tax loopholes this would also improve ohio s upside down state and local tax structure which takes a larger share of poor families earnings than of wealthy families it s time lawmakers focus on making ohio a place where we all can live healthy and happy lives find productive work and ensure a strong future for the next generation acknowledgements tags

source imgflip like many of you i m a passionate dividend growth investor and there s nothing i love more than a fat juicy yield but there is a huge difference between a yield trap unsafe dividend likely to be cut and a safe deep value high yield company worth buying with both hands thus my new deep value dividend growth portfolio or dvdgp beating the market by 9 4 since inception is 100 focused on quality low risk dividend growth stocks bought opportunistically typically when the market hates them most the goal is to only buy well run companies with strong cash flows sound balance sheets and good long term growth prospects that will deliver safe and rising income in all economic industry and interest rate conditions one of the most hated industries right now is tobacco which has traditionally been beloved by high yield investors for its low volatility recession resistant cash flow and great track record of outperformance despite the industry s numerous risks over the decades i ve received several requests from readers to compare british american tobacco nyse bti and philip morris international nyse pm both dvdgp holdings that we ve been aggressively buying in recent weeks pm bti and mo make up 8 of the portfolio data by ycharts that s thanks to both companies being in one of their most severe bear markets in history courtesy of rising fears that anti tobacco regulations could finally kill their core business models while owning tobacco giants isn t for everyone due to risk tolerances and moral issues for some let s see how these high yield tobacco giants compare to see which one is the better company to own as well as the better long term income growth investment today dividend track record winner philip morris on a technicality since tobacco stocks are primarily owned for their dividends let s start by comparing each company s respective payout track record philip morris dividend record source simply safe dividends under the current s p rules which were not yet in effect during the pm mo spinoff in 2008 philip morris is actually a dividend aristocrat despite raising its dividend for 10 straight years it might not officially make that list or etfs that track that index for 15 more years but needless to say pm s management is dedicated to steady and safe annual dividend hikes in comparison bti s dividend track record might appear far weaker at first british american dividend record source simply safe dividends but investors need to remember that in early 2018 the company switched to a quarterly dividend payout schedule with a long term target of a 65 adjusted eps payout ratio british american dividend record source simply safe dividends however even quarterly payments won t be as consistent as pm s because of currency fluctuations between the british pound and us dollar which dividends are paid in while bti can t match the dividend aristocrat like annual payout growth of philip morris investors can take heart in the fact that the overall long term track record 11 8 cagr dividend growth over the last 34 years remains excellent that dividend growth has been backed by steady adjusted eps and fcf growth and management plans to grow the dividend in line with its bottom line going forward source bti investor presentation thus both companies are solid long term dividend growth picks though pm takes the win in this category because as far as i m concerned it s a dividend aristocrat dividend safety philip morris but british american s payout is safer than it initially appears more important than a high and steadily growing yield is the safety of the payout here philip morris has the clear edge despite a much higher payout ratio company yield ttm fcf payout ratio simply safe dividend safety score out of 100 philip morris 6 1 83 68 safe british american 8 1 48 45 border line safe safe limit na 85 na click to enlarge source simply safe dividends how can that be and why is bti s dividend safety score so low according to simply safe dividend where i m an analyst covering about 200 companies per year well as far as the low safety score is concerned that is partially due to how ssd s algorithm works stressing long term steady payout growth due to british american s recent shift to quarterly payouts our system reads that as a dividend cut and a big one and thus dings bti for it in addition the quarterly usd payouts which result from currency effects which cancel out over the long term also negatively impacts british american compared to pm s super stable payouts however even if you factor out these technical issues the fact remains that pm s dividend is actually safer than bti s for one important reason debt company net debt ebitda interest coverage ratio s p credit rating average interest rate philip morris 2 3 11 9 a 1 8 british american 4 7 5 8 bbb 3 1 safe limit rule of thumb 3 0 8 0 na na click to enlarge source simply safe dividends fast graphs gurufocus bti has the highest leverage ratio of any global tobacco blue chip and the lowest interest coverage ratio that being said british american still enjoys a strong bbb credit rating though moody s has it as bbb equivalent and fitch has a negative outlook thus bti still enjoys an average interest rate that s less than half of its recovering return on invested capital more on this in a moment why is bti s debt so high because in 2017 it bought the remaining 58 of r j reynolds it didn t already own in a 86 billion valuation mega deal that cost it 49 4 billion mostly debt funded that was a strategic move in which it paid a fair 10 times ev ebitda to get back into the us market for the first time in 12 years it also made sense because in 2015 reynolds bought us menthol king lorillard owner of newport for 27 4 billion thanks to this mega deal british american s sales soared 58 over the past year but it s going to take a long time to pay down this debt with retained post dividend free cash flow the acquisition cost it several credit downgrades from rating agencies and management has committed to deleveraging aggressively over time thanks to the company s excellent free cash flow generation more in this in a moment management hopes to reduce leverage from 4 0 using adjusted ebitda in 2017 to 3 5 or less in 2019 and ultimately to a safe level of 3 0 source bti investor presentation the company s net debt is about 60 billion however management has a multi pronged plan for achieving its deleveraging goals part of that is ongoing cost cutting that should boost operating margins by 0 5 to 1 annually in the coming five years historical margin expansion 1 5 per year so they are being conservative driving that is strong cost cutting including 400 million in synergistic cost savings expected by 2020 from the reynolds acquisition which it is on track to achieve next the company s fcf adjusted eps conversion ratio has historically been 80 meaning that after dividends the company should have 15 of adjusted eps left over to pay down debt about 2 to 2 5 billion per year and with an average debt maturity of 9 2 years and no more than 14 maturing in any given year i m confident that bti s debt levels won t actually pose a risk to the dividend however it should be pointed out that this need to prioritize debt repayment means investors should expect slower dividend growth morningstar expects low to mid single digits for the foreseeable future but while both tobacco blue chips have safe dividends pm takes the win in this category as well thanks to its much stronger balance sheet company quality winner philip morris another important consideration when deciding whether or not to invest in a company is the quality of its management team corporate culture and business model a good proxy for this is a company s profitability including operating margin fcf margin what pays the dividend and return on invested capital or roic company operating margin fcf margin return on invested capital philip morris 39 23 53 british american 37 32 7 target quality tobacco company 25 20 15 click to enlarge source simply safe dividends in two out of these three key metrics pm has the clear edge though bti has strong results in all areas except for roic according to morningstar s philip gorham philip morris s economies of scale are slightly better than bti s with lower per pack operating costs 0 36 per pack for pm 0 41 per pack for bti that explains the slightly better operating margins though bti s cost cutting plan is expected to boost margins by 9 in the coming years and thus potentially give it the edge over pm but what about british american s low roic that s a proxy for long term capital allocation and the company s 7 trailing 12 month results are shockingly low for a tobacco company but again investors need to remember the reynolds acquisition which caused bti s debt levels and thus invested capital to greatly increase that caused roic to fall off a cliff but it s already starting to recover british america tobacco roic over time source simply safe dividends while true that bti s roic had been falling three straight years prior to the reynolds acquisition it was still high and should eventually return to 15 if management can deliver on its promised cost synergies which are so far going well but while bti s low roic may not be cause for concern it can t hold a candle to philip morris s far more stable track record of superior capital allocation philip morris roic over time source simply safe dividends so ultimately when it comes to quality i have to once more give the win to philp morris which i consider my top pick among all tobacco companies but british america is certainly not a poor company to invest in which is why i actively recommend both and own them in dvdgp in roughly equal amounts why is pm my favorite tobacco company that would be its superior risk profile risk profile winner philip morris no article comparing tobacco blue chips would be complete without a discussion of the white elephant in the room which would be the growing global anti tobacco sentiment and the risks that poses to future cash flow and dividend growth rates top global smoking rates source world health organization while smoking rates in the us have been declining for about 60 years from a high of 42 to just 14 today in other countries especially emerging markets in asia the middle east and africa smoking rates are still sky high while most countries don t have the same kind of class action laws that resulted in the 206 billion 46 state master settlement that us tobacco companies faced there are still plenty of regulatory risks global tobacco investors need to consider that includes ever higher tobacco taxes which consumed 63 of pm s 2017 revenue and 51 of bti s according to their last annual reports as well as geographical regulatory changes that can have a big impact on cigarette sales how do both company s sales break out by region here s philip morris s eu 35 asia 29 eastern europe middle east and africa 23 latin american and canada 13 and here s how british american compares asia pacific 22 western europe 21 us 21 eastern europe middle east and africa 20 americas 16 as you can see while both companies are globally diversified british american has a lot of us exposure which when combined with its big eu business could spell trouble for it in the years ahead that s for two main reasons first in the us the fda is planning to eventually regulate nicotine levels in cigarettes to reduce them to none addictive levels about 66 reduction what s more the fda has said it will eventually not for several years ban menthol cigarettes according to bti s management the fda is currently at step three of a nine step process that might require up to nine years to ban menthol in the us that potential regulation is following the eu s example of a 2016 menthol ban that will go into effect in may 2020 according to the wall street journal menthol focused newport accounts for about 33 of bti s us tobacco sales similarly menthol cigarettes are very popular in europe and as the world s global menthol king british american is most at risk of any tobacco giant thus the much lower valuation on top of the negative effects of regional menthol bans canada turkey and brazil are also planning or have passed such bans we can t forget that both companies face the standard regulatory risks including increasing restrictions on smoking in both public and private places regulations requiring plain and standardized packaging reduces brand and possibly pricing power product market restrictions black market cigarette sales higher taxes increase black market sales 456 billion cigarettes in 2017 between areas one way that both philip morris and british american plan to counter these rising regulatory risks is through reduced risk products or rrps that includes things like e cigarettes and heat not burn sticks like philip morris s iqos since 2008 philip morris has invested over 4 billion into rrps including launching iqos in japan in 2015 source philip morris investor presentation the reason for rolling out iqos in japan first is because regulations mean that vaping is pretty much a non starter in that country nicotine containing e liquids are regulated as pharmaceuticals pm has managed to gain 80 market share in japan s heat stick market though now rising competition from japan tobacco and bti have seen that decline thanks to a price war for heat sticks but philip morris has taken what it s learned from marketing success in japan and rolled out iqos to nearly 40 other markets where it s seen strong growth source pm investor presentation mind you none of these markets are seeing early japan style growth and so it s still not clear whether or not the company will achieve its ambitious target of raising heat stick volumes currently 7 to over 30 by 2025 and generate about 40 of revenue from rrps source pm investor presentation on the other hand in the first nine months of 2018 the company s heat stick volumes rose 42 4 to 29 2 billion units showing that at least for now pm s big bet on rrps is paying off but the good news is that philip morris is at least the global leader in heat sticks which generally have stronger brand and pricing power than e cigs due to being marketed under its well known brands though this might be changing in the future source pm investor presentation those brands are the cornerstone of pm s investing thesis because the company is currently the world leader in cigarettes thanks to marketing six of the world s top 15 brands that s why philip morris commands about 30 global market share excluding china which is the highest in the industry what s more since its spinoff from altria mo it s been the only tobacco giant to gain market share though just 0 3 source pm investor presentation one reason why pm is doing so well is the big focus on premium products which have grown to 55 of oecd volumes in 2018 studies show that smoker quit rates are much lower for premium brands which also command the best pricing power allowing pm to steadily increase prices per pack to slowly grow revenue over time despite steady global volume declines british american s rrp efforts have been more modest with some success with the vype e cig brand in the uk and the reynolds acquisition giving it vuse in the us however it s important to remember that according to nielsen s most recent survey juul soon 35 owned by altria controls 75 of the us vaping market similarly bti s glo heat sticks had just 4 market share in japan in mid 2018 highlighting how the company lacks the strong first move advantage pm has gained with a stronger global iqos rollout source bti investor presentation that being said british american has rolled out vaping products in 14 countries and plans to market them aggressively to try to win market share and given that at least so far lower excise taxes on vaping allow for gross margins of between 30 and 110 more than cigarettes depending on the market any market share gains bti makes in vaping should significantly boost its bottom line but as with philp morris for now british americans cash cow remains combustible tobacco where it owns some of the strongest brands in the us and the world source bti investor presentation like with pm bti s premium brand focus has allowed it to achieve smaller volume declines over time relative to the industry source bti investor presentation they also give british american strong pricing power of about 5 to 6 per year which is more than enough to offset volume declines and results in rising cigarette revenues source bti investor presentation and also like philip morris the company benefits from faster growth in emerging markets 66 of volumes especially asia india and the middle east as a result management is confident that its core business when combined with margin expansion from cost cutting strong deleveraging and long term success in rrps can drive adjusted eps and fcf growth in the high single digits roughly in line with its 20 year average and similar to what altria is guiding for source bti investor presentation now i m personally skeptical of management fully delivering on its growth plans especially in the us for example management says it plans to regain vaping leadership with vuse but juul is now firmly established as the king of us vaping and i expect bti s us vaping efforts to ultimately fizzle and since management estimates that vaping is causing a 0 7 annual decline in its us volumes that likely will mean that british american investors have to expect slightly worse us volume declines for the foreseeable future unless the fda makes good on its threat to devastate e cigs vaping in the us with harsh regulations source bti investor presentation combined with modest growth in the company s oral tobacco product lines bti should be able to achieve the modest 5 5 long term adjusted eps growth that analysts currently expect source bti investor presentation that might miss management s long term growth target however given that the stock is currently priced for virtually zero long term growth british american tobacco is likely to still generate great returns from even this level of modest growth which brings me to one of the most important differences between these two companies while philip morris has the stronger and more obvious long term growth runway and is capable of market crushing returns bti offers one of the best investment return potentials of any dividend stock in america total return potential winner british american if growth expectations are met historically a good long term return model relatively accurate since 1956 has been the formula yield long term cash flow dividend growth that s called the gordon dividend growth model and it s what brookfield asset management bam has used for decades one of the world s best asset managers the model assumes no changes in valuation over time they tend to cancel out due to mean reversion but to that formula i add a valuation adjustment factoring in valuation mean reversion over time five to 10 years company yield expected 5 year cash flow growth expected total return no valuation change valuation adjusted total return potential philip morris 6 1 6 9 13 0 16 1 to 19 5 british american 8 1 5 5 13 6 19 5 to 28 5 s p 500 2 0 6 4 8 4 3 to 9 click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends fast graphs multipl gordon dividend growth model dividend yield theory analyst estimates moneychimp thanks to their sky high yields both pm and bti are likely to deliver solid 13 long term total returns even assuming their valuations never improve that s far better than the s p 500 s historical 9 1 cagr total return as well as the 3 to 9 returns that most analysts asset managers expect from the market in the coming years but when you factor in higher multiples when both companies prove their businesses aren t dying then their return potential gets much better source fast graphs pm s average adjusted pe has been 17 1 since the spin off assuming a more modest 16 5 multiple in 2023 that would result in 14 3 cagr total returns from philip morris bti has a 10 year average adjusted pe of 15 9 and assuming it returns to a modest 15 multiple by 2023 that results in an annualized total return of 26 6 source fast graphs so as far as the better return potential goes bti has philip morris beat by a large margin at least over the next five years similarly over the next 10 years my valuation adjusted total return model estimates that pm should be able to conservatively deliver 16 cagr total returns while bti s more undervalued shares could return close to 20 how do i come up with those figures well that s where valuation analysis comes in valuation winner british american but both companies are screaming buys today data by ycharts needless to say it s been a rough year for tobacco investors though british american shareholders have suffered worse than anyone but that merely means that both companies are fantastic deep value opportunities for any high yield investor comfortable with owning tobacco stocks company forward adjusted pe 5 year average forward adjusted

don t trust forward pes then we can look at each company s trailing earnings and here too we see that both are trading at a significant discount to their historical norms pm s undervaluation appears slightly smaller using this approach while bti s remains largely unchanged but in terms of my favorite valuation technique and the one i use to build my return models recommend companies to readers and drive my portfolio investment decisions i turn to dividend yield theory or dyt this is the only approach that asset manager newsletter publisher investment quality trends has used since 1966 and only on blue chips to achieve decades of market beating returns and with 10 less volatility to boot source investment quality trends you might not think that beating the market by 10 over 30 years is

than wall street s best professionals you can see why i m trusting this time tested valuation model investing strategy with my own money dyt just compares a stock s yield to its historical norm because unless a company s thesis breaks yields tend to mean revert over time to a steady level that approximates fair value thus this historical yield comparison can be used to estimate with a historical margin of error of about 20 how much valuation boost a stock will get over a specific time period company yield 5 year average yield discount to fair value upside to fair value long term valuation boost potential 5 to 10 years philip morris 6 1 4 6 26 35 3 1 to 6 2 british american 8 1 4 0 50 100 7 2 to 14 9 click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends fast graphs dividend yield theory moneychimp using dyt and the 5 year average yield we can see that both stocks are extremely undervalued but bti is offering twice the discount that pm is due to the higher risk profile that means potentially enormous upside for both stocks that over five to 10 years should boost expected total returns yield long term cash flow dividend growth by a massive amount for context those valuation boosts alone are higher than the total return many analysts expect the s p 500 to deliver over the next five years but while i trust dyt enough to make it the cornerstone of my own investing strategy you might not despite that impressive track record so let s use morningstar s three stage discounted cash flow model instead company morningstar fair value estimate estimated discount to fair value upside to fair value long term valuation boost potential 5 to 10 years philip morris 102 27 37 3 2 to 6 5 british american 59 44 77 5 9 to 12 1 click to enlarge sources morningstar moneychimp morningstar is famous for its 100 fundamental long term and conservative valuation models which typically bake in slower growth projections than most analysts or management itself yet morningstar s fair value estimates back up dyt and agree that both pm and bti are highly undervalued and that british american is the better buy today the bottom line is that both of these high quality blue chips are trading at huge margins of safety and both are very strong buys but due to bti s higher risk profile debt and more menthol regulatory risk it s trading at a valuation that s too good to ignore and is the far stronger buy today if you can only afford to invest in one of these companies bottom line philip morris is the superior tobacco blue chip but british american is the better buy today don t get me wrong i m well aware that tobacco stocks aren t for everyone they have a much higher risk profile than most industries and plenty of people have moral misgivings about investing in them but for deep value contrarian income investors who are comfortable with their business models british american tobacco and philip morris are two of the best high yield buys you can make today philip morris is objectively the superior company thanks to a stronger balance sheet better profitability a safer and better dividend track record and a stronger long term growth runway that being said bti is trading at such a ridiculously low price that i have to give it the overall win in terms of the better buy right now yes investors will want to watch its debt levels closely in the coming years and how its growth rate progresses post the eu menthol ban but the margin of safety is now so high that buying british american right now is very unlikely to lose you money in the long term basically i m comfortable pounding the table about both companies which is why dvdgp owns significant positions in both and will steadily add to them for as long as the market offers these amazing high yield dividend growth opportunities
shinzo abe s speech to the davos pantomime was a wake up call the japan pm now g 20 chairman until end june signaled with his speech that he has now become a europhile and is moving away from a us centered approach washington global markets and japanese savers should all take careful note the likely consequences are not pretty much of this stems from abe s interest in continuing to expand trade relations with china everyone and their dog know that germany and japan are the two lead advanced economies which have integrated themselves with china using that country for example as a final assembly location for their exports and in the process shifting a large part of their own potential bilateral trade surplus with the us to the people s republic pro eu anti brexit earlier in the month shinzo abe on his lightning european tour dropped in on theresa may to publicly warn the british prime minister against defying eu power with a no deal brexit and he let the brexiters know if they had any illusions about this matter tokyo would not reward their defiance by opening talks on a free trade deal between the two island economies meanwhile back in tokyo pm abe s bank of japan chief haruhiko kuroda announced that there is to be no turning back from monetary radicalism featuring euro style negative interest rates and long term interest rate manipulation certainly these policies have not pushed the inflation rate up to the 2 per cent target but who doesn t know by now that the real purpose of monetary radicalism under present circumstances is currency manipulation and stealth taxation of fellow citizens there is nothing new about japan periodically embracing european alliances and learning from europe the tradition goes all the way back to the meiji restoration and the danger that european ties can stoke frictions in us japan relations is also familiar but now japan s geo political situation is particularly fragile the us not the eu is japan s more reliable partner in security yet the essence of a europhile policy for tokyo is close friendship with the eu hegemon berlin we know that the trump administration is watchful and alert to how germany has been gaming global trade and security to the disadvantage of the us the rapprochement of tokyo and berlin implicit in the concluding of the eu japan trade deal jars with the length of time during which the abe government worried about new demands to curb official or unofficial protection of its farmers and auto makers stalled the opening of talks with washington on a free trade agreement fta eventually agreeing to their start last autumn also jarring was the alacrity with which tokyo concluded a trans pacific partnership tpp deal once the trump administration turned its back on this meaning that japan has become the hegemon of a regional free trade area including canada and australia but ostensibly so far excluding south korea and india indeed in some respects canada s own fta with the eu coming into effect last year was a model for the japan eu deal one objective of tokyo in its fta with the eu was an expansion of the market for japanese autos matching concessions to european agriculture are in areas which don t compete with its own highly protected farmers cheese wine pork beef increasing financial integration also made sense not least given the massive accumulated stock of financial assets held in the euro zone by japanese investors made desperate for yield by the radical monetary experimentation of abe economics doubling down on abenomics the yield hungry japanese have flocked to french government bonds attracted by their yield spread over german and yet the perception of france at the eu core there has also been a huge build up of much higher yielding and riskier italian government bonds no wonder shinzo abe is shoulder to shoulder with angela merkel in hostility and fear of any populist quake under the eu whether a no deal brexit or anything else which could cause the pillars of the euro zone for fall shinzo abe and his architects of economic policy would not admit to having spread the terror of income famine amongst their fellow citizens after all he told the davos crowd that abe economics had defeated defeatism and thereby the japanese economy is prospering the business statistics are at least superficially on his side for now the cheap yen for japan like the cheap euro for germany has stimulated a cumulative rapid growth of the export sector but german and japanese households other than those earning bonuses in the big exporter corporations are quietly suffering some may delude themselves that speculative froth will continue to compensate for negative returns on domestic bonds and money but most realize that to attain their objective of accumulating capital for retirement they have to save even harder than otherwise the burden on the japanese saver is even greater than the german in fact the zero yield on 10 year jgbs compares to 10 year bund yields at 0 2 but jgbs are substantially riskier than bunds as reflected in credit ratings moreover investors in bunds reap a potential prize if one day the deutsche mark is re born yes present reported inflation in germany is higher than in japan but further ahead looking at the weak state of public finances in japan and the likely time limited nature of present downward forces on prices there especially integration with south east asia and especially china that relative situation could easily go into reverse in german democracy increasingly pluralistic there are political forces which could strengthen and bring a halt to radical monetary inflation policies as pursued by the ecb in japan by contrast one party dominance makes any such challenge implausible and in any case there is not the same distributional resentment to fuel discontent in japan all households are subject to tax by stealth on their savings in europe the tax is concentrated in germany and other northern european emu members the italians in particular though are not subject to this in that their banks and government are gradually being recapitalized to their benefit by the transfer german resentment in particular of the transfer is what might eventually fan sufficient support on the right and possibly far left to topple the centrist governments presided over by chancellor merkel or her successor if eventually the merkel regime and the eu status quo over which it presides crashes then historians will say that pm abe made a big error in betting so much on a new alliance with europe
earlier this month freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez the youngest woman ever elected to congress was interviewed by anderson cooper on 60 minutes one brief comment she made about taxes has the billionaire plutocrats of the new gilded age clutching their pearls and attacking her as a proxy for attacking progressive tax policy in general anderson cooper this would require though raising taxes rep alexandria ocasio cortez there s an element where yeah there people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes anderson cooper do you have a specific on the tax rate rep alexandria ocasio cortez you know it you look at our tax rates back in the 60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system your tax rate you know let s say from zero to 75 000 may be ten percent or 15 percent et cetera but once you get to like the tippy tops on your 10 millionth dollar sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent that doesn t mean all 10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more anderson cooper what you are talking about just big picture is a radical agenda compared to the way politics is done right now really anderson high marginal tax rates were the norm in american tax policy for many years when america still had a progressive tax system that built a vibrant american middle class it only became radical after wealthy plutocrats funded conservative anti tax think tanks to promote the discredited and disproven trickle down tax theory let the wealthy keep more of their money through lower taxes and they will invest it and it will trickle down to the lower classes a cruel myth unsupported by the data which the corporate media is more than happy to promote phillip bump of the washington post explains here s how ocasio cortez s tax comments are being misrepresented we should be clear at the outset that the tax rate mentioned by freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y in an interview with 60 minutes was not a hard and fast proposal meant to be voted on in the house over the short term asked by interviewer anderson cooper what a fair share of taxes looked like for wealthier americans ocasio cortez offered an example was a broadly accurate statement fifty years ago the tax rate on the highest bracket of income was indeed over 70 percent it applied only to income past the first 400 000 or so until 1965 which is presumably what ocasio cortez meant by the tippy tops this is an important distinction that has been blurred in the aftermath of ocasio cortez s comments if she were proposing that incomes above 10 million be taxed at a rate of 70 percent she s not suggesting that those making 10 million or more be taxed at 70 percent for every dollar as the washington post s christopher ingraham noted monday everyone would pay the same amount of tax on every dollar of income below that level americans have trouble understanding marginal tax rates and politicians and pundits are more than happy to exploit their lack of understanding let s now introduce the figure that has been most talked about from ocasio cortez s comments a 70 percent bracket starting at 10 million in other words a shift that looks like this philip bump the washington post now notice that until 10 million the black line representing ocasio cortez s sort of proposal and the gray dashed line indicating the status quo are identical they diverge only after 10 million resulting in added tax revenue indicated in the shaded green area how much could that raise our jeff stein talked to experts 720 billion in a decade now remember this applies only to people who make 10 million or more in a year and only to their incomes starting at that 10 million mark through dollar number 9 999 999 those people are still paying a bit less than 37 percent on their income the effect of ocasio cortez s comments would be that wealthier americans would keep slightly less of their income than they do now but as they made more money they d still be keeping more income too philip bump the washington post for all of the hand wringing over her comments not all of it sincere it s worth remembering that almost no one would be affected by such a change in 2016 the irs reported that only about 16 000 tax returns included adjusted incomes of at least 10 million 0 01 percent of the 150 million returns filed the corporate media s latest fave billionaire plutocrat of the week howard schultz says america doesn t want far left ideas like alexandria ocasio cortez s 70 marginal tax targeting the wealthy billionaire former starbucks ceo howard schultz is no fan of rep alexandria ocasio cortez s proposal to slap a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income above 10 million in an interview monday night he cited her idea as one of the reasons he could never run for president as a democrat schultz believes the party has moved too far left and he doesn t believe in their tax and spending priorities i respect the democratic party i no longer feel affiliated because i don t know their views represent the majority of americans i don t think we want a 70 percent income tax in america schultz told cnbc s andrew ross sorkin in new york he is of course wrong polls have shown that voters generally approve of the idea of taxing the wealthy at a higher rate indeed a recent hill harrisx survey of 1 001 registered voters found that 59 percent supported ocasio cortez s proposal a fox news poll published last week found that 70 percent of registered voters backed hiking taxes for families making more than 10 million a year schultz s veiled criticism of democratic socialist ocasio cortez s idea to tax earnings over 10 million at 70 percent matched the concerns of many of the uber rich who attended the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week the billionaire elite expressed dismay at the direction the 29 year old freshman firebrand from new york wants to take the nation perhaps congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez is not the best spokesperson for this tax policy she is young snd inexperienced and lacks gravitas as a result she is easily dismissed by the elitist billionaire plutocrats of the new gilded age so how about a highly experienced and respected economist with a long track record of being right and the gravitas of a nobel prize in economics paul krugman the economics of soaking the rich excerpt the right s denunciation of aoc s insane policy ideas serves as a very good reminder of who is actually insane the controversy of the moment involves aoc s advocacy of a tax rate of 70 80 percent on very high incomes which is obviously crazy right i mean who thinks that makes sense only ignorant people like um peter diamond nobel laureate in economics and arguably the world s leading expert on public finance although republicans blocked him from an appointment to the federal reserve board with claims that he was unqualified really and it s a policy nobody has ever implemented aside from the united states for 35 years after world war ii including the most successful period of economic growth in our history to be more specific diamond in work with emmanuel saez one of our leading experts on inequality estimated the optimal top tax rate to be 73 percent some put it higher christina romer top macroeconomist and former head of president obama s council of economic advisers estimates it at more than 80 percent where do these numbers come from underlying the diamond saez analysis are two propositions diminishing marginal utility and competitive markets diminishing marginal utility is the common sense notion that an extra dollar is worth a lot less in satisfaction to people with very high incomes than to those with low incomes give a family with an annual income of 20 000 an extra 1 000 and it will make a big difference to their lives give a guy who makes 1 million an extra thousand and he ll barely notice it what this implies for economic policy is that we shouldn t care what a policy does to the incomes of the very rich a policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people and will barely affect their life satisfaction since they will still be able to buy whatever they want so why not tax them at 100 percent the answer is that this would eliminate any incentive to do whatever it is they do to earn that much money which would hurt the economy in other words tax policy toward the rich should have nothing to do with the interests of the rich per se but should only be concerned with how incentive effects change the behavior of the rich and how this affects the rest of the population but here s where competitive markets come in in a perfectly competitive economy with no monopoly power or other distortions which is the kind of economy conservatives want us to believe we have everyone gets paid his or her marginal product that is if you get paid 1000 an hour it s because each extra hour you work adds 1000 worth to the economy s output in that case however why do we care how hard the rich work if a rich man works an extra hour adding 1000 to the economy but gets paid 1000 for his efforts the combined income of everyone else doesn t change does it ah but it does because he pays taxes on that extra 1000 so the social benefit from getting high income individuals to work a bit harder is the tax revenue generated by that extra effort and conversely the cost of their working less is the reduction in the taxes they pay or to put it a bit more succinctly when taxing the rich all we should care about is how much revenue we raise the optimal tax rate on people with very high incomes is the rate that raises the maximum possible revenue see economist jared bernstein on this point our fundamental fiscal problem isn t too much spending it s not enough revenue new analysis by jason furman and larry summers comes to the same conclusion without the bush and trump tax cuts and the interest payments on the debt that went with them last year s federal budget would have come close to balancing they also bring an important international comparison to this table concluding that the united states has more of a revenue problem than an entitlement problem u s spending on social programs ranks among the lowest in 35 advanced economies yet the country has the highest deficit relative to its gdp in the group that is because the united states brings in the fifth lowest total revenue as a share of gdp among those 35 countries bernstein concludes there is no realistic sustainable budget path that does not include increased tax revenue krugman continues something we can estimate given evidence on how responsive the pre tax income of the wealthy actually is to tax rates as i said diamond and saez put the optimal rate at 73 percent romer at over 80 percent which is consistent with what aoc said an aside what if we take into account the reality that markets aren t perfectly competitive that there s a lot of monopoly power out there the answer is that this almost surely makes the case for even higher tax rates since high income people presumably get a lot of those monopoly rents so aoc far from showing her craziness is fully in line with serious economic research i hear that she s been talking to some very good economists her critics on the other hand do indeed have crazy policy ideas and tax policy is at the heart of the crazy you see republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy this claim rests on research by well nobody there isn t any body of serious work supporting g o p tax ideas because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas look at the history of top marginal income tax rates left versus growth in real gdp per capita right measured over 10 years to smooth out short run fluctuations what we see is that america used to have very high tax rates on the rich higher even than those aoc is proposing and did just fine since then tax rates have come way down and if anything the economy has done less well why do republicans adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data well ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich and it s obvious and because the party s coffers demand adherence to nonsense economics the party prefers economists who are obvious frauds and can t even fake their numbers effectively which brings me back to aoc and the constant effort to portray her as flaky and ignorant well on the tax issue she s just saying what good economists say and she definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the g o p caucus not least because she doesn t know things that aren t true and it s not just republicans it is also self described centrist billionaire plutocrats who seek to maintain

in a shift u s fed says will be patient on future rate hikes by howard schneider and jason lange washington reuters the federal reserve on wednesday signalled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the u s economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the u s central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the u s outlook less certain we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong u s macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued u s economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn advertisement advertisement combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalise monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth advertisement advertisement powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases story continues but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behaviour the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticized by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signalling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement u s stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon advertisement advertisement market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signalling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signalled it would do so twice more this year the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the u s government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending advertisement advertisement in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york advertisement advertisement the downgrade in the fed s language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from strong to solid and it noted that market based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months the fed s policy decision was unanimous reporting by howard schneider and jason lange additional reporting by jonathan spicer editing by paul simao

sponsored it is that simple reigning financial asset valuations are now completely dependent on sustained central bank liquidity for example despite chair powell s bravado it is now patently clear that the fed cannot raise fed funds to 2 5 and reduce its balance sheet below 4 1 trillion without pressuring u s equity markets fed pause on rate hikes by unanimous decision at its 12 19 18 meeting the federal open market committee fomc hiked the fed funds rate by 25 basis points in his post meeting press conference chair powell telegraphed two additional rate hikes during 2019 and characterized the fed s balance sheet runoff as being on autopilot and not subject to change by january 9 however fed presidents bullard evans and rosengren coincidentally all 2019 fomc voters had weighed in against the necessity for further rate hikes by 1 14 19 even janet yellen had surfaced to suggest it s very possible we may have seen the last interest rate hike of this cycle on 1 15 19 the fed s most ardent hawk and final 2019 rotating fomc voter kansas city fed president esther george made it official it might be a good time to pause our interest rate normalization waiting for the scales to tip on gold there you have it the fed has all but admitted in the three weeks following its december rate hike that that hike may have been misguided as gold investors we have anticipated just such a fed denouement for much of 2018 in classic irony market reaction to date from abrupt reversal in fed policy guidance has largely been limited to equity ebullience the 11 post christmas rally in the s p 500 has been matched by a negligible 20 rally in the gold price 1 6 needless to say we expect more reasoned analysis to tip the scales dramatically in gold s favor in coming periods typical of late bull market cognitive dissonance we believe consensus is misreading the significance of the fed s evolving pause in rate hikes on the surface suspension of further tightening might equate to a back in the pool signal right actually no it doesn t the history of fed pauses during the past three decades has been to signal significant economic slowdown at least in 1989 2000 and 2007 the first fed pause signaled imminent recession indeed as shown in figure 4 since 1986 the length of time between first fed pause and first fed ease has averaged roughly six months with all due respect to equity markets

catalyst for the gold bullion rocket locked and loaded gold outshines the s p 500 in 2018 we believe that gold bullion and gold mining equities may be poised for a multi year uptrend gold bullion beat u s equities for the month of december the fourth quarter and the full calendar year of 2018 spot gold declined 1 58 versus the 4 39 drop in the s p 500 total return index in 2018 figure 1 gold also outperformed most currencies last year with the exception of the swiss franc and the japanese yen the bulk of gold s 2018 outperformance came in the fourth quarter on the back of the steep fall of the

important rally would be growing recognition that the fed s current tightening cycle was reaching a conclusion this crucial trigger appears to now be locked and loaded as we discuss below history overwhelmingly suggests the fed will be easing policy within three to six months once this inflection in fed policy officially hits the tape gold should have already commenced what we expect to be a significant and sustained advance during 2018 we warned that fed s dual policy agenda of simultaneous rate hikes and balance sheet reduction was crimping dollar liquidity to the significant peril of reigning financial asset prices throughout the year we documented signs of mounting financial stress in both peripheral and mainstream asset classes ranging from emerging markets and subprime u s consumer credits all the way to mammoth u s markets for residential housing and corporate debt by yearend fed induced liquidity strains materialized in broad equity averages with the s p 500 posting a

that he had scheduled a meeting of the president s working group on financial markets for the morning of 12 24 18 nicknamed the plunge protection team ppt the working group was formed after the 1987 market crash and is composed of top officials from the federal reserve the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission fanning conspiratorial flames the s p 500 abruptly reversed course from its 2 351 10 close on 12 24 and rallied 11 02 through a 1 15 19 close of 2 610 30 what could account for such sudden resilience of previously slumping equity averages as enjoyable as the hollywood optics of a christmas eve ppt thriller might be we would attribute the bounce in equities to a far more ordinary narrative more like a late night re run of an old sitcom in

it may be wise for investors to take some risk off the table stock markets have rallied since the december selloff but it s still debatable whether a recovery can be sustainable rising interest rates the united states s trade war with china and slower global growth are keeping markets on edge given the uncertainty exchange traded funds etfs with their diversified exposure to markets can be one way for investors to hedge their bets we asked three etf experts for their top defensive picks daniel straus etf analyst national bank financial inc toronto the pick invesco s p tsx composite low volatility etf tlv tsx management expense ratio mer 0 34 per cent this low volatility canadian stock etf can sometimes outpace the broader market but there are no guarantees says mr straus it has however beaten the s p tsx composite total return index by about 2 2 percentage points annually since inception in 2012 to the end of 2018 much of the outperformance came when the index lost 8 3 per cent in 2015 when oil prices collapsed while the etf gained 0 11 per cent in 2016 the index returned 21 1 per cent as oil prices recovered while the etf rose 15 4 per cent lagging the market during a strong bull trend is part of the trade off for a low volatility strategy he notes canada s six big banks are among the etf s 50 names a risk is the overweighting of the utilities and real estate sectors which could be hard hit if interest rates rise quickly he adds the etf s fee is among the lowest in its peer group the pick bmo shiller select u s index etf zeus tsx mer 0 73 per cent open this photo in gallery food companies such as general mills are included in defensive etfs because their stocks tend to hold up even in rough times jason lee reuters this u s equity etf s defensive nature comes from the inclusion of companies with a strong earnings history and an ability to navigate multiple economic cycles says mr straus using a methodology popularized by the yale university professor robert shiller the etf s strategy compares stock prices with their 10 year average inflation adjusted earnings to identify companies that can potentially weather economic downturns mr straus says kohl s corp general mills inc and chubb ltd are among the top holdings the fund s focus on 80 stocks however is a risk because that is only a small segment of the u s market he notes because of its value oriented strategy this etf launched in late 2017 could miss out on returns from strong growth stocks even though the etf s fee is on the expensive side its positioning could pay off in market slumps he says alex bryan etf and mutual fund analyst morningstar inc chicago the pick ishares edge msci minimum volatility global etf xmw tsx mer 0 48 per cent open this photo in gallery mcdonald s corp is one of the stocks included in the ishares edge msci minimum volatility global etf mike stewart the associated press this global etf which owns equities in both developed and emerging markets could be a core holding because it takes a holistic approach says mr bryan it screens for low volatility stocks in the msci all country world index acwi as well as those with a low correlation to other names in the benchmark he adds for instance the etf holds the gold miner newmont mining corp whose shares can be volatile because of fluctuating commodity prices but this stock can also provide a hedge for the other stocks in the portfolio because gold tends to rise when the market is down he notes this etf can overweight or underweight sectors only by as much as 5 per cent top holdings include johnson johnson mcdonald s corp pepsico inc and merck co inc while the etf offers downside protection the risk is that it might lag in rising markets he says its fee he adds is competitive with those of its low volatility etf peers the pick invesco s p 500 low volatility etf canadian hedged ulv f tsx expected mer 0 31 per cent this u s equity which screens for low volatility stocks in the s p 500 index provides potent exposure to a defensive play says mr bryan the strategy ranks the least volatile 100 names over the past 12 months while this etf could be used as a tactical bet on a market downturn such an event is hard to predict he says the fund is an option for risk averse investors who want some exposure to equities he adds holdings include coca cola co duke energy corp and nextera energy corp without sector constraints in this etf there can be overconcentration in utilities and consumer defensive stocks he notes utilities make up 22 per cent of the fund the risk is that this etf could give up some returns in a rallying market and rapidly rising interest rates could also hurt its utilities exposure he notes invesco canada expects the mer to fall to 0

higher quality companies outside north america offers easy diversification for investors who tend to stick to canadian and u s equities says mr kletz while european and asian stocks have lagged the u s market since the 2008 financial crisis that is unsustainable in the long term and creates an opportunity he says because this etf screens for stocks using criteria such as return on equity earnings stability and leverage the result is a collection of profitable companies with solid balance sheets that can weather market slumps he suggests among the holdings are nestlé sa glaxosmithkline plc and diageo plc while shares of even the most resilient companies could slide a bear market is not part of forstrong s market outlook this year he says the fund s fee he adds is near the lower end of its peer group the pick franklin ftse japan etf fljp nyse mer 0 09 per cent this japanese equity etf seems counter intuitive as a defensive play given the country s export led economy and leverage to global growth says mr kletz but this fund is attractive because corporate japan has made large strides under prime minister shinzo abe s economic policy while governance reforms have helped japan s corporate return on equity climb to the highest level since 2007 he adds despite a stable political backdrop and an accommodating central bank japanese stocks have not been widely embraced he says because the japanese market is cheap relative to its global peers that should limit risk stemming from global trade hostilities or other events he says since the japanese yen is seen as a safe haven asset in turbulent times currency gains should help offset losses he adds the etf s fee is among the lowest of its north american listed peers

in a shift u s fed says will be patient on future rate hikes by howard schneider and jason lange washington reuters the federal reserve on wednesday signaled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the u s economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the u s central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the u s outlook less certain we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong u s macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued u s economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalize monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behavior the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticized by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signaling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement u s stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signaling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signaled it would do so twice more this year the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the u s government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york the

are making in innovation and business transformation i will then turn the call to ted to review our financial performance in more detail and provide additional thoughts on our outlook for 2019 during our comments we will reference the q4 slide presentation posted on our investor relations website as you saw from this morning s release sales in the quarter increased 5 2 to 2 1 billion which is the highest fourth quarter sales in our history our strong sales performance included organic growth in all segments as well as record fourth quarter sales in both our nss and ups segments adjusting for the favorable impact of the security acquisitions in australia and new zealand completed in the second quarter of 2018 and the unfavorable impact of lower average copper prices and generally weaker foreign currencies organic sales increased 5 1 sales growth was above the midpoint of our outlook range of 4 5 to 5 5 driven by the ups segment complex and global accounts customers and our security business in addition to strong sales growth we were pleased to deliver meaningful improvement in gross margin driven by actions we have implemented across the business this reflected excellent sales execution and is evidence of getting paid for the value we continue to provide to our customers overall fourth quarter 2018 gaap earnings per diluted share was 1 22 and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9 from previous year to 1 53 during the quarter we accelerated investments in innovation and business transformation with a focus on customer facing technologies that will continue to enhance our digital capabilities and enterprise efficiencies we are streamlining and standardizing our global business processes as we migrate to a more efficient operating model we will continue to develop best in class digital tools that will make it easier and more efficient for our customers to engage with us anywhere in the world this innovation journey will provide significant efficiencies and become an important part of our strategy to grow revenue above market and drive long term operational leverage and ebitda improvement we expect to begin seeing efficiency benefits from our business transformation next year with long term annual run rate savings of 40 million to 60 million with our margin actions and short term efficiency efforts we expect modest ebitda margin improvement this year with accelerated benefits next year and beyond let me now review our sales results by segment beginning with nss as shown on slide 6 record nss quarterly sales of 1 1 billion increased 6 4 current quarter sales included 28 million favorable impact on the security acquisitions and a 12 million unfavorable impact from currency fluctuations on an organic basis nss sales increased 4 7 growth was broad based including in all geographies and key strategic initiatives driven by global accounts complex integrated supply programs and our security wireless and professional audio video businesses regarding end markets we continue to experience strong growth with financial services technology data center and healthcare customers by region nss north american sales of 820 million increased just under 2 on an organic basis growth in security wireless and professional a v partially offset a decline in our network infrastructure business growth in canada was strong as well driven by our security business in emea nss sales of 100 million increased 8 5 on an organic basis driven by global technology and financial services customers emerging market sales of 198 million increased 16 on an organic basis with strong growth in both cala and apac we experienced strong growth in mexico driven by a new complex services program with a large cable operator in latin america we continued to build our business with complex integrated supply programs finally strength in apac was driven by projects in australia and japan turning to the security side of the nss business sales of 500 million or approximately 45 of segment sales increased almost 19 driven by recent acquisitions and strong organic growth of 12 5 moving to electrical and electronics solutions on slide 7 fourth quarter sales of 571 million decreased by 1 8 adjusting for unfavorable impacts of lower average copper prices and generally weaker foreign currencies organic sales increased to half a percent given a challenging comparison with q4 2017 we highlight that on a two year stack basis organic sales growth was over 10 looking at ees by region north american sales of 443 million were flat on an organic basis as growth with oem customers was offset by a decline in our commercial and industrial business in emea ees sales of 59 million declined 14 on an organic basis with modest growth in our oem business partially offsetting lower sales in our industrial business as we discussed in the third quarter call we faced a difficult comparison due to several large projects in the middle east in the year ago quarter in emerging markets ees sales of 69 million increased 23 on an organic basis driven by both oem and industrial projects strength in latin america our ees growth strategy remains focused on our customer access strategy complex and global supply chain services and organic initiatives in fast growing and strategic areas of the business we were pleased to be awarded a data center project in the ees business with a global technology customer estimated at 50 million in incremental revenue over the next two years finally our utility power solutions segment achieved a record fourth quarter sales of 430 million resulting in 13 growth on an organic basis shown on slide 8 this represents the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for this segment growth was broad based with strong sales results across all geographic regions in the u s and canada the iou business achieved strong growth with existing customers while the public power business had strong project activity in revenues from hurricane rebuild activities in the gulf coast the fundamentals of this business and backlog and bookings continue to look good in both the u s and canada we are focused on working with our partners and customers to deliver best in class service solutions and improved efficiencies we continue to grow and gain share in this business and believe we are well positioned for future growth with the existing and new utility customers let me now turn to gross margin on slide 9 of our presentation fourth quarter gross profit increased 8 to 430 million resulting in a gross margin of 20 3 an increase of 50 basis points year over year and 80 basis points sequentially as we discussed on our third quarter call our gross margin in the first half of the year was impacted by increasing product costs from suppliers due to inflationary pressures included from increases in freight employee benefits and impact on tariffs to combat these headwinds we have implemented actions across the business to improve gross margin as you can see from this quarter s results we are beginning to benefit from the actions we are taking we believe gross margin expansion represents a significant opportunity and plan to invest the gross margin improvement in our innovation initiative while still delivering operating margin expansion for 2019 our goal is to improve gross margin by approximately 20 to 40 basis points from full year 2018 levels we expect this improvement to continue allowing us to invest in the innovation we discussed and position our company for the future to summarize our strong fourth quarter and full year sales performance reflected good execution by the team and benefited from a relatively stable economic backdrop for the full year we ve delivered organic growth of 4 8 our highest organic growth rate in seven years we achieved organic growth in all segments and all geographies and believe we maintained or gained market share in all of our major businesses as we look to 2019 the demand backdrop remains favorable in most of our geographies as our backlog continues to increase and our pipeline is healthy the indicators most relevant to anixter s such as u s pmi remain in expansion territory and capex spending remains solid although growth trends have decelerated in recent months as we look across our regional businesses our european business is experiencing the most uncertain economic environment and we expect those challenges to continue for the foreseeable future while we are concerned about some of the broader political and macroeconomic uncertainty including ongoing trade tensions and brexit we ve remained cautiously optimistic that the overall growth trends will continue in 2019 based on the generally solid trends we are experiencing and the success of our focused sales initiatives tempered by ongoing uncertainties in the external environment our initial outlook for 2019 organic growth is in the 3 to 6 range with that let me turn the call over to ted for a more detailed analysis of our results and our outlook for the first quarter of 2019 ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks bill and good morning everyone as a reminder today s earnings release includes non gaap measures which are reconciled to the gaap measures in the financial tables that accompany our release and are in the appendix of our accompanying slide presentation we believe the non gaap measures we disclose provide the best representation of our ongoing operational performance bill covered our strong sales and gross margin performance so i will begin with operating expense looking at slide 10 fourth quarter operating expense of 342 7 million compares to prior year operating expense of 317 8 million excluding the non gaap operating expense items detailed on page 11 of our release adjusted operating expense increased 10 7 or 32 2 million to 333 8 million as a percentage of sales current quarter adjusted operating expense of 15 8 compares to 15 in addition to higher volume the primary drivers of the increase in adjusted operating expense were 7 4 million related to the acquired companies 7 2 million related to our innovation and business transformation initiatives and inflationary impacts including higher freight and employee expenses while we have taken actions to help mitigate the impact freight expense remains a year over year headwind adjusted ebitda was flat at 109 million adjusted ebitda increased in all three business segments offset by investment in innovation and business transformation expenses at corporate adjusted ebitda margin of 5 1 compares to 5 4 in the prior year let me now review the adjusted ebitda trends by segment beginning with nss as shown on slide 13 adjusted ebitda increased 5 2 to 84 million the resulting adjusted ebitda margin of 7 5 compares to 7 6 the change reflects gross margin improvement offset by higher operating expense including freight increases and incentive compensation on a sequential basis nss adjusted ebitda increased by 30 basis points driven by gross margin improvement ees adjusted ebitda increased 1 8 to 34 million resulting in a 20 basis point improvement in adjusted ebitda margin to 5 9 the increase was driven by gross margin improvement partially offset by higher employee costs including incentive compensation on a sequential basis adjusted ebitda of 34 million compares to 37 million finally ups adjusted ebitda of 26 million compares to 21 million the corresponding adjusted ebitda margin of 5 9 compares to 5 4 strong performance was driven by volume growth combined with strong operating expense leverage resulting in an adjusted ebitda leverage of 1 9 times on a sequential basis ups adjusted ebitda margin improved 50 basis points driven by both gross margin improvement and strong operating expense leverage moving down the income statement interest expense of 19 8 million compares to 19 million the increase was driven by higher average borrowings under the revolving lines of credit due to the recent acquisitions and to support volume driven higher working capital requirements we expect interest expense to increase slightly in the first quarter of 2019 from our q4 level during the fourth quarter we refinanced 350 million of 5 5 8 senior notes due 2019 with 250 million of 6 senior notes due 2025 and the borrowings under the revolving lines of credit and we also amended and extended our revolving credit facilities to 2023 we were extremely pleased with these successful transactions in light of the volatile market conditions in the fourth quarter and believe we have ensured adequate capital liquidity for the next several years as a result of the refinancing we have pushed out our debt maturities and increased our financial flexibility our next note maturity is 2021 and our capital structure is in line with our long term strategic targets looking at the foreign exchange and other expense line we had 7 6 million compared to 100 000 in the prior year quarter excluding the 4 6 million of expense related to the loss on the extinguishment of the 2019 senior notes the adjusted fx and other expense of 3 million compares to just 100 000 in the prior year this increase was primarily currency driven turning to taxes our fourth quarter 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 28 6 compares to 38 5 for the full year our 2018 non gaap etr of 29 3 compares to 37 8 in 2017 with the favorable rate changes in both the fourth quarter and full year rates due primarily to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and our country mix of earnings our diluted share count was 34 1 million shares looking ahead we would expect our share count to be approximately 34 2 million in 2019 moving down to eps our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 53 increased by 9 or 0 12 from the year ago quarter as we discussed both copper and currency were headwinds in the quarter the 27 5 million impact on sales translates into a 0 10 unfavorable impact on diluted eps with a disproportionate impact on the ees segment turning to slide 16 our working capital ratio of 18 2 compares to 18 4 in the prior year quarter this 20 basis point improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital efficiency while working capital dollars have increased to support the higher sales growth we continue to drive improvements in our working capital processes to enable more efficient use of our balance sheet we generated 138 million in cash from operations in 2018 which compares to 184 million in 2017 with the change driven by an increase in working capital to support growth in the business despite the improvement in working capital efficiency looking ahead we expect to generate cash flow from operations of 150 million to 175 million for the full year 2019 finally in addition to investing 150 million in the security acquisitions we invested 42 4 million in capital expenditures in 2018 compared to 41 1 million in 2017 we expect to invest 55 million to 60 million in capital expenditures in 2019 with the year over year increase primarily due to our increased investment in innovation and business transformation turning to slide 17 our fourth quarter 2018 debt to capital ratio of 44 4 compares to 46 1 at year end 2017 slightly below our target range of 45 to 50 our debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of three times is at the high end of our target range of 2 5 to three times both metrics reflect the impact of the q2 security acquisitions a weighted average cost of borrowed capital of 5 5 compares to 5 6 at the end of 2017 and our liquidity position remains strong with total available liquidity under revolving lines of credit and secured accounts receivable and inventory facilities of 599 million at the end of the quarter turning to our outlook for sales growth as bill said our outlook range for full year 2019 organic growth is 3 to 6 which compares to 2018 organic growth of 4 8 based on trends in the business through the month of january and supported by generally favorable economic indicators we are estimating first quarter 2019 organic growth to be in the 3 to 5 range as bill indicated we expect gross margin to improve for the year by 20 to 40 basis points in the fourth quarter we saw a 50 basis point improvement in year over year margin and as we look at the first quarter we expect a similar 40 to 50 basis point improvement in gross margin on a year over year basis turning to operating expense for the full year we expect adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales to increase slightly however as bill said we expect the actions we are taking to improve gross margin will both fund investment and innovation and create operating margin expansion looking at the first quarter we expect our adjusted operating expense dollars to decrease slightly on a sequential basis due to somewhat lower volume to further help with your modeling i will provide our estimates for the impacts of currency copper and acquisition on our first quarter and full year 2019 sales as detailed on slide 19 of today s presentation based on the current value of the u s dollar against other currencies we estimate a sales headwind of 25 million to 30 million for the first quarter and a headwind of 40 million to 50 million for the full year based on recent copper prices of approximately 2 70 a pound we estimate unfavorable sales impacts of 10 million to 15 million in the first quarter and 25 million to 30 million for the full year as a reminder average copper price was 3 14 in the first quarter of last year and 2 93 for the full year of 2018 finally the sales impact from the acquired businesses will be approximately 25 million in the first quarter and 50 million for the full year reflecting an incremental 5 months of ownership let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we were pleased to deliver strong sales growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year we believe we have significant opportunity to leverage our unique set of products and innovative solutions across our global network as we discussed our highest priority remains improving gross margin and we are pleased that we are beginning to see the benefits of the actions we have implemented we are also in the early stages of our business transformation which will deliver state of the art customer facing technologies and best in class enterprise efficiencies we expect our investment and innovation to deliver significant long term benefits with the goals of improving profitability generating strong cash flow from operations and creating value for all of our stakeholders with that we will now open the call for questions questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of shawn harrison from longbow research go ahead please your line is open shawn harrison longbow research analyst good morning wanted to delve into the i guess the slowing in the legacy in nss business as well as kind of the industrial business within ees and whether this was a function of just tough comps or was there something in terms of timing or something else going on in the market particularly as we look forward into 2019 bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes shawn it s bill the industrial one as we said was a really tough comps on the q4 of last year if you remember that ees business really started to accelerate in the q4 of 2017 so to us it was actually fairly decent performance on the stack basis on the nss side i believe that that s been consistently improving since the fourth quarter of 17 which was soft if you remember so ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes shawn i m not sure if you re referring to on the nss side slowing on the north america side with growth rates not as high as elsewhere around the world but that s pretty consistent with what we saw throughout the year and was not a big surprise for us we had a couple percent growth in that north american nss business on an organic basis again we were comping a little bit tougher comparisons prior year q4 of 2017 was the best quarter of the year for nss and we were comparing against some high project growth and so forth so we don t feel that that s indicative of a weakness necessarily in that north american business though bill galvin president and chief executive officer shawn i d also say though that if you remember in 2017 we slowed down considerably in the global account because that was the first time we ve seen that in many years and it came back in 18 and a lot of the growth you saw internationally was with multinational customers so it s a function of where these customers were spending investment and that s why you saw stronger growth outside of north america shawn harrison longbow research analyst that s very helpful as a follow up if you look toward the organic growth forecast for calendar 19 if you could maybe offer up nss ees and ups whether they re going to be kind of above the midpoint of that trend line or maybe a little bit below in terms of your expectations bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes good question shawn we can tell you that the ups will probably be above the trends in that continue to strengthen i think the nss will be right in there and i think ees because of the strong comps of 2018 will probably be just below that so aggregating out to that point but that s generally how it s going to look shawn harrison longbow research analyst ok and then lastly just on the gross margin was extraordinary for this quarter up 50 basis points year over year particularly given the strength in ups and the security business so if you could maybe just go underneath the covers a little bit in terms of what exactly happened because usually when you see that type of volume strength in those businesses you don t see that type of gross margin expansion bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes shawn we kind of talked about it on the last call and tried to give you some view into that it is a long term training initiative and process to really improve a lot of different areas it s not just one piece and we expect this to be kind of a long term continuous improvement process for us and it was across the entire company and across many different aspects of where we felt we could get improvement and look as you re driving a global long term strategy sometimes you get away from the fundamentals and i feel like we re back on that and we have a process now that we feel like we can continue to improve on so it was a companywide initiative and great effort by the team on all basis ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer shawn the only thing i would add to bill s comments there as he referred to what we ve done here keep in mind that we were doing this on the heels of the most significant inflationary trends on a material cost side that we ve experienced in probably pushing nearly a decade and so for several quarters of last year we were constantly playing catch up in trying to pass those costs on through to the business and we feel that we have made substantial progress here over the course of say the last four months of 2018 and a lot of that has to do with providing better more timely information to our sales folks as they make pricing decisions shawn harrison longbow research analyst perfect congratulations on the quarter bill galvin president and chief executive officer thanks shawn operator our next question comes from the line of allison poliniak from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst hi guys good morning just to keep on that gross margin and the utility impact i mean is there a way it seems like it technically should have been better on the underlying despite the mix from eps i mean is there any way to help us understand what that mix headwind per se would have been in q4 ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer the mix of the three segments allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst well with ups outgrowth rate so there had to have been some level of mix headwind i think if i go back to the other question is there any way to quantify for that ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the thing i would say allison to keep in mind there was definitely a negative mix impact at the gross margin line but not a negative mix impact at the operating margin line if you look at that business again because it does have a profile with significantly lower operating expense ups growing faster than the other businesses did not have any material measurable impact on the operating margin percentage but it did have slight negative impact at the gross margin line because of the double digit growth that we had in that business allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great thanks and then on just your comments around tempered demand really strong outlook for 19 despite that going on i mean can you maybe expand on that comment are you seeing project delays or just not necessarily quick execution on making decisions about future projects any thoughts there bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes as you look i think we re not seeing and we re watching to allison but we re not seeing any general slowdown of decision processes as a matter of fact we continue to see good project activity in many aspects of the global account side and security and so on so for us the if you remember in nss for instance the acceleration we started to see in backlog and bookings at the end of 17 we kind of missed and thought it d be sooner in 18 but really you could see it come through in the last three quarters of 18 right so we continued to see that activity and you know our exposure in china is limited so we re not seeing any kind of headwinds there and generally we re still seeing activity that leads us to believe we can get the 3 to 5 range that ted mentioned allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great thanks so much operator and our next question comes from the line of david manthey from baird go ahead please your line is open david manthey robert w baird co analyst thanks good morning everyone first off looking at slide 20 when i read things like business transformation and innovation investments are these code words for erp ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer dave i would say no it s not code words for erp what we are doing though is very much a customer facing business process transformation not just to go back to those words and so a big part of our focus is looking at our business processes making it easier for our customers to do business with us but as part of that yes there is a it platform as part of it as you know we ve got a very old homegrown mainframe based system and we ve been already on a journey for the last couple of years if you will moving toward an integrated erp system but that will only take place over a period of several years bill galvin president and chief executive officer david i d add to this too look we re focused on customers how we service our customers how we support them how we integrate with them and how we provide kind of best in class services and for us to continue that journey we need to continue to innovate in both customer facing digital capabilities which we ve been on that journey for many years now as well as other systems so that we can provide the data analytics and the things we need to make good proper decisions in the future and hopefully we painted the picture to everyone that with all the moving pieces the margin improvement other efficiencies that we re driving we ll continue to drive ebitda margin improvement and accelerate that long term by the efficiencies we know we re going to get so it s been a strategic planning process that we ve all been part of and thinking about how we get to those long term goals that we know we can achieve but we need to do some of this additional innovation to do that david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok when we re looking at what amounts to a five year sort of systems project can you give us a little more detail in terms of what this new platform is are you doing it in house are you bringing in an integrator and then when you look out to 2023 and you start to develop these full benefits what are the sources of those benefits bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes good question so to clarify as i said we ve started on this journey a couple of years ago we ve been moving toward an oracle shop as opposed to as i said our in house homegrown systems that we ve relied on for so long and again as a distributor our lifeblood is all about order management inventory management warehouse management that s the core of our integrated operating system going forward but we also will be doing some conversions to global financial systems today especially on the heels of the large acquisitions we ve done more recently we still have disparate systems across our company so the savings that we anticipate driving over time will largely be back office driven but what that doesn t even begin to touch on is the leverage we think we can drive by having the better systems the better data analytics and so forth which will drive even better support for the growth that we re focused on across our business you ve heard us talk about in previous calls and investor meetings and so forth about our customer access strategy and this is really all about helping to support our growth goals as we look at the change in the marketplace and kind of the blurring of the lines if you will between different customers and different technologies ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer and i ll add to that also david that there s innovation in the entire supply chain that s in the market today whether it s block chain or other types of innovation that in order to take advantage of that innovation you have to have the capability to do that so this allows us to then adapt very quickly to new technologies and becomes an important part of it but again i focus on the fact that it s and we called it innovation because it s so many other components it s digital it s other efficiencies that we re driving in the company that will allow us to meet our long term financial goals david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok thanks and then ted just a couple of financial questions first is the operating cash flow if my notes are right here i think last quarter you were guiding to 160 million to 180 million for the full year and you came in at 138 million and i m just wondering if that is the case if i have that right what led to that shortfall over the course of 90 days ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes dave you absolutely got the numbers right on the cash flow for full year fourth quarter and full year 2018 that was lower than what we had projected at the beginning of the quarter but as i said it was completely driven by the higher level of working capital and i would tell you across the buckets of working capital the biggest driver that was higher levels of inventory so even though as i said we improved our working capital efficiency the 18 2 working capital as a percent of sales is the lowest we ve ever had at the end of a year but having said that with the continual up tick in the projects we have in our pipeline and in essence project inventory that we had on hand at year end we did come up a little bit short of that cash flow target so we can feel good about the working capital efficiency we drove but obviously that s an indication of our internal targets were to drive even more efficiency out of that the other thing that s clearly an impact for us as a company that closes our books on a four four five calendar our december our q4 ended on december 28 so that hurt us a little bit also on the ar collections lot of companies are paying under calendar months so our ar whereas it was also up to support the higher sales was up a little bit higher than what we would have expected and we attribute that to the calendar timing as well david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok thanks for that and then last one and then i ll pass it on in light of the investments you re making and so forth could you give us an idea of what we should think about for the unallocated corporate items in 2019 and sort of does that is it even or does it increase through the year and the same thing for d a i would imagine that some of these things are going to be depreciated over time ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i ll take that in reverse the easy part is no significant increase in d a because what we re developing is going to be done over a multiyear period of time so we won t see that increase in 2019 on the depreciation side separately you re right the bulk of these expenses that we re making in innovation are flowing through our corporate opex not within one of the three individual businesses so whereas we would expect to see that gradually go up over time keep in mind we are with the rate of spend that we ramped up over the course of 2018 including through this fourth quarter we wouldn t see that going up significantly more from the run rate that we exited the year david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok great thanks a lot guys bill galvin president and chief executive officer thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to our presenters for some closing remarks bill galvin president and chief executive officer great that concludes today s call if you

sales and gross margin trends as well as discuss the investments we are making in innovation and business transformation i will then turn the call to ted to review our financial performance in more detail and provide additional thoughts on our outlook for 2019 during our comments we will reference the q4 slide presentation posted on our investor relations website advertisement advertisement as you saw from this morning s release sales in the quarter increased 5 2 to 2 1 billion which is the highest fourth quarter sales in our history our strong sales performance included organic growth in all segments as well as record fourth quarter sales in both our nss and ups segments adjusting for the favorable impact of the security acquisitions in australia and new zealand completed in the second quarter of 2018 and the unfavorable impact of lower average copper prices and generally weaker foreign currencies organic sales increased 5 1 sales growth was above the midpoint of our outlook range of 4 5 to 5 5 driven by the ups segment complex and global accounts customers and our security business in addition to strong sales growth we were pleased to deliver meaningful improvement in gross margin driven by actions we have implemented across the business this reflected excellent sales execution and is evidence of getting paid for the value we continue to provide to our customers overall fourth quarter 2018 gaap earnings per diluted share was 1 22 and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9 from previous year to 1 53 during the quarter we accelerated investments in innovation and business transformation with a focus on customer facing technologies that will continue to enhance our digital capabilities and enterprise efficiencies we are streamlining and standardizing our global business processes as we migrate to a more efficient operating model we will continue to develop best in class digital tools that will make it easier and more efficient for our customers to engage with us anywhere in the world this innovation journey will provide significant efficiencies and become an important part of our strategy to grow revenue above market and drive long term operational leverage and ebitda improvement we expect to begin seeing efficiency benefits from our business transformation next year with long term annual run rate savings of 40 million to 60 million with our margin actions and short term efficiency efforts we expect modest ebitda margin improvement this year with accelerated benefits next year and beyond let me now review our sales results by segment beginning with nss as shown on slide 6 record nss quarterly sales of 1 1 billion increased 6 4 current quarter sales included 28 million favorable impact on the security acquisitions and a 12 million unfavorable impact from currency fluctuations advertisement advertisement on an organic basis nss sales increased 4 7 growth was broad based including in all geographies and key strategic initiatives driven by global accounts complex integrated supply programs and our security wireless and professional audio video businesses regarding end markets we continue to experience strong growth with financial services technology data center and healthcare customers by region nss north american sales of 820 million increased just under 2 on an organic basis growth in security wireless and professional a v partially offset a decline in our network infrastructure business growth in canada was strong as well driven by our security business in emea nss sales of 100 million increased 8 5 on an organic basis driven by global technology and financial services customers emerging market sales of 198 million increased 16 on an organic basis with strong growth in both cala and apac we experienced strong growth in mexico driven by a new complex services program with a large cable operator in latin america we continued to build our business with complex integrated supply programs finally strength in apac was driven by projects in australia and japan turning to the security side of the nss business sales of 500 million or approximately 45 of segment sales increased almost 19 driven by recent acquisitions and strong organic growth of 12 5 moving to electrical and electronics solutions on slide 7 fourth quarter sales of 571 million decreased by 1 8 adjusting for unfavorable impacts of lower average copper prices and generally weaker foreign currencies organic sales increased to half a percent given a challenging comparison with q4 2017 we highlight that on a two year stack basis organic sales growth was over 10 looking at ees by region north american sales of 443 million were flat on an organic basis as growth with oem customers was offset by a decline in our commercial and industrial business advertisement advertisement in emea ees sales of 59 million declined 14 on an organic basis with modest growth in our oem business partially offsetting lower sales in our industrial business as we discussed in the third quarter call we faced a difficult comparison due to several large projects in the middle east in the year ago quarter in emerging markets ees sales of 69 million increased 23 on an organic basis driven by both oem and industrial projects strength in latin america our ees growth strategy remains focused on our customer access strategy complex and global supply chain services and organic initiatives in fast growing and strategic areas of the business we were pleased to be awarded a data center project in the ees business with a global technology customer estimated at 50 million in incremental revenue over the next two years finally our utility power solutions segment achieved a record fourth quarter sales of 430 million resulting in 13 growth on an organic basis shown on slide 8 this represents the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for this segment growth was broad based with strong sales results across all geographic regions in the u s and canada the iou business achieved strong growth with existing customers while the public power business had strong project activity in revenues from hurricane rebuild activities in the gulf coast the fundamentals of this business and backlog and bookings continue to look good in both the u s and canada we are focused on working with our partners and customers to deliver best in class service solutions and improved efficiencies we continue to grow and gain share in this business and believe we are well positioned for future growth with the existing and new utility customers let me now turn to gross margin on slide 9 of our presentation fourth quarter gross profit increased 8 to 430 million resulting in a gross margin of 20 3 an increase of 50 basis points year over year and 80 basis points sequentially advertisement advertisement as we discussed on our third quarter call our gross margin in the first half of the year was impacted by increasing product costs from suppliers due to inflationary pressures included from increases in freight employee benefits and impact on tariffs to combat these headwinds we have implemented actions across the business to improve gross margin as you can see from this quarter s results we are beginning to benefit from the actions we are taking we believe gross margin expansion represents a significant opportunity and plan to invest the gross margin improvement in our innovation initiative while still delivering operating margin expansion for 2019 our goal is to improve gross margin by approximately 20 to 40 basis points from full year 2018 levels we expect this improvement to continue allowing us to invest in the innovation we discussed and position our company for the future to summarize our strong fourth quarter and full year sales performance reflected good execution by the team and benefited from a relatively stable economic backdrop for the full year we ve delivered organic growth of 4 8 our highest organic growth rate in seven years we achieved organic growth in all segments and all geographies and believe we maintained or gained market share in all of our major businesses as we look to 2019 the demand backdrop remains favorable in most of our geographies as our backlog continues to increase and our pipeline is healthy the indicators most relevant to anixter s such as u s pmi remain in expansion territory and capex spending remains solid although growth trends have decelerated in recent months as we look across our regional businesses our european business is experiencing the most uncertain economic environment and we expect those challenges to continue for the foreseeable future while we are concerned about some of the broader political and macroeconomic uncertainty including ongoing trade tensions and brexit we ve remained cautiously optimistic that the overall growth trends will continue in 2019 based on the generally solid trends we are experiencing and the success of our focused sales initiatives tempered by ongoing uncertainties in the external environment our initial outlook for 2019 organic growth is in the 3 to 6 range with that let me turn the call over to ted for a more detailed analysis of our results and our outlook for the first quarter of 2019 advertisement advertisement ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks bill and good morning everyone as a reminder today s earnings release includes non gaap measures which are reconciled to the gaap measures in the financial tables that accompany our release and are in the appendix of our accompanying slide presentation we believe the non gaap measures we disclose provide the best representation of our ongoing operational performance bill covered our strong sales and gross margin performance so i will begin with operating expense looking at slide 10 fourth quarter operating expense of 342 7 million compares to prior year operating expense of 317 8 million excluding the non gaap operating expense items detailed on page 11 of our release adjusted operating expense increased 10 7 or 32 2 million to 333 8 million as a percentage of sales current quarter adjusted operating expense of 15 8 compares to 15 in addition to higher volume the primary drivers of the increase in adjusted operating expense were 7 4 million related to the acquired companies 7 2 million related to our innovation and business transformation initiatives and inflationary impacts including higher freight and employee expenses while we have taken actions to help mitigate the impact freight expense remains a year over year headwind adjusted ebitda was flat at 109 million adjusted ebitda increased in all three business segments offset by investment in innovation and business transformation expenses at corporate adjusted ebitda margin of 5 1 compares to 5 4 in the prior year advertisement advertisement let me now review the adjusted ebitda trends by segment beginning with nss as shown on slide 13 adjusted ebitda increased 5 2 to 84 million the resulting adjusted ebitda margin of 7 5 compares to 7 6 the change reflects gross margin improvement offset by higher operating expense including freight increases and incentive compensation on a sequential basis nss adjusted ebitda increased by 30 basis points driven by gross margin improvement ees adjusted ebitda increased 1 8 to 34 million resulting in a 20 basis point improvement in adjusted ebitda margin to 5 9 the increase was driven by gross margin improvement partially offset by higher employee costs including incentive compensation on a sequential basis adjusted ebitda of 34 million compares to 37 million finally ups adjusted ebitda of 26 million compares to 21 million the corresponding adjusted ebitda margin of 5 9 compares to 5 4 strong performance was driven by volume growth combined with strong operating expense leverage resulting in an adjusted ebitda leverage of 1 9 times on a sequential basis ups adjusted ebitda margin improved 50 basis points driven by both gross margin improvement and strong operating expense leverage moving down the income statement interest expense of 19 8 million compares to 19 million the increase was driven by higher average borrowings under the revolving lines of credit due to the recent acquisitions and to support volume driven higher working capital requirements we expect interest expense to increase slightly in the first quarter of 2019 from our q4 level during the fourth quarter we refinanced 350 million of 5 5 8 senior notes due 2019 with 250 million of 6 senior notes due 2025 and the borrowings under the revolving lines of credit advertisement advertisement and we also amended and extended our revolving credit facilities to 2023 we were extremely pleased with these successful transactions in light of the volatile market conditions in the fourth quarter and believe we have ensured adequate capital liquidity for the next several years as a result of the refinancing we have pushed out our debt maturities and increased our financial flexibility our next note maturity is 2021 and our capital structure is in line with our long term strategic targets looking at the foreign exchange and other expense line we had 7 6 million compared to 100 000 in the prior year quarter excluding the 4 6 million of expense related to the loss on the extinguishment of the 2019 senior notes the adjusted fx and other expense of 3 million compares to just 100 000 in the prior year this increase was primarily currency driven turning to taxes our fourth quarter 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 28 6 compares to 38 5 for the full year our 2018 non gaap etr of 29 3 compares to 37 8 in 2017 with the favorable rate changes in both the fourth quarter and full year rates due primarily to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and our country mix of earnings our diluted share count was 34 1 million shares looking ahead we would expect our share count to be approximately 34 2 million in 2019 moving down to eps our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 53 increased by 9 or 0 12 from the year ago quarter as we discussed both copper and currency were headwinds in the quarter the 27 5 million impact on sales translates into a 0 10 unfavorable impact on diluted eps with a disproportionate impact on the ees segment turning to slide 16 our working capital ratio of 18 2 compares to 18 4 in the prior year quarter this 20 basis point improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital efficiency while working capital dollars have increased to support the higher sales growth we continue to drive improvements in our working capital processes to enable more efficient use of our balance sheet we generated 138 million in cash from operations in 2018 which compares to 184 million in 2017 with the change driven by an increase in working capital to support growth in the business despite the improvement in working capital efficiency looking ahead we expect to generate cash flow from operations of 150 million to 175 million for the full year 2019 finally in addition to investing 150 million in the security acquisitions we invested 42 4 million in capital expenditures in 2018 compared to 41 1 million in 2017 we expect to invest 55 million to 60 million in capital expenditures in 2019 with the year over year increase primarily due to our increased investment in innovation and business transformation turning to slide 17 our fourth quarter 2018 debt to capital ratio of 44 4 compares to 46 1 at year end 2017 slightly below our target range of 45 to 50 our debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of three times is at the high end of our target range of 2 5 to three times both metrics reflect the impact of the q2 security acquisitions a weighted average cost of borrowed capital of 5 5 compares to 5 6 at the end of 2017 and our liquidity position remains strong with total available liquidity under revolving lines of credit and secured accounts receivable and inventory facilities of 599 million at the end of the quarter turning to our outlook for sales growth as bill said our outlook range for full year 2019 organic growth is 3 to 6 which compares to 2018 organic growth of 4 8 based on trends in the business through the month of january and supported by generally favorable economic indicators we are estimating first quarter 2019 organic growth to be in the 3 to 5 range as bill indicated we expect gross margin to improve for the year by 20 to 40 basis points in the fourth quarter we saw a 50 basis point improvement in year over year margin and as we look at the first quarter we expect a similar 40 to 50 basis point improvement in gross margin on a year over year basis turning to operating expense for the full year we expect adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales to increase slightly however as bill said we expect the actions we are taking to improve gross margin will both fund investment and innovation and create operating margin expansion looking at the first quarter we expect our adjusted operating expense dollars to decrease slightly on a sequential basis due to somewhat lower volume to further help with your modeling i will provide our estimates for the impacts of currency copper and acquisition on our first quarter and full year 2019 sales as detailed on slide 19 of today s presentation based on the current value of the u s dollar against other currencies we estimate a sales headwind of 25 million to 30 million for the first quarter and a headwind of 40 million to 50 million for the full year based on recent copper prices of approximately 2 70 a pound we estimate unfavorable sales impacts of 10 million to 15 million in the first quarter and 25 million to 30 million for the full year as a reminder average copper price was 3 14 in the first quarter of last year and 2 93 for the full year of 2018 finally the sales impact from the acquired businesses will be approximately 25 million in the first quarter and 50 million for the full year reflecting an incremental 5 months of ownership let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we were pleased to deliver strong sales growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year we believe we have significant opportunity to leverage our unique set of products and innovative solutions across our global network as we discussed our highest priority remains improving gross margin and we are pleased that we are beginning to see the benefits of the actions we have implemented we are also in the early stages of our business transformation which will deliver state of the art customer facing technologies and best in class enterprise efficiencies we expect our investment and innovation to deliver significant long term benefits with the goals of improving profitability generating strong cash flow from operations and creating value for all of our stakeholders with that we will now open the call for questions questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of shawn harrison from longbow research go ahead please your line is open shawn harrison longbow research analyst good morning wanted to delve into the i guess the slowing in the legacy in nss business as well as kind of the industrial business within ees and whether this was a function of just tough comps or was there something in terms of timing or something else going on in the market particularly as we look forward into 2019 bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes shawn it s bill the industrial one as we said was a really tough comps on the q4 of last year if you remember that ees business really started to accelerate in the q4 of 2017 so to us it was actually fairly decent performance on the stack basis on the nss side i believe that that s been consistently improving since the fourth quarter of 17 which was soft if you remember so ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes shawn i m not sure if you re referring to on the nss side slowing on the north america side with growth rates not as high as elsewhere around the world but that s pretty consistent with what we saw throughout the year and was not a big surprise for us we had a couple percent growth in that north american nss business on an organic basis again we were comping a little bit tougher comparisons prior year q4 of 2017 was the best quarter of the year for nss and we were comparing against some high project growth and so forth so we don t feel that that s indicative of a weakness necessarily in that north american business though bill galvin president and chief executive officer shawn i d also say though that if you remember in 2017 we slowed down considerably in the global account because that was the first time we ve seen that in many years and it came back in 18 and a lot of the growth you saw internationally was with multinational customers so it s a function of where these customers were spending investment and that s why you saw stronger growth outside of north america shawn harrison longbow research analyst that s very helpful as a follow up if you look toward the organic growth forecast for calendar 19 if you could maybe offer up nss ees and ups whether they re going to be kind of above the midpoint of that trend line or maybe a little bit below in terms of your expectations bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes good question shawn we can tell you that the ups will probably be above the trends in that continue to strengthen i think the nss will be right in there and i think ees because of the strong comps of 2018 will probably be just below that so aggregating out to that point but that s generally how it s going to look shawn harrison longbow research analyst ok and then lastly just on the gross margin was extraordinary for this quarter up 50 basis points year over year particularly given the strength in ups and the security business so if you could maybe just go underneath the covers a little bit in terms of what exactly happened because usually when you see that type of volume strength in those businesses you don t see that type of gross margin expansion bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes shawn we kind of talked about it on the last call and tried to give you some view into that it is a long term training initiative and process to really improve a lot of different areas it s not just one piece and we expect this to be kind of a long term continuous improvement process for us and it was across the entire company and across many different aspects of where we felt we could get improvement and look as you re driving a global long term strategy sometimes you get away from the fundamentals and i feel like we re back on that and we have a process now that we feel like we can continue to improve on so it was a companywide initiative and great effort by the team on all basis ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer shawn the only thing i would add to bill s comments there as he referred to what we ve done here keep in mind that we were doing this on the heels of the most significant inflationary trends on a material cost side that we ve experienced in probably pushing nearly a decade and so for several quarters of last year we were constantly playing catch up in trying to pass those costs on through to the business and we feel that we have made substantial progress here over the course of say the last four months of 2018 and a lot of that has to do with providing better more timely information to our sales folks as they make pricing decisions shawn harrison longbow research analyst perfect congratulations on the quarter bill galvin president and chief executive officer thanks shawn operator our next question comes from the line of allison poliniak from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst hi guys good morning just to keep on that gross margin and the utility impact i mean is there a way it seems like it technically should have been better on the underlying despite the mix from eps i mean is there any way to help us understand what that mix headwind per se would have been in q4 ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer the mix of the three segments allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst well with ups outgrowth rate so there had to have been some level of mix headwind i think if i go back to the other question is there any way to quantify for that ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the thing i would say allison to keep in mind there was definitely a negative mix impact at the gross margin line but not a negative mix impact at the operating margin line if you look at that business again because it does have a profile with significantly lower operating expense ups growing faster than the other businesses did not have any material measurable impact on the operating margin percentage but it did have slight negative impact at the gross margin line because of the double digit growth that we had in that business allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great thanks and then on just your comments around tempered demand really strong outlook for 19 despite that going on i mean can you maybe expand on that comment are you seeing project delays or just not necessarily quick execution on making decisions about future projects any thoughts there bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes as you look i think we re not seeing and we re watching to allison but we re not seeing any general slowdown of decision processes as a matter of fact we continue to see good project activity in many aspects of the global account side and security and so on so for us the if you remember in nss for instance the acceleration we started to see in backlog and bookings at the end of 17 we kind of missed and thought it d be sooner in 18 but really you could see it come through in the last three quarters of 18 right so we continued to see that activity and you know our exposure in china is limited so we re not seeing any kind of headwinds there and generally we re still seeing activity that leads us to believe we can get the 3 to 5 range that ted mentioned allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great thanks so much operator and our next question comes from the line of david manthey from baird go ahead please your line is open david manthey robert w baird co analyst thanks good morning everyone first off looking at slide 20 when i read things like business transformation and innovation investments are these code words for erp ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer dave i would say no it s not code words for erp what we are doing though is very much a customer facing business process transformation not just to go back to those words and so a big part of our focus is looking at our business processes making it easier for our customers to do business with us but as part of that yes there is a it platform as part of it as you know we ve got a very old homegrown mainframe based system and we ve been already on a journey for the last couple of years if you will moving toward an integrated erp system but that will only take place over a period of several years bill galvin president and chief executive officer david i d add to this too look we re focused on customers how we service our customers how we support them how we integrate with them and how we provide kind of best in class services and for us to continue that journey we need to continue to innovate in both customer facing digital capabilities which we ve been on that journey for many years now as well as other systems so that we can provide the data analytics and the things we need to make good proper decisions in the future and hopefully we painted the picture to everyone that with all the moving pieces the margin improvement other efficiencies that we re driving we ll continue to drive ebitda margin improvement and accelerate that long term by the efficiencies we know we re going to get so it s been a strategic planning process that we ve all been part of and thinking about how we get to those long term goals that we know we can achieve but we need to do some of this additional innovation to do that david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok when we re looking at what amounts to a five year sort of systems project can you give us a little more detail in terms of what this new platform is are you doing it in house are you bringing in an integrator and then when you look out to 2023 and you start to develop these full benefits what are the sources of those benefits bill galvin president and chief executive officer yes good question so to clarify as i said we ve started on this journey a couple of years ago we ve been moving toward an oracle shop as opposed to as i said our in house homegrown systems that we ve relied on for so long and again as a distributor our lifeblood is all about order management inventory management warehouse management that s the core of our integrated operating system going forward but we also will be doing some conversions to global financial systems today especially on the heels of the large acquisitions we ve done more recently we still have disparate systems across our company so the savings that we anticipate driving over time will largely be back office driven but what that doesn t even begin to touch on is the leverage we think we can drive by having the better systems the better data analytics and so forth which will drive even better support for the growth that we re focused on across our business you ve heard us talk about in previous calls and investor meetings and so forth about our customer access strategy and this is really all about helping to support our growth goals as we look at the change in the marketplace and kind of the blurring of the lines if you will between different customers and different technologies ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer and i ll add to that also david that there s innovation in the entire supply chain that s in the market today whether it s block chain or other types of innovation that in order to take advantage of that innovation you have to have the capability to do that so this allows us to then adapt very quickly to new technologies and becomes an important part of it but again i focus on the fact that it s and we called it innovation because it s so many other components it s digital it s other efficiencies that we re driving in the company that will allow us to meet our long term financial goals david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok thanks and then ted just a couple of financial questions first is the operating cash flow if my notes are right here i think last quarter you were guiding to 160 million to 180 million for the full year and you came in at 138 million and i m just wondering if that is the case if i have that right what led to that shortfall over the course of 90 days ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes dave you absolutely got the numbers right on the cash flow for full year fourth quarter and full year 2018 that was lower than what we had projected at the beginning of the quarter but as i said it was completely driven by the higher level of working capital and i would tell you across the buckets of working capital the biggest driver that was higher levels of inventory so even though as i said we improved our working capital efficiency the 18 2 working capital as a percent of sales is the lowest we ve ever had at the end of a year but having said that with the continual up tick in the projects we have in our pipeline and in essence project inventory that we had on hand at year end we did come up a little bit short of that cash flow target so we can feel good about the working capital efficiency we drove but obviously that s an indication of our internal targets were to drive even more efficiency out of that the other thing that s clearly an impact for us as a company that closes our books on a four four five calendar our december our q4 ended on december 28 so that hurt us a little bit also on the ar collections lot of companies are paying under calendar months so our ar whereas it was also up to support the higher sales was up a little bit higher than what we would have expected and we attribute that to the calendar timing as well david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok thanks for that and then last one and then i ll pass it on in light of the investments you re making and so forth could you give us an idea of what we should think about for the unallocated corporate items in 2019 and sort of does that is it even or does it increase through the year and the same thing for d a i would imagine that some of these things are going to be depreciated over time ted dosch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i ll take that in reverse the easy part is no significant increase in d a because what we re developing is going to be done over a multiyear period of time so we won t see that increase in 2019 on the depreciation side separately you re right the bulk of these expenses that we re making in innovation are flowing through our corporate opex not within one of the three individual businesses so whereas we would expect to see that gradually go up over time keep in mind we are with the rate of spend that we ramped up over the course of 2018 including through this fourth quarter we wouldn t see that going up significantly more from the run rate that we exited the year david manthey robert w baird co analyst ok great thanks a lot guys bill galvin president and chief executive officer thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to our presenters for some closing

washington in the six weeks since a confident us federal reserve raised interest rates in response to a strong us economy consumer confidence dropped wholesale prices weakened financial markets wobbled and home sales fell further afield china tried to boost lending for its slowing economy the european central bank acknowledged ebbing growth in the euro zone and the international monetary fund cut its world economic growth forecast and warned that global trade had nosedived as major nations squabbled about tariffs as they conclude their latest two day policy meeting on wednesday fed policymakers will have to decide how big a risk all of that poses to the near decade long us economic expansion their task is made more difficult by the delayed release of key economic data due to the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the us government including important reports on retail sales and gross domestic product if the case for caution wasn t strong enough the sudden onset of a thick economic fog has made it so analysts said ahead of this week s policy decision fed officials are clearly sounding as if they are pausing they don t know exactly what s happened to the economy because the data hasn t been coming through said melanie baker senior economist at royal london asset management the us central bank is scheduled to release its latest policy statement at 2 p m est 1900 gmt with investors widely expecting it to leave its benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged in a target range of 2 25 per cent to 2 50 per cent fed chairman jerome powell is due to hold a press conference shortly after the statement s release analysts at goldman sachs said they expected the fed to water down the language from the december policy statement in which the central bank said some further rate increases would be warranted this year such a move could pave the way for a possibly extended pause in monetary tightening buying the fed the time to see whether unemployment remains low and inflation which by some measures has weakened continues to hover around its 2 per cent target the fed raised rates four times last year amid unexpectedly stronger us economic growth spurring sharp criticism from president donald trump who accused the central bank of undercutting economic growth at its policy meeting in december the fed signalled that it would raise rates twice in 2019 though it is now expected to hold off lifting borrowing costs for at least its next few meetings fed policymakers have been clear they plan to be patient on this front investors on the other hand have fully written off the likelihood of any rate increases this year those expectations could shift in either direction depending on whether the fed s policy statement continues to characterise economic growth as strong and still describes the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced or whether policymakers feel recent events point to slower than expected growth financial markets will also be watching how the fed handles the growing spotlight on its practice of running off up to 50 billion in treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet each month some investors have cited that taper as a cause of recent market turbulence saying the fed has sent a confusing signal as it tacitly puts upward pressure on long term interest rates even as policymakers seem ready to halt for now any more overt moves to raise rates the monthly decreases in the balance sheet are likely to continue but many investors hope powell will in his press conference be more precise about how much longer they may go on
the u s dollar slid and equities surged on wednesday fueled at first by boeing and apple s results and later by the federal reserve pledging to be patient with future interest rate hikes a change in tone stock investors interpreted as a buy signal the fed held interest rates steady at the end of a two day meeting in which it struck language in a december policy statement that projected some further rate hikes would be appropriate in 2019 u s stocks extended their gains and bond yields fell as markets got what they were hoping for said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signaling just a few months ago el erian said scott minerd global chief investment officer at guggenheim partners in santa monica

saying that fed can afford some patience before another rate move and fed chair jerome powell even indicated that fed is flexible to move in either direction if necessary any change in the forward

personally like to thank manny mehos for his constant support and trust over the past few months as we work toward uniting these two great companies i ll start with a couple of exciting announcements our board has adopted our first quarterly dividend of 0 125 per share payable on february 21st for shareholders of record on february 7th and we have finalized and received approval of a buyback agreement for up to 50 million of our common stock during 2019 now on the results fourth quarter was an encouraging quarter for veritex we recorded fourth quarter eps of 0 40 and fully diluted operating eps of 0 47 we continue to see a very strong texas lending market with veritex net loans during the quarter increasing 110 million or 18 annualized 2018 marked the eighth consecutive year of record loan growth for veritex veritex originated new loan commitments in excess of 1 675 billion while green originated just short of 1 2 billion that s almost 3 billion in combined new loan commitments our pipelines remain active and full and we are extremely confident that our 2019 net loan growth will be in the low double digits our texas economy is strong our unemployment rate continued at historic rates of 3 7 with new jobs of 391 000 and 127 000 statewide and dfw respectively texas remains a robust economy as mentioned last quarter we felt our core nim had some upward movement the quarter produced a 9 basis point increase to 3 82 from 3 73 last quarter terry will provide some additional color on the nim in a few moments credit quality has remained very strong net charge offs for the year were virtually non existent non performing assets decreased from 0 80 to 0 77 during the quarter and concentrations remained at acceptable levels additionally we completed the december review of the outstanding green bank loan portfolio to obtain the most current data available and are making the appropriate up to date marks to the acquired portfolio the deposit side of our business continue to be extremely competitive in all of our markets veritex grew deposits 343 million or 15 1 for the calendar year 2018 recognizing that a majority of this growth was in the interest bearing categories we continue to be keenly focused on this side of the business we have multiple levers available to continue to grow our core deposits such as treasury management focused sales efforts relationship manager deposit incentive plans and the creation of a new hoa division we re also looking forward to new customer opportunities provided by the scale achieved with the merger of green now i will turn the call over to terry for some additional color on our numbers terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everybody malcolm definitely did a good job in covering the major highlights for the quarter and there is certainly some good news and results i ll move to now drill down into numbers and try to give you a sense of the earnings power of the new combined company i ll just start by acknowledging that by including the discussion of green results in the press release it does make it very long but the importance of the green acquisition to the veritex financials along with the desire to be totally transparent led us to conclude this presentation approach was best finally while gaap reporting is certainly important and required i m going to focus most of my comments on combined operating results even though the slides reflect the companies on a stand alone basis turning to slide five in the deck malcolm has already commented on the key financial results for the quarter so i just want to spend a minute focusing on a couple of other points the combined and annualized fourth quarter operating net income for green and veritex totaled 111 million again combined and annualized this translates into 2 04 in fully diluted earnings per share and you get there by adding the fully diluted shares for both companies and applying the exchange rate for the merger this earnings level should give everyone a sense of the run rate earnings power before 2019 growth the impact of the cost saves and the balance sheet marks on slide six just please note the growth in tangible book value per share in q4 with veritex ending the year at 14 57 and green at 11 18 obviously the tangible book value will change materially on january 1st with the closing of the merger the work on the fair value marks for the balance sheet is still under way but veritex remains confident that is earlier estimates of upfront tbv dilution from balance sheet marks and merger cost remain materially correct in the aggregate turning to the next slide these graphs demonstrate this earnings power i ve been talking about of the two companies and show the pre tax pre provision operating earnings contribution as well this level of pre tax pre provision operating earnings bodes well as we move later and later in the credit cycle both companies are producing strong operating results clearly the level of excess capital being carried by the two companies will be significantly lower from the merger coupled with the initiation of the dividend and the announcement of the buyback the merger and these capital management actions should result in significantly higher returns on tangible common equity going forward on slide eight both companies were already very efficient on an operating basis before we see the benefits of the cost saves related to the merger with the conversion and branch consolidations planned for the end of the second quarter the bulk of the cost saves will be back end loaded there has been a small portion of the overall savings that were realized late in 2018 and that level will increase in q1 and q2 with scheduled employee departures and other cost saving integration activities on a combined basis loan production increased approximately 77 from 2017 to 2018 to the almost 3 billion number that malcolm mentioned earlier the planned divestiture of green s austin branch was announced late in q4 and is expected to close in late q1 loan growth on a combined basis excluding the impact of the austin loans which are classified as held for sale was approximately 530 million or almost 10 in 2018 this growth was achieved in spite of the distraction from the merger and the work on the integration management remains confident in our ability to achieve low double digit loan growth in 2019 commercial real estate concentrations remained steady in q4 and should not be a constraint on loan growth as we go through 2019 on slide 10 the combined non interest bearing dda portfolio is almost 1 5 billion and represents approximately 24 of total deposits total deposit costs continued to increase but remember please consider the loan beta where we have almost 70 floating rates additionally the branch light business model provides other expense synergies given the 6 1 billion in deposits with only 43 banking offices turning to slide 11 now the increase in contractual loan rates from q3 to q4 for both veritex and green highlights the floating rate nature of our loan portfolio and the combined interest net interest margin in q4 was 3 84 as we look out into 2019 the companies is expecting a net interest margin in the range of 4 05 to 4 2 this is the this range assumes no fed fund rate increases and is a result of first the purchase accounting marks on loans and investments second the rate marks on the time deposits and borrowings and third a favorable mix shift in both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities finally on slide 12 as malcolm stated earlier q4 reflected continued credit stability at veritex with a slight decline in npas and green has shown considerable improvement in npas since the end of q1 also recall that the credit mark was refreshed at green right before year end and should provide considerable downside protection as it relates to net charge offs and loan loss provisions it s important to note that post merger approximately 63 of the loan portfolio now carries a credit mark and the part that isn t marked has been underwritten to veritex credit standards and continues to show exceptional loss performance with that i d like to turn the call back malcolm charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thank you terry as you might imagine we have a lot of moving parts right now consolidating our two institutions the integration of our systems and teams is going extremely well personnel and management determinations have been made and communicated companywide over the last months we offered 18 retention agreements to key green producers with a 100 acceptance rate other highlights include us hiring our first ever full time training director from the green side and engage in a brand agency to better connect with our customers additionally our cio just hired a new chief technology officer to lead us in our growing technology area candidly i ve never seen this much communication and collaboration between similar sized institutions while coming together we have a great deal of work to accomplish and our goal is to have a majority of it completed by june 30 we ll continue to monitor us we will take the best of each institution to produce a better company and stronger than either one of us was independently increased scale and countless new opportunities enhance our new veritex and our excitement about what we can build together in 2019 and beyond operator at this time we d be happy to answer any questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of matt olney from stephens you may begin matt olney stephens analyst hi thanks good morning guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matt olney stephens analyst want to start on capital you had some interesting announcements last night as far as the stock repurchase program the dividend i think they all make sense curious on the buyback how active do you expect to be is this more of an insurance policy in case the stock gets down to below 22 again and then on the pro forma tce ratio i guess with green bank i want to make sure i m thinking about this right i m about at 9 5 tce ratio in the first quarter am i in the right ballpark there charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer go ahead terry terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt it s terry let me take your last question first i think you are in the right ballpark with respect to tce at the end of q1 you know and on the buyback i would i do view it more as an insurance policy although i would probably put a little bit higher number on it than you did you used 22 so let s just let s leave it there i think the last point i would make is that this company is going to generate a lot of excess capital even with the earnings power and so it s a great problem to have but certainly the dividend and if we need the buyback we re going to stay given our risk profile we ll have plenty of capital to support the growth we need in our key markets matt olney stephens analyst okay that s perfect thank you for that and then on the cost savings i think you said in the prepared remarks there was a small portion of the cost saves that were recognized at the end of 2018 so just taking a step back any change in the overall cost saving expectations and can you kind of firm up for us the timing of those cost savings i think you said they would be back half loaded any other color you can provide on the timing of the cost saves terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well i chose those remarks carefully and you ll note that we gave guidance on nim and we felt like we needed to give guidance on the nim because the range of everybody out there who writes on us was so wide especially in q1 and it felt like there was a need to clarify and tighten that up a little bit we didn t say anything on the efficiency because i felt like you got in the cost saves because my general view is you guys have done pretty good job there and you know it will have we will have we will realize additional saves in the first half of the year whether it d be personnel or non personnel related things but when you got your consolidation and your conversion at in june that s when you re really going to start to see the operational saves and things like that so i don t know i ll probably just leave it there charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think you re on the cost save number we it moves within the number but then the total that we had originally when we originally looked at the deal is virtually the same matt olney stephens analyst okay all right guys i ll step back in the queue thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brady gailey from kbw your line is now open brady gailey kbw analyst hey good morning guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning brady brady gailey kbw analyst so the 2019 nim guidance of the 4 05 to 4 20 i got that how are you all thinking about the core nim for 2019 i m just trying to figure out how much yield accretion will be flowing through the margin this year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer my estimates of yield accretion on the loan side are probably in the 9 to 10 basis points range well let me say 8 to 9 basis points sorry needed to look back at my notes 8 to 9 basis points brady gailey kbw analyst okay yeah so a core margin somewhere in kind of the high 3 low 4 range is that correct terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer no no i mean well not yet let s be careful as you know that when i say 8 to 9 bps on the loan portfolio there s another 4 to 5 bps on the investment portfolio and there s some on the liability side so i don t see the core nim doing a lot it might be up a handful basis points but both from earning assets as well as the december fed increase but that s the way i think about this brady gailey kbw analyst okay right that s helpful and then just on the m a front i know it feels a little early to ask about m a just because it s still the big deal and i know you are going to be focused on it for the at least the first half of the year if not the full year but i mean both green and veritex have been pretty acquisitive in the past how are you all and you ll be around 8 billion so you got not a ton of room until you hit 10 billion how are you all thinking about m a for the back half of this year and into 2020 charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer we re thinking about it the back half really we re thinking about it 2020 i mean you hit the nail on the head we this is a big deal for both of us we are zero focused on making sure this integration goes well and it is going exceedingly well but there is a bunch of stuff to do between now and 6 30 that the m a discussion has really been off the table until we can get through 6 30 and we even have a small little piece of our data converting in september it s a smaller piece it s a treasury piece but we ve got a lot to get done here and so if we do what we think we can do and we can deliver what we think we can deliver then we re going to have some optionality in the back half of the year and going into in 2020 to make some of those decisions but those are decisions that we ll make down the road brady gailey kbw analyst okay great thanks guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks brady terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brady operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brad milsaps from sandler o neill you may begin brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst hey guys good morning charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer hey brad brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst terry i just wanted to follow up on the whole core nim discussion it looks like maybe you changed the way you presented to some degree in that the core nim as you define it includes some level of expected purchase accounting and then anything above that is sort of the accelerated piece is that correct terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that is correct in my view the scheduled accretion is no different than buying the loan portfolio is like buying a bond at a discount and it s got a life and when you look at veritex s stand alone accretion in the fourth quarter one it was down materially which drove the decline in the nim but there is if you take the remaining marks accretable yield and look at it and look at q4 we got 17 quarters if the level stays exactly the same and so of life left in those marks if you will 17 quarters and i just think that bodes well and it s an ongoing revenue stream that needs to be considered as core because it really has got a pretty long life on it so yeah we ve changed that s why we ve changed i guess reflecting my view of that scheduled accretion as part of the yield that you priced into the deal when you marked the balance sheet and announced a deal and that s the way we ought to treat it and if there s anything above that then we ought to call that out because that is lumpy and unusual brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst got it so the 4 05 to 4 20 would include everything the accelerated and the expected or that s just the expected terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer that s the expected brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay so then it could there could be upside if you get something accelerated terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer correct brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay and then you said you expressed comfort with kind of the efficiency expenses that are out there does that include like any new update on cdi because you have new marks here terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer when yes we have it does include cdi both the positive impact of wiping out the green and the estimated cdi from the merger our work on the cdi is not yet complete but i just really don t think it s going to change materially from what was filed in the s 4 brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay great and then just a final question on fees specifically sba i think if i read correctly it would sound like veritex had a pretty good sba quarter maybe you guys did and may have that flip flop but just kind of curious what s all going on with that product kind of how you think about that kind of a on a combined basis charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean we it s still a major focus for us both companies were very active and had folks in at the green the green guy is going to be leading us there we think it has understandably slowed down a little bit but we still think that we will be fairly active i think we re kind of looking at about 1 5 million or so a quarter in usda and sba but that s those are lumpy as you know so those usda deals show up and you could have a great quarter and the next quarter be a little bit down but that s still a very very much a focus for us the 10 year product is pretty difficult to sell right now just because of the pricing the 25 year product you still get some really good pricing so we ll make those decisions depending on what the markets are but it s still a major piece of what we re going to have for next year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer and but tagging on the great thing about the usda product is you don t have to split the premium over 10 so the economics are even better it s lumpy but it s going to have even more great focus for us going forward and the rest of what malcolm said i totally agree with brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst great thank you guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks brad terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brad operator and our next question comes from the line of gary tenner from d a davidson you may begin gary tenner d a davidson analyst good morning charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning gary tenner d a davidson analyst some of my questions have been answered good morning couple of questions though i guess in terms of fees for the combined company are there any fee categories where maybe the structure or types of fees differed materially whether there d be any sort of meaningful difference than just the combination of the two companies fee items charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer no i mean i think the combination is accurate green definitely had a really nice non interest income treasury fee product products which we re going to be adopting but combining them together i think is very accurate terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer i do think it s the place where they we see revenue synergies trying to leverage that customized green treasury management code across the veritex footprint and the green within the customer interest rate swap business and that s something we d like to see expand across the veritex footprint so but malcolm s right it s combining it and thus just focusing on it and growing it gary tenner d a davidson analyst okay thanks for that and actually as you mentioned the swap book and the swap business with prospects of a fed pause and not knowing where they ll go after this and you noted the large amount of your loans that are floating rate in nature any thoughts in terms of sort of moderating or adjusting the rate sensitivity at this point in the cycle terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well we ve now run we ve got three quarters we ve already run on the pro forma combined basis for the institution and i m pretty comfortable with where the asset sensitivity is i d say it s modestly or moderately asset sensitive it s come down with some fixed rate lending that we ve done in the back half of the quarter we re certainly not neutral or not liability sensitive but i m pretty comfortable with where we are and i don t see the need i think the asset duration we have i want to use in the owner occupied commercial real estate book to help us drive deposits and operating from operating businesses so we ve got the ability to do that we will continue to do it i think it will keep us neutral and i like what it can help us do on the deposit side so feeling pretty good there gary tenner d a davidson analyst all right thank you very much charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks gary operator and our next question comes from the line of daniel mannix from raymond james you may begin daniel mannix raymond james analyst hey guys good morning charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer hey daniel terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer hey daniel daniel mannix raymond james analyst appreciate the updated outlook here i want to start with credits so maybe clay want to ask it looked like the credit metrics regained their footing this quarter can you give us an update on those three pci loans that were removed to non performing last quarter in 3q michael clayton riebe executive vice president and chief credit officer sure sure we can the first credit that was in the auto industry that loan resolved and is on a performing basis today the other two credits that are in the oil and gas space we expected one to resolve in the fourth quarter through a refinance that has not taken place we continue to work that credit and the final credit was another oil and gas credit that s in the bankruptcy today and we expect that to resolve in q2 of this year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer no additional marks or anything on any of those credits valuations has stayed pretty stable michael clayton riebe executive vice president and chief credit officer right daniel mannix raymond james analyst got it so adequately reserved michael clayton riebe executive vice president and chief credit officer yes terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sir daniel mannix raymond james analyst great okay and then just wanted to switch over to deposits looked like there was sequential declines in the core deposits after what was really a great third quarter how much of that fourth quarter decline is seasonal or i guess transitory in nature i mean i and i totally understand the high loan growth and tilt toward commercial what how that impacts deposit costs and betas but how do you see those trending this year and 2019 charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer seasonal probably isn t the right word but they are opportunistic and that there were a couple of large company sales that happened in the third quarter that were substantial and so those money sat around for 60 to 120 days while they reinvested and did whatever they did with those dollars we still know that deposits are probably one of our largest challenges we do have a bunch of levers to pull this market is still growing it s quite robust but it is very competitive the good news is that at least on the loan side we continue to move our loan yields up and as we move up our deposit side but we have seen some flattening i guess locally in terms of cost and so is the competition the same yes but i think it s at a lesser price which is encouraging to us but it s just it s something that s got to be top of mind for all of our relationship managers and in my management team it is the most frequently talked about subject but we still feel good about getting our growth next year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we ve also increased the weight we give it in our lender incentive plan to support that importance and view of the challenge it represents for us so hopefully that will contribute as well daniel mannix raymond james analyst yeah that s really helpful i appreciate the additional color on those deposit growth strategies so just wanted to confirm there are you still targeting that 95 loan to deposit ratio for the combined company terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sir daniel mannix raymond james analyst great all right that s it from me thanks gentlemen charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks daniel terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks daniel operator and our next question comes from the line of bill dezellem from tieton capital management you may begin bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst thank you i had a couple of questions first of all your i guess i should say veritex s salaries and employee benefits was up by roughly 900 000 versus the third quarter would you please walk us through what was behind that and then secondarily terry you d mentioned that the combined entity had 2 04 of earnings when annualized is that the number that we should be taking that 25 accretion on that you originally noted when the combination was announced terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer let me take let me start the first there on veritex salaries i think there s two things that are playing into the increase in the salary line first is variable incentives driven by growth and production by the by our bankers so it was a strong it s strong growth translated into better incentives for them secondly though even though we had a lot of growth production was actually down and veritex has been talking for several quarters now about a lot of production that was going to fund up and i think that was what was going on so production was down a little so our cost deferral under fas 91 was less and so the combination of higher variable incentives and lower cost deferral is what s contributing to the salary line on the second question i went blank charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer it is on the 2 04 terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer 2 04 yeah i think that s look we i gave you that number because i think it s indicative of what our run rate earnings are as we jump off into 2019 before those things and so we certainly didn t know on july 24th exactly what our q4 run rate earnings were going to be but i think our comments and everything still generally we re not sitting here and giving guidance that or comments that would change that guidance so it s in the range of when you get to a nim of 4 05 to 4 20 it puts you in a similar place with respect to that accretion eps accretion we originally discussed when we announced the merger bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst and the 2 04 that s the combined annualized is the correct base to be using that on as opposed to veritex only or i just want to make sure that we don t start doing a 25 accretion on the wrong base terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well it gets you to the the comment was based on veritex the merger announcement was based on veritex s eps expectations for 2019 so i mean you re layering in the green earnings but you re layering in the green fully diluted shares as well so the calculation was different what i m really saying that what you suggested gets you into the right range if you will of where we think about 2019 performance bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst okay thank you for the clarity and i appreciate the help charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of matt olney from stephens you may begin matt olney stephens analyst hey thanks for taking the follow up i just wanted to understand the one time expenses for 2019 as a result of the acquisition kind of the timing and the amount we should be expecting terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt it s terry we timing we want them to be front end loaded at first half of the year and i would estimate that we have about two thirds of them to go and they there will be a lot in q1 with the closing of the deal and the advisory cost and some of the severance et cetera so we certainly have got about again about two thirds to go with i think and i would say that will be weighted a little bit toward q1 over q2 matt olney stephens analyst okay and then on the green bank side i think there was a larger charge off than we ve seen for a few quarters now any color was that cleanup or anything you can tell us about that charge off or just credit in general at green bank terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that charge off related to the syndicated healthcare credit that green identified in q1 and provided for and so that bankrupt that company went into bankruptcy and that during q4 that bankruptcy was resolved and green was paid down on its unreserved portion if you will and so we were just cleaning it up we had gotten far enough along we had real clarity on what the charge off needed to be and we dealt right to get that done in 12 31 so matt olney stephens analyst and outside of that terry it looks like non accrual levels fell at green bank so i assume there is no other color there or any other details on the green bank credit piece terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer no it s actually moving in the right direction matt olney stephens analyst perfect terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer and that s all before the march that we re going to make on the portfolio so we feel really good about their portfolio matt olney stephens analyst okay and then circling back to the margin discussion i looked at my notes and i believe the mark that we talked about last time on that sub debt and maybe some trust preferreds was around 8 million is that still the right ballpark number or has that moved around with rates being volatile terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer it s i think it s rates have moved up and moved back down i m still using as i think about things that same general number that work is still that we ve been more focused on the loan and investment side than on the liability side of the balance sheet on the marks so far in january but i think you re probably still in the ballpark matt olney stephens analyst and just how do i think about the duration of some of these moving pieces so take that first one on the sub debt part what s the duration of something like that terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well the bulk of the marks coming out of the green sub debt which was put on in december of 16 it s a 10 year no call 5 so you got three years to run it was expensive when issued and that we would expect to actively refinance it when the time comes so that s the way i would think about that the other liability marks are going to be relatively short the federal home loan bank advances are all inside of 18 months and the duration of the cd portfolio on average is probably about a year i mean it s as is most i don t think in my entire career i ll be ever seeing a cd book with a duration of more than inaudible it s a that s where so they don t have long lives matt olney stephens analyst and what about the duration on the loan side terry what s your best guess of that terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that s got it s that s probably four to five years and the same is true in the investment portfolio i talked about the yield the nim pickup and the investment portfolio it s got a effective duration if at probably around about 4 1 years so yeah so it s got a pretty good tail on it as well matt olney stephens analyst okay all right this is challenging my accounting knowledge but i ll do the best i can on this thanks guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer so be it thanks matt terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks matt operator operators instructions and i m showing no questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to malcolm for closing remarks charles

by danilo masoni milan reuters world stocks and the dollar steadied on wednesday ahead of policy guidance from the u s federal reserve with apple results providing relief while market confidence that a no deal brexit can be avoided took a hit the msci world equity index which tracks shares in 47 countries was 0 1 percent higher by 1140 gmt following gains in asia overnight and a muted start to trading in europe the pan european stoxx 600 benchmark index was also up by 0 1 percent investors pondered the possibility of a no deal british departure from the european union after uk lawmakers instructed prime minister theresa may on tuesday to reopen the treaty she had negotiated with brussels to replace a divisive irish border arrangement while a no deal scenario is still unlikely these developments increase the risk of accidentally leaving the eu without a deal and plans may intensify from both sides to manage that outcome said bethany payne global bonds portfolio manager at janus henderson goldman sachs upped its no deal brexit probability to 15 percent from 10 percent and cut the chance of brexit not happening at all to 35 percent from 40 percent worries over a disorderly exit of britain from the club it joined in 1973 hammered the pound overnight and that in turn helped lift the internationally exposed uk top share index by 1 3 percent in late morning deals sterling recovered to be up 0 25 percent at 1 3101 suggesting investors remained hopeful that a chaotic brexit could still be avoided even though brussels has indicated that the divorce deal was not up for renegotiation talks between the sides continued european council president donald tusk and british prime minister theresa may will have a phone call about brexit later on wednesday an eu source said earlier apple results provided some reassurance as the iphone maker reported sharp growth in its services business investors were relieved that there was no more bad news after the company shocked

for the last 18 months the cambodian government has seen foreign conspiracies everywhere it looks the largest opposition party the cambodia national rescue party cnrp was plotting a coup with american backing the government says and was summarily dissolved by the supreme court in november 2017 as a result the cnrp s president kem sokha was also arrested for treason though the government gave scant evidence of this the list goes on two reporters for radio free asia were charged with espionage in late 2017 an australian filmmaker was convicted as a spy for filming a cnrp rally there are numerous other instances of the government s myopic mirages of cambodians from senior opposition politicians to jaded social media users who are plotting its downfall amid this the ruling cambodian people s party cpp which came in power in 1979 thanks ironically largely to the support of the vietnamese military in ousting the genocidal khmer rouge claims that it is the protector of peace and stability and the only guarantor of cambodia s national sovereignty and independence cambodia s sovereignty it says is now also at stake as the european union eu threatens to remove cambodia from a preferential trade deal unless the cpp s political chokehold loosens this is important under the everything but arms eba scheme which grants most cambodian exports into europe duty free status cambodia exported roughly 5 8 billion worth of goods to the eu in 2017 making europe its largest export market and main purchaser of its most profitable products garments and footwear the government s response to possible sanctions has oscillated between victimhood and vainglory between saying cambodia s economy won t be too badly affected by the eba s withdrawal and saying that if the eu goes ahead with its threat it will destroy of livelihoods of millions of cambodians mostly the poor naturally enough the government has been steadfast in calling possible sanctions an assault on cambodia s national sovereignty and independence in reality however all the eu is doing is reaffirming the conditions of a benevolent trade scheme that explicitly stipulates standards on democracy human rights and a free society as previsions for membership the cambodian government doesn t have to accept the eu s demands of course brussels isn t threatening to physically intervene in cambodia indeed the choice is clear the cambodian government can do what it likes just not if it wants the trade benefits europe offers and which happen to prop up cambodia s export driven economy prime minister hun sen has recently responded with his own violent ultimatum if you want the opposition dead just cut it he said earlier this month referring to the eba s withdrawal and the death of the cnrp if you want the opposition alive don t do it and come and hold talks together but he stands to lose much more despite the cambodian government s perception of hostility is the eu s position different from any other trade deal when china offers cambodia millions of dollars worth of loans which is has on numerous occasions including 600 million just last week they come with conditions obviously china doesn t say that the cambodian government can set whatever terms it likes and then beijing will blindly comply no beijing states what amount should be paid back with how much interest and when among many other conditions some of which are controversial and importantly in order to meet these repayments the cambodian government must change its domestic policy so that its national debt doesn t grow too costly and there is enough money to make loan repayments the government modifies its budget it must curb spending so that it has enough capital to repay the debt is this an affront to cambodia s sovereignty most people correctly think not isn t this also the case with foreign investment hasn t the cambodian government changed its laws to attract foreign investors one only has to look at the tax cuts special economic zones higher wages and more investment in infrastructure among other policies that the government has introduced over the decades to boost investment there are other analogies too cambodia is party to numerous international treaties while it must change its domestic laws to comply with rules set by the world trade organization and the association of southeast asian nations asean what about changes of the law required by free trade deals are they infringements on its independence and sovereignty the cambodian government has never thought so the point is that the government often has to change its domestic laws so it can enjoy the benefits provided by trading with foreign nations making adaptions to stay within the eba scheme is on paper no different the only actual difference is the eu s conditions mean the cpp will have to loosen its political stranglehold something less palatable than tax cuts a few other observations first it is not cambodia s inherent right to be part of the eba scheme it was designed by the eu to help boost the developing economies second the scheme lays out clearly what conditions must be upheld if a country wants to remain part of the deal it isn t as though the cambodian government has suddenly been informed of these they were in black and white when it joined the eba scheme years ago my colleague luke hunt spelled this out clearly in the diplomat recently eba is not a trade pact open to negotiations it is a trade preference gifted to financially impoverished countries and designed to encourage democratic and social reforms more attuned with european standards whose taxpayers are footing the bill this brings up my last point remember too that many european businesses lose out because of the eba scheme providing cheap cambodian exports with duty free status of course negatively impacts european producers who cannot compete with the costs this was the chief reason why unrelated to the eba scheme the eu this month imposed tariffs on cambodia produced indica rice exports so as to safeguard italian and spanish rice growers as hunt also notes the eba scheme costs european taxpayers who are basically subsidizing cambodian exporters is it not then within the sovereignty of the eu and european nations to determine who remains part of the eba scheme or more so the right of european states to protect their own producers even if this comes at the cost of cambodian workers interestingly enough sovereignty and independence cut both ways in the end all talk of national sovereignty and european inequity is up against a ticking clock factory owners in cambodia are troubled by possibly having to pay tariffs in the future and some appear to be bailing out while investors also seem to be putting their money in countries other than cambodia where labor is now cheaper and infrastructure better things will only worsen as uncertainty lingers over cambodia s eba status no one in truth thinks that the eu really wants to remove cambodia from its eba scheme out of malice most of its politicians just want to see some political progress in the country and think economic threats are the best way of achieving it but they have now laid down their conditions which every policymaker in phnom penh clearly understands so it is up to the cambodian government to respond like with any other trade deal the government doesn t have to agree to them but it ought not to get angry when it cannot have it cake and eat it too isn t there another cliché about biting the hand that feeds
editor s introductory note part 1 of this article on the mexico currency devaluation was posted on tuesday january 29 2019 today part 2 concludes this article in part 1 i described how while i was living and teaching in mexico in 1982 there was a nearly 50 devaluation of the mexican peso resulting in major economic hardship for the average citizen in this installment i would like to share a few lessons i learned from experiencing a currency devaluation essentially an economic collapse and how these lessons can help us prepare for a similar or much worse collapse in the future i would like to start by re visiting my lesson 1 rules can be broken i thought i was safe by having my money deposited in a mexican bank in dollars instead of pesos wrong as i mentioned in part 1 i was shocked to learn that in order to withdraw my dollars according to the new rules those dollars first had to be converted to pesos at the new exchange rate and then i would get my dollars so figuring i might as well get something instead of possibly seeing the bank closing and getting nothing i went ahead and withdrew my money the shocks will come in waves before the mexico currency devaluation the exchange rate was 27 pesos to the dollar after the first of two devaluations the rate skyrocketed to 45 pesos to the dollar six months later there was a second devaluation sending the rate to 69 pesos to the dollar so suppose you have 1 000 in the bank pre devaluation those dollars are equal to 27 000 pesos yes it was common back then to carry 500 or 1 000 peso bills around so in that initial devaluation we all lost nearly 50 or our buying power and in the later devaluation another 20 or so so since rules can be and in fact have been broken who do we really believe if you have your money deposited in a bank remember even though you have been told your money is safe is it really from past experience i would say no but what about certificates of deposit cds for example so what if you can earn 2 8 interest on a six month cd if the bank closes down or institutes capital controls how safe are you then now regarding capital controls or limits banks place on withdrawals did you know that banks including banks in the u s already have capital controls in place a few years ago my wife and i wanted to buy a used recreational vehicle rv from a private party i went to my local credit union and needed to withdraw around 9 500 the teller told me i m sorry sir we re going to need some time to complete this withdrawal i replied how much time she said they would need an extra day to transfer the cash from one of their other branches to complete the full amount so i waited and got my cash but the point is banks and credit unions don t have all that much cash laying around at any given time i m sure this is in part to reduce their liability in case of a robbery but it s also due to the practice known as fractional reserve banking a system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and are available for withdrawal the rest of the money is tied up in loans and risky investments such as derivatives more on that later a mexico currency devaluation redux imagine what things will be like in a run on the banks which i experienced in the mexico currency devaluation in 1982 for a while the banks will either impose a limit on withdrawals or will charge depositors to withdraw their money as i mentioned in the previous article in the cyprus bail in crisis of 2013 depositors with more than 130 000 lost 9 9 of their money a surcharge depositors with amounts less than 130 000 were clipped for 6 75 of their deposits even if they were insured remember rules can be broken and new rules can be written at will and you can bet the new rules won t benefit you and me do you think you re safe with your gold and jewels in a safety deposit box think again in greece there are plans raid bank safety deposit boxes to confiscate cash bonds and even works of art just to pay off government debt in italy in 2016 and 2017 when a few key italian banks veneto banca and banca populare di vicenza were on the verge of failure the solution was an investor bail in this is when bank stockholders and bondholders are forced to pay large amounts just to keep the bank afloat so much for a safe and profitable investment also it s not just your bank account that is at risk in greece pension funds have been cut at least 10 times in the past few years in california the california public employees retirement system calpers one of the nation s largest has lost 100 billion dollars dating back to the 2007 08 recession only about 2 3 of current and future retirees are covered by current reserves in fact governments in several states are already reducing their previously agreed upon contributions for government pension funds in illinois in 2013 pension benefits were slashed for employees to avert failure of the fund which was facing a 100 billion shortfall and there are many other examples my point in describing the mexico currency devaluation is rules can be broken and in many cases the rules for our government banks credit unions financial institutions and pensions are already being broken and rewritten as we speak time to make some changes so you may ask what can i do i can understand not wanting to do anything to jeopardize your retirement contributions however what about your savings and any other investments you may have for example if you have an annuity you can cash it in under certain circumstances if you have a 401k if you are younger than 59½ years old you can withdraw it with a 10 penalty plus any taxes on it to avoid penalties some investment funds will allow you to take out a loan on your investment without taxes and penalties as long as you make minimum payments to repay it if you have cds you can either wait until they mature to withdraw your funds or pay a penalty and at least get your cash most cd early withdrawals will only charge a certain portion of your interest and not the principal but check with your broker for details on this now what about stocks and bonds we have seen some wild swings in the stock market lately the dow jones hit an all time high of 26 828 in october last year then fell 4 the following week the market has since gone up and down but the key concern here is volatility even though the economy has mostly recovered in the past year or so there is so much uncertainty especially with the government shutdown immigration and the 800 lb twin gorillas of the current 21 6 trillion government debt and 1 2 quadrillion derivative exposure worldwide now when some of those derivative deals the banks and other institutions have made start going sour guess who will be asked to bail them out before they close their doors that s right you and me get tangible now some of you might ask do i think a future collapse will be partial and or gradual or complete and sudden the answer is i have no idea however i have had enough experience in at least a partial collapse in the mexico currency devaluation to have a strong desire to take action ahead of time instead of waiting for fate to close in on me whether gradually or suddenly i have had enough experience from the past to know that i should take action now buy those essentials now before their prices skyrocket or when they become totally unavailable what should you buy buy land buy non perishable food buy gold and or silver buy anything but keeping your money locked up in a bank or investment house where the future rules are bound to be broken and you end up paying for it when it comes to the government banks and other institutions trust no one take care of yourself and your family now instead of kicking yourself later on for not taking action sooner

differ from management s expectations and with that i will turn the call over to john more from the motley fool john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer thank you bob and good morning everyone thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call in my opening remarks i want to highlight some of the headline themes that we ll be discussing with you today a strength of our business model is the ability to rebalance our portfolio between contractual and spot market freight as market conditions change in periods of market dislocation we experience higher levels of repricing activity across our portfolio then as routing guides perform more effectively and freight costs decelerate we tend to see our volume shift more heavily toward contractual business accompanied by net revenue growth and margin expansion this outcome is clearly reflected in our fourth quarter results over an extended freight cycle we continue to believe that honoring our commitments on contractual freight while also securing spot market capacity is the best way to serve our network of customers and carriers grow our business and create value for shareholders with fluctuating levels of freight demand and carrier supply significant weather events and changes in tariff activity and government regulations the last few years have marked a period of high volatility in the freight market a critical part of our strategy is to make investments that add value for our customers and carriers and drive growth for our business regardless of where we are in the freight cycle we are proud of the strong financial results we delivered in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 and believe that they are a reflection of our strategy of through cycle investments our north american surface transportation business did an excellent job of supporting our customers and carriers through a volatile freight market and delivered outstanding results for the year our global forwarding business delivered strong revenue growth through a combination of volume increases and pricing adjustments that reflect market conditions while also making investments to drive future growth our robinson fresh business delivered significantly improved results in the second half of the year and finished the year with net revenue growth and operating margin expansion with those introductory comments i ll turn it over to andy to review our financial statements andrew clarke chief executive officer thank you john and good morning everyone i d like to begin my comments on the financial results by highlighting the fact that robinson achieved record results across the board gross revenues net revenues and operating income for both the quarter and the full year were at all time highs all three of our reportable segments contributed to this success by growing both net revenues and operating income at a double digit rate in the fourth quarter each segment expanded operating margin significantly in the quarter as well from a cash flow perspective we knocked it out of the park generating over 700 million in free cash flow and returning nearly 600 million to our shareholders during the year our enterprise platform has been carefully and thoughtfully constructed over many years for both scale and leverage through all types of environments and cycles we are appropriately proud of this performance now on to slide 4 and our financial results fourth quarter total revenues increased 4 5 to 4 1 billion driven by higher pricing across most transportation service lines volume growth in ltl ocean and customs and higher fuel costs total company net revenues increased 82 million or 13 in the quarter to 714 million net revenue growth was led by truckload services up 53 million and ltl services up 12 million we delivered double digit net revenue growth in ocean air and customs for a combined increase of 15 million in the quarter fourth quarter monthly net revenue per business day was up 10 11 and 13 respectively in october november and december total operating expenses increased 37 million an 8 9 increase versus the prior year period personnel expenses increased 8 9 primarily as a result of increases in our performance based compensation that aligns the interests of our employees with our shareholders total company average headcount increased slightly in the quarter and slowed sequentially from the 2 6 growth in the third quarter the fourth quarter included headcount reductions in both global forwarding and robinson fresh sg a expenses were up 8 8 in the quarter to 119 million the primary drivers were increases in outside professional services occupancy and travel and entertainment costs total operating income was a record 256 million in the fourth quarter up 21 2 over last year operating margin expanded 240 basis points versus last year and 40 basis points sequentially to 35 8 our teams did an excellent job of achieving operating margin leverage in the quarter and the year this has been and will remain a top priority for our organization fourth quarter net income was 187 million an increase of 22 7 our diluted earnings per share was 1 34 in the fourth quarter up from 1 08 last year slide 5 covers other income statement items the fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23 9 up from 21 1 last year recall that the year ago period included one time tax benefits totaling 31 8 million for the full year our tax rate was 24 5 and we expect our effective tax rate to be between 24 25 again in 2019 as noted throughout the year we adopted the new accounting standards update for revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018 as a result in transit shipments are now included in our financial results this policy did not have a material impact on our overall operating results for the year however it did significantly decrease gross revenues in our robinson fresh sourcing business including a 37 million reduction in the fourth quarter of this year for the full year sourcing gross revenues were negatively impacted by 121 million fourth quarter interest and other expense totaled 9 5 million down from 17 5 million last year every quarter we are required to revalue our u s dollar working capital and cash balances against the functional currency in each country where we conduct business and hold u s dollars the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the income statement the u s dollar strengthened against several of our key currencies this quarter resulting in a 2 4 million gain from currency revaluation movements in currency valuations will continue to have an impact on our quarterly net income and we will continue to break out this impact in future quarters the gain in currency valuation was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates while overall debt balance was down our share count in the quarter was down just over 1 as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans turning to slide 6 we had another strong quarter of cash generation cash flow from operations totaled 264 million in the quarter up 59 versus last year for the full year cash flow from operations increased nearly 107 to 793 million a combination of increased earnings and improved working capital performance drove the fourth quarter and full year improvement capital expenditures totaled 14 3 million for the quarter and 63 9 million for the year in 2019 we expect capital expenditures to be between 80 90 million the increased spending will be primarily dedicated to technology our capital distribution is summarized on slide 7 we returned 168 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends a 42 increase versus the prior year period for the full year we returned 590 million to shareholders a 28 increase in 2019 we will continue to evaluate and deploy our capital to add value to our network of customers and carriers and generate returns for our employees and shareholders we will look to acquire quality companies that fit our strategies business model and culture and we will continue to reward our shareholders through buybacks and dividends now on to the balance sheet on slide 8 working capital increased 12 versus the prior year period driven by higher gross revenues and the resulting increase in accounts receivables the contract assets and accrued transportation expense lines on the balance sheet primarily reflect in transit activity in accordance with the adoption of revenue recognition our debt balance at the quarter was 1 35 billion across our credit facility private placement debt accounts receivable securitization and senior notes our weighted average interest rate was 4 in the quarter slide 9 captures our full year financial performance we delivered double digit growth in net revenues and operating income and a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin strong operating profit performance combined with improved working capital and the benefits of corporate tax reform drove a 32 5 increase in our earnings per share once again it bears mentioning 2018 net revenues operating income earnings per share and cash flow from operations all represent record levels of performance for c h robinson i d like to congratulate all of our teams across the globe on your outstanding performance in 2018 our great results this year reflect our focus on profitable growth and our vigorous efforts to grow our business while maintaining strong operational excellence i ll wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends our consistent practice is to share the per business day comparison of net revenues and volume january 2019 global net revenues per business day have increased approximately 9 and north american truckload volumes have increased approximately 3 as we look ahead to the balance of the first quarter we wanted to highlight an item from our 2018 first quarter results driven by the tight truckload market last year we saw sequential acceleration in our net revenue growth during the first quarter of 2018 last year net revenue per business day increased 7 12 and 12 respectively in january february and march additionally the 2019 first quarter has one less business day versus the first quarter of 2018 thank you all for joining us this morning we appreciate you all listening i will now turn it over to bob to provide additional context on our segment performance robert biesterfeld chief operating officer thanks andy and good morning everyone i ll begin my remarks this morning on our operating segment performance by highlighting the rapidly changing nature of the logistics market on slide 11 the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in north america truckload rate per mile billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel costs since 2008 as a reminder north america truckload includes both nast and robinson fresh truckload the grey line represents our net revenue margin for all transportation services the rate of growth in north america truckload price per mile and cost per mile continued to moderate this quarter including a modest decline in truckload cost per mile versus the prior year we benefited from the shift toward contractual volume in a decelerating cost environment in the fourth quarter leading to 110 basis points sequential improvement in transportation net revenue margin from the third quarter our net revenue margin expands and contracts with changes in the freight cycle tending to expand when costs moderate despite the high level of rate and cost volatility as well as other secular market factors our average net revenue margin has remained relatively consistent over time one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our managed services business which represents roughly 4 billion in freight under management in the fourth quarter the average routing guide depth of tender was 1 4 representing that on average the first or second carrier in a shipper s routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases this representation of routing guide performance is reflective of a more balanced market moving to slide 12 this graph shows north america truckload average price per mile billed to customers and cost per mile paid to our carriers net of fuel since 2010 and represents the underlying data from the previous slide we ve excluded the actual price per mile and cost per mile scale to protect our proprietary data the absolute price per mile and cost per mile moderated versus last quarter however both metrics remain well above levels we ve seen over much of the current decade so while the managed services routing guide depth of 1 4 reflects a more balanced market it appears that in general routing guides have reset at higher pricing and are functioning more effectively the chart also shows that since 2010 we ve continued to adjust our pricing in response to changes in marketplace conditions we ve generally maintained a consistent spread between price and cost even in periods of high volatility in the freight market on average both customer pricing and carrier costs have increased at roughly 3 annually over this time period turning to slide 13 in our north america surface transportation business fourth quarter nast net revenues increased 13 5 to 471 million led by double digit growth in our truckload less than truckload and intermodal services a combination of higher contractual prices and moderating freight costs in the fourth quarter drove a 110 basis point expansion in net revenue margin despite a roughly 35 basis point headwind led by higher fuel costs led by higher pricing our truckload net revenues increased 13 to 344 million in the quarter the successful repricing of our contractual business during 2018 has rebalanced our portfolio leaning toward more contractual freight with an approximate mix of 65 contractual and 35 transactional volume in the fourth quarter versus a 50 50 mix in the year ago period nast truckload volume declined modestly in the quarter down 1 5 as our repricing activity led to roughly 45 reduction in our negative loads associated with contractual shipments and returned our negative load percentage to a more typical level we continue to add new carriers to our network driving continued expansion of the largest fleet of motor carriers in north america while simultaneously bringing new capacity solutions to life for our customers we added roughly 4 800 new carriers in the fourth quarter which is a 30 increase over last year s fourth quarter our less than truckload business delivered another quarter of great performance with net revenues increasing 11 5 to 112 million this represents our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit net revenue growth we delivered a high single digit increase in pricing driven by the continued expansion of pricing tools that enable us to react faster to changes in the ltl market ltl volumes increased 2 in the quarter driven by continued growth in manufacturing and e commerce through our common carrier service offerings and our consolidation products we continue to gain scale and market share in the ltl segment in our intermodal business fourth quarter net revenues increased 76 4 versus the year ago period which included elevated repositioning charges we remain committed to our intermodal business as it enables us to offer our customers the most comprehensive service line offerings in the logistics industry slide 14 outlines our nast operating income performance fourth quarter operating income increased 16 9 to 211 million operating margin of 44 8 improved 130 basis points led by net revenue growth this strong performance includes the impact of higher variable compensation expenses our fourth quarter operating margin also improved 90 basis points sequentially our fourth quarter results reflect the benefits of our continued investments in technology we are leveraging advanced algorithms and the scale of our data advantage to further improve our ability to profitably match shipper demand and carrier supply across our network we are also driving productivity improvement through tools that automate interactions with our customers and our carriers and improve our internal workflows these investments enabled us to deliver growth in both net revenues and expand our operating margin in the fourth quarter for the full year our nast business delivered outstanding performance net revenues increased 17 3 including double digit growth in our truckload ltl and intermodal service lines despite headcount that grew less than 0 5 operating margin expanded 210 basis points including the impact of increased variable compensation expense driven by our strong performance in 2019 we plan to accelerate our digital transformation efforts and technology investments to make our processes even more efficient and our employees even more productive while continuing to deliver more benefits to our network of customers and carriers turning to slide 15 and our global forwarding business fourth quarter global forwarding net revenues increased 11 6 to 143 million we lapped our acquisition of milgram co in canada in the third quarter so our fourth quarter net revenue performance reflects pure organic growth from a comparability standpoint in our ocean service line we returned to net revenue growth as expected driven by a combination of pricing reflective of the current market conditions and a robust sales pipeline ocean net revenues increased 12 4 in the quarter including a 7 5 increase in shipment volumes fourth quarter air net revenues increased 9 3 as a shift in customer mix was partially offset by a 3 decline in shipments customs net revenues increased 12 4 in the quarter while transactions increased approximately 4 5 in the fourth quarter as we continue to expand our customs presence around the world in our conversations with carriers and global shippers companies continue to plan for tariff activity and potential implications to the redesign of global supply chains our global forwarding business is actively engaged with customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts of both the enacted and potential future tariffs the current set of tariffs in place has not had a significant impact on our global forwarding financial results given our broad portfolio of service offerings and our strong presence in key markets such as southeast asia and india we believe we are well positioned to help our customers continue to win in an ever changing global trade environment slide 16 outlines our global forwarding operating income performance fourth quarter operating income increased 76 9 to 30 million operating margin of 20 9 increased 770 basis points versus last year led by higher net revenues and a modest decline in headcount for the full year we re pleased with the top line growth of our global forwarding business we grew volume in our ocean air and custom service lines and generated double digit growth in global forwarding net revenues looking forward we continue to see significant opportunities to drive scale and geographic reach in the segment at the same time we realize that we have opportunities to drive even greater efficiency as we grow this business so we re focused on operating margin expansion through additional technology deployment and intelligent process automation over the long term we remain confident that we will deliver operating margin performance consistent with other leading companies in the global forwarding segment transitioning to slide 17 and our robinson fresh segment sourcing net revenues were 25 million down 8 2 from last year case volumes declined 6 5 driven by a combination of lower levels of promotional activity at our retail customers and lower restaurant traffic at our foodservice customers the revenue recognition policy change negatively impacted sourcing total revenues by approximately 37 million in the quarter there was no impact to net revenue transportation net revenues grew 45 9 to over 39 million led by a double digit increase in truckload the improvements in robinson fresh transportation results are directly related to the repricing activities that took place throughout 2018 slide 18 outlines our robinson fresh operating income performance fourth quarter operating income grew by 53 5 to nearly 20 million operating margin of 30 8 improved 700 basis points led by higher net revenues in the transportation business and a 5 reduction in headcount through a combination of pricing reflective of market conditions operating expense controls and investments to improve operational efficiency our robinson fresh team generated improved results in the second half of 2018 and for the full year delivered both growth in net revenues and operating income along with 190 basis points of operating margin expansion moving to our all other and corporate businesses on slide 19 as a reminder all other includes our managed services business surface transportation outside of north america other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses managed services net revenues increased 10 9 to 20 million in the quarter driven by a combination of selling additional services to our existing customers and new customer wins freight under management increased 2 in the quarter to over 1 3 billion and freight under management for the full year increased 9 to eclipse 4 billion customers continue to value our transportation management system offering which allows them to manage their carrier selection process and complex supply chains without the required fixed investment in people or technology our sales pipeline in the managed services business remains very robust and we expect continued growth in this business in 2019 other surface transportation net revenues declined 7 3 in the quarter to 15 million as pricing declines were partially offset by a mid single digit increase in volume we have a very strong pipeline of new business in our europe surface transportation before i turn the call back to john for some final comments i ll take a minute to wrap up the section on our operating performance our operating results reflect our continued ability to help our network of customers and carriers navigate a rapidly changing freight market and provide solutions that accelerate commerce in their businesses in both the fourth quarter and the full year we delivered strong growth in net revenues and an expansion in both net revenue margin and operating margin we also significantly increased our cash from operations and cash return to shareholders i m very pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year financial results as we turn to 2019 we remain committed to our operating plans that we ve been implementing across our businesses we will continue to leverage our comprehensive offering of services and capabilities to deliver logistics expertise to our customers and carriers we will accelerate our digital transformation with investments in technology that deliver actionable intelligence and supply chain capabilities to the over 200 00 companies that conduct business on our global platform i remain confident that we ll continue to deliver industry leading capabilities to our customers and our carriers to provide rewarding career opportunities for our employees and to generate strong returns to our shareholders thank you for listening this morning and at this point i ll turn the call back to john john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer thank you bob i want to wrap up our prepared remarks for the few final comments let me start by sharing a few data points on what we re seeing currently in the marketplace as stated we do see evidence of a more balanced freight market routing guide depths are now more consistent with a balanced freight market and our truckload shipments have moved back to our typical more contractually weighted mix the significant price increases of 2018 have moderated and while it s uncertain what the remainder of 2019 will bring we are in a more balanced situation today tariffs and changes in global trade agreements remain a big uncertainty for many of our customers we do believe there were modest amounts of advance shipping and inventory buildup in 2018 the u s economy continues to grow and our customers are generally planning for steady to increased freight volumes while our markets are more balanced at the moment the potential for further changes remains high our core go to market strategy has always been to help our customers understand and adapt to the market conditions we focus on managing through the cyclical changes in the market while investing in our capabilities for the future 2018 was a year of excellent financial performance for robinson we generated record levels of revenues operating income earnings per share and cash from operations but more importantly we continue to invest in our people processes and technology for the future our team our culture and our platform are real competitive advantages that are getting stronger every day we feel great about our future and our continuing ability to create value for all of our stakeholders that concludes our prepared comments and with that i ll turn it back to the operator so that we can answer the submitted questions questions and answers operator thank you mr houghton the floor is now yours for the question and answer session robert houghton vice president investor relations thank you donna first i would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday for today s q a session i will frame up the question and then turn it over to john andy or bob for a response our first question comes from several analysts bob after a very strong 2018 year over year comparisons clearly get more challenging as we move through 2019 can you speak to the levers that you intend to pull to help drive nast net revenue growth in 2019 given evidence of a balanced freight market robert biesterfeld chief operating officer absolutely so we re definitely feeling a more balanced market in 2019 when compared to the prior year as we ve stated in the past we tend to look at net revenue dollars on a per load or per shipment basis as a more important internal metric than absolute net revenue margin so we know for the first half of 2018 our net revenue dollars per load were pretty close to our historical average and those really expanded throughout the second half of the year as costs started to moderate so for us success in 2019 is going to come from continuing to take market share through increasing truckload and ltl volumes on a year over year basis as well as continuing to stay focused on our initiatives around cost control and driving further efficiency into our business model volume growth will be key for us throughout the year but even more so in the second half fortunately for us we ve only got 3 market share today in nast and we ve got a really large and aggressive sales force that s committed to driving growth in 2019 by continuing to add value to our customers and carriers in these market conditions i ve said it a lot in the past several years but our focus is really not to go ditch to ditch between a focus on net revenue per load and load volume but to continue to pursue that balanced growth strategy over the long term and throughout cycles robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question comes from jack atkins with stephens jack atkins stephens inc managing director andy looking back to the last time we were in a balanced market 2016 and early 2017 your net operating margin peaked in the second quarter of 2016 and then declined pretty significantly over the next several quarters would you expect net revenue to grow faster than operating expenses in 2019 andrew clarke chief executive officer thanks jack for the question the short answer is our stated goal and objective is always to grow net revenue faster than operating expenses that s at the enterprise level but also at the divisional levels when you reference a balanced market i know you re speaking specifically to the truckload market and let s go back and revisit that and the difference which by the way is truckload is 55 of our net revenue today and it s growing and it s great and we re very pleased with it but in that market i would say that there are two differences that primarily are different than today and the first is gdp was lower and the second is pricing and cost were lower so today and at that point it s pure arithmetic where the cost and the price were lower today gdp is higher and the price and the cost are higher so if you look at those lines that we produce in the published reports on our earnings they re higher but the relative difference hasn t really materially changed so when we think about those levers particularly within nast we think that continuing to grow net revenue in excess of our expenses is clearly achievable you then layer in some of the other services that we ve added over the last five or six years you think about ltl you think about global forwarding both of those businesses have doubled in that time and in doing so we ve added more of a secular growth story to the robinson enterprise and robinson platform and in doing that we ve made investments and clearly as you saw in the fourth quarter a lot of those investments began to pay off so we re really pleased with those results and we do expect and it s our stated goal and it s how we re all compensated to grow net revenues in excess of our operating expenses robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question is for john and it s from ben hartford of robert w baird jack atkins with stephens asked a similar question benjamin hartford robert w baird analyst what are 2019 contractual pricing growth expectations have they softened from the low single digit outlook provided on the third quarter earnings call john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer so in our committed bid the low single digit comment was relevant to truckload so i m assuming that s where the question is at but with regards to our contractual bidding whenever you go through a period of time where there s meaningful change in the spot market you re going to start to see some of that show up in the sentiment around the contracts and the committed rates over the months of december and january there have been some meaningful softening and reductions in some of the spot market and that will start to show up in the attitudes and the outcomes of the bids and the committed relationships i think low single digits is probably still a good center of gravity maybe a quarter ago people were saying low to mid single digits and that s more what we re seeing now more common low to flat single digits so some of the softening in the pricing is showing up in the committed activity it s a pretty rapidly changing market as we shared in our prepared comments there s a lot of different factors that are continuing to impact those bid arrangements and a lot of potential for change but today probably low single digits is still a good center of gravity in terms of expectations around committed pricing robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks john the next question is for bob from todd fowler with keybanc todd fowler keybanc capital markets managing director with respect to the outlook commentary indicating that continued investments in technology will help achieve the 2019 objectives of top line growth and operating margin expansion could you comment on how you see technology impacting 2019 and beyond are there costs associated with these investments that tail off in the future and if so how much robert biesterfeld chief operating officer thanks todd we expect that our capex run rate will increase to about 80 90 million in 2019 and with that really our total expense related to it investment for next year is planned to increase to well over 200 million so while we re really proud of the foundation we ve built within our navisphere technology platform and our ability to provide customers and carriers with unrivaled actionable intelligence about their businesses the further investments that we re going to make in technology will really be focused on ensuring that we re providing best in class user centric technology we re providing technology that enables even more frictionless transactions leveraging more effectively advanced analytics and data science and that doesn t just apply to truckload but really applies across all of our services we want to make sure that our it team has the appropriate resources that they need to accelerate the speed to value so that they can take the great ideas from our people and from our customers and bring those to life even faster for our clients and create value for all of our stakeholders so in terms of the step up in capex i d expect that to be pretty consistent for the next several years robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question is also for bob from chris wetherbee of citi chris wetherbee citigroup analyst fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin expansion can you help provide color on the broader trends in the cost structure is it being driven by more automated transactions in direct load matching and are there other initiatives and what level do you think operating margins can move to over time robert biesterfeld chief operating officer i m really bullish on our ability to both drive net revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the coming years much as andy said automating transactions and direct load matching are certainly part of the reason why operating margin has expanded and why we believe the opportunity to continue to expand operating margin but it s really only part of the story the active matching capacity to demand is really a small part of the overall quote to cash cycle that our clients ask us to manage for them and we re focused on creating value and reducing cost at each step of that cycle so we re investing in the area of direct load matching but we re also rolling out tools that help us to accept the right freight based upon predictions of outcomes more effectively manage exceptions and we re leveraging tech in new ways across all of our reporting segments that remove unnecessary steps out of our operational processes we re investing in tech and process improvement to enhance our sales force both the sales force effectiveness and the sales force efficiency as well as back office function such as collections billing imaging and the like which has a positive impact digital freight matching is clearly gaining most of the headlines today we feel like we re in a great place in that space but our focus is going to continue to be from quote to cash and in the simplest sense it s about winning more freight executing at a lower cost and maintaining or improving our industry leading operating margins robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question for andy comes from todd fowler todd fowler keybanc capital markets managing director what do you view as normalized net operating margins for nast and global forwarding what factors within your control contribute to your ability to improve net operating margins over time andrew clarke chief executive officer several years ago we made the decision to go to reportable segments and in doing so we broke out nast global forwarding and robinson fresh under individual performance so now we have four years of data to look at and over that period of time i would break nast and global forwarding into two components and the first component is net revenue and nast net revenue the median net revenue margin percentage of nast has been 16 4 over those last four years with a standard deviation of 120 basis points and that includes the cosmetic impact of fuel but also the substitution impact of ltl which tends to have a higher net revenue margin percentage and so we would say that that net revenue margin has been relatively consistent and it s been in that mid double digits for a long period of time and we would expect it to continue to be in that and so then you go to and to a large degree there s a cyclical element of that as bob mentioned earlier making a lot of investments on the it and the business side to help us make smarter decisions both for our customers on the pricing side but also our carriers on the cost side in doing so we think that we can continue to move the needle a bit on the net revenue margins on the operating margin side again same figures over the last four years nast operating margins the median s been about 43 5 and if you knock out the high highs and the low lows the standard deviation on that has been 160 basis points and we talk about making investments in a through cycle environment and so fortunately for us we have the ability as bob mentioned earlier to give our it people the resources to make investments despite the fact there were periods of time if we go back to the net revenue number where in fact the net revenue has been below the median for a period of time we re still making investments and as a result you see the commensurate impact on the operating margin percentage but the good news is when we come out the other side the operating margin expands and so to a large degree that s where we re really focusing our efforts again as both bob and john mentioned we re going to continue to make those investments but we re going to continue to be more efficient and more effective as we go to market the global forwarding story is yet another interesting one as i mentioned earlier it s doubled in the last four or five years we continue have made significant investments in that part of our business and today it s continuing to grow and it d be an important part of our go to market with our customers their median net revenue margins have been 22 8 again with a standard deviation of about 180 basis points on the operating margin side the median s been about just under 21 and again knocking out the high highs and the low lows you ve got about a 280 basis point standard deviation on the operating margin you have to then add back or include what i would say we talk about the investments we ve made on the cash amortization that s anywhere from 6 8 so think about the operating margin of 21 we believe that those are on a cash basis in the high 20s low 30s now on a relative basis it s less mature than our nast business and so we would expect both the net revenue margins on global forwarding as well as the operating margins given the investments that we ve made to continue to expand both in nast and global forwarding robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question is also for andy from matt young with morningstar jason seidl with cowen and company also asked a similar question matthew young morningstar analyst a few upstart digital freight brokers appear to be gaining some traction in the truck brokerage space at least from a gross revenue standpoint could you talk about what you are noticing if anything in the marketplace from these providers andrew clarke chief executive officer i think it s appropriate to first talk about and start off by answering that question and really telling the story of our platform and then maybe begin to talk about what others are talking about what they re doing and so robinson is a digital leader in the logistics space and it s a big it s a growing space but we ve been in it the longest bob mentioned we re spending as much if not more than anybody else we re connecting over 200 000 companies around the globe through that navisphere technology platform we re executing truckload ltl intermodal ocean air customs managed services parcel and other services with over 20 billion in freight under management one hundred percent of our shipments are executed on the navisphere platform and again why does that benefit the benefit is obviously to our customers they have one source of truth for that why does it benefit our carriers it allows them to go to one place to get access to all of their information and so we believe in that one platform and so we re going to continue to invest in it and while it s big and growing we re the largest i wouldn t say that anybody could go out there and claim to have conquered logistics despite the fact that there are many people out there with apps or many people out there with press releases there are many people that are out there telling the story of how much they might have raised in a particular round it s a big space and we re going to continue to lead in that where we are seeing some of these digital competitors that you might have mentioned are in select customers we have over 120 000 customers and i d say if you canvassed all of them there s probably 119 000 of those customers that aren t or haven t been doing business with the digital upstarts now there are 17 000 brokers truckload brokers freight brokers in north america right now if you think about where that exists in the globe there s multiples of that as well and so we have had and will always have competition in the marketplace and to a large degree everybody s talking about technology our go to market has been and will continue to be our people our process and our technology we believe that those three tenets are core to how we re going to continue to successfully grow our business solve the complex global logistics needs of our customers be a strategic provider to our carriers whether they be located in north america whether they be located in europe asia latin america and so we re pretty comfortable and pretty confident in our technology story particularly vis a vis the start ups robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question for john comes from several analysts how much business is currently under spot versus contract and do you think there will be a shift back to the spot market in 2019 john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer we are today in our truckload business back to that more typical mix of having more committed or contractual activity probably two thirds one third about 65 35 with more of that being committed or contracted today with regards to where will it go in 2019 and where it will it s more difficult than ever to predict but a few thoughts around that coming off of 2018 where we showed on our charts double digit price increases over a short period of time and that being higher than anything that you see historically on any of those charts those price increases were in part driven by some regulatory changes around eld implementations and all of the carrier network changes that accompanied those implementations we don t see anything on the horizon that is that significant there s no pending rule changes or anything that would suggest that that type of spot market activity or price increases would happen again in the short term as i commented earlier there has been some deceleration of pricing in the spot market and some opportunity where maybe the committed rates are softening a little bit and could drive some shippers to explore more spot market opportunities to take advantage of lower prices if that s where it s sustained so while we don t see anything big on the horizon that would drive it back to the spot market another factor to consider is that over the last decade as shippers have automated their supply chains and carriers have automated and tightened their network around how they run their capacity there is less slack in the overall system which has led to more volatility and greater price changes so while there s nothing big on the horizon that caused the price increases in 2018 the overall environment is predisposed toward faster changes and greater impacts that could result in more freight going back to the spot market if we see a meaningful change in the overall demand robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks john the next question for bob comes from matt young with morningstar matthew young morningstar analyst could you provide some additional color on nast efforts in terms of running more truckload transactions through a mobile platform along with a rough idea of the magnitude of adoption among c h robinson shippers and carriers robert biesterfeld chief operating officer sure so a core tenet of our go to market strategy has always been to really meet our customers and carriers how and where they want to buy so our focus has been less on moving transactions to mobile as it has been on just really being focused on driving toward those frictionless transactions we based upon the preferences of our customers and our carriers so a couple of examples if a customer wants to integrate their erp into navisphere we just want to make sure that we re the easiest supply chain platform to connect to and extend our platform into their erp if our customer wants to use the navisphere platform to place orders track shipments or get exception notifications we want to ensure that we can provide that information via web or mobile in a means that serves their needs in the fastest most user friendly way another example if a carrier prefers to work in their native tms versus in navisphere again we try to connect to their native tms and ensure that they ve got visibility to our freight and make it easiest for us to connect to them specific to mobile in general we ve seen the carrier community much more active in the mobile space than on the customer side in terms of rough orders of magnitude today we capture about 55 of our truckload events in an automated fashion much of that coming from mobile and we ve got tens of thousands of active users every single day on the navisphere carrier both mobile and web platforms as well as the customer primarily web platform another example our book it now feature on navisphere carrier continues to gain broader acceptance among the carrier community and we see more and more carriers taking advantage of the ability to come online either via the web or app and self select and self book freight on the customer side we see relatively low adoption of mobile as the primary means for communication and edi really continues to be the preferred method of electronic integration with the customers robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question is also for bob from ben hartford of robert w baird todd fowler of keybanc and jason seidl of cowen and company also asked similar questions benjamin hartford robert w baird analyst what are nast and overall headcount growth plans for 2019 robert biesterfeld chief operating officer in the simplest sense over the long term we expect volume to grow at a rate ahead of our headcount growth i made this commitment at our 2017 investor day relative to nast and i believe that that formula still has application across our business in total over the past couple of years the mix of our job families has continued to evolve and as we continue to grow through some of the roles that are more task oriented it allows us to improve productivity there and keep headcount relatively flat in some of those areas and we ll continue to add more specialized skills and more customer facing people to drive growth and innovation in our workforce our headcount growth moderated in the fourth quarter and our focus in 2019 and beyond is to continue to layer in that technology and process automation so that our people can be even more effective which should further moderate headcount growth moving forward robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob ravi shanker of morgan stanley asked about personnel expenses tom wadewitz with ubs also asked a similar question ravi shanker morgan stanley managing director andy what drove personnel expense growth to be below net revenue growth andrew clarke chief executive officer well again we talk about the operating leverage of our model and we ve been pretty clear about how it does work and in fact 2018 is a great example of it not only in the fourth quarter which i ll address shortly but also for the full year if you think about it we added pretty significant net revenue during the entire year but relative to last year headcount was relatively flat and in fact in certain cases with global forwarding and robinson fresh it was down so you think about how they were able to grow their business those two particular divisions with less headcount we re pretty pleased with as bob was talking about just before the leverage that is inherent in our company and in our platform as it relates to the fourth quarter again just think about how much net revenue additionally we drove over the fourth quarter over 84 million the bulk of the increase in the fourth quarter personnel expenses are related to performance based pay both in terms of cash compensation as well as equity so if you think about headcount again relatively flat on a q4 versus q4 basis but because we performed so much more a lot of that variable expense went up which obviously aligns as we talked about the interests of our employees with the interests of our shareholders very well and that s the beauty and that s how our models always were throughout different cycles robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question for john on tariffs came from several analysts have you seen any impact in your forwarding business from the tariffs from both the u s and china or the political economic unrest in europe we have heard other large international logistics and retail companies mention both of these as headwinds in 2019 curious if you are seeing an impact and what your outlook is for forwarding in 2019 given these overhangs john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer we ve been growing our global forwarding business the last five years by taking market share in a number of corridors around the world and we do continue to believe that we re going to be successful doing that in 2019 as well the primary impact to date or in the year 2018 was the processes around implementing and collecting the increased tariffs as well as some modest increase and shipment activities probably near the end of the year to try to accelerate some of the activities to get in before year end or get in before tariffs there s still so much remaining uncertainty around where those trade negotiations in asia and europe will both land so beyond the minor impacts that we had to our business in 2018 all of the discussion around supply chain strategy where will your suppliers be will shippers have to move out of china into other places in asia those communications are going on and the planning is accelerating as we speak so there s high potential for greater changes in routing greater changes in sourcing areas for a lot of our customers but we haven t seen a lot of that activity to date we ve mentioned in the past and continue to invest in expanding and scaling our global forwarding network precisely for reasons like this that if customers do end up making decisions that these tariffs and supply chain changes are going to be permanent and move their sourcing locations we re confident that we ll be able to move with them and that we have capabilities in other parts of the world that we ll be able to continue to go after that market share and grow our business regardless of where the trade negotiations land robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks john the next question is for andy from several analysts why did the annual increase in cash from operations up 409 million significantly exceed growth in annual net income up 160 million what were the drivers andrew clarke chief executive officer 2018 was a fantastic year for us from a cash flow from operations and obviously you got net income up 160 million but bob mentioned earlier the investments we re making on the quote to cash but there s also the order to cash and once it becomes an order across the organization from the business to support from financial operations driving down that order to cash cycle and so if you think about the decrease on a year over year basis and the need for spending that on working capital the largest contributor of that came from the effort there and that s where we re making a lot of investments on digitalization that s where we re making a lot of investments in standardization streamlining that part of the organization so that we would expect to continue to see improvements in that area robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks the next question is also for andy from chris wetherbee of citi ken hoexter of bank of america merrill lynch asked a similar question chris wetherbee citigroup analyst with the truckload spot market rolling over on a year over year basis how would you expect net revenue margins to trend as 2019 progresses andrew clarke chief executive officer that goes back to what we talked about earlier on the net revenue margins dollar percentages it s largely a function of arithmetic and so if you look at one of the slides that we have in the earnings deck and that s a relative change we talk about how those cycles tend to go in three to four to five quarter periods where cost is always the leader when costs rise or fall pricing tends to follow that we saw that through a balance period and we talked about that earlier and when it begins to tip over and costs go down price tends to lag that which does have a positive impact on the margins but on a relative basis you see that the price and cost numbers on a sanitized the numbers that we report are at an elevated level and so there s the balancing impact of fuel the balancing impact of the numerator and denominator simply being higher but overall when costs begin to decrease it does tend to have a positive impact on our truckload margins we ve made a lot of investments as bob mentioned earlier on the ltl side to be smarter on the pricing and the cost side and so we would continue to expect to drive secular margin expansion in other parts of our business as well robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question is for bob from lee klaskow from bloomberg ryan ossenbeck with j p morgan asked a similar question lee klaskow bloomberg analyst did the implementation of precision scheduled railroading in the east drive the 13 decline in intermodal volume if not what was the driver robert biesterfeld chief operating officer so we don t believe that psr has had a broad impact on our intermodal volumes for the quarter nor do we expect it to we have seen examples where lane cancellations have either limited intermodal options altogether or new routings have created drayage inefficiencies which has made the routing more cost effective using truckload which could potentially benefit us in terms of our volume decline for the quarter it was really driven by less spot market opportunity and truckload to intermodal conversion as well as lower than expected west coast volumes when compared to the peak season of last year robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob andy todd fowler of keybanc and tom wadewitz of ubs asked about m a please provide an update on potential acquisition opportunities both service line and geographies and if you feel anything imminent in 2019 andrew clarke chief executive officer well i m going to talk about the first one in terms of the potential acquisition opportunities we have and will continue to be an active participant in the m a environment we look at transactions every day that are complementary to both our service line whether that be nast whether that be our global forwarding or robinson fresh but we also look at it in terms of geographical expansion and i ll go back and talk about how we ve made investments over the last several years in global forwarding we continue to make investments in nast as we did with the acquisition of freight quote and those are pretty much part of our standard routine as it relates to assisting and enabling our rather strong organic growth strategy that we have in place and so i wouldn t say that there s anything materially different as to how we re looking about it i would say that it continues to be a robust environment for well run organizations we are very selective in the acquisitions that not only we look at but also execute upon and so they have to meet a rather stringent criteria both in terms of strategy culture and business model and then of course financial returns are very important to how we view and evaluate those opportunities and so i wouldn t say that there s anything materially different in 2019 of our strategy versus what it s been over the last several years robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy that

capped an important year for 3m as we posted good results and continued to transform for the future we delivered organic growth of more than 3 with growth across all business groups and geographic

last year was our 60th consecutive year of dividend increases please turn to slide 15 beyond financial results in 2018 we continue to position 3m for long term growth and value creation this includes executing our four priorities which i laid out at our investor day in november i ll comment briefly on the impact of each priority starting with portfolio the ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value for our customers and shareholders in 2018 for example we sold our communication markets business this builds on the portfolio work we ve done over the last several years in electronics and energy which has led to improved growth and margins last month we also announced the acquisition of m modal stechnology business which is a leading provider of ai powered healthcare solutions as you recall two years ago we decided to retain and further invest in our health information systems business this acquisition builds on that commitment and will expand our ability to improve outcomes for both patients and providers we expect this transaction to close in the first quarter and its impact is reflected in our updated guidance for 2019 which i ll cover shortly turning now to transformation which is fundamentally improving how we serve our customers how we work and how we compete 2018 was an important year in our transformation journey our team executed our erp deployment across all five business groups in the united states which accounts for nearly 40 of our global sales this was a significant undertaking i commend our people for successfully rolling out our new systems and i thank our customers for working closely with us through this change with the u s rollout we have deployed approximately 70 of our global revenue on the new erp system we are now stepping up our efforts to fully leverage this progress and accelerate value realization for our customers and our company ultimately transformation is making 3m a more agile more efficient and more competitive enterprise our next priority is innovation innovation is fundamental to our organic growth and is key to our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital it allows us to create unique differentiated solutions for our customers which leads to superior returns for our shareholders in 2018 we continued to invest in both research and development and capex with accelerated investments in our priority growth platforms focused around healthcare transportation safety and infrastructure technology is advancing rapidly in these market spaces and 3m will continue to capitalize on these opportunities as we move ahead this brings me to people and culture which is foundational to each of the other priorities everything that differentiates 3m our technologies our manufacturing our global reach our brand starts with our people in 2018 we expanded development opportunities for 3mers while launching initiatives to deepen our commitment to sustainability diversity and inclusion we also earned a number of external recognitions including being named one of the world s most ethical companies for the fifth straight year in summary our team made good progress on each of our priorities in 2018 and we are positioned for a successful 2019 please turn to slide 16 as you recall at our investor day in november we laid out our guidance framework for 2019 since then there has been slowing in key end markets with the biggest impact coming from china automotive and electronics therefore we are widening our range for expected organic growth to 1 to 4 against the prior range of 2 to 4 we now anticipate eps as of 10 45 to 10 90 which includes a 0 10 earnings headwind from the m modal acquisition against a previous range of 10 60 to 11 05 please note that the prior range did not include the m modal impact we continue to expect a return on invested capital of 22 to 25 along with a free cash flow conversion rate of 95 to 105 please turn to slide 17 here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth starting with our business groups we expect organic growth to be led by healthcare with a range of 3 to 5 followed by safety and graphics at 2 to 5 organic growth in industrial is expected in the range of 1 to 4 with electronics and energy at 0 to 4 and consumer at 1 to 3 looking by geographic area we expect organic growth in the united states of 2 to 4 followed by emea at 1 to 3 organic growth in asia pacific is expected in the range of 1 to 5 with latin america canada at 3 to 5 i ll now turn it back to nick who will provide some color on our 2019 outlook nick nick gangestad chief financial officer thanks mike please turn to slide 18 here are our key planning assumptions in 2019 most of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we discussed at our november investor day with the exception of three items first is the expanded full year organic growth range that mike just discussed second is in regards to our global pension expense december s market volatility lowered our 2019 earnings benefit versus our expectation in november and lastly we are now including the estimated full year growth and earnings impact from the pending m modal acquisition other items to note we are forecasting full year foreign currency translation to be a 1 headwind to sales but neutral to earnings turning to raw materials we do anticipate higher year on year costs including tariff impacts however we continue to expect our selling prices along with our global sourcing team s ongoing productivity efforts to more than offset the expected raw material headwinds we estimate the 2019 impact from the pending m modal acquisition net of the communication market s divestiture to be neutral to sales and an earnings headwind of 0 15 per share we continue to increase our efforts to accelerate benefits from transformation portfolio and footprint optimization along with our manufacturing and sg a productivity lastly we forecast our full year tax rate to be 20 to 22 versus our 2018 underlying rate of 20 i ll now move to our 2019 capital allocation plan on slide 19 our strong operational cash flow fuels our capital allocation plan we expect another year of strong cash flow from operations with 2019 estimated to be between 9 5 billion and 10 5 billion prior to our investments in r d and our global pension plans all in including cash marketable securities and added leverage our 2019 plan calls for 14 5 billion to 16 5 billion of available capital our first priority for capital deployment remains investing in our business which includes research and development and capex supplemented with acquisitions while at the same time returning cash to shareholders please turn to slide 20 here you can see our 2019 earnings roadmap based on the key assumptions i just laid out for 2019 we expect per share earnings in the range of 10 45 to 10 90 including a negative 0 10 impact from the m modal acquisition this earnings range represents an increase of 5 to 9 year on year compared to our 2018 underlying eps of 9 96 to wrap up fourth quarter was a good finish to 2018 we are focused on executing our four priorities along with delivering on our financial objectives in 2019 with that we thank you for your attention and we ll now take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning mike roman chief executive officer good morning andrew nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning andrew andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst just a question on asia you guys clearly seem to have a better handle on your customers than a lot of other folks but as we think about 2019 do you have a sense when asia growth bottoms ex whatever contingency you have on the tariff negotiations how should we think about the pace of growth in asia throughout 2019 mike roman chief executive officer yes andrew if you look at the guidance we have for asia in our outlook we see it pretty balanced across the year within those ranges and within that range of guidance now the caution as we start the year is really focused on not so much trade and tariff but on the impact in end markets that we talked about automotive and electronics are the focus for the slower more cautious view as we look to 2019 so i think as we get a better view of what s going to go on in those end markets that would change where we are in the range but i think that balance across the year is the way i d have you think about it andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just a follow up question a couple of people asked this about r d spend your longer term framework 6 for the year i think in 18 it was 5 6 for the quarter 5 5 any timing on r d in 2018 and how should we think about r d in 2019 mike roman chief executive officer this is as you said andrew this is still a priority and it s we re committed to this it s what drives our differentiation our innovation in 3m and if you look at where we are in the quarter we saw some impact from the contract r d work that we do for customers and i would say the divestiture of the communication markets so those are a few of the things that kept us a little lower in the quarter we are committed to driving that model that 6 r d and the investment in capex that goes along with it and if you look at 2018 we actually did have an increase in headcount so it s a better reflection maybe of our commitment to that ongoing investment andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst terrific thank you operator our next question comes from the line of joe ritchie of goldman sachs please proceed with your question joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys nick gangestad chief financial officer hey joe mike roman chief executive officer good morning joe joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst so maybe just kind of following up on andrew s question on china and more specifically auto and electronics you took the guide down by a point at the low end not really surprising given what we re seeing across the value chain i guess the question though is it seemed like those end markets were generally ok for the quarter how did things progress during the quarter and what are you actually seeing in your core business that makes you feel like growth will be slower in those end markets for 2019 mike roman chief executive officer yes joe we talked about this a bit at the third quarter call that we saw some slowing in china as we went into q4 and automotive was one of the things that we talked about that said we saw additional slowing as we exited the quarter and you see it in the projection for build rates the updated view of the build rates in the quarter and then the projection for where things are going in 2019 there s just caution there s a revision down it s not a huge step down but it s a revision down in the first half of the year really driven by china so i would say some additional slowing in the outlook for build rates in automotive electronics it held up well in the quarter we had a good solid finish for that business in fact if you look at 2018 we were right in the range for what we were expecting in the electronics markets and we had a cautious outlook as we went through the year i think you see it with the oems in that market they re signalling a cautious view and it s more for first quarter than it was necessarily impacting q4 of 18 joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst ok fair enough mike if i could follow up nick just on price costs we ve seen commodities come in a little bit as we ended the year saw the raw mat headwind on the bridge but maybe just talk a little bit about how much price do you think you ll be able to get in 2019 and are the pricing actions already in place for those benefits nick gangestad chief financial officer yes joe i would say much of 2018 as well as q4 has played out exactly how we expected that we expected fairly significant raw material headwinds that we ve been more than offsetting throughout the year with our selling price increases so as i look backwards on 18 very much how we saw that happening as we look forward into 2019 we do see raw material and tariff headwinds continuing just not at the same level of what we saw in 2018 so you see in our earnings bridge we re expecting 0 10 to 0 20 of headwinds and that s inclusive of tariffs in november when you were with us we laid out that i i laid out that expected that to be about 100 million headwind from tariffs right now we d put that at about 70 million year on year headwind from tariffs and that s built into that 0 10 to 0 20 and we remain optimistic that selling prices will more than offset the last part of that question the vast majority of our price increases have already been enacted either late in the second half of 2018 or ones that have already been announced that go into effect early this year so much of it if not all of it has already been auctioned joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst ok thanks guys nick gangestad chief financial officer thanks joe operator our next question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz of citi please proceed with your question andrew kaplowitz citi analyst hey good morning guys nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning andie mike roman chief executive officer morning andie andrew kaplowitz citi analyst nick can you talk about what happened in safety and graphics in terms of the 22 margin you report in the quarter you mentioned some fourth quarter actions and weakness in roofing granules impacting margin but the margin was obviously lower than last year s q4 despite now lapping scott safety so was there how much of the fourth quarter actions were unusual and would you expect margin going forward to be up significantly in 19 versus 18 nick gangestad chief financial officer yes andy one of the first things you should do is just look at we had a noticeable gain in fourth quarter last year on the sale of our electronic monitoring business within safety and graphics that s why we re explaining that the underlying margin once we pull that gain out is down 110 basis points the two primary things driving that 110 basis point margin contraction one is that decline in roofing granules and then we ve also as you know we acquired the scott safety business we continue to take actions to integrate that we ve been taking a number of actions and that s that continued integration of scott safety is the second contributing factor to the margin contraction overall we re extremely pleased with scott safety s performance high growth in the quarter and very pleased with the contribution it s making to our safety and graphics business andrew kaplowitz citi analyst ok and then maybe shifting gears to healthcare 4 growth in oral care is the best you ve recorded in some time there and china growth is obviously strong in healthcare so do easier comps in drug delivery mean that the lumpiness really that we saw in 18 is probably behind 3m and the confidence level in your 3 to 5 organic growth in healthcare for 19 is reasonably high nick gangestad chief financial officer yes andy i think it s still going to be lumpy in 2019 and that s primarily going to be driven by comps to what we saw in 2018 for the full year we re not anticipating that drug delivery in total is going to have a noticeable impact on healthcare s growth but as i look at the seasonality of what we re staring into of comps in drug delivery we will see it being negative in the first half of the year and likely positive in the second half of the year mike roman chief executive officer andy let me clarify negative comps from drug delivery we re not seeing the healthcare business negative in the first half andrew kaplowitz citi analyst right but overall the rest of the business does seem reasonably solid and you would say you have pretty good visibility into the rest of the business including the new product intros that you ve got in oral care starting to impact that business mike roman chief executive officer correct yes andrew kaplowitz citi analyst all right thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of john walsh of credit suisse please proceed with your question john walsh credit suisse analyst hi good morning mike roman chief executive officer morning john nick gangestad chief financial officer morning john john walsh credit suisse analyst i guess maybe a quick one on what you re seeing in terms of channel inventory levels and if we re all still normal or if you re seeing anything different across any of your businesses mike roman chief executive officer john i would say we came out of q4 pretty balanced across the businesses in channel it s something we watch very closely we re watching sell in sell out and it looks to be pretty balanced i would say with a word of caution around the end markets that are slowing that always puts a focus on channel so when you look at what s going on automotive and electronics we re watching that closely and making sure that we have a good view of what s going on there but as we exited 18 it looked to be a pretty good balance and that s not just true of those specific end markets but across broader industrial and even across the consumer business as well john walsh credit suisse analyst gotcha and then maybe just drilling down into one of those specifically because every once in a while it kind of does get called out is on the automotive repair and refinish obviously there was some channel consolidation there that all seems to be behind the business i just wanted to kind of confirm that mike roman chief executive officer yes i think what i said about the broader industrial is true for automotive aftermarket as we come out of 18 as well pretty balanced across the channel that said what we called out there the consolidation that s something that is ongoing we saw a significant impact as we went through the first part of the year i think that s something that can continue so that s another one of those impacts on channel inventory that we watch as we see consolidation but coming out of the year pretty balanced in automotive aftermarket as well john walsh credit suisse analyst gotcha and then maybe one more specific to the businesses here i mean with the acquisitions you ve done personal safety now by sub business is one of your larger exposures obviously i think you said organic was up seven can you just kind of talk a little bit about what s happening there and if you think that kind of momentum can continue to carry on mike roman chief executive officer yes if you look at if you think about personal safety it s been a leader for us in growth over the last two years 17 and 18 both strong growth and that s really i think a testament to the organic priorities that we put there and the leading position that we ve been able to develop organically and then also the acquisitions that have complemented that portfolio well it positions us well in the marketplace where the growth is happening and so we continue to see leading growth for the company and we are we have a very strong portfolio and position for our customers so i expect it s a larger business and it s a very strong contributor to our growth as we move ahead so i expect it to continue to lead in its market john walsh credit suisse analyst great thank you mike roman chief executive officer thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of julian mitchell of barclays please proceed with your question julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning mike roman chief executive officer hey julian nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning julian julian mitchell barclays analyst hey good morning just wanted to follow up if there was any extra color you d give on how the year is starting out in q1 versus either sales ranges laid out on the slide 17 or else the earnings bridge items on slide 20 things like fx hedging i m not sure how that plays out through the year and on the revenue side in particular just wondering how confident you are in q1 that apac and the emea regions can both see positive growth nick gangestad chief financial officer julian so far what we re seeing as a start to this year is very much in line with the guidance that we ve laid out and just in terms of how we ended 2018 i d say as we went through the quarter things were very much in line with what we were expecting the only color i d put is we probably saw some weakening in china as the quarter went on now in terms of 2019 and our guidance and what we re expecting there things that can impact quarter by quarter foreign exchange and i ll talk this on an eps basis we think that s going to be neutral for the year given where the currencies are if they stay there and given our hedging position i will note that it will be a headwind in the first half of the year particularly in q1 and then a tailwind to us in the second half of 2019 other things to note we expect margin expansion throughout the year full year based on our guidance it pencils out to about 100 100 basis point margin expansion and tax rate the tax rates we expect by quarter we re guiding 20 to 22 i d expect to see 20 the first quarter closer to the low end of that range and then the other quarters closer to the midpoint or high end of that range and then as far as growth that you were asking about right now our view is we see pretty much all the areas lining up with the ranges that we ve laid out i think in the case of china and asia where we re guiding low to mid single digits we if anything i d expect the first quarter to be the more challenged of those and then progressively better but i don t think it s too much out of the range that we ve just laid out here quarter by quarter julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you nick and then my follow up question would just be around some of the various cost levers in the p l you d stated that operating margins should be up about 100 points basis points for 2019 overall i m guessing r d may be a slight headwind r d to sales coming up so how do we think about the delta on gross margin versus sg a and i ask particularly because you had very very good sg a control in the second half of the year in particular is that a one time but then needs to step back up in sg a to sales in 19 or is it a function of productivity and business mix changes so it s sustainable nick gangestad chief financial officer julian if i break it into the three components you re asking about we do see our r d expense as a percent of revenue going up in 2019 we see our gross margin improving and we see our sg a percent to revenue going down so that margin expansion is going to be coming from both gross margin improvements and sg a productivity the gross margin improvements some of that has been going through our from our transformation some of it is coming from our footprint actions that we ve been actioning over the last couple of years and then on the sg a front it s our continued leverage of the productivity through our transformation efforts that we ll be continuing to expand margin on that front julian mitchell barclays analyst great thanks very much mike roman chief executive officer thanks julian nick gangestad chief financial officer thanks julian operator our next question comes from the line of scott davis of melius research please proceed with your question scott davis melius research analyst hey good morning guys mike roman chief executive officer hey scott nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning scott scott davis melius research analyst a couple small questions here first one i m just curious how do you get scott safety to grow 10 i mean tyco tried for a long time and i don t think they ever had a quarter anywhere close to that type of growth is it as simple as just plugging into your distribution system or is there something more to it mike roman chief executive officer yes i think the scott safety it goes back to what i was talking about with the safety business in general when we re bringing together those complementary portfolios it s been a really i think a win win for us as we ve integrated the teams together that we can go out with leading solutions and combine those and that s having a noticeable impact it s certainly energized the teams and it s had some impact on the business i think we had a number of projects come together in q4 that was part of it as well so we certainly saw positive timing impacting it but we are seeing a lift from having our leading personal safety portfolio combining with scott safety and capital safety for that matter and bringing those into the marketplace together scott davis melius research analyst that makes sense and guys as a follow up i m just curious on the cadence of cost out on the erp i mean when you deploy when you get 70 done i mean how long do you how long before you can cut the cord on the duplicate spend there s obviously some duplicate spend for a while until you are 100 comfortable going with that new erp system is there is that a material change in cadence through the year of cost out into 2020 nick gangestad chief financial officer scott i wouldn t call it a material change throughout the year i d call it a continued progression of what we were seeing in 18 into 19 so there s not going to be one significant triggering event but every quarter additional productivity as we realize those benefits as we ensure that our supply chain is functioning as we expected as we re meeting our customers requirements as we continue to work through those things we continue to see more and more sg a opportunity for benefits but not a cliff it will just continue to evolve over the next couple years mike roman chief executive officer and scott maybe to add to that we have a value realization map and as we deploy and we stabilize we get benefits from that as we take better advantage of our service models that we put in place we get benefit but we re also we talked about this in the investor day really doubling down on leveraging the new capabilities we have and that gives you a steady opportunity to drive productivity and that s what i think you ll see and that s the next point it s going to be a steady progression as we take full advantage of the capabilities that we re putting in place scott davis melius research analyst fair enough good luck and thank you fellows mike roman chief executive officer yes thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of deane dray of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning deane deane dray rbc capital markets analyst hey a little chilly for you guys this morning i see still mike roman chief executive officer a little bit deane dray rbc capital markets analyst glad everyone made it in for nick it looks like free cash flow yes you re above 100 for the fourth quarter but it did lag your historical fourth quarter conversion pretty significantly can you just walk us through the puts and takes there please nick gangestad chief financial officer yes as part of what i ve shared before we in 2018 built inventory in anticipation of some of our go lives for our business transformation erp deployments and as we ve progressed throughout the year one of the more significant things is that that extra inventory that we re seeing that s been impacting our cash flow it s one of the things that we are starting to see change in the fourth quarter and our expectation as we guide 95 to 105 free cash flow conversion in 2019 the expectation that we make even more significant improvements on that going through 19 so working capital is the biggest thing i ll call out there that we see that it s one of our biggest places for opportunity in our free cash flow conversion deane dray rbc capital markets analyst got it and then one of the businesses that had a soft spot in the third quarter was office retail but i see it swung into one of the growth areas this quarter could we just drill down for a bit on office retail maybe address e commerce and expectations in 2019 mike roman chief executive officer yes deane this has been an evolving story and we ve talked a lot about the channel and the restructuring that s going on there and it ends up and we see it as a sell in sell out kind of story even through that transformation we were seeing sell out for our portfolio still being positive we were seeing negative sell in as we saw the restructuring of the channel and inventory coming out there s certainly e commerce is another growth platform for that portfolio and we continue to do very well there in that category it s a strong growth driver for that business so as we came through 18 we started to see the balance between sell out and sell in come a little closer and so we saw some positive growth on the sell in and again the sell out remaining still strong so as we get into 19 the story will be what additional structure or changes will happen in the channel how does that shift we re going to continue to be focused on the end user and driving that demand and driving that sell out and i think we ll continue to drive a positive growth from that over the long run deane dray rbc capital markets analyst got it and just the last quick question your comment on the air quality improvement in china caught me a little bit by surprise but i see news reports now real significant improvement especially in beijing is that going to be a recurring theme because you ve got some tough comps in that business throughout that you ll be looking at in 2019 mike roman chief executive officer yes deane we saw we certainly had some tough comps as we came through the second half of 18 and with an improvement in air quality you saw that play out as part of the slowing that we saw in china in the second half of the year and impacted those businesses related to it as well when we go into 19 we still see some comp in the first half of the year but it gets a little more normalized and it will depend on what happens to air quality as we move ahead is there does it continue to see an improvement but our the base for it gets more in line with what we saw in 18 as we go through 19 deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you mike roman chief executive officer thanks deane operator our next question comes from the line of steve tusa of jpmorgan please proceed with your question steve tusa j p morgan analyst hi guys good morning mike roman chief executive officer good morning steve nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning steve steve tusa j p morgan analyst can we just maybe just help kind of calibrate perhaps with some numbers what could happen here in the first quarter i mean i hear a lot of commentary about from you guys and from everybody obviously it s kind of more of a macro thing about things slowing toward the end of the quarter and then into the first quarter you had a couple electronics guys who really saw a fall off toward kind of the end of the quarter and into the first and you said it s not going to be too different but kind of sounding like it s toward the low end of the range year over year i mean are we talking about basically like kind of a will you grow organically in the first quarter kind of at the low end of that range i mean is that kind of what you re saying nick gangestad chief financial officer analyst steve i would not be surprised if in the first half of the year partially based on comps we re in the lower half of the range and in the second half of the year we re in the upper half of the range steve tusa j p morgan analyst ok nick gangestad chief financial officer analyst much of what we have is lined up that way i don t see us in negative growth territory in any quarter and i and the second quarter the only reason i say that steve is we noted in second quarter last year that we felt there was some pull ahead of revenue from third quarter into second quarter so we ll be facing into that comp second quarter of this year steve tusa j p morgan analyst that makes a lot of sense and then your kind of normal seasonality is up low double digit from 4q to 1q should we think about that as kind of a little bit lower organic offset by lower tax or is the organic enough to kind of make first quarter a bit less of a seasonal performance nick gangestad chief financial officer i think taxes typically are lowest our first quarter is typically our lowest tax expense i do see it a bit more normalized of tax expense if you look quarter by quarter if you look at 2018 our tax expense in the first quarter was noticeably below the range i don t see that happening in first quarter of 19 i think it will be in the range but closer to the low end and then the other piece steve as i mentioned fx will be a bit of an abnormal pattern throughout the year that it will be a headwind to us in the first half and in particular in the first quarter and then it will be offsetting and flipping and that s primarily driven by hedging that we re seeing that we had hedging losses in 2018 and if currencies stay where they are they ll be flipping to hedging gains in 2019 steve tusa j p morgan analyst and how big are those gains for 19 nick gangestad chief financial officer we were hedging losses of approximately a little over 80 million in 2018 and if currencies stayed where they are they d be in the 50 million 60 million 70 million of gains right now steve tusa j p morgan analyst one last quick one for you guys on portfolio management this year you re kind of flipping the portfolio around a little bit it seems like it s a bit of a headwind this kind of 0 15 headwind i mean is that i know some of it is temporary but is that kind of should we be ready for a bit of kind of year one dilution as you work through as you continue to work through the portfolio on an annual basis or does it all kind of does it catch up toward the end because i know that you ve guided to positive ultimately positive benefits over the long term but obviously this year is a bit of a negative how should we think about that in the context of the long term guide on portfolio management nick gangestad chief financial officer analyst yes if i use m modal as an example that one we see as a 0 10 headwind this year that s driven by some of our transaction costs one time some of our integration costs at the beginning of the of our time of owning it as well as some ongoing amortization this particular one we guided that we think by year three it will be about 10 times this would equate to a 10 times ebitda so it will be generating 100 million plus of ebitda by year three i d say that s not uncommon of what to expect that often in the first year we want to aggressively integrate whatever we buy into the company to be fully realizing the value model that we can create by having it part of 3m steve tusa j p morgan analyst ok thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski of morgan stanley please proceed with your question josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning josh mike roman chief executive officer good morning josh josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst just maybe to start out can nick can you talk about what some of the offsetting factors are in guidance i guess if i add up pension the m modal and then the lower organic growth it seems like a bit more than what you ve tweaked the range by you mentioned that the tariff headwind was a little lower is there anything else in the bridge that we should be aware of as being kind of an offsetting item nick gangestad chief financial officer in terms of what we were anticipating back in november those three things you just called out josh those would all be tweaks down as far as tweaks up since november we re seeing a less negative environment for raw material prices that if i had called out specifically in back in november what we were expecting for raw material headwinds i would have been quoting a higher number there and that s partially offsetting some of these tweaks down that we ve that i ve laid out that s the single biggest one that s changed josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst got it that s helpful then just as an exporter did you see any of your customers in the fourth quarter do any pre buy work when january was still kind of a target date for tariffs we ve seen some of that in some other short cycle guys curious if that impacted you at all mike roman chief executive officer yes josh we watch that closely and it s part of what we look at in the channel that we see when we see these macro changes are they impacting the pre buy we didn t see that as we came through the quarter and as nick said the quarter progressed the way we expected we re it s not just watching from a distance we re close with those partners and we don t we didn t have any indication of that happening certainly not at any significant level josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst got it appreciate it thanks mike mike roman chief executive officer yes operator our next question comes from the line of john inch of gordon haskett please proceed with your question john inch gordon haskett analyst good morning everybody nick gangestad chief financial officer good morning john mike roman chief executive officer good morning john john inch gordon haskett analyst good morning guys hey so europe western europe flat how much of that was self inflicted by your own actions to withdraw from certain product lines and markets versus the actual market and what kind of i don t know if there s a way to quantify it but what how does that sort of spill into kind of the 2019 outlook as well is there a way to quantify that nick gangestad chief financial officer john i d estimate that there s about 200 basis points of us taking specific actions of adjusting our portfolio of product lines that we re choosing to exit that are built into that there will be some carry forward of that into 19 but not on as a significant level as what we saw in 2018 john inch gordon haskett analyst and nick are you still on track to get to the 20 margins in europe i forget exactly what you said in november what your timeline was but how is that tracking is that ahead of schedule or just on track nick gangestad chief financial officer yes we re on track to do that john 2019 will be a noticeable year where we ve done a number of things in 17 and 18 to set us up for that 19 will be a year of seeing noticeable margin improvement to get us on track to that 20 by 2020 john inch gordon haskett analyst 20 by 2020 ok and then there s a lot of moving parts here to this guide i understand why you took the lower end of the range down a point but the midpoint if you adjust for m modal really only declines by 0 05 right which i guess you could argue that s the impact of half a point but there must be some other things i m curious specifically on raw materials i don t i get what you re saying on the other hand nick didn t you say that tariffs would be fully offset and versus november this raw material productivity the minus 0 20 to minus 0 10 is that actually lower because obviously things like oil and other things have actually declined so just trying to calibrate why even though you lowered the guide where only the midpoint is 0 05 lower and is any of this being offset because raw materials are while still a headwind slightly better if that makes sense nick gangestad chief financial officer analyst yes we if i had shown this what we expected it look like in november i would have been showing a higher raw material headwind there as we ve seen with oil and some of the things that we were expecting on tariffs haven t turned out quite as bad as what we were estimating back in november we i said we were confident that we could more than offset whatever we see with raw materials and tariffs with our selling prices and we remain i d say even more confident on that front john inch gordon haskett analyst andthen just lastly nick how did the semicon piece of 3m do specifically i think that s remind us is that about 1 billion dollars i know consumer electronics is around 2 billion did semicon was it seeing the weakness particularly in asia that a lot of these companies are calling out or did you do better and if you did better actually why do you think that s the case mike roman chief executive officer john maybe yes i ll take that if you look at the business our electronic materials business has got the semiconductor piece of it it s not the largest piece of that and when you look at that we ve got other businesses in there we ve got materials into consumer electronics we have assembly solutions but a big portion of it goes into semicon we certainly expected to see some slowing as we went through the quarter they as nick talked about they were in line that business was in line with the overall 3 growth that we saw in the quarter going forward there s more caution in that marketplace and the semiconductor manufacturers are part of that so i would say it was less of an impact on q4 but more of part of the caution as we guide going into 19 john inch gordon haskett analyst understood got it thanks guys appreciate it nick gangestad chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of laurence alexander of jefferies company please proceed with your question laurence alexander jefferies company analyst hi two quick ones could you characterize what you re seeing in latin america in a little bit more detail like where the pockets of strength are and can you speak a little bit more broadly about in 2019 2020 what kind of impact you may see on 3m from emerging market customers realigning their supply chains to work around the current tariff disputes mike roman chief executive officer laurence talking about latin america first we saw broader based growth in latin america across our portfolio and both brazil and mexico the largest countries there performing well as we came through q4 so it was pretty balanced and pretty broad based in portfolio and growth and we re we have that same kind of outlook as we look to 2019 and i to your question about the supply chain and are we seeing changes there it s certainly something we watch for we expect the supply chain to react over time as tariffs come into play we haven t seen a significant impact to that at this point it just hasn t shown up that way we watch it closely with the customer and we re connected with them on the design and specification of our products and that includes pretty good visibility on the supply chain we just haven t seen it react that strongly to this point laurence alexander jefferies company analyst thank you mike roman chief executive officer yes nick gangestad chief financial officer thanks laurence operator our next question comes from the line of nigel coe of wolfe research please proceed with your question nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning and thanks for going long here can you hear me ok mike roman chief executive officer yes nick gangestad chief financial officer yes nigel coe wolfe research analyst good i m having some problems with the phone here so i m on a cellphone just want to go back to the electronics outlook for zero to 4 and obviously you ve provided some comments in terms of quarterly cadence if we dig into the businesses electronics business energy are you seeing any appreciable difference in the two sub segments for 19 mike roman chief executive officer in nigel you re talking about the sub segments of energy or the you re talking about energy versus electronics nigel coe wolfe research analyst energy versus electronics i m looking at that 2 midpoint how would that break out between the two sub segments mike roman chief executive officer yes yes we highlighted the good performance from energy markets in q4 and we have an outlook for that to continue as we go into 2019 so i would say that is more of the same the electronics we ve been coloring that all morning based on the outlook in the end markets so i would say that s the one that we re a little more cautious about energy looks pretty stable as we go into the year but both of them contributing i would say kind of evenly across the year with that kind of caution on the end markets in play nigel coe wolfe research analyst ok and is there any appreciable difference in the margin profile between energy and electronics i ve always assumed electronics was higher margins but could you clarify that nick gangestad chief financial officer yes nigel there s really not a discernible difference between the margins in the different components there between our electronics and our energy they re very similar nigel ok and then nick if you could just quickly clarify the comments you made on safety and graphics margins for 4q you called out scott safety integration headwinds but then we re comping against some of the purchase accounting headwinds in 4q of 17 so i m just wondering why we wouldn t have seen a benefit from scott safety in 4q 18 yes when i m backing out last year there were one time costs with scott bringing them in as well as the gain that we had on the sale of our electronic monitoring business when i go and say it s 110 basis underlying margin contraction that s already discounting for that piece now that we ve taken that out and as part of our ongoing business we are continuing to take actions in scott and other parts of our safety and graphics business but scott s the largest one that we re taking actions on that s one of the things that s behind that the other piece that i maybe didn t highlight clearly enough for you nigel is the sales decline that we re seeing in roofing granules that is creating a year on year margin contraction in safety and graphics that s impacting that total nigel coe wolfe research analyst understood thanks nick nick gangestad chief financial officer analyst yes mike roman chief executive officer thanks nigel operator that concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call i will now turn the call back over to mike roman for some closing comments mike roman chief executive officer thank you in summary the fourth quarter capped another year of significant accomplishments for 3m as we posted good results

the fed says it will be patient with interest rates and wall street jumps in response 1 the macro matters for markets there are two things important to financial markets currently the outlook for global growth and the state of financial conditions that is what are economic fundamentals showing and how are central bankers responding to those fundamentals at its core the market rout in the last quarter of 2018 was about the interplay of these two concerns global growth was apparently slowing unaided by the trade war and a seemingly cyclical slow down in the chinese economy while monetary policy was tightening sucking liquidity out of financial markets it was believed that a deterioration in the global economy was upon us it may well still be and those responsible for ensuring this does not eventuate were deaf to the cries of market participants 2 the links between the fundamentals and the themes this is the reason why a headline about a weaker europe or an escalation in the trade war or a story about the us fed sticking to rate hikes or its quantitative tightening program hurt the bulls so much the global economy can t prosper without at least signs of solid growth or the necessary support from monetary authorities to at the very least keep the global economy on life support

november 14 2018 john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer thank you bob and good morning everyone thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call in my opening remarks i want to highlight some of the headline themes that we ll be discussing with you today a strength of our business model is the ability to rebalance our portfolio between contractual and spot market freight as market conditions change in periods of market dislocation we experience higher levels of repricing activity across our portfolio then as routing guides perform more effectively and freight costs decelerate we tend to see our volume shift more heavily toward contractual business accompanied by net revenue growth and margin expansion this outcome is clearly reflected in our fourth quarter results over an extended freight cycle we continue to believe that honoring our commitments on contractual freight while also securing spot market capacity is the best way to serve our network of customers and carriers grow our business and create value for shareholders with fluctuating levels of freight demand and carrier supply significant weather events and changes in tariff activity and government regulations the last few years have marked a period of high volatility in the freight market a critical part of our strategy is to make investments that add value for our customers and carriers and drive growth for our business regardless of where we are in the freight cycle we are proud of the strong financial results we delivered in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 and believe that they are a reflection of our strategy of through cycle investments our north american surface transportation business did an excellent job of supporting our customers and carriers through a volatile freight market and delivered outstanding results for the year our global forwarding business delivered strong revenue growth through a combination of volume increases and pricing adjustments that reflect market conditions while also making investments to drive future growth our robinson fresh business delivered significantly improved results in the second half of the year and finished the year with net revenue growth and operating margin expansion with those introductory comments i ll turn it over to andy to review our financial statements andrew clarke chief executive officer thank you john and good morning everyone i d like to begin my comments on the financial results by highlighting the fact that robinson achieved record results across the board gross revenues net revenues and operating income for both the quarter and the full year were at all time highs all three of our reportable segments contributed to this success by growing both net revenues and operating income at a double digit rate in the fourth quarter each segment expanded operating margin significantly in the quarter as well from a cash flow perspective we knocked it out of the park generating over 700 million in free cash flow and returning nearly 600 million to our shareholders during the year our enterprise platform has been carefully and thoughtfully constructed over many years for both scale and leverage through all types of environments and cycles we are appropriately proud of this performance now on to slide 4 and our financial results fourth quarter total revenues increased 4 5 to 4 1 billion driven by higher pricing across most transportation service lines volume growth in ltl ocean and customs and higher fuel costs total company net revenues increased 82 million or 13 in the quarter to 714 million net revenue growth was led by truckload services up 53 million and ltl services up 12 million we delivered double digit net revenue growth in ocean air and customs for a combined increase of 15 million in the quarter fourth quarter monthly net revenue per business day was up 10 11 and 13 respectively in october november and december total operating expenses increased 37 million an 8 9 increase versus the prior year period personnel expenses increased 8 9 primarily as a result of increases in our performance based compensation that aligns the interests of our employees with our shareholders total company average headcount increased slightly in the quarter and slowed sequentially from the 2 6 growth in the third quarter the fourth quarter included headcount reductions in both global forwarding and robinson fresh sg a expenses were up 8 8 in the quarter to 119 million the primary drivers were increases in outside professional services occupancy and travel and entertainment costs total operating income was a record 256 million in the fourth quarter up 21 2 over last year operating margin expanded 240 basis points versus last year and 40 basis points sequentially to 35 8 our teams did an excellent job of achieving operating margin leverage in the quarter and the year this has been and will remain a top priority for our organization fourth quarter net income was 187 million an increase of 22 7 our diluted earnings per share was 1 34 in the fourth quarter up from 1 08 last year slide 5 covers other income statement items the fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23 9 up from 21 1 last year recall that the year ago period included one time tax benefits totaling 31 8 million for the full year our tax rate was 24 5 and we expect our effective tax rate to be between 24 25 again in 2019 as noted throughout the year we adopted the new accounting standards update for revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018 as a result in transit shipments are now included in our financial results this policy did not have a material impact on our overall operating results for the year however it did significantly decrease gross revenues in our robinson fresh sourcing business including a 37 million reduction in the fourth quarter of this year for the full year sourcing gross revenues were negatively impacted by 121 million fourth quarter interest and other expense totaled 9 5 million down from 17 5 million last year every quarter we are required to revalue our u s dollar working capital and cash balances against the functional currency in each country where we conduct business and hold u s dollars the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the income statement the u s dollar strengthened against several of our key currencies this quarter resulting in a 2 4 million gain from currency revaluation movements in currency valuations will continue to have an impact on our quarterly net income and we will continue to break out this impact in future quarters the gain in currency valuation was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates while overall debt balance was down our share count in the quarter was down just over 1 as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans turning to slide 6 we had another strong quarter of cash generation cash flow from operations totaled 264 million in the quarter up 59 versus last year for the full year cash flow from operations increased nearly 107 to 793 million a combination of increased earnings and improved working capital performance drove the fourth quarter and full year improvement capital expenditures totaled 14 3 million for the quarter and 63 9 million for the year in 2019 we expect capital expenditures to be between 80 90 million the increased spending will be primarily dedicated to technology our capital distribution is summarized on slide 7 we returned 168 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends a 42 increase versus the prior year period for the full year we returned 590 million to shareholders a 28 increase in 2019 we will continue to evaluate and deploy our capital to add value to our network of customers and carriers and generate returns for our employees and shareholders we will look to acquire quality companies that fit our strategies business model and culture and we will continue to reward our shareholders through buybacks and dividends now on to the balance sheet on slide 8 working capital increased 12 versus the prior year period driven by higher gross revenues and the resulting increase in accounts receivables the contract assets and accrued transportation expense lines on the balance sheet primarily reflect in transit activity in accordance with the adoption of revenue recognition our debt balance at the quarter was 1 35 billion across our credit facility private placement debt accounts receivable securitization and senior notes our weighted average interest rate was 4 in the quarter slide 9 captures our full year financial performance we delivered double digit growth in net revenues and operating income and a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin strong operating profit performance combined with improved working capital and the benefits of corporate tax reform drove a 32 5 increase in our earnings per share once again it bears mentioning 2018 net revenues operating income earnings per share and cash flow from operations all represent record levels of performance for c h robinson i d like to congratulate all of our teams across the globe on your outstanding performance in 2018 our great results this year reflect our focus on profitable growth and our vigorous efforts to grow our business while maintaining strong operational excellence i ll wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends our consistent practice is to share the per business day comparison of net revenues and volume january 2019 global net revenues per business day have increased approximately 9 and north american truckload volumes have increased approximately 3 as we look ahead to the balance of the first quarter we wanted to highlight an item from our 2018 first quarter results driven by the tight truckload market last year we saw sequential acceleration in our net revenue growth during the first quarter of 2018 last year net revenue per business day increased 7 12 and 12 respectively in january february and march additionally the 2019 first quarter has one less business day versus the first quarter of 2018 thank you all for joining us this morning we appreciate you all listening i will now turn it over to bob to provide additional context on our segment performance robert biesterfeld chief operating officer thanks andy and good morning everyone i ll begin my remarks this morning on our operating segment performance by highlighting the rapidly changing nature of the logistics market on slide 11 the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in north america truckload rate per mile billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel costs since 2008 as a reminder north america truckload includes both nast and robinson fresh truckload the grey line represents our net revenue margin for all transportation services the rate of growth in north america truckload price per mile and cost per mile continued to moderate this quarter including a modest decline in truckload cost per mile versus the prior year we benefited from the shift toward contractual volume in a decelerating cost environment in the fourth quarter leading to 110 basis points sequential improvement in transportation net revenue margin from the third quarter our net revenue margin expands and contracts with changes in the freight cycle tending to expand when costs moderate despite the high level of rate and cost volatility as well as other secular market factors our average net revenue margin has remained relatively consistent over time one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our managed services business which represents roughly 4 billion in freight under management in the fourth quarter the average routing guide depth of tender was 1 4 representing that on average the first or second carrier in a shipper s routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases this representation of routing guide performance is reflective of a more balanced market moving to slide 12 this graph shows north america truckload average price per mile billed to customers and cost per mile paid to our carriers net of fuel since 2010 and represents the underlying data from the previous slide we ve excluded the actual price per mile and cost per mile scale to protect our proprietary data the absolute price per mile and cost per mile moderated versus last quarter however both metrics remain well above levels we ve seen over much of the current decade so while the managed services routing guide depth of 1 4 reflects a more balanced market it appears that in general routing guides have reset at higher pricing and are functioning more effectively the chart also shows that since 2010 we ve continued to adjust our pricing in response to changes in marketplace conditions we ve generally maintained a consistent spread between price and cost even in periods of high volatility in the freight market on average both customer pricing and carrier costs have increased at roughly 3 annually over this time period turning to slide 13 in our north america surface transportation business fourth quarter nast net revenues increased 13 5 to 471 million led by double digit growth in our truckload less than truckload and intermodal services a combination of higher contractual prices and moderating freight costs in the fourth quarter drove a 110 basis point expansion in net revenue margin despite a roughly 35 basis point headwind led by higher fuel costs led by higher pricing our truckload net revenues increased 13 to 344 million in the quarter the successful repricing of our contractual business during 2018 has rebalanced our portfolio leaning toward more contractual freight with an approximate mix of 65 contractual and 35 transactional volume in the fourth quarter versus a 50 50 mix in the year ago period nast truckload volume declined modestly in the quarter down 1 5 as our repricing activity led to roughly 45 reduction in our negative loads associated with contractual shipments and returned our negative load percentage to a more typical level we continue to add new carriers to our network driving continued expansion of the largest fleet of motor carriers in north america while simultaneously bringing new capacity solutions to life for our customers we added roughly 4 800 new carriers in the fourth quarter which is a 30 increase over last year s fourth quarter our less than truckload business delivered another quarter of great performance with net revenues increasing 11 5 to 112 million this represents our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit net revenue growth we delivered a high single digit increase in pricing driven by the continued expansion of pricing tools that enable us to react faster to changes in the ltl market ltl volumes increased 2 in the quarter driven by continued growth in manufacturing and e commerce through our common carrier service offerings and our consolidation products we continue to gain scale and market share in the ltl segment in our intermodal business fourth quarter net revenues increased 76 4 versus the year ago period which included elevated repositioning charges we remain committed to our intermodal business as it enables us to offer our customers the most comprehensive service line offerings in the logistics industry slide 14 outlines our nast operating income performance fourth quarter operating income increased 16 9 to 211 million operating margin of 44 8 improved 130 basis points led by net revenue growth this strong performance includes the impact of higher variable compensation expenses our fourth quarter operating margin also improved 90 basis points sequentially our fourth quarter results reflect the benefits of our continued investments in technology we are leveraging advanced algorithms and the scale of our data advantage to further improve our ability to profitably match shipper demand and carrier supply across our network we are also driving productivity improvement through tools that automate interactions with our customers and our carriers and improve our internal workflows these investments enabled us to deliver growth in both net revenues and expand our operating margin in the fourth quarter for the full year our nast business delivered outstanding performance net revenues increased 17 3 including double digit growth in our truckload ltl and intermodal service lines despite headcount that grew less than 0 5 operating margin expanded 210 basis points including the impact of increased variable compensation expense driven by our strong performance in 2019 we plan to accelerate our digital transformation efforts and technology investments to make our processes even more efficient and our employees even more productive while continuing to deliver more benefits to our network of customers and carriers turning to slide 15 and our global forwarding business fourth quarter global forwarding net revenues increased 11 6 to 143 million we lapped our acquisition of milgram co in canada in the third quarter so our fourth quarter net revenue performance reflects pure organic growth from a comparability standpoint in our ocean service line we returned to net revenue growth as expected driven by a combination of pricing reflective of the current market conditions and a robust sales pipeline ocean net revenues increased 12 4 in the quarter including a 7 5 increase in shipment volumes fourth quarter air net revenues increased 9 3 as a shift in customer mix was partially offset by a 3 decline in shipments customs net revenues increased 12 4 in the quarter while transactions increased approximately 4 5 in the fourth quarter as we continue to expand our customs presence around the world in our conversations with carriers and global shippers companies continue to plan for tariff activity and potential implications to the redesign of global supply chains our global forwarding business is actively engaged with customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts of both the enacted and potential future tariffs the current set of tariffs in place has not had a significant impact on our global forwarding financial results given our broad portfolio of service offerings and our strong presence in key markets such as southeast asia and india we believe we are well positioned to help our customers continue to win in an ever changing global trade environment slide 16 outlines our global forwarding operating income performance fourth quarter operating income increased 76 9 to 30 million operating margin of 20 9 increased 770 basis points versus last year led by higher net revenues and a modest decline in headcount for the full year we re pleased with the top line growth of our global forwarding business we grew volume in our ocean air and custom service lines and generated double digit growth in global forwarding net revenues looking forward we continue to see significant opportunities to drive scale and geographic reach in the segment at the same time we realize that we have opportunities to drive even greater efficiency as we grow this business so we re focused on operating margin expansion through additional technology deployment and intelligent process automation over the long term we remain confident that we will deliver operating margin performance consistent with other leading companies in the global forwarding segment transitioning to slide 17 and our robinson fresh segment sourcing net revenues were 25 million down 8 2 from last year case volumes declined 6 5 driven by a combination of lower levels of promotional activity at our retail customers and lower restaurant traffic at our foodservice customers the revenue recognition policy change negatively impacted sourcing total revenues by approximately 37 million in the quarter there was no impact to net revenue transportation net revenues grew 45 9 to over 39 million led by a double digit increase in truckload the improvements in robinson fresh transportation results are directly related to the repricing activities that took place throughout 2018 slide 18 outlines our robinson fresh operating income performance fourth quarter operating income grew by 53 5 to nearly 20 million operating margin of 30 8 improved 700 basis points led by higher net revenues in the transportation business and a 5 reduction in headcount through a combination of pricing reflective of market conditions operating expense controls and investments to improve operational efficiency our robinson fresh team generated improved results in the second half of 2018 and for the full year delivered both growth in net revenues and operating income along with 190 basis points of operating margin expansion moving to our all other and corporate businesses on slide 19 as a reminder all other includes our managed services business surface transportation outside of north america other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses managed services net revenues increased 10 9 to 20 million in the quarter driven by a combination of selling additional services to our existing customers and new customer wins freight under management increased 2 in the quarter to over 1 3 billion and freight under management for the full year increased 9 to eclipse 4 billion customers continue to value our transportation management system offering which allows them to manage their carrier selection process and complex supply chains without the required fixed investment in people or technology our sales pipeline in the managed services business remains very robust and we expect continued growth in this business in 2019 other surface transportation net revenues declined 7 3 in the quarter to 15 million as pricing declines were partially offset by a mid single digit increase in volume we have a very strong pipeline of new business in our europe surface transportation before i turn the call back to john for some final comments i ll take a minute to wrap up the section on our operating performance our operating results reflect our continued ability to help our network of customers and carriers navigate a rapidly changing freight market and provide solutions that accelerate commerce in their businesses in both the fourth quarter and the full year we delivered strong growth in net revenues and an expansion in both net revenue margin and operating margin we also significantly increased our cash from operations and cash return to shareholders i m very pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year financial results as we turn to 2019 we remain committed to our operating plans that we ve been implementing across our businesses we will continue to leverage our comprehensive offering of services and capabilities to deliver logistics expertise to our customers and carriers we will accelerate our digital transformation with investments in technology that deliver actionable intelligence and supply chain capabilities to the over 200 00 companies that conduct business on our global platform i remain confident that we ll continue to deliver industry leading capabilities to our customers and our carriers to provide rewarding career opportunities for our employees and to generate strong returns to our shareholders thank you for listening this morning and at this point i ll turn the call back to john john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer thank you bob i want to wrap up our prepared remarks for the few final comments let me start by sharing a few data points on what we re seeing currently in the marketplace as stated we do see evidence of a more balanced freight market routing guide depths are now more consistent with a balanced freight market and our truckload shipments have moved back to our typical more contractually weighted mix the significant price increases of 2018 have moderated and while it s uncertain what the remainder of 2019 will bring we are in a more balanced situation today tariffs and changes in global trade agreements remain a big uncertainty for many of our customers we do believe there were modest amounts of advance shipping and inventory buildup in 2018 the u s economy continues to grow and our customers are generally planning for steady to increased freight volumes while our markets are more balanced at the moment the potential for further changes remains high our core go to market strategy has always been to help our customers understand and adapt to the market conditions we focus on managing through the cyclical changes in the market while investing in our capabilities for the future 2018 was a year of excellent financial performance for robinson we generated record levels of revenues operating income earnings per share and cash from operations but more importantly we continue to invest in our people processes and technology for the future our team our culture and our platform are real competitive advantages that are getting stronger every day we feel great about our future and our continuing ability to create value for all of our stakeholders that concludes our prepared comments and with that i ll turn it back to the operator so that we can answer the submitted questions questions and answers operator thank you mr houghton the floor is now yours for the question and answer session robert houghton vice president investor relations thank you donna first i would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday for today s q a session i will frame up the question and then turn it over to john andy or bob for a response our first question comes from several analysts bob after a very strong 2018 year over year comparisons clearly get more challenging as we move through 2019 can you speak to the levers that you intend to pull to help drive nast net revenue growth in 2019 given evidence of a balanced freight market robert biesterfeld chief operating officer absolutely so we re definitely feeling a more balanced market in 2019 when compared to the prior year as we ve stated in the past we tend to look at net revenue dollars on a per load or per shipment basis as a more important internal metric than absolute net revenue margin so we know for the first half of 2018 our net revenue dollars per load were pretty close to our historical average and those really expanded throughout the second half of the year as costs started to moderate so for us success in 2019 is going to come from continuing to take market share through increasing truckload and ltl volumes on a year over year basis as well as continuing to stay focused on our initiatives around cost control and driving further efficiency into our business model volume growth will be key for us throughout the year but even more so in the second half fortunately for us we ve only got 3 market share today in nast and we ve got a really large and aggressive sales force that s committed to driving growth in 2019 by continuing to add value to our customers and carriers in these market conditions i ve said it a lot in the past several years but our focus is really not to go ditch to ditch between a focus on net revenue per load and load volume but to continue to pursue that balanced growth strategy over the long term and throughout cycles robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question comes from jack atkins with stephens jack atkins stephens inc managing director andy looking back to the last time we were in a balanced market 2016 and early 2017 your net operating margin peaked in the second quarter of 2016 and then declined pretty significantly over the next several quarters would you expect net revenue to grow faster than operating expenses in 2019 andrew clarke chief executive officer thanks jack for the question the short answer is our stated goal and objective is always to grow net revenue faster than operating expenses that s at the enterprise level but also at the divisional levels when you reference a balanced market i know you re speaking specifically to the truckload market and let s go back and revisit that and the difference which by the way is truckload is 55 of our net revenue today and it s growing and it s great and we re very pleased with it but in that market i would say that there are two differences that primarily are different than today and the first is gdp was lower and the second is pricing and cost were lower so today and at that point it s pure arithmetic where the cost and the price were lower today gdp is higher and the price and the cost are higher so if you look at those lines that we produce in the published reports on our earnings they re higher but the relative difference hasn t really materially changed so when we think about those levers particularly within nast we think that continuing to grow net revenue in excess of our expenses is clearly achievable you then layer in some of the other services that we ve added over the last five or six years you think about ltl you think about global forwarding both of those businesses have doubled in that time and in doing so we ve added more of a secular growth story to the robinson enterprise and robinson platform and in doing that we ve made investments and clearly as you saw in the fourth quarter a lot of those investments began to pay off so we re really pleased with those results and we do expect and it s our stated goal and it s how we re all compensated to grow net revenues in excess of our operating expenses robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question is for john and it s from ben hartford of robert w baird jack atkins with stephens asked a similar question benjamin hartford robert w baird analyst what are 2019 contractual pricing growth expectations have they softened from the low single digit outlook provided on the third quarter earnings call john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer so in our committed bid the low single digit comment was relevant to truckload so i m assuming that s where the question is at but with regards to our contractual bidding whenever you go through a period of time where there s meaningful change in the spot market you re going to start to see some of that show up in the sentiment around the contracts and the committed rates over the months of december and january there have been some meaningful softening and reductions in some of the spot market and that will start to show up in the attitudes and the outcomes of the bids and the committed relationships i think low single digits is probably still a good center of gravity maybe a quarter ago people were saying low to mid single digits and that s more what we re seeing now more common low to flat single digits so some of the softening in the pricing is showing up in the committed activity it s a pretty rapidly changing market as we shared in our prepared comments there s a lot of different factors that are continuing to impact those bid arrangements and a lot of potential for change but today probably low single digits is still a good center of gravity in terms of expectations around committed pricing robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks john the next question is for bob from todd fowler with keybanc todd fowler keybanc capital markets managing director with respect to the outlook commentary indicating that continued investments in technology will help achieve the 2019 objectives of top line growth and operating margin expansion could you comment on how you see technology impacting 2019 and beyond are there costs associated with these investments that tail off in the future and if so how much robert biesterfeld chief operating officer thanks todd we expect that our capex run rate will increase to about 80 90 million in 2019 and with that really our total expense related to it investment for next year is planned to increase to well over 200 million so while we re really proud of the foundation we ve built within our navisphere technology platform and our ability to provide customers and carriers with unrivaled actionable intelligence about their businesses the further investments that we re going to make in technology will really be focused on ensuring that we re providing best in class user centric technology we re providing technology that enables even more frictionless transactions leveraging more effectively advanced analytics and data science and that doesn t just apply to truckload but really applies across all of our services we want to make sure that our it team has the appropriate resources that they need to accelerate the speed to value so that they can take the great ideas from our people and from our customers and bring those to life even faster for our clients and create value for all of our stakeholders so in terms of the step up in capex i d expect that to be pretty consistent for the next several years robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question is also for bob from chris wetherbee of citi chris wetherbee citigroup analyst fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin expansion can you help provide color on the broader trends in the cost structure is it being driven by more automated transactions in direct load matching and are there other initiatives and what level do you think operating margins can move to over time robert biesterfeld chief operating officer i m really bullish on our ability to both drive net revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the coming years much as andy said automating transactions and direct load matching are certainly part of the reason why operating margin has expanded and why we believe the opportunity to continue to expand operating margin but it s really only part of the story the active matching capacity to demand is really a small part of the overall quote to cash cycle that our clients ask us to manage for them and we re focused on creating value and reducing cost at each step of that cycle so we re investing in the area of direct load matching but we re also rolling out tools that help us to accept the right freight based upon predictions of outcomes more effectively manage exceptions and we re leveraging tech in new ways across all of our reporting segments that remove unnecessary steps out of our operational processes we re investing in tech and process improvement to enhance our sales force both the sales force effectiveness and the sales force efficiency as well as back office function such as collections billing imaging and the like which has a positive impact digital freight matching is clearly gaining most of the headlines today we feel like we re in a great place in that space but our focus is going to continue to be from quote to cash and in the simplest sense it s about winning more freight executing at a lower cost and maintaining or improving our industry leading operating margins robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question for andy comes from todd fowler todd fowler keybanc capital markets managing director what do you view as normalized net operating margins for nast and global forwarding what factors within your control contribute to your ability to improve net operating margins over time andrew clarke chief executive officer several years ago we made the decision to go to reportable segments and in doing so we broke out nast global forwarding and robinson fresh under individual performance so now we have four years of data to look at and over that period of time i would break nast and global forwarding into two components and the first component is net revenue and nast net revenue the median net revenue margin percentage of nast has been 16 4 over those last four years with a standard deviation of 120 basis points and that includes the cosmetic impact of fuel but also the substitution impact of ltl which tends to have a higher net revenue margin percentage and so we would say that that net revenue margin has been relatively consistent and it s been in that mid double digits for a long period of time and we would expect it to continue to be in that and so then you go to and to a large degree there s a cyclical element of that as bob mentioned earlier making a lot of investments on the it and the business side to help us make smarter decisions both for our customers on the pricing side but also our carriers on the cost side in doing so we think that we can continue to move the needle a bit on the net revenue margins on the operating margin side again same figures over the last four years nast operating margins the median s been about 43 5 and if you knock out the high highs and the low lows the standard deviation on that has been 160 basis points and we talk about making investments in a through cycle environment and so fortunately for us we have the ability as bob mentioned earlier to give our it people the resources to make investments despite the fact there were periods of time if we go back to the net revenue number where in fact the net revenue has been below the median for a period of time we re still making investments and as a result you see the commensurate impact on the operating margin percentage but the good news is when we come out the other side the operating margin expands and so to a large degree that s where we re really focusing our efforts again as both bob and john mentioned we re going to continue to make those investments but we re going to continue to be more efficient and more effective as we go to market the global forwarding story is yet another interesting one as i mentioned earlier it s doubled in the last four or five years we continue have made significant investments in that part of our business and today it s continuing to grow and it d be an important part of our go to market with our customers their median net revenue margins have been 22 8 again with a standard deviation of about 180 basis points on the operating margin side the median s been about just under 21 and again knocking out the high highs and the low lows you ve got about a 280 basis point standard deviation on the operating margin you have to then add back or include what i would say we talk about the investments we ve made on the cash amortization that s anywhere from 6 8 so think about the operating margin of 21 we believe that those are on a cash basis in the high 20s low 30s now on a relative basis it s less mature than our nast business and so we would expect both the net revenue margins on global forwarding as well as the operating margins given the investments that we ve made to continue to expand both in nast and global forwarding robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question is also for andy from matt young with morningstar jason seidl with cowen and company also asked a similar question matthew young morningstar analyst a few upstart digital freight brokers appear to be gaining some traction in the truck brokerage space at least from a gross revenue standpoint could you talk about what you are noticing if anything in the marketplace from these providers andrew clarke chief executive officer i think it s appropriate to first talk about and start off by answering that question and really telling the story of our platform and then maybe begin to talk about what others are talking about what they re doing and so robinson is a digital leader in the logistics space and it s a big it s a growing space but we ve been in it the longest bob mentioned we re spending as much if not more than anybody else we re connecting over 200 000 companies around the globe through that navisphere technology platform we re executing truckload ltl intermodal ocean air customs managed services parcel and other services with over 20 billion in freight under management one hundred percent of our shipments are executed on the navisphere platform and again why does that benefit the benefit is obviously to our customers they have one source of truth for that why does it benefit our carriers it allows them to go to one place to get access to all of their information and so we believe in that one platform and so we re going to continue to invest in it and while it s big and growing we re the largest i wouldn t say that anybody could go out there and claim to have conquered logistics despite the fact that there are many people out there with apps or many people out there with press releases there are many people that are out there telling the story of how much they might have raised in a particular round it s a big space and we re going to continue to lead in that where we are seeing some of these digital competitors that you might have mentioned are in select customers we have over 120 000 customers and i d say if you canvassed all of them there s probably 119 000 of those customers that aren t or haven t been doing business with the digital upstarts now there are 17 000 brokers truckload brokers freight brokers in north america right now if you think about where that exists in the globe there s multiples of that as well and so we have had and will always have competition in the marketplace and to a large degree everybody s talking about technology our go to market has been and will continue to be our people our process and our technology we believe that those three tenets are core to how we re going to continue to successfully grow our business solve the complex global logistics needs of our customers be a strategic provider to our carriers whether they be located in north america whether they be located in europe asia latin america and so we re pretty comfortable and pretty confident in our technology story particularly vis a vis the start ups robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question for john comes from several analysts how much business is currently under spot versus contract and do you think there will be a shift back to the spot market in 2019 john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer we are today in our truckload business back to that more typical mix of having more committed or contractual activity probably two thirds one third about 65 35 with more of that being committed or contracted today with regards to where will it go in 2019 and where it will it s more difficult than ever to predict but a few thoughts around that coming off of 2018 where we showed on our charts double digit price increases over a short period of time and that being higher than anything that you see historically on any of those charts those price increases were in part driven by some regulatory changes around eld implementations and all of the carrier network changes that accompanied those implementations we don t see anything on the horizon that is that significant there s no pending rule changes or anything that would suggest that that type of spot market activity or price increases would happen again in the short term as i commented earlier there has been some deceleration of pricing in the spot market and some opportunity where maybe the committed rates are softening a little bit and could drive some shippers to explore more spot market opportunities to take advantage of lower prices if that s where it s sustained so while we don t see anything big on the horizon that would drive it back to the spot market another factor to consider is that over the last decade as shippers have automated their supply chains and carriers have automated and tightened their network around how they run their capacity there is less slack in the overall system which has led to more volatility and greater price changes so while there s nothing big on the horizon that caused the price increases in 2018 the overall environment is predisposed toward faster changes and greater impacts that could result in more freight going back to the spot market if we see a meaningful change in the overall demand robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks john the next question for bob comes from matt young with morningstar matthew young morningstar analyst could you provide some additional color on nast efforts in terms of running more truckload transactions through a mobile platform along with a rough idea of the magnitude of adoption among c h robinson shippers and carriers robert biesterfeld chief operating officer sure so a core tenet of our go to market strategy has always been to really meet our customers and carriers how and where they want to buy so our focus has been less on moving transactions to mobile as it has been on just really being focused on driving toward those frictionless transactions we based upon the preferences of our customers and our carriers so a couple of examples if a customer wants to integrate their erp into navisphere we just want to make sure that we re the easiest supply chain platform to connect to and extend our platform into their erp if our customer wants to use the navisphere platform to place orders track shipments or get exception notifications we want to ensure that we can provide that information via web or mobile in a means that serves their needs in the fastest most user friendly way another example if a carrier prefers to work in their native tms versus in navisphere again we try to connect to their native tms and ensure that they ve got visibility to our freight and make it easiest for us to connect to them specific to mobile in general we ve seen the carrier community much more active in the mobile space than on the customer side in terms of rough orders of magnitude today we capture about 55 of our truckload events in an automated fashion much of that coming from mobile and we ve got tens of thousands of active users every single day on the navisphere carrier both mobile and web platforms as well as the customer primarily web platform another example our book it now feature on navisphere carrier continues to gain broader acceptance among the carrier community and we see more and more carriers taking advantage of the ability to come online either via the web or app and self select and self book freight on the customer side we see relatively low adoption of mobile as the primary means for communication and edi really continues to be the preferred method of electronic integration with the customers robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob the next question is also for bob from ben hartford of robert w baird todd fowler of keybanc and jason seidl of cowen and company also asked similar questions benjamin hartford robert w baird analyst what are nast and overall headcount growth plans for 2019 robert biesterfeld chief operating officer in the simplest sense over the long term we expect volume to grow at a rate ahead of our headcount growth i made this commitment at our 2017 investor day relative to nast and i believe that that formula still has application across our business in total over the past couple of years the mix of our job families has continued to evolve and as we continue to grow through some of the roles that are more task oriented it allows us to improve productivity there and keep headcount relatively flat in some of those areas and we ll continue to add more specialized skills and more customer facing people to drive growth and innovation in our workforce our headcount growth moderated in the fourth quarter and our focus in 2019 and beyond is to continue to layer in that technology and process automation so that our people can be even more effective which should further moderate headcount growth moving forward robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob ravi shanker of morgan stanley asked about personnel expenses tom wadewitz with ubs also asked a similar question ravi shanker morgan stanley managing director andy what drove personnel expense growth to be below net revenue growth andrew clarke chief executive officer well again we talk about the operating leverage of our model and we ve been pretty clear about how it does work and in fact 2018 is a great example of it not only in the fourth quarter which i ll address shortly but also for the full year if you think about it we added pretty significant net revenue during the entire year but relative to last year headcount was relatively flat and in fact in certain cases with global forwarding and robinson fresh it was down so you think about how they were able to grow their business those two particular divisions with less headcount we re pretty pleased with as bob was talking about just before the leverage that is inherent in our company and in our platform as it relates to the fourth quarter again just think about how much net revenue additionally we drove over the fourth quarter over 84 million the bulk of the increase in the fourth quarter personnel expenses are related to performance based pay both in terms of cash compensation as well as equity so if you think about headcount again relatively flat on a q4 versus q4 basis but because we performed so much more a lot of that variable expense went up which obviously aligns as we talked about the interests of our employees with the interests of our shareholders very well and that s the beauty and that s how our models always were throughout different cycles robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question for john on tariffs came from several analysts have you seen any impact in your forwarding business from the tariffs from both the u s and china or the political economic unrest in europe we have heard other large international logistics and retail companies mention both of these as headwinds in 2019 curious if you are seeing an impact and what your outlook is for forwarding in 2019 given these overhangs john wiehoff chairman chief executive officer we ve been growing our global forwarding business the last five years by taking market share in a number of corridors around the world and we do continue to believe that we re going to be successful doing that in 2019 as well the primary impact to date or in the year 2018 was the processes around implementing and collecting the increased tariffs as well as some modest increase and shipment activities probably near the end of the year to try to accelerate some of the activities to get in before year end or get in before tariffs there s still so much remaining uncertainty around where those trade negotiations in asia and europe will both land so beyond the minor impacts that we had to our business in 2018 all of the discussion around supply chain strategy where will your suppliers be will shippers have to move out of china into other places in asia those communications are going on and the planning is accelerating as we speak so there s high potential for greater changes in routing greater changes in sourcing areas for a lot of our customers but we haven t seen a lot of that activity to date we ve mentioned in the past and continue to invest in expanding and scaling our global forwarding network precisely for reasons like this that if customers do end up making decisions that these tariffs and supply chain changes are going to be permanent and move their sourcing locations we re confident that we ll be able to move with them and that we have capabilities in other parts of the world that we ll be able to continue to go after that market share and grow our business regardless of where the trade negotiations land robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks john the next question is for andy from several analysts why did the annual increase in cash from operations up 409 million significantly exceed growth in annual net income up 160 million what were the drivers andrew clarke chief executive officer 2018 was a fantastic year for us from a cash flow from operations and obviously you got net income up 160 million but bob mentioned earlier the investments we re making on the quote to cash but there s also the order to cash and once it becomes an order across the organization from the business to support from financial operations driving down that order to cash cycle and so if you think about the decrease on a year over year basis and the need for spending that on working capital the largest contributor of that came from the effort there and that s where we re making a lot of investments on digitalization that s where we re making a lot of investments in standardization streamlining that part of the organization so that we would expect to continue to see improvements in that area robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks the next question is also for andy from chris wetherbee of citi ken hoexter of bank of america merrill lynch asked a similar question chris wetherbee citigroup analyst with the truckload spot market rolling over on a year over year basis how would you expect net revenue margins to trend as 2019 progresses andrew clarke chief executive officer that goes back to what we talked about earlier on the net revenue margins dollar percentages it s largely a function of arithmetic and so if you look at one of the slides that we have in the earnings deck and that s a relative change we talk about how those cycles tend to go in three to four to five quarter periods where cost is always the leader when costs rise or fall pricing tends to follow that we saw that through a balance period and we talked about that earlier and when it begins to tip over and costs go down price tends to lag that which does have a positive impact on the margins but on a relative basis you see that the price and cost numbers on a sanitized the numbers that we report are at an elevated level and so there s the balancing impact of fuel the balancing impact of the numerator and denominator simply being higher but overall when costs begin to decrease it does tend to have a positive impact on our truckload margins we ve made a lot of investments as bob mentioned earlier on the ltl side to be smarter on the pricing and the cost side and so we would continue to expect to drive secular margin expansion in other parts of our business as well robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy the next question is for bob from lee klaskow from bloomberg ryan ossenbeck with j p morgan asked a similar question lee klaskow bloomberg analyst did the implementation of precision scheduled railroading in the east drive the 13 decline in intermodal volume if not what was the driver robert biesterfeld chief operating officer so we don t believe that psr has had a broad impact on our intermodal volumes for the quarter nor do we expect it to we have seen examples where lane cancellations have either limited intermodal options altogether or new routings have created drayage inefficiencies which has made the routing more cost effective using truckload which could potentially benefit us in terms of our volume decline for the quarter it was really driven by less spot market opportunity and truckload to intermodal conversion as well as lower than expected west coast volumes when compared to the peak season of last year robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks bob andy todd fowler of keybanc and tom wadewitz of ubs asked about m a please provide an update on potential acquisition opportunities both service line and geographies and if you feel anything imminent in 2019 andrew clarke chief executive officer well i m going to talk about the first one in terms of the potential acquisition opportunities we have and will continue to be an active participant in the m a environment we look at transactions every day that are complementary to both our service line whether that be nast whether that be our global forwarding or robinson fresh but we also look at it in terms of geographical expansion and i ll go back and talk about how we ve made investments over the last several years in global forwarding we continue to make investments in nast as we did with the acquisition of freight quote and those are pretty much part of our standard routine as it relates to assisting and enabling our rather strong organic growth strategy that we have in place and so i wouldn t say that there s anything materially different as to how we re looking about it i would say that it continues to be a robust environment for well run organizations we are very selective in the acquisitions that not only we look at but also execute upon and so they have to meet a rather stringent criteria both in terms of strategy culture and business model and then of course financial returns are very important to how we view and evaluate those opportunities and so i wouldn t say that there s anything materially different in 2019 of our strategy versus what it s been over the last several years robert houghton vice president investor relations thanks andy that

the fed says it will be patient with interest rates and wall street jumps in response 1 the macro matters for markets there are two things important to financial markets currently the outlook for global growth and the state of financial conditions that is what are economic fundamentals showing and how are central bankers responding to those fundamentals at its core the market rout in the last quarter of 2018 was about the interplay of these two concerns global growth was apparently slowing unaided by the trade war and a seemingly cyclical slow down in the chinese economy while monetary policy was tightening sucking liquidity out of financial markets it was believed that a deterioration in the global economy was upon us it may well still be and those responsible for ensuring this does not eventuate were deaf to the cries of market participants 2 the links between the fundamentals and the themes this is the reason why a headline about a weaker europe or an escalation in the trade war or a story about the us fed sticking to rate hikes or its quantitative tightening program hurt the bulls so much the global economy can t prosper without at least signs of solid growth or the necessary support from monetary authorities to at the very least keep the global economy on life support

the new accounting standard asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers on january 1 2018 under asc 606 revenue is recognized when all material conditions for completion have been met and it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in a future period the application of this standard resulted in advisory revenue of 3 4 million being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 representing variable consideration under the standard substantially all of which would have been recognized in the first quarter of 2019 under the legacy accounting standard and advisory revenue of 50 8 million being recognized in the third quarter of 2018 representing variable consideration under the standard substantially all of which would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018

for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 the compensation ratio was 58 0 versus 56 5 for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 the compensation ratio for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 reflects the elevated level of expense associated with the significant investment in advisory talent in 2018 as well as increased expense from compensation associated with recruiting senior talent in 2016 and 2017 the compensation ratio was lower for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 partially due to the expense reversal associated with acquisition related lp interests during the first quarter of 2017 see the business line reporting discussion of u s gaap results below for further information operating income for the three months ended december 31 2018 operating income of 250 2 million increased 36 versus the three months ended december 31 2017 driven by an increase in net revenues partially offset by increased compensation and non compensation costs in the

the twelve months ended december 31 2018 the effective tax rate was 19 7 versus 59 1 for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 the decrease in the tax provision from 2017 primarily reflects the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act as noted below which resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate for 2017 related to the re measurement of net deferred tax assets as well as the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2018 the effective tax rate is also impacted by the non deductible treatment of compensation associated with evercore lp units interests in conjunction with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act on december 22 2017 which reduced income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years our effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 was reduced by 12 percentage points before the impact of the application of the share based compensation accounting standard described below further our tax provision for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2017 includes a charge of 143 3 million primarily resulting from the estimated re measurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act on december 22 2017 these deferred tax assets relate principally to temporary differences from the step up in basis associated with the exchange of partnership units deferred compensation accumulated other comprehensive income and depreciation of fixed assets and leasehold improvements this charge as well as the reduction in the liability for amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement described above resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate of 59 3 and 27 1 percentage points for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2017 respectively the provision for income taxes for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 includes a benefit of 0 5 million and 23 4 million respectively and 0 3 million and 24 0 million for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2017 respectively following the application of a new accounting standard effective january 1 2017 related to share based compensation which requires that the tax deduction or expense associated with the appreciation or depreciation in the firm s share price upon vesting of employee share based awards above or below the original grant price be reflected in income tax expense this benefit resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate of 0 2 and 4 2 percentage points for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 respectively and 0 2 and 5 5 percentage points for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2017 respectively net income loss and earnings loss per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 net income loss attributable to evercore inc and earnings

execution clearing and custody fees to conform to the current presentation a 1 adjusted results throughout the discussion of evercore s business segments and elsewhere in this release information is presented on an adjusted basis formerly called adjusted pro forma which is a non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap measure adjusted results begin with information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america u s gaap adjusted to exclude certain items and reflect the conversion of vested and certain unvested evercore lp units and interests as well as acquisition related share issuances and unvested restricted stock units granted to isi employees into class a shares evercore believes that the disclosed adjusted measures and any adjustments thereto when presented in conjunction with comparable u s gaap measures are useful to investors to compare evercore s results across several periods and facilitate an understanding of evercore s operating results the company uses these measures to evaluate its operating performance as well as the performance of individual employees these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u s gaap these adjusted amounts are allocated to the company s two business segments investment banking and investment management the differences between the adjusted and u s gaap results are as follows 1 assumed vesting of evercore lp units and exchange into class a shares the company incurred expenses in employee compensation and benefits resulting from the vesting of class e lp units issued in conjunction with the acquisition of isi as well as class g and h lp interests and class j lp units the amount of expense or the reversal of expense for the class g and h lp interests was based on the determination if it was probable that evercore isi would achieve certain earnings and margin targets in 2017 and in future periods the adjusted results assume these lp units and certain class g and h lp interests have vested and have been exchanged for class a shares accordingly any expense or reversal of expense associated with these units and interests and related awards is excluded from the adjusted results and the noncontrolling interest related to these units is converted to a controlling interest the company s management believes that it is useful to provide the per share effect associated with the assumed conversion of these previously granted equity interests and thus the adjusted results reflect the exchange of certain vested and unvested evercore lp partnership units and interests and ipo related restricted stock unit awards into class a shares 2 adjustments associated with business combinations and divestitures the following charges resulting from business combinations and divestitures have been excluded from the adjusted results because the company s management believes that operating performance is more comparable across periods excluding the effects of these acquisition related charges a amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related amortization amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related amortization from the acquisition of isi and certain other acquisitions b acquisition and transition costs primarily professional fees incurred and costs related to transitioning acquisitions or divestitures c fair value of contingent consideration the expense or reversal of expense associated with changes in the fair value of contingent consideration issued to the sellers of certain of the company s acquisitions d gain on sale of institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc the gain resulting from the sale of the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc in the fourth quarter of 2017 e foreign exchange gains losses release of cumulative foreign exchange losses resulting from the restructuring of our equity method investment in g5 in the fourth quarter of 2017 3 special charges expenses during 2018 that are excluded from the adjusted presentation relate to separation benefits and costs of terminating certain contracts associated with closing the agency trading platform in the u k and separation benefits and related charges associated with the company s businesses in mexico as well as the acceleration of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements in conjunction with the previously announced expansion of our headquarters in new york expenses during 2017 that are excluded from the adjusted presentation relate to a charge for the impairment of goodwill in the institutional asset management reporting unit and a charge for the impairment of our investment in g5 in the second quarter and the sale of the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc during the fourth quarter of 2017 a 2 4 income taxes evercore is organized as a series of limited liability companies partnerships c corporations and a public corporation and therefore not all of the company s income is subject to corporate level taxes as a result adjustments have been made to the adjusted earnings to assume that the company is subject to the statutory tax rates of a c corporation under a conventional corporate tax structure in the u s at the prevailing corporate rates and that all deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations are fully realizable within the structure on a consolidated basis this assumption is consistent with the assumption that certain evercore lp units and interests are vested and exchanged into class a shares as discussed in item 1 above as the assumed exchange would change the tax structure of the company excluded from the company s adjusted results are adjustments related to the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which resulted in a reduction in income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years the enactment of this tax reform resulted in a charge to the provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 143 3 million primarily resulting from the estimated re measurement of net deferred tax assets which relates primarily to temporary differences from the step up in basis associated with the exchange of partnership units deferred compensation accumulated other comprehensive income and depreciation of fixed assets and leasehold improvements the tax reform also resulted in an estimated adjustment to other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 77 5 million related to the re measurement of amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement which was reduced due to the lower enacted income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years 5 presentation of interest expense the adjusted results present interest expense on short term repurchase agreements within the investment management segment in other revenues net as the company s management believes it is more meaningful to present the spread on net interest resulting from the matched financial assets and liabilities in addition adjusted investment banking and investment management operating income are presented before interest expense on debt which is included in interest expense on a u s gaap basis 6 presentation of income from equity method investments the adjusted results present income from equity method investments within revenue as the company s management believes it is a more meaningful presentation this release also presents changes in adjusted investment management operating income and adjusted investment management operating margin from the prior year periods assuming that the restructuring of certain investment management affiliates occurred on december 31 2016 this includes the sale of the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc that occurred on october 18 2017 evercore believes this is useful additional information for investors because it improves the comparability of period over period results and aligns with management s view of business performance during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company s adjusted presentation for current and prior periods was revised to eliminate the netting of client related expenses expenses associated with revenue sharing engagements with third parties and provisions for uncollected receivables with their related revenue the revised presentation reflects the expense and related revenue gross the company revised

issued to the sellers of certain of the company s acquisitions 8 evercore is organized as a series of limited liability companies partnerships c corporations and a public corporation and therefore not all of the company s income is subject to corporate level taxes as a result adjustments have been made to the adjusted earnings to assume that the company is subject to the statutory tax rates of a c corporation under a conventional corporate tax structure in the u s at the prevailing corporate rates and that all deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations are fully realizable within the structure on a consolidated basis this assumption is consistent with the assumption that certain evercore lp units and interests are vested and exchanged into class a shares as the assumed exchange would change the tax structure of the company excluded from the company s adjusted results are adjustments described below related to the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which resulted in a reduction in income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years the enactment of this tax reform resulted in a charge to the provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 143 3 million primarily resulting from the estimated re measurement of net deferred tax assets which relates principally to temporary differences from the step up in basis associated with the exchange of partnership units deferred compensation accumulated other comprehensive income and depreciation of fixed assets and leasehold improvements the tax reform also resulted in an estimated adjustment to other revenue of 77 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the re measurement of amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement which was reduced due to the lower enacted income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years 9 reflects an adjustment to eliminate noncontrolling interest related to all evercore lp partnership units which are assumed to be converted to class a common stock in the adjusted presentation 10 assumes the vesting and exchange into class a shares of certain evercore lp partnership units and interests and ipo related restricted stock unit awards in the adjusted presentation in the computation of outstanding common stock equivalents for u s gaap net income per share the evercore lp partnership units are anti dilutive further as a result of the company incurring a loss on a u s gaap basis for the three months ended december 31 2017 the additional shares of the company s common stock assumed to be issued per the computation of diluted shares outstanding were antidilutive and consequently the additional shares have been excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding u s gaap these shares have been included in the reconciliation to diluted shares outstanding adjusted 11 assumes the sale of the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc had occurred as of the beginning of the prior period presented and reflects adjustments to eliminate revenue and expenses that were previously consolidated from the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc management believes this adjustment is useful to investors to compare evercore s results across periods a 12 source evercore related links

when today wednesday january 30 2019 where cnbc s closing bell live from the context summits in miami fl the following is the unofficial transcript of a cnbc exclusive interview with former national economic council director and former goldman sachs president and chief operating officer gary cohn and cnbc s leslie picker on cnbc s closing bell m f 3pm 5pm today wednesday january 30th live from the context summits in miami florida the following is a link to video from the interview on cnbc com all references must be sourced to cnbc wilfred frost welcome back fed chair jay powell saying the case for raising interest rates has weakened and stocks are soring off the back of it let s head now to leslie picker who has an exclusive interview with former national economic council director gary cohn at the context summits in miami leslie over to you leslie picker thanks so much so the fomc meeting just concluding the press conference just concluding do you think that jay powell is handling the economy the right way with today s decision gary cohn i actually do look i think jay was put into a very difficult position but he s actually handled it very well i listened to the conference leslie picker difficult how so gary cohn i think jay acknowledged that the united states economy is growing and is growing well but if you look at what s going on in other parts of the world he is having to deal with the slowing economic conditions in other parts of the world so on one hand the united states continues to grow and continues to show good signs of strength but other parts of the world continue to slow and he is trying to balancing the equation between domestic growth and global growth and that is a pretty difficult part of the equation he is also realizing that we do not have a lot of inflation in the united states and in fact the only real inflation we hopefully will have in the united states is wage inflation we ve seen wages in the united states get up to 3 1 so we re starting to see some real wage growth in the united states but outside of that we really don t have inflation in the united states and i know as chairman of the fed you are always worried about being behind the curve on inflation so i think that jay and the rest of the committee is doing a pretty good job here leslie picker are you personally concerned about a slowdown given some of the risks that are out there a lot of the people who come on cnbc ray dalio to name one scott minerd has recently said that they re concerned that a recession is in the near future gary cohn well i have been teasing you and a lot of your colleagues recently that cnbc seems to be obsessed with the recession i am not obsessed with the recession i actually think the united states is in pretty good shape we continue to see the very positive effects of the stimulus from tax cuts to the united states we haven t even seen a tax filing season yet no one has really filed their taxes yet to see what the effect it i think that the effect is going to be quite positive not only on the business side but equally as important on the personal side we continue to see the consumer in the united states spend money yes we saw a funny consumer confidence number yesterday but remember that data was taken during the middle of a government shutdown it is hard to have real consumer confidence during the middle of a government shutdown so i believe that the consumer will continue to spend in the united states we have a five year investment cycle for companies to invest in the united states we d like to see more capital investment in the united states but look at what s going in with these external factors the rest of the world is slowing down a little bit we ve got a lot of discussion about trade and the price of underlying commodities steel and aluminum that you need to build factories so companies have yet to invest and when we start seeing that investment cycle i think the u s economy will continue to grow leslie picker now you have been outspoken about the tariffs you ve been outspoken about the shutdown saying that neither are really what the country needs at this time have you lost confidence in this administration from an economic standpoint since you ve left the white house gary cohn i ve made my point on tariffs and on trade very clear u s consumers are paying the tariffs no foreign entity has paid a dollar of tariff to the u s government so when we make goods more expensive for the u s consumer it means that they can buy less other goods or less other services or even worse of all save less money that s not what we need to be doing to our consumers so i feel very strongly that it is our job to make goods as cheap as possible in the united states so our consumers can consume as much as they want and hopefully save at the end of the day leslie picker now in terms of that tax stimulus that you talked about a few questions ago there was recently a nabe survey that came out a few days ago which said that about 84 of the people surveyed believed that they hadn t really felt much of an impact from the tax bill that they haven t increased their hiring they haven t increased their capex spending as a result what s going on there are you disappointed with the results or gary cohn well look i think there s a couple different things going on we came out with a great tax plan we came out with a great deregulation plan both meant to stimulate growth on the flip side we ve come out with things that are anti stimulus at the same time and you and i both know that corporations a take a long time do their capex plan you know companies can t decide today that they are going to go buy a 100 acre piece of land and go build a factory they need to buy the land design the factory get the permits that itself will take a year or two and that is why we made the investment window a five year investment window but then if you see the price of steel of goes up you see the price of machinery goes up it makes it less and less compelling to build those factories so we need to make it compelling for people to build those factories and we need to keep people investing in the businesses so look my view is that investment will come when there is more and more clarity in what our trade relationships are with countries around the world leslie picker is there a risk that it is too late though that the benefit of that stimulus will come to pass by the time the government figures out its way on trade and figures its way out with regard to the shutdown gary cohn look there is risk to everything when you are dealing with corporate decision making when you are dealing with economic growth when you are you dealing with jobs there is always risks you know things happen that you can never foresee or foreshadow things good and bad so there is risk to all of these scenarios we are hoping that we stay more or less on the path that we hoped we would be on we continue to have companies be more competitive in the world environment because our tax rate makes them more competitive we continue to hire more people in fact you see that we ve got an unemployment rate below 4 we ll continue to have qualified skilled labor in the united states to hire from and we re continuing to grow our economy but these things take time as i said we haven t even gone through a full tax cycle yet in fact many of the tax rules were just released by the irs within the last 6 to 8 weeks not that i m complaining about that they had so much rule and regulation to write the opportunities on regulation was just written at the end of last year leslie picker and yet we re starting to see this sentiment really build in this country whether it is with regard to representative alexandria ocasio cortez elizabeth warren even howard schultz is talking about fiscal responsibility but the first two aoc and warren have both proposed plans that would incorporate raising taxes on the wealthy what do you make of those proposals do you think that is what the economy needs at this time gary cohn look first of all the u s tax code is very very complicated i spent you know over a year of almost every waking hour in the u s tax code it is very very complicated so the one thing that i would tell people before they start talking about the u s tax code they need to understand it the u s tax code is really three different tax codes we have a corporate tax code which i think people understand we have an individual tax code which i m not sure people understand but most importantly we have this tax code in the middle which is the pass through tax code which is the vast majority of businesses in america the vast majority of people work for pass through entities which is really part of the personal income tax cut it s really this hybrid and the relationship between the corporate tax code and the pass through tax code is very very important because people or businesses can always turn themselves into a corporation or a corporation can always turn themselves into a pass through leslie picker so you re saying if there was some sort of wealth redistribution policy put in place that people would just find ways to skirt it or gary cohn i m saying we have to make a level playing field for everyone in the system so look if you and i were in the exact same business and you were a corporation and i m a pass through and you were paying 20 income tax on your income and i m a pass through and i m today i m paying 37 less maybe 20 but then my incremental rate goes up dramatically i wouldn t be competitive in the world you would be competitive in the world i wouldn t even be competitive with you i wouldn t even be competitive domestically leslie picker but they are talking about individuals they re talking about they re talking about billionaires gary cohn by the way i m talking about some of the biggest pass throughs in the united states are bigger than some of the corporation in the united states leslie picker but do you think if this plan passes and i don t even know if you think it has a chance at passing that it would be harmful to the economy or helpful to the economy gary cohn it would be harmful to the economy and i m not saying that collecting more tax revenue is harmful to the economy i m saying that we have to compete in a global theater and when we look at cutting the business tax and also cutting the pass through tax down the main driver for that was to allow u s companies to compete in a globalized world so we were trying to tell u s companies to compete against companies in other parts of the world they were paying substantially less tax than their u s competitor and now we ve got it more or less on a level playing field leslie picker now gary i have to ask you because you are here at a hedge fund conference there are headlines about you joining the board of a block chain startup there are headlines about you joining a harvard fellowship what are you doing these days what is your act three what are your plans for the future gary cohn wellall of those are true so you happen to be three for three there so i am involved in a block chain business and i believe very much block chain as a business process makes an enormous amount of sense going forward i am continuing in the process i started in the u s government former senator heidi heitkamp and myself are going to be teaching a class at harvard starting next week on what we call the real estate of the union it s going to a policy class of the kennedy school where we ll go through all of the big policy issues in the u s government which i m very excited to do to just to continue to talk about many of these policy issues that have gotten very important to me and i m continually investing in new companies i think are really important for the united states look one of the biggest competitive advantages we have as a country is we have an entrepreneurial spirit and we tend to invent some of the best companies in the world and i m having a great time working with some of those young inventors in the world leslie picker so we may see you show up in silicon valley one of these days gary cohn you may i m out there a lot leslie picker alright gary cohn thank you so much gary cohn great seeing you thanks for more information contact

sterling sparkles at start of week eurozone gloom continues usa china tensions take their toll down in the dumps down under it s been another hectic and cold week for the currency markets and many of the world s economies brexit has been at the forefront of uk news and the latest votes in parliament have set the scene for uk prime minister theresa may to return to brussels and attempt to renegotiate an exit deal the eurozone also in a gloomy mood has been keeping a close eye on developments too but they have also had a slew of data to contend with including consumer and business confidence indices sterling sparkles at start of week sterling started the week in sparkling form outperforming most key currencies and standing strong in the run up to the uk parliamentary votes this was mostly on the relative strength of the uk economy despite the endless speculation and uncertainty surrounding brexit a bit of a break in uk data releases helped the pound push upwards but the uk currency corrected as brexit uncertainty reared its head once more for the uk mp votes on proposed amendments to the exit deal eurozone gloom continues europe continues to watch what s going on in the uk warily but they have a number of other plates to spin european central bank ecb president mario draghi and his colleagues at the ecb were equally cautious in their tone as they announced their latest meeting minutes draghi s press conference that followed even spelled out concerns about the risks posed by brexit uncertainty and alluded to the potential for a recession across the eu bringing the struggles that the eurozone faces now and in the future sharply into focus add to that the disappointing data from top eu economic contributors france and germany and you can see why the eurozone doesn t have much to be cheerful about right now needless to say the ecb did not raise interest rates at the latest monetary policy committee meeting usa china tensions take their toll us china trade worries are taking their toll on the us dollar and shaking up the commodity currencies the us dollar has picked up from the effects of trade tensions and the government shutdown by positive economic data in the form of the latest housing and employment statistics a fascinating discussion was held at davos on the quality of these jobs in such a wealthy country citing some quite frankly horrific sounding forms of employment that make up these positive numbers it certainly provides food for thought for the average american citizen and for all those watching what s happening in the united states both politically and economically how heathy is the us economy really from a currency perspective the us dollar always seems to pull through its troubles thanks in part to its traditional safe haven status and also often down to last minute data shocks to the positive the word continues to watch and wait to see what will happen next with the government and the relationship with china down in the dumps down under while our aussie friends celebrated australia day worldwide the australian economy did not paint such a rosy picture and the australian dollar fell to levels not seen since last autumn against the pound with the new zealand dollar falling in a similar pattern the australian central bank the reserve bank of australia rba even spoke about lowering interest rates after such a prolonged period of an already very low base rate it s definitely an opportunity for those buying australian dollars benefit from a better exchange rate with the pound make the most of it market jitters what do they mean markets are clearly nervous as you can tell from the flight to the classic safe haven gold even the yen and dollar are seeing volatility off the back of economic and political activity so it really is an important time to keep an eye on the currency markets and assess how all this affects you and your money transfers get in touch with the team today and see how we can help in these unprecedented times of uncertainty cold shoulder the snow and ice has gathered in a number of areas across the uk and europe once again do stay safe in the snow and cold conditions and spare a thought for our friends in chicago who are potentially facing overnight temperatures of minus 35 degrees tonight ouch wednesdaywisdom i met a delightful woman at a meeting of the women in business network yesterday who runs her own travel business her strapline is a little sand between the toes is sure to take away our woes wise words indeed conjuring up thoughts of warm sandy beaches is just what we need in this weather feeling toastier already now time to book that holiday
the fed says it will be patient with interest rates and wall street jumps in response 1 the macro matters for markets there are two things important to financial markets currently the outlook for global growth and the state of financial conditions that is what are economic fundamentals showing and how are central bankers responding to those fundamentals at its core the market rout in the last quarter of 2018 was about the interplay of these two concerns global growth was apparently slowing unaided by the trade war and a seemingly cyclical slow down in the chinese economy while monetary policy was tightening sucking liquidity out of financial markets it was believed that a deterioration in the global economy was upon us it may well still be and those responsible for ensuring this does not eventuate were deaf to the cries of market participants 2 the links between the fundamentals and the themes this is the reason why a headline about a weaker europe or an escalation in the trade war or a story about the us fed sticking to rate hikes or its quantitative tightening program hurt the bulls so much the global economy can t prosper without at least signs of solid growth or the necessary support from monetary authorities to at the very least keep the global economy on life support

effective component of our capital management strategy over the past year we increased our quarterly dividend by 14 and paid special dividends of 3 00 per share we expect afg s core net operating earnings in 2019 to be between 8 35 and 8 85 per share our core earnings per share guidance excludes non core items such as realized gains and losses as well as other significant items that are not able to be estimated with reasonable precision or that may not be indicative of ongoing operations specialty property and casualty insurance operations core operating earnings in afg s p c insurance operations were 214 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 233 million in the prior year period a decrease of 19 million or 8 lower underwriting profits were partially offset by higher year over year p c net investment income primarily the result of higher earnings on limited partnerships and similar investments and lower other expenses the strong investment performance should not be expected to repeat in future periods the specialty p c insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of 102 million for the 2018 fourth quarter compared to 156 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 lower underwriting profitability in our specialty casualty group primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and the lower year over year favorable reserve development within neon and lower underwriting profit in our property and transportation group primarily the result of lower crop earnings following the exceptionally strong results reported in the 2017 fourth quarter contributed to these results the fourth quarter 2018 combined ratio of 92 0 includes 4 7 points of favorable prior year reserve development compared to 4 1 points of favorable prior year reserve development in the comparable 2017 period catastrophe losses added 3 0 points to the combined ratio in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to 0 6 points in the comparable prior year period pretax catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and inclusive of reinstatement premiums were 38 million during the fourth quarter and were primarily the result of hurricane michael and the camp and woolsey wildfires in california catastrophe losses in the 2017 fourth quarter were 12 million gross and net written premiums were up 3 and 4 respectively in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2017 growth in our property and transportation and specialty casualty groups was partially offset by lower premiums in our specialty financial group excluding the impact of the timing of renewal of two large accounts in our property and transportation group gross and net written premiums increased approximately 1 and 2 respectively in the fourth quarter average renewal pricing across our entire p c group was up 2 for the quarter excluding our workers compensation business renewal pricing was up approximately 4 further details of afg s specialty p c operations may be found in the accompanying schedules the property and transportation group reported an underwriting profit of 64 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 84 million in the comparable prior year period higher underwriting profits in our transportation property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses were more than offset by lower underwriting profits in our agricultural businesses and our singapore branch our crop insurance operations reported strong profitability during the 2018 fourth quarter albeit at lower levels than in the prior year fourth quarter catastrophe losses for this group had a favorable impact of 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a favorable impact of 3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter with catastrophe losses reported from the previous quarter developing favorably in the fourth quarters of both years fourth quarter 2018 gross and net written premiums in this group were 4 and 6 higher respectively than the comparable prior year period the increase was largely the result of a change in the timing of renewal of two large accounts in one of our transportation businesses from the third to fourth quarter excluding the impact of the timing of these policy renewals both gross and net written premiums in this group were up approximately 1 year over year lower year over year premiums in our crop insurance business and underwriting actions on under performing accounts in our singapore branch both tempered fourth quarter premiums overall renewal rates in this group increased 3 on average in both the 2018 fourth quarter and full year the specialty casualty group reported an underwriting profit of 22 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to 58 million in the comparable 2017 period lower underwriting profit within neon primarily the result of higher 2018 catastrophe losses and lower year over year favorable reserve development due to the fourth quarter 2017 neon reinsurance to close transaction were the primary drivers of these results lower profitability in our workers compensation business contributed to a lesser extent higher underwriting profit in our excess and surplus lines and targeted markets partially offset these results despite lower year over year profits in our workers compensation operations these businesses achieved excellent underwriting margins catastrophe losses for this group were 28 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 18 million in the comparable 2017 period gross and net written premiums increased 6 and 5 respectively for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the same prior year period higher year over year premiums within neon resulting from the growth of its portfolio in targeted classes of business along with growth in several other businesses and the addition of aba insurance services were partially offset by lower premiums in our workers compensation businesses renewal pricing for this group was flat in the fourth quarter and was down approximately 1 overall for the year excluding our workers compensation businesses renewal rates in this group were up approximately 4 in the fourth quarter and 3 for the year the specialty financial group reported an underwriting profit of 20 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 with all businesses in this group achieving excellent underwriting margins catastrophe losses for this group were 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a favorable impact of 5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter gross and net written premiums declined by 12 and 9 respectively in the 2018 fourth quarter when compared to the same 2017 period primarily due to the timing of several new accounts in our lending and leasing businesses in the prior year renewal pricing in this group was up 5 during the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2018 carl lindner iii stated i m very pleased with the strong underwriting margins and superior investment performance reported by our specialty p c group in the fourth quarter i m particularly pleased with the excellent underwriting margins in our workers compensation crop and excess surplus lines businesses average renewal pricing across our entire p c group was up 1 5 for the year and up 3 excluding our workers compensation business these results were in line with our objectives for the year mr lindner continued looking forward to 2019 we are forecasting an overall calendar year combined ratio in the range of 92 to 94 and we expect net written premiums to be flat to up 3 when compared to the 5 billion reported in 2018 further details about

embedded derivative and interest rates to rise resulting in continued increases in interest on the embedded derivative liability in the fourth quarter of 2018 the 14 decline in the s p 500 index contributed to a significant unfavorable fair value accounting impact of 27 million 0 24 per share for the quarter as shown in the table above the majority of this impact is non economic and is expected to reverse over time even in the absence of a stock market recovery by comparison in the fourth quarter of 2017 the benefit of a higher stock market resulted in a 9 million favorable impact

assumptions in an interim quarter as it did in the second quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 afg s review resulted in unlocking charges of 4 million and 3 million respectively annuity premiums afg s annuity segment reported record statutory premiums of 1 48 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 909 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 63 significant growth in sales of fias in the broker dealer and retail markets as well as higher year over year sales in our financial institutions channel contributed to these record results craig lindner stated afg s annuity segment achieved record sales in 2018 while maintaining pricing discipline throughout the year production in our retail and broker dealer markets was particularly strong due to the launch of several new products and our efforts to expand our distribution within each of these channels in addition the annuity segment earned an after tax operating return on equity in excess of 12 for the full year despite the impact of the poor stock market performance in the fourth quarter more information about premiums and the results of operations for our annuity segment may be found in afg s quarterly investor supplement 2019 annuity outlook for 2019 afg expects annuity sales will be down slightly from its record 5 4 billion of premiums in 2018 as afg continues to maintain its pricing discipline year over year average annuity asset and reserve growth of 8 to 10 and pretax annuity earnings of 365 million to 425 million compared to 361 million in 2018 the midpoint of the 2019 annuity earnings guidance assumes i interest rates and the stock market rise moderately ii more normalized income from certain investments required to be marked to market through earnings and iii lower impact in 2019 from unusual investment income items such as prepayment of fixed income securities fluctuations in these items could lead to significant positive or negative impacts on the annuity segment s results investments effective january 1 2018 afg adopted asu 2016 01 which requires that all equity securities previously classified as available for sale be reported at fair value with holding gains and losses recognized in net earnings instead of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the impact to our income statement will vary depending upon the level of

washington afp advertising read more the federal reserve left the key us lending rate unchanged on wednesday and said it would be patient about making any further changes in the clearest signal yet the central bank has heeded concerns about the economy although the fed continues to expect continued expansion of the economy and strong jobs growth are the most likely outcomes the statement signaled the growing uncertainty about the outlook in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines the timing and need for any further increases the policy setting federal open market committee said in an unusual separate statement the fed also said it was prepared to change the pace of reduction of its massive securities holdings after markets became concerned that the current process was too rigid the language used in the fomc statement keeping the benchmark interest rate in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent reflected the increasing sense that the us economy may have peaked it cited solid economic growth rather than a strong rate of growth highlighted in prior statements the decision at the fed s first policy meeting of the year was expected after central bankers signaled strongly in recent weeks that they intended to tread cautiously about any further moves but the unusually dovish language likely will come as a surprise federal reserve chairman jerome powell will have an opportunity to explain the central bank s thinking in a news conference due to begin at 1930 gmt us stocks added to gains following the fed statement with the dow climbing 1 6 percent to 24 964 94 near 1910 gmt the dollar also fell sharply after the release with the euro at 1 1471 compared with 1 1421 just before the statement the fomc increased the benchmark rate four times last year but rising concerns about a slowing us economy amid a trade war with china prompted officials to signal they will take time to gauge the economy s performance and the five week government shutdown also dented economic performance in the first quarter of the year although most of that is expected to be recovered powell late last year repeatedly shook up markets with comments considered to be overly optimistic and hinting at more rate hikes to come balance sheet change possible facing blowback from his efforts to speak plainly powell retreated from his stance and made an effort to stress the uncertainty about the economic outlook he likened the situation to being in a dark room and needing to take time to find the right path one of the concerns was the effect of the fed s decision to reduce its securities holdings which built up to 4 5 trillion in the aftermath of the global financial crisis it has been reducing those investments by about 50 billion a month but investors worry that in a slowing economy that process will tend to raise the cost of borrowing the statement on the balance sheet normalization process said the fed would be prepared to use its full range of tools including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy while some economists say jittery markets overreacted the fed acknowledged signs of slowing as reason enough to pause the monetary policy tightening and to acknowledge the concerns of investors about the securities sell off 2019 afp

in miami and the perfect day development full year 2018 us gaap net income for the year was 1 8 billion or 8 56 per share and adjusted net income was 1 9 billion or 8 86 per share this result beat the january 2018 mid point guidance by 0 21 per share and equates to a 17 5 year over year growth in adjusted earnings per share this result was achieved despite the unfavorable impact from currency and fuel which negatively affected earnings by approximately 123 million or 0 58 per share versus the january 2018 guidance this year our teams achieved record financial results while introducing four new vessels acquiring silversea cruises inaugurating two stunning cruise terminals and implementing excalibur on about half of our fleet said richard d fain chairman and ceo by any measure 2018 was a particularly stellar year and the strong wave makes us optimistic about 2019 as well net yields were up 4 4 in constant currency strong demand for our core products better onboard revenues and the consolidation from silversea s operations drove the year over year increase ncc excluding fuel per apcd were up 4 1 in constant currency the main drivers behind the year over year increase were more drydock days the lapping of hardware changes investments in technology and the consolidation of silversea s operations fourth quarter results us gaap net income for the fourth quarter was 315 7 million or 1 50 per share and adjusted net income was 322 1 million or 1 53 per share last year us gaap and adjusted net income were 288 0 million or 1 34 per share gross yields were up 7 3 in constant currency net yields were up 6 8 in constant currency slightly better than the midpoint of guidance gross cruise costs per apcd increased 6 1 in constant currency ncc excluding fuel per apcd were up 5 1 in constant currency lower than guidance driven by timing favorability from depreciation and our joint ventures also contributed to the quarter s positive performance lastly a combination of a stronger dollar and fuel rates negatively impacted the quarter by 0 04 bunker pricing net of hedging for the fourth quarter was 546 70 per metric ton and consumption was 357 700 metric tons full year 2019 the company expects full year adjusted eps guidance to be in the range of 9 75 to 10 00 per share wave season has started on a strong note and the company s overall booked position for 2019

currency and 6 0 to 8 0 as reported for the full year these metrics include approximately 350 basis points from the operation of silversea the cruise terminal in miami and the perfect day water park and resort on the island of cococay in the bahamas which will launch in may of 2019 as an ultra luxury brand silversea s revenues and expenses on a per apcd basis are both higher than the company s average moreover our new miami based terminal and perfect day will also increase both our revenue and cost metrics since their additions do not include apcds as such we have provided the impact of these items on our yield and cost metrics forward guidance our yield outlook for 2019 is very encouraging said jason t liberty executive vice president and cfo demand for our brands continues to accelerate and we are well positioned for another year of double digit growth in our earnings per share we are also very excited about the introduction of celebrity flora in may 2019 the first ship designed for the galapagos and the introduction of spectrum of the seas in the china market in june 2019 these new ships will also be contributors to 2019 yield growth ncc excluding fuel are expected

on the company s investor relations website at www rclinvestor com selected operational and financial metrics adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps represents adjusted net income divided by the weighted average or by the diluted weighted average of shares outstanding as applicable at the end of the reporting period we believe this measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis adjusted net income adjusted net income represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items include the impairment loss related to skysea holding the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the acquisition the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements and the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards available passenger cruise days apcd apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary constant currency we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant non gaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because our reporting currency is the us dollar the value of these revenues and expenses in us dollars will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel in constant currency i e as if the current period s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period s rates we calculate constant currency by applying the average prior year period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and or forecasted period so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods we do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods it should be emphasized that the use of constant currency is primarily used by us for comparing short term changes and or projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency based fluctuations gross cruise costs gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses for the periods presented gross cruise costs exclude the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition and the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards which were included within marketing selling and administrative expenses gross yields gross yields represent total revenues per apcd net cruise costs ncc and ncc excluding fuel represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance net revenues net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses net yields net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a day to day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses occupancy occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins passenger cruise days passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period

on the company s investor relations website at www rclinvestor com selected operational and financial metrics adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps represents adjusted net income divided by the weighted average or by the diluted weighted average of shares outstanding as applicable at the end of the reporting period we believe this measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis adjusted net income adjusted net income represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items include the impairment loss related to skysea holding the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the acquisition the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements and the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards available passenger cruise days apcd apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary constant currency we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant non gaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because our reporting currency is the us dollar the value of these revenues and expenses in us dollars will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel in constant currency i e as if the current period s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period s rates we calculate constant currency by applying the average prior year period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and or forecasted period so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods we do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods it should be emphasized that the use of constant currency is primarily used by us for comparing short term changes and or projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency based fluctuations gross cruise costs gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses for the periods presented gross cruise costs exclude the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition and the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards which were included within marketing selling and administrative expenses gross yields gross yields represent total revenues per apcd net cruise costs ncc and ncc excluding fuel represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance net revenues net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses net yields net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a day to day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses occupancy occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins passenger cruise days passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period

lee devito uaw workers hold a candlelight vigil after general motors announces it will close five north american plants including detroit hamtramck assembly for thousands of general motors autoworkers there was little cheer to be felt this holiday season which is why on a friday evening in early december a small group of them braved the bitter cold to air their grievances in front of detroit s united auto workers solidarity house not far from gm s detroit headquarters two days before thanksgiving the board of directors of the biggest u s automaker approved a massive plan to cut 6 billion in costs that meant five plants would be closed or unallocated to use the company s antiseptic parlance by the end of 2019 those included detroit hamtramck assembly lordstown assembly in ohio and oshawa assembly near toronto as well as transmission plants in warren and outside of baltimore combined with 8 000 white collar cuts the plan called for a 15 percent reduction of the company s salaried workforce or more than 14 000 workers the news especially hurt because it came less than a decade after the federal government spent 51 billion to keep the company afloat during its 2009 chapter 11 bankruptcy and that wasn t the first time the company convinced the government to lend a helping hand in 1981 gm persuaded the city of detroit to use eminent domain to seize and raze more than 1 000 houses several catholic churches and more than 100 businesses in detroit s largely polish poletown community on the border of hamtramck to build detroit hamtramck assembly displacing 4 000 people at the time an opposition case made it all the way to the michigan supreme court which ruled in favor of general motors finding economic development to be a legitimate use of eminent domain but now less than 40 years after gm destroyed the community in the name of economic development the plant was closing for some gm s announcement wasn t a big surprise after a decade of growth the auto industry was expected to cool off last year but then president donald trump who has long criticized the big three for building cars in mexico and china to export back to the u s issued tariffs on steel and aluminum in october ford motor co ceo jim hackett forecasted that the tariffs would cost the company 1 billion in profits honda north america vice president rick schostek echoed the sentiment saying the tariffs were causing the prices of u s steel to go higher resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional annual costs gm ceo mary barra did not blame trump s tariffs for the drastic cost cutting measure though she had long tried to stay on the president s good side serving as a member on the president s strategic and policy forum and a manufacturing advisory council the relationship was certainly strained when gm publicly disagreed with the president s decision to leave the paris climate treaty in 2017 an agreement among united nations members to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions both councils were dissolved after a critical mass of ceos resigned following trump s defense of a deadly white supremacist protest in charlottesville va which resulted in the murder of a peaceful counterprotester instead the company quietly filed complaints with the commerce department saying the new tariffs undermining gm s competitiveness against foreign auto producers by erecting broad brush trade barriers that increase our global costs in a statement gm chief financial officer chuck stevens avoided naming trump saying instead the company s operating performance was impacted by significant headwinds from commodity costs and also cited forecasted profit losses of 1 billion trump who won the 2016 election thanks in part to his promising to bring back manufacturing jobs to states like michigan and ohio was pissed in 2017 he held a rally at lordstown and promised that factory jobs would return very disappointed with general motors and their ceo mary barra for closing plants in ohio michigan and maryland he wrote on twitter nothing being closed in mexico china the u s saved general motors and this is the thanks we get we are now looking at cutting all gm subsidies including for electric cars the small group that braved the freezing temperatures to gather on friday dec 7 shared trump s anger at gm and barra but they also blamed union leadership i mean it s a slap in the face says brian keller of uaw local 1248 despite the fact that he works for fiat chrysler he says he was so disgusted with the uaw leadership that he led the demonstration outside of the solidarity house that included members from all of detroit s big three automakers the group says they have stood out here every day since monday one woman says she had been here since 2 p m on friday it s been years of corruption collusion and nepotism keller says referring to a federal criminal probe into the union s dealings these companies have been making record profits on top of the corporate tax breaks last year keller and two other fiat chrysler employees filed a lawsuit against the uaw alleging that union leaders colluded with company officials to influence collective bargaining agreements a car drives by exiting the solidarity house parking lot as the driver waits for the gate to open he stoically looks ahead doing his best to ignore the protesters take care of your membership the woman who has been standing out here for hours yells they take care of you the car drives off without even a solidarity honk this union was founded by blue collar workers with blue collar values but they ve lost their way keller says you know we even had a guy that was here protesting earlier with us an older gentleman he s retired and he asked to use the restroom and they wouldn t even let him use it and this union solidarity house belongs to the membership they won t even let us pass the gate that just shows you that they re a separate entity to the membership they don t stand with the membership they re not unified with the membership gm s layoffs were the latest headline in a string of bad news for the uaw which is under investigation as part of an expanding federal corruption probe initially the investigation focused on auto executives including the late fiat chrysler ceo sergio marchionne for funneling money gifts and illegal benefits to uaw officials to keep them fat dumb and happy according to prosecutors as the uaw upped its membership dues in recent years leadership was using funds to pay for extravagant trips and meals according to court documents the feds are looking into whether former uaw president dennis williams directed subordinates to funnel the funds from training centers for the big three prosecutors are also investigating nearly 1 million of membership dues spent on condos liquor food and golf in palm springs calif between 2014 and 2016 where gary jones held annual conferences before becoming president in the desert oasis uaw leaders used either membership dues contributed by blue collar workers or money from fiat chrysler its adversary across the bargaining table to pay for dinners condominiums golf fees and 1 217 at a salon run by the hollywood stylist from mad max fury road according to the detroit news in a statement to the news uaw spokesman brian rothenberg defended the expenses as entirely reasonable over three years more than 650 union attendees from all over the western half of the country attended all day meetings during week long conferences he said those are the facts which stand in contrast to unattributed allegations still the probe has ensnared some uaw officials in july nancy adams johnson the union s no 2 official at fiat chrysler pleaded guilty to illegally receiving cash and valuable items from the company in all the court alleges she spent more than 33 000 on flights and shopping sprees and she faces up to 18 months in federal prison a vice president of fiat chrysler automobiles nv and the wife of a deceased uaw vice president have also pleaded guilty to charges in the alleged scheme after getting linked to the federal investigation in late 2017 former uaw vp joe ashton suddenly resigned from gm s board with no explanation gm has said it has launched its own internal investigation and that it is cooperating with federal investigators to make matters worse it was revealed in november that the uaw drew from the union s member funded 721 million strike fund to use nonunion labor to build a lakeside retreat for williams the union defended the project stating that it tries to use union labor whenever possible and that it was hard to find union contractors near cheboygan it also noted that the house belongs to the union not williams but for the uaw s critics there is perhaps no clearer evidence of how far the union has strayed from its values in 2014 union delegates voted to raise membership dues the first time it had done so in 47 years the union had 430 871 members as of 2017 and members pay 670 to 1 600 in dues annually depending on their hourly wage then last year union delegates voted to increase uaw leadership salaries by 31 percent for keller the taxpayer subsidies and the ruthless workforce slashing don t add up last year the company reported north american pre tax profits of 12 8 billion meanwhile the aftermath of the bankruptcy forced concessions on lower level workers including the creation of a different tier of wages for newer workers which have yet to be restored keller says he and other workers are sick of feeling the squeeze we re told that we got to be viable and competitive with foreign labor markets like mexico and china and indonesia he says but none of our ceos are living up to that standard they skim from the workers not from themselves and they re the ones that have failed the company in 2017 barra made 21 96 million or about 295 times gm s median employee salary keller believes the union s leadership has become too entwined with the company executives as part of the 2010 bailout the uaw agreed to exchange its retirees health funds for stock in the big three with 55 percent ownership in chrysler 18 percent stake in gm and 11 percent in ford but keller sees that as a huge conflict of interest what s good for shareholders isn t necessarily good for workers you can t negotiate wage increases if you re holding gm stock because you re afraid the stock is going to go down keller says indeed the day gm announced the plant closures its stock went up 4 8 percent steve fecht for general motors gm ceo mary barra at a shareholders meeting in 2017 as long as they re sitting on gm stock they re not going to authorize a strike which is our only tool to fight back he says you can t ride the fence and be on management s side and then think you re going to represent us at the same time now it feels like they re colleagues with management and not representatives of labor keller says he supports trump s tariffs which also include a proposed 30 percent tariff on vehicles built outside of the u s he concedes however that the tariffs have so far not stopped the big three from shipping jobs overseas me personally i don t believe in the democratic or republican parties he says i think they both let down the middle class and there s no lesser than two evils they both get their campaign dollars from the same lobbyists and special interest groups they protect wall street and at the end of the day it s always labor that ends up suffering they were elected to do a job and i feel neither party is doing what they should be doing still keller thinks the tariffs are a start that s the only way anything s going to happen he says because these companies are playing these countries labor at markets against each other for the lowest bidder to keller s point backlash against gm has gone international in recent years in 2011 12 former gm employees set up camp outside the u s embassy in bogota colombia in protest of what they allege were unsafe working conditions and unfair practices at the company s colmotores plant the men allege that gm illegally fired them after sustaining injuries on the job the company denied they were fired because of the injuries and successfully litigated most of the claims through the colombian courts but the workers allege the company tampered with their medical records rendering them ineligible for compensation the case first caught metro times attention in 2013 when some of the protesters after having camped outside the embassy for more than 670 days dramatically sewed their lips shut as part of a hunger strike frank hammer a metro detroit based retired uaw international representative former local president and longtime progressive activist took an interest in the case and traveled to bogota to meet with the protesters one of the injured workers jorge parra traveled to detroit to share his plight with the solidarity house the uaw then sent representatives to inspect the bogota plant gm also sent representatives on the condition the hunger strike end gm set something up that they called the mediation which for all intents and purposes wasn t hammer argues and gm and uaw came back home and pretty much wish they d go away and they haven t been there ever since but now more than seven years later hammer says the former employees are still camped outside the embassy demanding compensation including medical costs pensions disability and lost wages it hasn t been a total loss for the colombian workers hammer says since the protests workers successfully organized and formed an injured workers union and that the company has fired fewer injured workers and improved conditions in the colmotores factory in 2016 a judge ordered gm to reinstate 24 injured workers who were fired that year though it later fired 12 of them the workers attorney liliana quemba attributed the victory in part to the tent encampment additionally the judge fined the company 200 000 and ordered the gm colmotores president and general manager to spend three days in jail though gm attorneys successfully rescinded both orders still it s a precarious time for labor in colombia a report from the british trade union confederation s justice for colombia found that violence against trade unionists has increased in 2018 with at least 161 so called violations of life liberty and physical integrity against trade unionists between the start of the year and 27 august including 14 murders six attempted murders and 134 threats conditions have worsened under the recent election of right wing anti labor president ivan duque hammer fears the tent encampment could be in danger the implications for the encampment are unpredictable but they certainly aren t favorable he says he notes the uaw has been supportive sending funds down to the encampment however in recent years he says he has found that most uaw membership does not seem to be aware of the case he has called on the union to publicize it and has also called for uaw leadership to make another trip to bogota to visit the tent encampment and to invite parra back to detroit s solidarity house another activist even purchased gm stock so hammer could attend the company s annual shareholders meetings in june 2017 and 2018 to bring the issue to barra he says they were quickly escorted out by security after bringing up the issue and the meeting was abruptly adjourned it s not the only organized opposition mounting against gm s business practices outside of the u s following the announcement of the oshawa plant closure which will eliminate some 3 000 jobs canadian auto worker union unifor called for the boycott of gm s mexican built vehicles in a tv ad in late december the union also ran four full page ads critical of gm in the free press and detroit news if it starts with 3 it s not for me unifor president jerry dias said at a news conference referring to the mexican built cars vehicle identification number according to the detroit free press they are naive to believe that canadians won t betray them for their blatant disloyalty said dias when they needed us we were there mexico never gave them a dime in a statement gm argued that unifor s boycott would create collateral damage across the wider ontario economy which has more than 60 ontario based auto parts companies supporting mexico production nevertheless the pressure appears to be gaining traction workers at canadian auto supplier inteva products which supplies both ishawa and detroit hamtramck walked off the job in solidarity with the laid off workers dias is set to meet with uaw leadership in february to discuss a possible plan to join forces a gm spokesman told the free press the company believed dias was likely planning wildcat strikes at other suppliers to disrupt production if gm has no intention of honoring the collective bargaining agreement the million dollar question is why should i dias said according to the free press meanwhile last week more than 70 000 workers from more than 40 factories including some that supply gm launched a wildcat strike in the u s mexican border town of matamoros after plant owners refused union demands for a 20 percent pay hike and an annual bonus joseph xu detroit congresswoman rashida tlaib takes to the megaphone at a green new deal demonstration weeks after keller led the tiny protest in front of the solidarity house the uaw holds a demonstration near detroit s cobo center to coincide with the north american international auto show s annual charity gala as industry executives sip champagne in formal attire the uaw is holding a candlelight vigil near the foot of transcending a giant arch that was built to commemorate the labor movement in the nearby hart plaza at the vigil the mood is somber and low energy at one point uaw chaplain philip jackson is brought forward to appeal to the almighty for help we need a little help from above god today he says looking up at the icy january sky i need you to help my brothers and sisters i need you to make a way out of no way i need you to touch the hearts of all the leaders of these companies that are negotiating for us today i need you to open doors that men have shut with that the procession marches over to cobo and then returns before dispersing meanwhile over at cobo there s a concurrent demonstration against gm with an entirely different vibe there a coalition has gathered to call on gm and lawmakers to make detroit the engine of a green new deal according to banners held by the protesters largely led by younger activists the organizers have printed bold yellow and green screen printed posters with messages like detroit is our city not gm s and justice for poletown the group is louder and livelier than the candlelight vigil complete with a marching band as the well heeled gala attendees sheepishly scurry by some protesters chant at them make better life decisions just outside cobo s windows newly elected detroit congresswoman rashida tlaib takes to the megaphone in support of the demonstration let s not forget what happened to poletown she says let s not forget every single person that gave up so much for that plant in hamtramck to be built and for them to walk away so i m telling you i stand with our uaw leaders but i am for accountability today if you leave i want our money back if you leave i want our plant back i want every single thing we ever gave you back because that s what we deserve the group carries on marching in front of cobo dancing and chanting which side are you on after police gently break up the group the yellow and green posters disappear into the night days later hammer agrees that the energy was markedly different between the candlelight vigil and the green new deal demonstration which he helped organize as part of his group auto workers caravan a candlelight vigil what kind of message does that say he says it doesn t embody a fight he says he s alarmed that the uaw was not able to get more people to attend the vigil the uaw has to examine why it is that they were only able to turn out so few people for as critical of an issue as a plant closing he says the green new deal demonstration was led by a coalition of a number of different groups including the detroit chapter of the democratic socialists of america sunrise michigan detroit s green party and the michigan coalition for human rights among many others the name of course is a reference to the new deal series of public work projects and financial reforms enacted by president franklin d roosevelt during the great depression as outlined in pamphlets co signed by tlaib the green new deal coalition demands that gm keep its factories open if they can t do that the group believes the factories should be seized via public domain and be put to public use in order to create federal union jobs to us on a path to rapid decarbonization of the economy they also call for public hearings on the issue nicholas jansen who helped coordinate the event as director for sunrise michigan says it s up to a new generation to demand better of companies like gm what we re seeing is a coalition of progressive groups around the country rethinking how our economy works he says young people did not create a lot of the problems we re seeing especially in terms of climate change a lot of young people feel such a personal stake in this fight and so we need to show up in solidarity with laborers because those are the groups that have been facing a lot of these challenges so far we re going to be the ones that have to help push for solutions so we can have a sustainable life the coalition also points out that gm s plans go against its own pledge to become environmentally friendly in a statement posted to linkedin in late 2017 barra wrote that general motors has committed itself to leading the way toward this future guided by our vision of zero crashes zero emissions and zero congestion the plant closures apparently were supposed to be necessary steps to retool gm for this greener future but the coalition for a green new deal notes that gm does not appear to be making these greener moves just yet all of the products slashed in the november cost cutting announcement were sedans including the electric hybrid volt its remaining products include gas guzzling trucks and suvs which are more popular and have higher profit margins ford and fiat chrysler have made similar changes to their product lines favoring more popular trucks and suvs at the expense of lower selling and more fuel efficient smaller cars but what the coalition is calling for jansen says goes beyond just gm s dealings in detroit the way we see it these problems are larger than any one company or any one presidency he says our economy has been set up for decades to just benefit those at the top of it ceos are now making 100 200 times more than the average worker and that s just not in one place and only one state that is all across the board we re seeing workers everywhere being left behind jansen believes the green new deal an idea that has been around for at least a decade but gained prominence after congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez staged a recent sit in outside house speaker nancy pelosi s office in support of it will gain traction in the elections ahead by the end of this year any candidate running for office that wants to be taken seriously in 2020 needs to support a green new deal otherwise they re not thinking about climate change seriously enough he says citing the latest report from the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change which estimates that we only have about 12 years to stop a climate change catastrophe hammer says he s pleased to see the green new deal gaining traction a decade ago he says he incorporated elements of it as a new arsenal of democracy plan brought forth to washington as part of the auto workers caravan i prefer arsenal of democracy because it was a way that the u s mobilized to counter the nazi threat in europe he says referring to the years 1942 through 1945 when u s auto plants were ordered by federal fiat to cease making new cars in order to make military weapons and vehicles instead we saw the government directing the auto companies to convert their plants to deal with the crisis of the moment and i very much think that we re in a similar crisis now he says the government has to step up its power to direct private companies to begin to convert to renewable energy he says the uaw has been slow to recognize the threat of climate change it needs to look at our situation and begin to educate the leadership and the rank and file about this issue and the role of the auto industry and what we need to do to improve things for autoworkers and to improve things for the environment he says i think it would behest the uaw to initiate rank and file green new deal committees he also reiterates that the issue is much bigger than the uaw in a globalized economy and dealing with a company that is as globalized as gm is the uaw needs to be globalized and have a global union he says in the meantime keller says to expect future demonstrations he reiterates the urgency of the situation in a global market countries become intertwined economically if the u s dollar collapses it pulls everybody down everybody s going to be a loser he says you don t have to be an economics teacher to know this until the union authorizes a strike keller is calling on union members to protest on their own time there will be more marches outside of the solidarity house he says he has also called on members to peacefully protest outside of gm dealerships i know that the membership is listening to me when i go on facebook live but i don t know what the participation is going to be until it gets warmer outside he says hopefully it will gain traction come early spring and we can get these people a couple hours prior to their shift or a couple hours after their shift we need to put some kind of pressure on our leadership to negotiate a fair and just contract to give some of the pie over to labor because we re the ones that build those profits all i m saying is something s got to be done to stop general motors from doing what they re doing now he says you want us to buy american products and support american companies then american companies need to support good paying american jobs it can t be where they got this mindset to where they can just abuse us and have us build a product that they reap all the benefits from labor is the heart of the company we are the heart of the union without us nothing moves forward another protest is planned at 2 p m on

record annual leasing volume of 28 0 million square feet 25 3 percent growth in rents on leasing activity 2019 guidance issued indianapolis jan 30 2019 globe newswire duke realty corporation nyse dre the largest domestic only logistics reit today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 jim connor chairman and chief executive officer said i m happy to announce full year and fourth quarter 2018 results which are highlighted by outstanding operational successes and the continued execution of our growth strategy operational results for the fourth quarter included the execution of 8 1 million square feet of leases with leasing volume for the year totaling 28 0 million square feet which is our highest year of industrial leasing volume on record partly as the result of early renewals of leases expiring in 2019 leases were renewed during the fourth quarter at an 87 9 percent tenant retention rate which has reduced turnover risk and helped us accelerate expected rental rate increases new and renewal leases executed during the quarter on a combined basis resulted in 25 3 percent growth in annualized net effective rents and 7 0 percent rent growth on a cash basis same property net operating income also increased by 3 5 percent during the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 4 3 percent for the full year 2018 compared to 2017 all of these operational accomplishments led to a strong finish to 2018 with full year core ffo of 1 33 per diluted share which represents 7 3 percent growth over 2017 mark denien executive vice president and chief financial officer stated we financed the majority of our fourth quarter development and acquisition activity with disposition proceeds cash on hand and cash that had been held in escrow for 1031 exchanges we have no debt maturities of any significance until 2021 which allows us to finance ongoing growth with a combination of internally generated funds available to be reinvested 273 million of interest bearing notes receivable that mature at various points through january 2020 expected proceeds from planned asset dispositions and the capacity to modestly increase leverage while still maintaining our current credit ratings quarterly highlights a complete reconciliation in dollars and per share amounts of net income to funds from operations ffo as defined by nareit as well as to core ffo is included in the financial tables included in this release the company adopted the nareit funds from operations white paper 2018 restatement the 2018 white paper effective december 31 2018 all current and prior period computations of ffo as defined by nareit are presented in accordance with the guidance in the 2018 white paper net income was 0 18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 0 52 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease to net income per diluted share was due to significant gains recognized from the sale of the final tranches of the company s medical office portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2017 net income for the full year 2018 was 1 07 per diluted share compared to 4 56 per diluted share for the full year 2017 the decreased net income per diluted share for the full year was primarily the result of the significant gains on the disposition of the company s medical office portfolio during 2017 ffo as defined by nareit was 0 36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 0 32 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit increased due to significant investments in new industrial properties over the last year and overall improved operational performance ffo as defined by nareit was 1 34 per diluted share for the full year 2018 compared to 1 25 per diluted share for the full year 2017 in addition to the factors leading to the increase in ffo per share for the fourth quarter the increased ffo per diluted share for the year was also driven by lower interest expense in 2018 as well as losses on debt extinguishment during 2017 partially offset by promote income recognized during 2017 core ffo was 0 35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 0 30 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase in core ffo per diluted share was largely driven by the same factors as the increase in ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit core ffo was 1 33 per diluted share for the full year 2018 compared to 1 24 per diluted share for the full year 2017 the increase to core ffo for the full year was driven by increased investment in real estate assets lower interest expense and overall improved operational performance operating performance within the company s industrial portfolio included total stabilized occupancy at december 31 2018 of 98 0 percent compared to 97 9 percent at september 30 2018 and 98 5 percent at december 31 2017 total in service occupancy at december 31 2018 of 96 3

mr connor further stated we started 101 million of developments during the quarter totaling 1 7 million square feet which were 68 percent pre leased our development pipeline at december 31 2018 was 55 percent leased and consisted of 22 properties totaling 9 5 million square feet with expected costs of 749 million during 2018 we increased the amount of speculative space in our portfolio both in service and under development while holding our overall occupancy steady this speculative space both in service and under development provides significant opportunity for overall growth in net operating income core ffo and affo we are confident in our ability to further lease up our pipeline during 2019 during the fourth quarter we acquired two fully leased properties totaling 512 000 square feet in a strategic location in seattle that allows for easy access to the ports of seattle and tacoma the seattle tacoma international airport and interstate 5 these assets are among only a handful of properties in that submarket with a 36 foot clear height and the acquisition represented a unique opportunity to deploy capital in this high barrier location we also acquired a fully leased property in south florida pursuant to a right of first offer negotiated with the seller of a three building portfolio in south florida that we purchased earlier in the year further increasing our presence in high barrier markets and allowing us to generate efficiencies with the assets we already own in the area these high barrier market acquisitions were funded by redeploying proceeds from midwest property dispositions development the fourth quarter included the following development activity consolidated properties during the quarter the company started two consolidated development projects with expected costs of 51 million these development projects consisted of a 544 000 square foot speculative development in chicago and a fully leased 194 000 build to suit development in

of the company s per share guidance for diluted net income per common share to ffo as defined by nareit and to core ffo is included in the financial tables to this release the company issued guidance for net income of 0 92 to 1 16 per diluted share the company issued guidance for ffo as defined by nareit of 1 33 to 1 43 per diluted share commenting on the company s 2019 outlook mr connor stated we are introducing 2019 guidance for core ffo of 1 37 to 1 43 per diluted share our 2019 core ffo guidance is based on the expectation of continued positive operating fundamentals across all of our markets similar to those experienced in 2018 with strong leasing fundamentals rent growth and tenants continuing to seek additional space our guidance for growth in adjusted funds from operations affo on a share adjusted basis ranges from 5 1 percent to 10 2 percent and is driven largely by the same reasons as the growth in core ffo our guidance for same property noi growth ranges from 3 25 percent to 4 75 percent and the projected growth is anticipated to be from continued strong rental rate increases we expect to continue development at a robust pace without needing additional equity financing while still maintaining a disciplined approach to maintaining a healthy level of pre leasing our guidance for development starts ranges from 600 million to 800 million ranges for the other key assumptions underlying this guidance are as follows dispositions of non strategic properties in a range of 350 million to 550 million with the proceeds primarily used to fund development and acquisitions acquisitions of properties in a range of 100 million to 300 million average percent leased of our stabilized portfolio ranging from 96 7 percent to 98 7 percent general and administrative expenses ranging from 57 million to 61 million more specific assumptions and components of the company s 2019 guidance will be available by 6 00 p m eastern time today through the investor relations section of the company s website ffo and affo reporting definitions ffo ffo is computed in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in december 2018 nareit issued the 2018 white paper which reaffirmed and in some cases refined nareit s prior determinations concerning ffo the guidance in the 2018 white paper allows preparers an option as it pertains to whether gains or losses on sale or impairment charges on real estate assets incidental to a reit s business are excluded from the calculation of ffo we have made the election to exclude activity related to such real estate assets that are incidental to our business the guidance in the 2018 white paper is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted we early adopted the guidance in the 2018 white paper effective december 31 2018 and have accordingly revised prior periods to reflect that guidance ffo is calculated as net income or loss in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate gains and losses on sales of real estate assets including real estate assets incidental to our business and related taxes gains and losses from change in control impairment charges related to real estate assets including real estate assets incidental to our business and similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and partially owned consolidated entities we believe ffo to be most directly comparable to net income or loss as defined by gaap and that ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements accompanying this release ffo does not represent a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders core ffo core ffo is computed as ffo adjusted for certain items that are generally non cash in nature and that materially distort the comparative measurement of company performance over time the adjustments include tax expenses or benefits related to i changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances ii changes in tax exposure accruals that were established as the result of the previous adoption of new accounting principles or iii taxable income loss related to other items excluded from ffo or core ffo collectively referred to as other income tax items gains or losses on debt transactions gains or losses from involuntary conversion from weather events or natural disasters promote income severance and other charges related to major overhead restructuring activities and the expense impact of costs attributable to successful leasing activities although our calculation of core ffo differs from nareit s definition of ffo and may not be comparable to that of other reits and real estate companies we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance affo affo is a supplemental performance measure defined by the company as core ffo as defined above less recurring building improvements and total second generation capital expenditures the leasing of vacant space that had previously been under lease by the company is referred to as second generation lease activity related to leases commencing during the reporting period and adjusted for certain non cash items including straight line rental income and expense non cash components of interest expense and stock compensation expense and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures same property performance the company includes same property net operating income growth as a property level supplemental measure of performance the company utilizes same property net operating income growth as a supplemental measure to evaluate property level performance and jointly controlled properties are included at the company s ownership percentage a reconciliation of

the fed says it will be patient with interest rates and wall street jumps in response 1 the macro matters for markets there are two things important to financial markets currently the outlook for global growth and the state of financial conditions that is what are economic fundamentals showing and how are central bankers responding to those fundamentals at its core the market rout in the last quarter of 2018 was about the interplay of these two concerns global growth was apparently slowing unaided by the trade war and a seemingly cyclical slow down in the chinese economy while monetary policy was tightening sucking liquidity out of financial markets it was believed that a deterioration in the global economy was upon us it may well still be and those responsible for ensuring this does not eventuate were deaf to the cries of market participants 2 the links between the fundamentals and the themes this is the reason why a headline about a weaker europe or an escalation in the trade war or a story about the us fed sticking to rate hikes or its quantitative tightening program hurt the bulls so much the global economy can t prosper without at least signs of solid growth or the necessary support from monetary authorities to at the very least keep the global economy on life support
by reuters by julien ponthus and ritvik carvalho london reuters while global markets would hail a u s china trade deal fears are growing that the european union could be the fall guy in any breakthrough which would allow donald trump to turn his attention to german cars or french luxury wines investors thinking of chasing a rally on a trade accord through european trade proxies such as germany s export heavy dax index or the continent s luxury names should probably think twice analysts believe for trouble could come in a lot of different forms alicia garcía herrero chief economist at natixis for asia pacific and a researcher at the bruegel think tank is among those who have warned that a deal could cost europe dearly if china substitutes a large part of its european imports for u s goods in a bid to appease the trump administration there is a lot at stake european listed firms expect 456 billion euros 398 4 billion in total revenue from china in 2019 with luxury brands and automakers the most exposed sectors a refinitiv analysis of company data shows vincent deluard global macro strategist at intl fcstone said that in the case china and the united states fail to clinch a deal europe could be flooded with cheap chinese goods europe stands to lose the most when the truce expires on march 1st as china would surely dump billions of discounted goods on the old continent deluard wrote in 2017 china exported goods worth 374 billion euros to the eu and 505 billion dollars to the united states another dire scenario sketched out by deluard would be a bitter lose lose for europe and arguable win win for trump imposing tariffs on european cars and reaching a deal with china could allow the trump administration to claim two victories at the same time many investors fear the immediate relief of a china u s deal could be swiftly followed by a bitter confrontation between the eu and its closest ally we are next while germany takes the lion s share of the eu s trade surplus with the united states over 63 billion dollars in 2017 other european countries such as ireland italy or france have a lot to lose if tariffs are imposed on european goods graphic u s trade balance with eu the diversity of their exports highlights how wide the impact would be advertisement a graphic from the atlas of economic complexity center for international development at harvard university shows how french exports in 2016 ranged from wines 3 80 percent to gas turbines 10 95 percent and medicines 6 08 percent graphic french exports to the united states 2016 analysts trying to decipher the u s president s strategy believe that a confrontation with the eu is a probable next step following the revamping of the north american free trade agreement and his current efforts to slash the u s trade deficit with china from a record 375 billion dollars in 2017 advertisement we are next in the queue warns bnp paribas chief economist william de vijlder adding that the subject of the eu u s trade negotiations has been under the radar up to recently but could resurface soon lombard odier strategist charles st arnaud believes a period of prolonged eu u s tension with daily incendiary headlines making european markets jittery is a distinct possibility what trump tweeted about french wine i can see the parallel with canadian milk he said recalling the tense u s nafta negotiations with canada on nov 13th trump complained that while france could easily export wines to the united states u s winemakers access to the french market was restricted not fair must change he said on twitter advertisement to see trump s tweet click st arnaud argues that the threat of a trade war with the united states could mean another grim year for european stocks which have already suffered collateral damage from the trade spat between the world s two biggest economies a european underperformance is possible in 2019 he believes advertisement if the chinese negotiating team currently in washington was to achieve significant progress european stocks would get a boost at least in the short term it is crucial for the world economy that this man made uncertainty ceases said de vijlder an escalation would meanwhile sharpen the global growth downturn and hit bourses worldwide according to a big reuters poll of economists but while both emerging and european stock markets underperformed wall street during 2018 due to the trade stress endured by exporters european shares remain very much less loved by global investors than their em peers according to data provider epfr while emerging markets equity funds have recorded 15 straight weeks of inflows european funds saw outflows for 45 of the past 46 weeks advertisement take the wind out trump s sail with a concerns about brexit unrest in france italy s populist government and may s eu elections the big european benchmarks are seen by many foreign investors as uninvestable especially as growth slows it s pretty clear that during the course of conversation with any client political risk premium political uncertainty will come into the conversation said andrew milligan head of strategy at aberdeen investments joerg kraemer commerzbank s chief economist said a confrontation with washington could be very damaging notably for the german car industry and that the european commission would be wise to make a pre emptive move europe needs to take the wind out trump s sails and move first he told reuters calling for the eu to scrap its 10 percent tariff on u s cars to defuse tensions advertisement reporting by
