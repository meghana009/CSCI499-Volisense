jul 5 2019 alasdair macleod there are growing signs that the global economic slowdown is for real as was the case in 1929 the combination of the peak of the credit cycle coupled with trade protectionism in the smoot hawley tariff act are similar conditions to those of today and potentially pose a serious economic challenge to the post bretton woods fiat currency system therefore we must consider the consequences if monetary policy fails to contain the developing recession and it turns into a full blown slump complacency over broken markets is no longer an option with rising prices for gold and bitcoin signalling the prospect of a new round of currency debasement to avoid market distortions unwinding this article shows why this outcome could undermine fiat currencies entirely and looks at the alternatives of bitcoin and gold in this context introduction never in all recorded history have financial markets been so distorted everywhere in our lifetimes we have seen the ussr and also china under mao attempt to do without markets altogether and fail having starved and slaughtered millions of their citizens in the process the romans started a long period of currency debasement lasting from nero to diocletian who wrote prices in stone the origin of the phrase in a vain attempt to control them while the roman empire was the known world at the time it was essentially restricted to the mediterranean and europe subsequently there have been over fifty instances recorded of complete monetary collapse the vast majority in the last hundred years which have led to the breakdown of every society involved and now we could be facing a global totality the grand daddy of them all we have become inured to cycles of credit expansion driven by fractional reserve banking at least since the bank charter act of 1844 which legalised fractional reserve banking extra impetus was given by central banks from the 1920s onwards we have become so used to it that we now expect central banks to issue and control our money and only get really worried when we think they might lose control in their efforts to satisfy the mandate they have assumed for themselves central banks intervene more and more with every credit cycle our complacency extends to prices especially regarding the exchange and valuation of capital assets there are now about 13 trillion of bonds in issue with negative yields we rarely think in any depth about this strangeness but negative yields are never the consequence of market pricing free from monopolistic distortions the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank all impose negative interest rates as well as sweden s riksbank and denmark s nationalbank the ecb commands the currency and finances of the largest economic area in the world and the boj the third largest national economy in denmark mortgage lenders are even offering negative yield mortgages in other words danes are being paid to take out loans with negative interest rates ten year government bonds issued by germany japan sweden and even by france have negative yields all danish government bonds have negative yields negative yields stand time preference on its head time preference refers to the fact that we prefer current possession to future possession for obvious reasons so when we part with our money we always do so at a discount to expected repayment which is reflected in a positive rate of interest the idea that anyone parts with money to get less back at a future date is simply nuts it gets even more bizarre the french government has debts roughly equal to france s gdp and by any analysis is not a very good credit risk but it is now being paid by lenders to borrow only forty per cent of her economy is the productive tax base for a spendthrift business emasculating government an independent observer evaluating french government debt would be hard put to classify it as investment grade in the proper meaning of the term but not according to bond markets and not according to the rating agencies which today s investors slavishly follow there are a number of explanations for this madness besides complacency and misplaced investor psychology the most obvious distortion is regulation investors particularly pension funds and insurance companies are forced by their regulators to invest nearly all their funds in regulated investments their compliance officers who are effectively state sponsored bureaucrats control the investment decision process portfolio managers have become patsies managing capital with little option but to comply additionally with their highly geared balance sheets state licenced banks complying with basel ii and iii are also corralled into riskless assets which according to the regulators are government debt the rating agencies play along with the fiction for example moody s rates france as aa2 high quality and subject to very low credit risk this is for a country without its own currency to inflate to repay debt low enough for negative yields low enough to be paid to borrow in japan the country s government debt to gdp ratio is now over 250 the bank of japan maintains a target rate of minus 0 1 and the 10 year government bond yield is minus 0 16 making the yield curve negative even in negative territory it doesn t stop there with the bank of japan having bought 5 6 trillion yen 52bn of equity etfs last year this takes its total equity investment to 29 trillion yen 271bn representing 5 of the tokyo stock exchange s first section last year s purchases absorbed all foreign selling of japanese equities so they were clearly aimed at rigging the equity market rather than some sort of monetary manoeuvre it s not only the bank of japan but the national bank of switzerland has been at it as well according to its annual report and accounts at end 2018 it held chf156bn in equities worldwide 159bn being 21 of its foreign reserves we can see the direction central bank reserve policy is now heading and should not be surprised to see equity purchases become a wide spread means of rigging stockmarkets and expanding base money sovereign wealth funds which are government funds that owe their origin to monetary inflation through the foreign exchanges have invested a cumulative total of nearly 2 trillion dollars in listed equities while this is only 2 5 of total market capitalisation of listed securities world wide they are a significant element in marginal pricing more so in some markets than others between them central banks and sovereign wealth funds that are buying equities in increasing quantities further the scope of quantitative easing the precedent is now there economists in the central banking community now have a basis for drafting erudite neo keynesian papers on the subject giving cover for policy makers to take even more radical steps to pursue their interventions by all these methods state control of regulated public and private sector funds coupled with the expansion of bank credit has cheapened government borrowing and it would appear that governments are now enabled to issue limitless quantities of zero or negative yielding debt so long as enough money and credit is fed into one end of the sausage machine it emerges as costless finance from the other never mind the destruction wreaked on key private sector investors such as pension funds whose actuarial deficits are already in crisis that is a problem for later never mind the destruction of insurance fund finances where premiums are normally supplemented by healthy bond portfolio returns just blame the insurance companies for charging higher premiums this is now the key question are we entering a new phase of low inflation managed capitalism or are we tipping into a mega crisis possibly systemically destructive if the latter there s a lot to go horribly wrong the bank for international settlements the central banks central bank is certainly worried only this week it released its annual economic report in which it said monetary policy can no longer be the main engine for economic growth clearly whistling to keep our spirits up it calls for structural reforms to boost government spending on infrastructure translated the bis is saying little more can be achieved by easing monetary policy so presidents and prime ministers it s over to you you can create savings by making government more efficient and you can spend more on infrastructure while the bis washes it hands of the problem history and reason tell us increased state involvement in economic outcomes will only make things worse it is in the nature of government bureaucracy to be economically wasteful because its primary purpose is not the efficient use of capital resources and while the outcome be it a new high speed railway or a bridge to nowhere may be a visible result it fails to account for the true cost to the economy of diverting economic resources from what is actually demanded heed the message from the credit cycle bullish investors should note that we are already far down the path of our economic decline which gives a fundamental falsity to financial valuations following the lehman crisis the expansion of money and credit fed into asset inflation creating an illusion of improving business prospects the suppression of interest rates was the come on to businesses to invest in production the government s budget deficit created extra spending as a further encouragement the government s economists say it s all down to reviving those animal spirits but they have been encouraging businesses to chase a mirage which as they progress towards it always seems that little bit further away until it finally disappears altogether businesses that relied on the state s mirage now find it is just an illusion for those of us struggling to preserve our savings the effect of monetary inflation on financial prices is the reality that matters the purchasing power of the currency in which we measure our savings is a commonly neglected consideration an issue of added importance at times of high monetary inflation unfortunately it is an effect that cannot be measured but it doesn t stop statisticians from persuading us that they can even though they are accepted by financial analysts without any reservation government statistics on price inflation have underplayed the progressive impoverishment of productive consumers by monetary debasement since this dishonourable manipulation of statistics was adopted governments have been faced with a stark choice either they confess to the deceit and protect the currency from further debasement or like every roman emperor who followed nero continue to debauch the currency so long as there are suckers to believe in it the growing dishonesty of statistical manipulation over time is an additional factor to take into account when observing successive credit cycles they are part of a policy of concealing the fact that they are getting worse when the official line is otherwise policy makers claim to be improving their control over the excesses of the markets by supressing evidence to the contrary credit cycles have been generally worsening at least since the inflationary crisis of the 1970s which followed the abandonment of the bretton woods agreement in 1971 central banks have debauched their currencies increasingly over successive credit cycles building up to an inevitable apocalyptic crash the approaching one could be our global totality the grand daddy of them all those of us not wrapped up in the illusion of modern monetary theory and keynesian and monetarist claptrap have always know it will happen one day the collapse of the bretton woods agreement was an event in a larger cycle of government intervention and failure von mises knew it would happen and he explained why in his the theory of money and credit first published in german over one hundred years ago ten years before it happened he predicted the collapse of the mark and other european currencies in the early 1920s since then we have proved that collectively we have learned little it s like living on the slopes of a volcano knowing it is certain to erupt one day the optimists are betting that the growing mountain of negative yielding debt is not the apocalypse s calling card trade protection and the credit cycle so far i have described the worrying imbalances in financial markets evidenced in this credit cycle by growing quantities of negative yielding debt but last year an additional problem arose through american trade tariffs which now combine with the top of the credit cycle i have written about this before so will only summarise the main point here in 1929 the smoot hawley tariff act was legislated at the end of the 1920s credit expansion and it was the combination of the two that changed the similarly benign conditions of the 1920s to those of today into the 1929 crash and the depression that followed undoubtedly there were other factors that made the situation worse than it otherwise would have been principally president hoover s disastrous attempts to intervene in the economy today government intervention is far more pervasive and has the potential to make things even worse it must not be assumed that today s stock markets will fall by nine tenths as was the case between 1929 32 through the medium of dollar in those days prices were effectively measured in gold at the fixed rate of 20 67 to the ounce today currencies are totally fiat and the price of any financial asset will reflect changes in value from the money side as well as from the asset itself however stocks are still likely to be liquidated in a serious downturn added to this today is a potential etf problem where investors only attachment is to bullish stockmarkets and not individual investments as soon as the public wake up to changed market conditions we can expect them to liquidate index tracking etfs by all appearances in its early days the ending of a prolonged period of credit expansion is turning out for investors to be no worse than a normal downturn nothing monetary policy can t fix it is certainly possible the can will be kicked down the road just one more time if that fails a second phase of investor psychology will anticipate a deepening of the global recession and a realisation that monetary policy is failing to stop it equity markets should then begin to fall in earnest property prices can be expected to follow perhaps declining heavily given the leverage of mortgage debt so far so conventional if it happens almost certainly there will be a financial abyss into which we will all stare we have seen it before in january 1975 in the uk it was after the stockmarket had fallen 73 from its 1972 peak there was a similar moment in america in 2002 when alan greenspan turned it round and during the great financial crisis there was another moment still fresh in our minds always the solution was for the establishment comprising the government its central bank the commercial banks and the pension and insurance funds to act together behind the scenes to restore confidence we can be sure that government coercion to achieve the same revival of confidence will be tried again if the situation arises if an attempt to fully restore confidence fails to do more than provide a short term fix government finances will deteriorate further and monetary inflation will be tried in even greater quantities than we have seen heretofore flooded with fiat money most economies will then experience rising price inflation that can no longer be camouflaged by government statistics to protect the currencies and reflect the markets increasing time preference higher interest rates will then surely follow in such an environment the world s banking system will be under enormous strain and the risk of systemic failure will escalate while it is never too late to look for alternatives to deposits in the banking system it is far better to seek them before a crisis can be seen on the horizon in the event that global fiat money finances do deteriorate into a systemic crisis the majority of people will be caught by surprise having relied on the state to regulate greedy bankers and crony capitalists of all stripes unfortunately complacency and ignorance are no defence in the courts of human experience the two alternative stores of value whereby money can be taken out of a bank without queueing for physical cash are through the purchase of secure cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and metallic money gold and silver their prices are already rising perhaps reflecting shortening odds of the cataclysmic events described herein taking place for this reason the merits and limitations of both should hold our interest bitcoin king of the cryptos the more prescient individuals amongst us will have already taken out some insurance against the inevitable calamity von mises described over a hundred years ago traditionally this has meant portfolio exposure to precious metals but in the last few years we have observed an interesting development the decentralisation of information through the internet has undermined government control of the media particularly with respect to money the growing numbers of millennials now seeking the truth about money is a new phenomenon they seek alternatives to state issued currency and are the driving force behind cryptocurrencies the invention of a digital rival bitcoin along with other cryptocurrencies has profound implications for the hitherto unquestioning public acceptance of fiat currency keynes wrote that there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all the hidden forces on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose the economic consequences of the peace 1919 with the new millennials the ignorance of the masses upon which currency issuing governments depend is being unexpectedly eroded through their interest in cryptocurrencies they have learned about the drawbacks of fiat currencies and while their unconditional support for bitcoin and the like may be challenged they realise that governments debauch currencies at their expense for this reason cryptocurrencies particularly bitcoin are a significant threat to state currencies the consequence may be to speed up the collapse of fiat currencies faith in fiat currencies is already being tested which can be deduced from the performance of bitcoin s price furthermore if commercial banks become systemically threatened we can expect to see rapidly increasing amounts of fiat deposits being exchanged by millennials for diminishing quantities of bitcoin the mistake observers of bitcoin often make is to disqualify it as money because it is volatile what matters is not its use as a medium for transactions but its ability to store value wholly protected from government intervention by virtue of its distributed ledger through their continual debasement and their tightening control over the use of fiat currencies governments have created and fuelled the demand for bitcoin and when it comes to security bitcoin and its blockchain has survived all attempts to break them it is in various service providers that the weaknesses lie not in bitcoin and its blockchain though they have shown interest in the blockchain financial institutions are only now beginning to take notice of bitcoin itself and pressure is mounting for it to be accepted as an investment asset regulated bitcoin futures contracts are being traded on comex and when other asset classes yield inadequate returns pressure for financial institutions to invest in bitcoin should continue to increase while no one can predict how bitcoin prices will actually evolve it is already becoming clear that its story has much left to tell interestingly bitcoin s recent dramatic price move has come at a time when the risk of a deepening and global economic recession appears to be increasing it is not yet tangible evidence that bitcoin could accelerate the transfer of value away from fiat money thereby undermining it but it is food for thought gold the only money that survives all in all history its rarity desirability and chemical stability tell us that gold is the most secure form of money it is only in the advanced economies in the west where we have fallen for decades of government propaganda that gold no longer has a monetary role that people have forgotten its proven qualities as the ultimate money it stands to reason that as the purchasing power of state issued currencies is increasingly threatened by over issuance the west s collective amnesia will be replaced by a reassessment of gold as the proven protection from collapsing fiat currencies despite the excitement generated by secure cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin gold remains the refuge of choice for those concerned about an emerging post fiat world a world where even the internet and mobile communications risk being disrupted rendering cryptocurrencies temporarily useless as transaction money ahead of a collapse in fiat currencies the most powerful argument in favour of both bitcoin and gold is their ability to store value this is not the same as their role as currency which becomes more important afterwards when bitcoin cannot compete with gold the transfer of bitcoin ownership is restricted to a daily rate of about 500 000 and is already running close to this capacity for this reason it can never replace conventional forms of instant exchange unlike a gold coin only gold and additionally silver will offer both the store of value and cash transaction functions demanded in a post fiat world the physical supply of gold will become central to its price relationship with failing fiat currencies so a proper assessment of the stock of gold available as currency in a post fiat world is essential gold as money can be regarded as being in two categories there are the reserves held by central banks which will be required to back note issues and electronic money when the fiat money component of reserves become worthless additionally there are gold bars and coins distributed in public ownership the two quantities appear to be similar as the following analysis demonstrates of a total above ground stock of physical gold which at goldmoney we estimate to be about 176 000 tonnes perhaps 60 is used for jewellery and industrial purposes leaving 70 400 tonnes of which 34 024 tonnes are recorded as official reserves however it is almost certainly the case that nations such as china hold gold which is undeclared and at the same time not all official reserves are bullion but bullion swapped and leased so are double counted let us simplistically assume that these two quantities cancel each other out that leaves an estimated 36 376 tonnes owned by the public as bar and coin which together with official reserves we can regard as the gold money supply strictly speaking it is a mistake to include jewellery in asia where the bulk of it is held as part of gold s money supply while it can easily be encashed close to melt value in practice it is not held for this purpose the flow of gold into jewellery tends to be a one way phenomenon where it is more likely to be used as collateral at asian pawnshops for the purpose of bridge financing and capital spending with the intention of being redeemed for fiat cash therefore except in the case of a post apocalyptic economic catastrophe gold jewellery is not part of gold s monetary flow significantly higher gold prices may change this but for now gold jewellery should be regarded as its owners see it a dependable asset to be held and passed on to successive generations the reason for belabouring the point is analysts mistakenly use estimates of total above ground stock as gold s money supply it confuses a store of value with money available for transactions the same confusion that leads advocates of cryptocurrencies to regard bitcoin as a circulating currency bitcoin can only circulate within the constraints of a distributed ledger so its theoretical status is more akin to a form of digital jewellery hoarded and not intended to be spent we can now compare the value of gold that will circulate as currency with the total of cash and bank deposits in fiat currencies held round the world internet searches tell us the world s fiat money totals about 80 trillion while the quantity of monetary gold as redefined above at current prices is worth 3 2 trillion a ratio of 25 times and that s before any further expansion of fiat money is issued in an effort to stem a developing credit crisis conclusion it is very likely the recent strength in both gold and bitcoin is linked to changing perceptions of risk to the global economy it has become increasingly clear in recent weeks that the coincidence of the end of the expansionary phase of the credit cycle coinciding with trade protectionism has damaged global trade very severely and the effects are now extending into domestic economies this being the case we can expect a renewed acceleration of monetary inflation while supporting government finances through new bouts of quantitative easing the wealth transfer effect of monetary inflation will increasingly undermine the productive economy that is why gold and bitcoin prices could turn out to be an early warning of an acceleration in the rate at which fiat currencies will lose purchasing power if leading nations through their central banks fail to protect their currencies then these two alternatives to fiat currencies will have only just started to rise see currently 0 31 fixed for the rest of the year see

mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country according to data from the ghana chamber of mines the minerals and mining sector was the foremost source of direct domestic revenue paid to the ghana revenue authority gra in 2017 corporate income tax receipt of mining companies was 969 6 million cedis mineral royalty revenue was 702 4 million cedis employee income tax pay as you earn was 487 9 million cedis in 2017 compared to 399 9 million cedis in 2016 other forms of taxes collected by the gra in the mining sector which are officially classified as self employed amounted to 780 000 cedis in 2017 overall the total mining fiscal receipts paid to the gra increased by 31 per cent year on year from 1 65 billion cedis in 2016 to 2 16 billion cedis in 2017 gold accounts for approximately 97 per cent of all mineral receipts according to the minerals commission total gold output in ghana increased to 3 79 million ounces in 2016 compared with 3 6 million ounces in 2015 this 5 per cent increase in gold production was the result of increased purchases of gold from small scale producers which more than offset the reduction in gold production from large scale mining businesses in specific terms whereas the production by the large scale producers declined by 1 per cent to 2 55 million ounces the purchases of gold from small scale miners increased by 20 per cent to 1 23 million ounces in 2016 in 2015 the output of the small scale sector was 1 million ounces while that of the large scale sector was 2 5 million ounces the small scale mining sector is estimated to contribute to about 32 per cent of gold production notwithstanding the challenging environment the minerals and mining industry continues to be a significant contributor to the country s development ghana maintained its position as the world s 10th largest gold producer accounting for 3 per cent of global gold output in 2015 diamond purchases by the precious minerals and marketing company decreased by 28 per cent and total manganese shipments by the country s sole producer the ghana manganese company declined by 5 per cent the falling gold price and the effect of the electricity supply deficit to the mining companies partly led to a 10 per cent decline in gold exports according to the gra in 2016 the mining and quarrying sector resumed its position as the leading source of direct domestic revenue after being supplanted by the financial and insurance sector during 2015 total fiscal receipts attributable to the mining and quarrying sector increased by 22 per cent from about us 320 million in 2015 to us 392 million in 2016 the contribution of the mining sector constitutes about 16 per cent of direct domestic revenue the 2016 mining fiscal revenue outturn represents approximately 16 per cent of direct domestic revenue acquired by the gra and 5 per cent of total government revenue including grants further the fiscal revenue performance of the mining and quarrying sector which excludes payments of ground rent and dividends to the state compares favourably with the oil and gas sector s contribution of 972 5 million cedis reported in the 2016 budget statement and economic policy the bank of ghana ghana central bank indicates that the minerals sector continues to be the leading export earner and improved upon its share in gross merchandise exports from 32 2 per cent in 2015 to 45 5 per cent in 2016 whereas cocoa and crude oil contributed 22 3 per cent and 12 5 per cent respectively this indicates that the proceeds from mineral exports was twice that of cocoa and more than three times that of crude oil in 2016 in addition to the mining sector s contribution to the reduction in the depreciation as against other currencies in 2016 the 41 per cent increase in mineral exports was the primary reason for the balance of payments surplus achieved for that year in a report in january 2017 the bank of ghana s monetary policy committee stated for the first time since 2011 the provisional balance of payments in 2016 recorded a surplus this largely reflected an improvement in the trade balance driven by a rise in gold export receipts and a fall in oil import prices the total workforce employed by mining companies was 11 628 as at the end of 2016 compared to 9 939 for 2015 indicating an increase of 16 per cent out of the total number of employees 190 are foreign expatriates and the rest are ghanaians the mining sector is also crucial for attracting foreign investment total investments in the sector during the past 10 years exceeded us 10 billion coming from companies engaged in gold production exploration and support services target minerals what are the target minerals the main minerals extracted in ghana are gold diamond bauxite and manganese however gold currently accounts for more than 90 per cent of mining sector revenue and activity there has been no growing interest in minerals used in battery technology or renewable energy regions which regions are most active the ashanti belt which covers most parts of ghana s ashanti and western regions is the most active mining region particularly for gold and prospecting the sefwi belt in the north west of the western region and the wa laura bole and bui belts in the northern regions are also active particularly for gold prospecting the kibi belt in the eastern region is active with diamond and bauxite mining with gold prospecting undertaken too legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based ghana s legal system is based on english common law regulation how is the mining industry regulated the mining industry in ghana is regulated at state and national levels by way of mining laws and agreements what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the principal laws regulating the mining industry are the minerals and mining act 2006 act 703 as amended by the minerals and mining amendment act 2015 act 900 the minerals and mining act the minerals development fund act 2016 act 912 and the minerals income investment fund act 2018 act 947 and the following regulations the minerals and mining compensation and resettlements regulations 2012 li 2175 the minerals and mining support services regulations 2012 li 2174 the minerals and mining general regulations 2012 li 2173 the minerals and mining health safety and technical regulations 2012 li 2182 the minerals and mining explosives regulations 2012 li 2177 and the minerals and mining licensing regulations 2012 li 276 the above minerals and mining regulations replaced the mining regulations 1970 li 665 the principal regulatory body administering these laws is the minerals commission the minerals and mining act aims to develop a national policy on mining and consolidate the disparate laws on mining that existed at the time and increase investment by foreign mining companies in ghana by removing the uncertainty concerning the availability and conditionality of mining rights and the bureaucratic gridlock that provided opportunities for corruption mining legislation is applied equally to ghanaians and foreign investors except for provisions relating to small scale mining of minerals which is exclusively reserved for ghanaians the minerals and mining regulations health safety and technical establish environmental safety machinery and related guidelines for mining operations the minerals commission was established under the minerals commission act 1993 act 450 for the regulation and management of the utilisation of the mineral resources and the coordination of the policies in relation to them the minerals commission is empowered by section 100 of the minerals and mining act to under the direction of the minister of lands and natural resources supervise the proper and effective implementation of the minerals and mining act and regulations the minerals commission is required by law to formulate recommendations on mineral policy monitor the implementation of these policies assess stability agreements and report to parliament and collect data on national mineral resources classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves in ghana any of the recognised international classification systems are acceptable including those from canada south africa and australia the minerals commission however has guidelines for preparing feasibility study reports mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas the title or ownership of all minerals including metallic minerals is vested in the president of ghana in trust for and on behalf of the people of ghana mineral rights are granted to private parties giving them the right to mine the minerals in the ground there are large areas such as tarkwa and obuasi where the mineral rights are privately held by large mining companies small scale and artisanal miners are also permitted to exploit the minerals in those areas often the surface rights are owned separately publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online the minerals commission has a geological map of ghana specifying the probable areas where minerals may be found the geological survey department is the technical entity responsible for carrying out geological surveys and also retains similar data private parties granted mineral rights are required to keep records of any minerals discovered results of any geochemical or geophysical analysis results of any study survey test or other work undertaken in the area covered by the licence and interpretation and assessment of such tests and surveys among others the subject matter of the records depends on the type of mineral right granted and the holder of the right is required to keep these records at an address notified to the minerals commission the holder of the mineral right is also required to permit officials of the commission to inspect and make copies of the records the holder of a mineral right may also be required to furnish the commission or the geological survey department with reports kept as part of the required records all records kept are however confidential and as such persons to whom they are disclosed are prohibited from divulging information contained in them also copyright in the information contained in the reports passes to and resides in ghana when the person who prepared the reports ceases to hold the mineral rights in respect of which the records were kept or is not granted any other mineral right in substitution over the same area the mining laws require that records of all mineral rights granted should be maintained and must be open to inspection by members of the public copies of such records are available to members of the public on payment of the prescribed fees the database is not yet available online acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence ghana has three kinds of mining rights reconnaissance licence prospecting licence and mining lease private parties may acquire any or all of them although the correct procedure is to obtain the exploratory licences reconnaissance and prospecting and then convert them into a mining lease following a successful exploration the reconnaissance licence allows the holder to engage in initial exploratory work and search for minerals it gives the holder the right to conduct reconnaissance exercises regarding the reconnaissance area however the holder is not entitled to drill excavate or carry on any under surface operations the prospecting licence permits the holder to carry out activities including activities to determine the extent and economic value of any deposit in the prospecting area the mining lease gives the holder the right to intentionally win minerals and it includes any operations directly or indirectly necessary or incidental thereto the granting of mineral rights is based on a first come first served basis as long as the applicant has met the requirements stipulated in the mining law a holder of a reconnaissance licence may apply to obtain a mining lease but not on a preferential basis from 1 july 2010 the minerals commission enacted a new policy concerning the granting of extensions to mineral rights this was because the minerals commission realised that a number of companies were abusing the regime then in place section 34 2 of the minerals and mining act allows for the term of prospecting licences to be no more than three years licence holders are obliged to reduce the area of the prospecting licence upon renewal by section 38 1 of the minerals and mining act in practice however the term granted has generally been two years to ensure companies are kept committed following complaints from prospecting licence holders that the two year term granted was not enough for the completion of their exploration programmes a further one year extension was granted without requiring a reduction in the size of prospecting area if the holders demonstrated performance but needed time to complete their exploration programmes and enable them to make informed decisions with regard to renewing their licence the minerals commission realised that a number of companies abused this privilege and continuously requested extensions even though they were in a position to apply for a renewal of the licence this practice created problems for the minerals commission in its management of the mineral title system consequently since 1 july 2010 the minerals commission has been guided by the following policies in granting extensions only prospecting licences may be extended reconnaissance licences and mining leases will not be extended an application for extension of a prospecting licence will be granted once and for a term of one year especially for those companies active on the ground and no extensions will be entertained for non performing companies a holder of a reconnaissance licence or a prospecting licence may apply for one or more mining leases regarding any or all of the minerals that formed the subject of the licence prior to the expiry of the licence however the blocks that constitute the reconnaissance or prospecting area should not form more than three discrete areas three separate applications should be submitted with each consisting of either a block or a number of blocks with common sides the grant of the mining

in connection with the mineral right the minister of lands and natural resources may cancel mining leases where the holder has without good cause failed to carry out its mining programme for two or more years acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties small scale mining is reserved exclusively for ghanaians beyond this there is no distinction between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic and foreign parties in the mining industry there is no requirement that a foreign party should have a domestic partner however the ghanaian government as per the minerals and mining act has a 10 per cent free carried interest in all mining undertakings and retains the option to acquire an additional interest on terms to be agreed on by the private party and the government protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed

rights is only entitled to an annual ground rent compensation for disturbance of surface rights or resettlement a surface rights holder cannot object to the exercise of surface rights granted to the holder of a mineral right by the minister the law allows the mineral rights holder to pay fair adequate and prompt compensation to the original surface rights holder if there is any disturbance to the

reading time 6 minutes latin america s recent economic success carries with it the risk of complacency among the region s policymakers economic growth during 2003 2007 was the highest in the region since the adoption of neoliberal policies in the early 1980s most of south america seems to be well on the road to recovery from the global financial crisis while countries like brazil appear bound for global economic status but when the region s economies are examined within the larger global context the urgent need for action becomes clear many latin american countries today are caught in a middle income trap on the one hand they can no longer compete with low wage countries in standardized products on the other they cannot compete with countries with greater capabilities in more technology intensive goods and services the reason many governments have never developed the policies and institutional environment to make the leap to high tech or industrial economic development what is often referred to as industrial policy in the last 60 years latin america s economic strategy has swung broadly from import substitution industrialization isi to neoliberalism under isi governments understood that economic activities differ in their potential for creating sustained growth and that they need to provide an incentive structure that allows private producers to accumulate the technological capabilities required to compete in activities with increasing returns governments also understood they had to adopt policies to support and coordinate the development of complementary social capabilities but overconfidence in the abilities of governments as well as the lack of built in performance requirements for protected industries resulted in persistent and widespread inefficiencies and widely divergent productivity within and across sectors of the region s economies in the neoliberal period governments substituted competitiveness policies for industrial policies assuming that market forces would generate sustained growth the benefits of trade liberalization foreign investment and good governance are not automatic if local industries and producers have not reached a certain threshold in their own capacity then they will not be able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by international markets and foreign investment this is where government policy comes in well structured transparent and predictable interactions between government institutions and private sector organizations provide the institutional architecture to implement successful pro growth industrial policies falling short in global comparisons the accumulation of technological capabilities is at the heart of the development process technological capabilities refer to the resources and organizational abilities needed to generate and manage technological change in a changing national and global context accumulating those capabilities is the key to sustained productivity growth and high end economic development the results of 25 years of neoliberal policies in latin america speak volumes about the current state of technological capabilities in the region latin american economies grew at an average annual rate of 2 7 percent between 1980 and 2008 that is half the rate of growth during the import substitution period and substantially lower than in any other developing country group productivity growth has fared even worse labor productivity grew at an annual rate of 0 2 percent compared to 2 5 percent during the prior period 1 to be sure economic growth for most of the 2000s was considerably higher though still lower than in other developing country groups but that was primarily the result of the commodity price boom and remittances from latin americans living in the united states the set of reforms adopted in the late 1980s and early 1990s including the lowering of tariff barriers reduction of public subsidies elimination of price controls and freeing of interest rates the so called washington consensus led to the de industrialization of latin american economies the share of manufacturing as a percentage of gdp declined from 27 percent in 1980 to 17 9 percent in 2009 which puts it roughly at the same level as the eurozone 18 1 percent and substantially below developing east asia and pacific 31 4 percent 2 south american countries reverted to comparative advantages in natural resources with a few new ones like natural gas and soybeans added to the old ones like copper and iron ore central american countries and to some extent mexico developed specializations in low skill labor intensive assembly based production facilitated by privileged access to the u s market through special provisions of the u s tariff schedule and broad tariff free access through the caribbean basin initiative and in the case of mexico the north american free trade agreement nafta at the same time other developing countries performed much better over the last 25 years most importantly china both in terms of economic growth and the development of comparative advantages in more technology intensive activities with an investment ratio double that of latin america and a strategy of controlled market liberalization deliberate expansion of technological capabilities and strategic incorporation of foreign investors china has become competitive in both technology intensive and labor intensive products given the difference in technological capabilities between china and latin america the region s bilateral trade deficit with china skyrocketed from 863 million in 2000 to 32 billion in 2009 only brazil chile and peru had a significant trade surplus with china in 2009 based on their exports of iron ore copper and soybeans industrial policies under import substitution all carrots no sticks the industrial policies of the isi period have been maligned by the proponents of neoliberalism but it is important to distinguish the economic and development logic of the strategy from the detrimental ways some of the policies were carried out industrial policies under isi were based on the acceptance of three central premises 1 what a country exports matters for productivity and economic growth 2 technological learning takes time and is cumulative and 3 the accumulation of broad based technological capabilities requires proactive government policies and the development of human resources particularly through education under isi upgrading production meant creating policies and an environment that would foster industrial activities industrial production promises longer term development benefits than natural resource extraction and primary production it offers greater potential for technological learning and spillover effects into other areas of the economy for increasing returns and higher value added production and manufactured products enjoy higher income elasticities of demand in international markets tariffs and non tariff barriers were expected to provide the space needed for local producers to learn by doing and to develop the needed capabilities to become internationally competitive governments adopted policies that supported the development of capacities across different sectors horizontal policies as well as policies that channeled resources to specific sectors that were thought to have large potential spillover effects vertical policies at the same time government investment in human capital in higher education and vocational training increased considerably and there were incipient efforts to promote science and technology development banks provided long term financing for local investors and to ensure that foreign investment would generate backward linkages and spillovers in technology larger countries like brazil and mexico adopted technology transfer requirements and stipulated that foreign investors had to buy a certain percentage of inputs domestically domestic content requirements it is well known where industrial policies under isi went awry in latin america the asian tiger governments combined public support to companies with performance requirements which often meant that firms had to export a growing share of their output during the learning process latin american governments provided only the carrots without the sticks they did not use disciplining mechanisms to ensure that firms would turn public support to help them learn to become internationally competitive the public coddling created widespread inefficiencies some east asian governments formed deliberative committees to bring companies together with public officials to explore possible new comparative advantages in latin america by contrast there was little consultation between governments and the private sector the lack of serious coordination produced many projects with no foreseeable comparative advantage at the same time though the state initiated the production of strategic intermediate goods e g steel in brazil that the private sector would have avoided given the large initial capital layouts and long gestation periods endnotes 1 the data are based on palma

by david haggith first a decline in manufacturing and then a slump in service industries now a broad spectrum inversion of the yield curve hitting its most critical metric this week unemployment finally starting to rise again a one year relentless housing decline across most of the nation and the world carmageddon pressing car dealers to offer big incentives once again just to hold sales flat shipping everywhere sinking rapidly broadly deteriorating general business conditions plus tariff troubles for the us throughout the world all of these economic stresses have gotten remarkably worst in just the past month at the same time the stock market has soared back up to its three time ceiling now four time and managed to clear microscopically above that level apparently the last recession was such a great recession the stock market believes more of the same would be the best thing that could happen and why not the last recession made 10 of the us richer and 1 fabulously richer investors it would appear couldn t be more delighted to see so many forces pushing the entire global economy us now fully included back into recession for another go at the best of times for the one percent crowd with their best interests in mind let s take a closer look at all that is happening on that downhill run to recession all the things that give investors sugar plum dreams at night about the fed being forced to inject more monetary narcotics into the market let me lay out all the recent hopeful signs that the economy is crashing just in time to force the fed s first interest rate cut after a couple of years of rising rates that cut of coke that the market is now demanding 1 factory orders manufacturing are in repetitious months of decline in may factory orders fell 0 7 month on month which is the third decline in four months april s decline was revised lower to 1 2 within those figures sales of transportation equipment plunged 4 6 transportation being particularly indicative of where the overall economy is going a look at the actual trend line makes the meaning of these drops much more apparent after months of decline the ism shows no signs of a bottom forming here s another view we are now the closest we ve been to actual economic contraction since the great recession up to now all talk has been about slowing growth now we are on the cusp of actual contraction which means the same thing as recession if it lasts six months or more what is seen for manufacturing in the reports above is consistent with recent results from the dallas fed manufacturing survey which crashed below the worst analysts estimates in june things don t look any better in the empire state manufacturing survey both are back in their contraction zones 2 services sector finally joins the fall many who have been seeing this decline play out over months in the manufacturing sector have been hoping that the services sector will save the day services have been holding up much better than manufacturing so perhaps that sector of industry would carry the economy over this slump however as you can see in the graph below services are no long doing much better anything below the 50 line represents economic contraction though serviced did see a minor uptick in june it was barely visible and still leaves the service sector very near the 50 line this keeps them just about at a three year low hardly encouraging given the massive business tax cuts in the us over the last year and a half that were accompanied with massively increased government spending at the same time employment in the services industry dropped by its most in sixteen months so all that boost is creating now apparent lift at all an improvement in service sector growth provides little cause for cheer as the survey data still indicate a sharp slowing in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter a major change since the first quarter has been a broadening out of the slowdown beyond manufacturing with the service sector growth now also reporting much weaker business activity and orders trends than earlier in the year hiring was hit as firms scaled back their expansion plans in the face of weaker than expected order inflows and gloomier prospects for the year ahead jobs growth was the weakest for over two years and future expectations across both services and manufacturing has slipped to the lowest seen since comparable data were first available in 2012 ihs markit the services sector employs more than 80 of all american workers but hey that s good for fed addicts right with momentum clearly fading it won t be long before the fed begins cutting interest rates said senior u s economist michael pearce of capital economics marketwatch yay let s all join in hoping the economy crashes spectacularly so stocks can benefit all over again from years of more free fed funds than they ve ever seen before the one percenters are already stocking champagne for that day when great recession 2 0 is finally announced 3 the yield curve just inverted at its most critical level the bond market flashed yet another warning signal for investors on wednesday that a downturn for the economy may be coming despite the s p 500 hitting new all time highs the yield on 30 year u s treasury bonds briefly dipped below the overnight fed funds rate a signal that has preceded the past five u s recessions yahoo finance economists have known for quite some time that yield curve inversions tend to be reliable predictors of business contractions recessions st louis fed 4 unemployment has begun to rise at last the first upticks in unemployment typically are one of the last events to happen before a recession begins so renewed hope for the one percent is not far off while the number of job layoffs remains near a half century low initial jobless claims have started to rise the four week monthly average of claims considered the more stable report has also begun to rise albeit incrementally the pace of hiring has dropped but the pace of firing has not yet risen with the unemployment rate at a nearly 50 year low of 3 6 good help is hard to find and companies are reluctant to let go of workers the economy would have to stumble badly to get firms to start handing out pink slips en masse marketwatch whenever unemployment has settled this low an uptick in joblessness soon begins and recession always begins shortly thereafter st louis fed historically a trough in the unemployment rate also tends to be a reliable predictor of a business recession st louis fed well good then the trough is already forming and it doesn t have to form for more than 2 3 months before recession is here that uptick in job losses is particularly notable now in the bellwether small business sector where falling jobs haven t looked this bad since the great recession adp s worst plunge in jobs in this sector since 2010 the small business sector leads the cycle and employment here has plunged 61k in the past two months haven t seen this in over 9 years same decline we saw in feb march of 2008 when the consensus was busy calling for a soft landing this isn t a repeat of 2016 by any

a good unprofitable company right now like only one time before the last time it paid this well to be unprofitable was at the change of the millennium moments before everyone s 401k got wiped out in a big stock market bust is it any wonder unprofitable companies are coming on like gangbusters when we still have a stock market that falls because of relatively good news about a temporary reprieve in the decline of the job market the market has no interest in a good economy because the junky bulls crave only their next hit of fed meds if the fed doesn t deliver the dope later this month watch out below on the other hand the dot com bust tells us the first part of these recessions isn t even good for stock investors but it is the extremely long recovery period after the fall the has them all salivating that and the fact that they think they can somehow slide right over the recession part and just go straight into recovery mode good luck with that 6 housing continues its relentless decline speaking of another whacky ipo bubble we also have another whacky housing bubble the best of both of the last excellent recessions at the same time this has to have the one percenters salivating with

the reality of a housing decline across the us just take a look at construction spending on a nationwide basis since i announced a year ago the housing decline had begun as the first i know of to do so i see a slump there i don t know why some can t if the housing market were growing contractors would be spending money the last time we saw a drop this long in residential construction was during the housing collapse that gave us the great recession the housing collapse has spread throughout the global economy right now too the global housing market is showing cracks those fissures could spread throughout the world wide economy potentially sending world wide gross domestic product or gdp to its lowest annual pace of in 10 years according to research from oxford economics a combined

with predicting several recessions over the past 40 years thinks the u s is in a relatively mild slump i think we re probably already in a recession shilling points to declining industrial production feeble job growth the federal reserve bank of new york s recession probability chart the organization for economic co operation and development s leading economic indicators weak housing data usa today no wonder american sentiment is turning sour i don t put any stock in sentiment as being much of a predictor or driver of where the economy is going because i think it is more of a following trend as such however it is still useful for seeing how many people are now agreeing with my start of the year proposition of a summer recession especially since so few agreed back when i made it according to bankrate com 40 of americas now believe a recession will begin in less than a year with half of those believing it has already begun rising stock market notwithstanding the experts of course believe a recession is at least 1 2 years away of course few if any experts saw the last recession coming even when it had already begun so if you re going to await the phd experts you re not going to know we re in a recession until it s over you ll feel it but you won t know it all that remains to happen now to give the one percenters an instant replay of the glorious great recession is for the fed to make its first interest rate cut because each of the last two huge recessions with their attending stock market crashes began right after the fed made its first rate cut cut following a period of rate increases so permabulls keep hoping the fed makes its first move in july and you may get all the free drugs you are hoping for but if you think you are going to skip over the painful recession part where stocks lose big it hasn t ever work that way so good luck with that and don t be a baby about it when the pain comes because you asked for it no pain no gain in the world of free

zimbabwe should not expect any further major policy shockers following the re introduction of the zimbabwe dollar with the focus now shifting towards growing the economy and creating jobs according to finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube in an exclusive interview with business weekly on wednesday mthuli said that he was happy that the government moved quite fast on major currency reforms as any delays would have prolonged market volatility and uncertainty as from june 24 2019 the government declared the rtgs dollar zimdollar the sole legal tender effectively abandoning multi currency regime which zimbabwe adopted in 2009 when hyperinflation rendered the zimbabwean currency worthless the rtgs dollar was introduced in february as part of ongoing currency reforms which began in october last year following the separation of fca nostro and rtgs accounts the next step was abolishment of 1 1 fixed exchange rate after the reserve bank of zimbabwe introduced the interbank market last week the government finally announced that the united states dollar alongside the south african rand botswana pula and other foreign currencies were no longer legal tender in zimbabwe the move also averted the country from plunging into full re dollarisation when the economy did not have enough us dollars to support this the continued depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar had seen most business preferring to quote prices in us dollars in a country were the majority are paid rtgs dollars mthuli said the currency reforms were essentially over and the only small thing left was introducing proper bank notes to replace the existing bonds notes and coins we have made tremendous progress in the currency reforms agenda which started on the first of october after separation of the fcas and that was followed with the review of the fuel prices in january and the third step was the monetary policy review on the 28th of february which introduced the interbank market when we then moved from one to one fixed exchange rate said mthuli we have now introduced the domestic currency zimbabwe dollar and disallowed the used of other currencies within our border even though you can hang on to the us dollars in your pocket in your bank account in the shops you have to use the local zim dollar which at the moment is defined as a combination of the bond notes and the rtgs dollars of course we had to move quite fast to complete the project of current reforms because any delay causes volatility and uncertainty for now there is sanity in the parallel market we have had to institute other measures such as raising interest rates to deal with speculative attacks on the currency and also to deal with the inflation the pain was inevitable but in my view we should not see any kind of big policy changes on the macro economic front going forward i think it is fair to say this was the biggest policy change going forward in terms of macro policies it is consolidation then we can put this behind us and then focus on growth jobs and broader development because we are done with these broader macro reforms we want to put these behind us added mthuli the treasury chief said the sharp hike of the central bank s accommodation rate from 15 percent to 50 percent per annum was meant to discourage borrowing for purposes of speculative currency trading in addition the finance minister said the reserve bank of zimbabwe can now effectively defend the value of the local currency with a domestic currency in place as sole legal tender since it will now have the full kit of monetary policy instruments at its disposal government through the reserve bank has also indicated that it will provide us 330 million worth of letters of credit to support efficient functioning of the interbank market and reduce further pressure on demand for forex on the black market further the government last week removed administrative limits on bureaux de change and the 2 5 percent maximum profit margin on forex trading by banks as part of further measures to promote a free floating interbank foreign currency system price volatility induced by pass through effects of parallel market foreign exchange rate premiums on prices saw inflation keeping a northward trajectory hitting 97 85 percent for april prompting government workers to demand us dollar salaries as more retailers sold in forex the currency reforms form part of major economic reforms minister ncube targeted under government s transitional stabilisation programme tsp which included reining in runaway government expenditure budget and current account deficits following the adoption of a mono domestic currency for local transactions parallel and official exchange rates have since converged as per authorities expectations a development likely to result in increased flow of foreign currency into formal systems business weekly
we are living in precarious times and if you haven t prepared for an economic collapse yet it is time to start taking action despite what some experts would like you to believe the us is on shaky financial ground several indicators suggest things are far worse than many think let s take a look at them now more than half of families in the us live in asset poverty a recent study found that more than 63 percent of american children and 55 percent of americans live in asset poverty this means they have few or no assets to rely on in the event of a financial emergency such as a job loss a medical crisis recessions or natural disasters in a press release study co author david rothwell an assistant professor in osu s college of public health and human sciences explained that when families lack assets such as vehicles homes savings accounts or investments surviving a financial crisis is very difficult this is a dimension of financial security that we don t think about that much and it s pretty high the findings highlight the extent of financial insecurity among american families these shocks ripple through the family and down to the children rothwell said prepperu2019s long ter jim cobb best price 7 99 buy new 8 95 as of 05 50 utc details the study was published in the journal children and youth services review earlier this year co authors are timothy ottusch of the university of arizona and jennifer finders of purdue university living in poverty can have devastating impacts on children as the press release explains rothwell studies poverty and its impact on families and children experiencing poverty in childhood can have lifetime impacts for those children past research has shown that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to struggle in school have lower job earnings throughout life and experience family instability as adults a growing body of research suggests that parents asset levels also predict academic achievement educational expectations and the likelihood of college enrollment and graduation families with assets that can be used when income is disrupted are also likely to experience less financial stress and strain yet asset poverty is higher than income poverty for children and families in a 2018 study of canadian families researchers including rothwell found that asset poverty was two to three times more prevalent than income poverty families can have adequate day to day funds but be asset poor and would likely struggle during a financial shock source rent is becoming unaffordable for many americans according to the national low income housing coalition renting is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many americans in its latest out of reach report the organization explains that the struggle to find affordable housing is not limited to those earning minimum wage or the unemployed the report s central statistic is the housing wage which is an estimate of the hourly wage a full time worker must earn to rent a home without spending more than 30 percent of income on housing costs for 2019 the housing wage is 22 96 and 18 65 for a modest two and one bedroom apartment respectively based on the fair market rent the average renter s hourly wage is 1 08 less than the housing wage for a one bedroom rental and 5 39 less than a two bedroom rental that means that an average renter in the u s has to work a 52 hour week to put this in perspective a median wage worker in eight of the country s largest ten occupations does not earn enough to afford a one bedroom apartment an employee earning the federal minimum wage 7 25 per hour would have to work 127 hours every week equivalent to more than two full time jobs to afford a two bedroom apartment this is not just a regional issue there isn t a single state metro area or county in the u s where a full time employee earning the minimum wage can afford to rent a two bedroom property to explore data for your area enter your zip code in the box below the map on this page out of reach 2019 according to the report the ten jobs that are expected to see the biggest growth over the coming decade are those that pay less than the wage needed to afford housing and that is likely to result in an even greater disparity between wages and housing costs by 2026 as this infographic from statista illustrates food is about to become more expensive massive damaging floods in the midwest have been occurring since this past march to make a bad situation worse the potential for more floods in key agricultural states looms in front of us as more rain is predicted for the rest of this spring so far heavy flooding has impacted important agricultural states including nebraska iowa illinois and missouri the economic impacts of the flooding are likely to be devastating as cat ellis explained in midwest flooding will cause shortages of these foods bottom line our modern food supply is largely dependent upon grains and soy with major producers losing at least one harvest this year the cost of manufactured food and livestock feed will skyrocket meat and dairy will be doubly impacted while many farms lost animals to floodwaters and farmers lost money due to both lost animals and damage to property the cost to feed those remaining animals is going to go through the roof add to this livestock disease and tariffs and trade war with both mexico and china the two countries from whom we import the most food both consumers and farmers are in deep financial trouble whatever your situation is start thinking about what you eat and how to store those items ellis wrote here s how to get started building that stockpile americans are losing purchasing power purchasing power is the value of a currency expressed in terms of the amount of goods or services that one unit of money can buy in other words it is how much your money buys you purchasing power is important because all else being equal inflation decreases the amount of goods or services you are able to purchase inflation reduces the value of a currency s purchasing power in the article america s concealed crisis fifty years of economic decline 1969 to 2019 charles hugh smith explains how the loss of purchasing power has pushed the middle class into the working class the keys to understanding the concealed crisis of decline are purchasing power relative to wages earnings how many goods and services can wages buy for the average american household wages have risen modestly while the purchasing power of those wages has plummeted furthermore the quality of goods and services has in many cases declined sharply so that even if prices have dropped what you get for your money has fallen even further effectively reducing the purchasing power of your wages source smith also discusses how planned obsolescence impacts purchasing power case in point appliances were once designed and built to last a generation or longer refrigerators washers and dryers lasted for decades now the average appliance fails within a few years and the electronic board costing roughly a third of the entire appliance price fails and must be replaced with labor the cost of the repair is so high consumers often send the almost new appliance to the landfill and buy a new and soon to fail appliance net net low quality reduces purchasing power even if price has declined source although our income is higher than it was 40 years ago we can t buy much with it smith says bottom line how much housing higher education and well being does the average wage buy now compared to decades past not much the statistics are bleak wages are basically unchanged from the high water mark 50 years ago which coincidentally was also the high water mark of u s energy production until very recently adjusted for purchasing power and quality the average paycheck buys far less than it did 50 years ago source evidence that the economy has already entered a downturn is mounting a few days ago michael snyder summed up some of the signs the us economy is starting to deteriorate rapidly in the article the pain of this new economic downturn is starting to show up all over the country on tuesday we got some more new numbers and they were just as bad as we thought they might be but even before today s numbers all of the data were telling us the exact same thing the new york fed s empire state manufacturing index just suffered the worst one month decline in u s history morgan stanley s business conditions index just suffered the largest one month decline that we have ever seen global trade numbers are the worst they have been since the last recession and just last week i detailed the complete and utter bloodbath that we are witnessing in the u s trucking industry right now so considering what we already knew it shouldn t have been a surprise that new home sales in the u s were down a whopping 7 8 percent during the month of may source in addition an economic indicator that has preceded every recession over the past five decades occurred a few days ago reports npr it is known among economists and wall street traders as a yield curve inversion and it refers to when long term interest rates are paying out less than short term rates that curve has been flattening out and sloping down for more than a year raising worries among some analysts that investors long term view of the market is not positive and that an economic downturn is looming but on sunday an inauspicious milestone was achieved the yield curve remained inverted for three months or an entire quarter which has for half a century been a clear signal that the economy is heading for recession in the next nine to 18 months according to campbell harvey a duke university finance professor who spoke to npr on sunday his research in the mid 1980s first linked yield curve inversions to recessions that has been associated with predicting a recession for the last seven recessions harvey said from the 1960s this indicator has been reliable in terms of foretelling a recession and also importantly it has not given any false signals yet source the economy has not recovered much since the 2008 recession many refer to stock market valuation and the official unemployment rate as indicators of an improving economy but the truth is that they paint a deceiving picture of the true state of the american economy as economist antony p mueller outlines in phony economic growth stats conceal deep problems on main street alternative calculations of the employment data which include long term discouraged workers and chronically unemployed indicate that the labor market is much slacker than the official statistics indicate profits recovered in the first few years after the crisis of 2008 but over the past five years they have been flat stock prices in turn as measured by the s p 500 index have risen by over 50 percent since 2012 the recovery after the crisis of 2008 was brought about by the stimulus packages and later on by the monetary policy of quantitative easing the expansion that followed does not constitute genuine economic growth while the financial asset markets indicate wealth creation the economy s productive capacity tends to remain weak over the past ten years the congressional budget office had to lower its estimate of potential output year by year and productivity growth has stayed below the trend of the time before the crisis of 2008 source in the conclusion of that piece dr mueller states policymakers ignore the main lesson of the crisis of 2008 that monetary and fiscal stimulus policies do not bring about a solid recovery but manufacture a phony economic growth that distorts the economy s structure of production instead of a v shaped recovery that would occur if government abstained from intervention policymakers produce an l shaped agony as if a prolonged stagnation wasn t already bad enough the interventionists also act as the undertakers of capitalism policy intervention distorts the economy and drives a wedge between wall street and main street the majority of the people do not attribute the discrepancy between the growth of financial wealth and the stagnation of the real economy to the policy of the authorities but accuses capitalism of this evil source here s what you can do to prepare for a financial crisis the

the united states is the wealthiest nation on the face of the earth the country has the highest level of gdp and the overall political stability has caused the us dollar to be the worldâ s reserve currency the primary attribute of a reserve currency is stability and value while only the full faith and credit of the us government that issues legal stand stands behind the greenback it is the foreign exchange instrument of choice for central banks monetary authorities and government around the globe when it comes to foreign exchange reserves and holdings the position as the leading reserve currency makes the us dollar the benchmark pricing mechanism for most commodities which are global assets therefore the direction of the us dollar is often a leading factor when it comes to price strength or weakness in the raw materials asset class the dollar index has been making higher lows and higher highs since february 2018 when the index found a bottom at 88 15 the most recent peak came in may 2019 at 98 26 as interest rate differentials between the dollar and the euro and yen two other reserve currencies remained at over the 2 25 level aside from being the wealthiest nation in the world short term rates mean that dollar holdings pay an attractive yield while euro and yen rates remain in negative territory and involve a cost when it comes to holding the two other currency instruments interest rate differentials are one of the primary factors when it comes to the value of one currency versus another the dollar index fell following the most recent fomc meeting where the central bank told markets that the fed funds rate could be dropping over the coming months however during the first week of july the dollar rebounded the invesco db us dollar index bullish fund nysearca uup and its bearish counterpart udn do an excellent job replicating the price volatility in the dollar index the most recent price action at the start of july could mean that the market is having second thoughts when it comes to a more dovish approach to monetary policy by the us central bank the dollar dropped after the june fed meeting the fedâ s guidance that the fed funds rate would fall over the second half of 2019 drove the dollar index lower in the aftermath of the june meeting source cqg as the chart of the now active month september dollar index futures contract highlights the index fell from 97 265 on june 18 to a low at 95 365 on june 25 a decline of 1 95 as june futures rolled to september open interest which is the total number of open long and short positions in the dollar index futures contract declined from 62 335 on june 14 to 42 576 contracts on july 3 or over 31 6 a decline in open interest while the price of a futures contract is dropping is typically not a technical validation of an emerging bearish trend but the move in the metric came during the roll period which reflects the roll rather than the price action in the dollar index at the same time the decline in the index pushed it into oversold territory on the daily chart stability is the most significant issue in currency markets and as the dollar is the leading reserve currency in the world volatility tends to be at a minimum governments around the world that manage the currency markets likely found that the move in the dollar index was overdone during the first week of july the dollar index moved back towards the 97 level aside from the move to oversold territory two events at the end of q2 could have contributed to the rebound of the dollar index at the start of q3 de escalation with china on the trade front is welcome news the long awaited trade summit between presidents trump and xi at the g20 meeting on june 29 did not result in any significant breakthrough that ended the dispute however the leaders agreed to a moratorium on any new protectionist measures president trump pledged to not slap china with new tariffs on 300 billion of chinese exports to the us and president xi agreed to purchase agricultural products from the us over the coming months at the same time both leaders agreed to restart negotiations which injected some optimism into the market and likely lifted the value of the us dollar at the same time president trump traveled to korea from the g20 meeting and had an impromptu and highly symbolic meeting with north korean leader kim jong un at the dmz that divides the two koreas on june 30 even if the unprecedented meeting where president trump briefly stepped onto north korean soil was a bit of a publicity stunt the symbolism and potential for peace in the region with the us in a leadership role could have contributed to buying in the dollar on the first trading day of july some market participants may have had some second thoughts about the fedâ s promise to cut interest rates given the potential for optimism to return to markets when it comes to trade and peace on the korean peninsula the dollar index rises as employment data shed doubts on a rate cut after making a series of new highs since february 2018 the dollar index could now settle into a trading band over the summer months below the highs and at or just marginally under the july 25 low as the summer months are a time for vacations and european markets typically shut down during august volatility could decline in the currency markets the first test for the dollar index will come at the july fed meeting at the end of this month a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate would likely send the dollar index back towards its recent low or a marginal new low but the market now expects a rate cut the only surprise would be if the data driven fed decided to cut the short term rate by 50 basis points at their july meeting which is highly unlikely in the current environment on the other hand if the fed does not cut rates at the july meeting we could see the dollar index rise perhaps to the may peak at 98 26 the employment data last friday which surpassed market expectations shed additional doubt on if the fed will move the short term rate at its upcoming meeting meanwhile the summer months tend to be a quiet time in currency markets which could mean that the dollar index will settle into a narrow range barring any significant surprises on the global economic or political landscapes commodities stall on the rebound in the greenback on the first day of trading in q3 the september dollar index futures contract rose by 0 645 points which was a 0 67 gain compared to the closing level on june 28 the stronger dollar sent the prices of some dollar sensitive commodities lower on monday july 1 on friday july 5 the employment sent the dollar index even higher the price of gold which had been climbing since the fed meeting suffered its first significant correction since it broke out above the 2016 highs in june source cqg as the daily chart of august gold futures shows the yellow metal settled at 1412 50 on june 28 and moved to a low at 1384 70 on july 1 27 80 or almost 2 lower however the price bounced back over the 1440 level on july 3 only to move back to 1400 last friday on the back of the latest us employment data source cqg copper the red metal that is a barometer of global economic health put in a bearish reversal on the daily chart on the first trading day of q3 as the price dropped below the 2 70 per pound level while gold moved higher on july 2 and 3 and the dollar index was a bit lower on those sessions copper continues to decline fridayâ s price action in the greenback and yellow metal told us that copper saw what was coming copper and gold are two commodities that are highly sensitive to the us dollar and interest rates however the trade dispute continues to weigh on the price of copper as china is the worldâ s leading consumer of the nonferrous metal while both sides agreed to negotiate no agreement appears to be on the horizon anytime soon in the wake of the g20 meeting when it comes to gold the environment of uncertainty is likely to provide support for the yellow metal which underwent a significant technical breakout in q2 a summer range uup and udn to trade the ups and downs in the dollar index i do not expect all that much action in the currency markets over the summer of 2019 however we could see the dollar index swing higher and lower within its current trading range therefore buying dips when the greenback looks awful and selling rallies when it appears to be heading to a new and higher high could be the best approach when it comes to the worldâ s reserve currency the most direct route to long and short positions in the dollar index is via the highly liquid over the counter foreign exchange market or the dollar index futures on the intercontinental exchange for those who do not venture into either of those two arenas the invesco db us dollar index bullish fund uup and its bearish counterpart udn replicate the price action in the dollar index the most recent top holdings in uup include source yahoo finance since the uup holds futures contracts in the dollar index it follows the futures market higher and lower the dollar index rallied from a low at 95 365 on june 25 to its most recent peak at 97 040 on july 5 a move of 1 76 source barchart over the same period uup moved from 25 89 to 26 33 per share or 1 7 higher uup has net assets of 321 94 million and trades an average of 593 280 shares each day uup charges an expense ratio of 0 75 the dollar index declined from 97 265 on june 18 to a low at 95 365 on june 25 or 1 95 udn is the bearish product when it comes to the us dollar index source barchart over the same period udn rose from 20 54 to 21 03 or 2 39 udn has net assets of 37 69 million and trades an average of 33 777 shares each day like uup it charges an expense ratio of 0 75 the dollar bounced higher in the aftermath of the g20 meeting and president trumpâ s historic steps into north korea last weekend the market likely had second thoughts about the fedâ s message that they will cut rates over the coming months which caused a bounce in the dollar index on the first week of q3 however we are now in the heart of the summer season and i do not expect much action in the currency markets uup and udn could be valuable tools to trade the range in the dollar index during july and august

how big will the punch bowl be this time around financial markets are convinced the fed is set to commence on an easing cycle this summer but if we see fed fund futures price in only two rate cuts this year us stocks will struggle to make fresh highs and the highly anticipated dollar reversal may not come to fruition friday s blockbuster us non farm payroll report tentatively derailed stock and equity bullish plans the needle was moved from a slight lean towards 3 rate cuts to two cuts the dollar s broad gains accompanied a surge with us treasury yields and a pullback in stocks the focus will now shift to incremental updates on the trade front and a plethora of fed speak and the minutes to last month s decision us inflation data will be released but other indications do not point for a significant surprise rise the release of china s trade figures will show how resilient their economy was during the tensest moments in the trade war with the pboc waiting to stimulate their economy we could see dismal data support earlier action regarding trade we will need to see meaningful updates or scheduled trips to dc or beijing to support optimism that both sides are closing the gap a wrath of fed speak will see investors search for clues if the fed waiver on its signal for a july rate cut powell testifies on semiannual monetary policy report trade war impact on chinese trade and inflation data german industrial production could fuel contraction bets euro stimulus bets from the ecb may grow if we continue to see a trend of softer than expected data out of germany the brewing trade war between the us and europe will likely to continue to weigh on car manufacturers with germany bearing the brunt of the troubles industrial production on a monthly basis is expected to rebound but following a very disappointing factory orders reading we should not be surprised if the german data comes in softer if we see lagarde become the ecb chief we could see fiscal stimulus expectations rise which should be very positive for both growth and the euro draghi s ecb has stated they are in no rush to deliver a rate cut this month but if the data continues to show significant slowdowns a 20 basis point cut could happen this month cad the bank of canada boc is widely expected to keep rates steady with only one economist calling for a 25 basis point cut monetary policy is expected to remain on hold for the rest of the year as the recent data has been surprisingly better than expected not counting friday s cool labor market number employment has been on a tear with the first half being the best start since 2002 oil the crude selloff that stemmed from global slowdown concerns appears to be fully priced in west texas intermediate crude may find key support from the mid 50 barrel area oil got a boost on an improving outlook for demand on a surprising robust us nonfarm payroll report fresh stimulus bets are still strong for the fed to deliver a rate cut at the end of july and for the other big three banks the pboc ecb and boj to remain active in delivering additional stimulus if we do see us and china come through with scheduling face to face talks we could see markets again to price in further optimism we could see a deal done this year global demand would get a reprieve if china and us could finalize a trade deal geopolitical risks are also keeping a bid in place for oil as iran continues to increase their nuclear activities up until now most of europe has been trying to negotiate with tehran but if iran continues to with their nuclear agenda we could see deeper international sanctions that could completely cripple iran s economy gold gold lost some of its mojo after a robust nonfarm payroll report eased up dovish bets on the fed the overall outlook for bullion is still looking bright as gold etf inflows appears insuppressible robust demand for the yellow metal will continue to be supported on the backdrop of expectations of fresh stimulus to be

survey to pay attention to the trend not the month to month change which always comes with a huge margin of error the decline from may was too small on its own to say anything more than employment had plateaued at a high level the jobless rate was the second lowest recorded in the data set that goes back to 1976 so that s hardly a sign of weakness statcan s measure of the trend in hiring based on a calculation of the current month and the previous six months increased by almost 22 000 positions in june earlier this year when headline employment increased by an incredible 106 500 positions the trend reading rose by only 34 800 the economy is rarely as strong or as weak as the headlines and tweets on jobs day suggest canada s economy is essentially at full employment a situation where most people who want a job can get one the jobless rate rose because statcan counted more new people in the labour force than newly employed workers many economists interpret a growing workforce as a sign

by the australians americans and europeans but that would require a significant shift in domestic conditions the best information in the labour force survey is below the headlines the boc watches more

part 33 his vice president was everything ronald reagan was not the hollywood actor in chief had far less political qualification on paper than his 1980 republican primary opponent george h w bush though reagan oozed optimism and soothed the american people with his confident digestible rhetoric he was certainly no policy expert or washington insider bush was both he was a man born of privilege scion of a prestigious wealthy family and son of a republican u s senator from connecticut prescott bush however the mid 20th century was different from our own time it was an era when affluence and social standing didn t obviate a sense of duty to country and family honor bush like so many thousands of the other members of the american aristocracy volunteered for the u s military in response to the japanese attack on pearl harbor not yet 19 he would become the youngest pilot in the u s navy at that time eventually flying dozens of combat missions in the pacific theater in september 1944 he was involved in an action that won him the distinguished flying cross in the words of the citation bush pressed home an attack in the face of intense antiaircraft fire although his plane was hit and set afire at the beginning of his dive he continued his plunge toward the target and succeeded in scoring damaging bomb hits before bailing out of the craft he was the only member of the three man crew to live through the incident afterward survivor s guilt bled through his letters home at war s end bush entered yale after moving to texas and finding wealth and respect in the oil industry he followed his father into politics he won a house seat in the 1960s then lost a race for the u s senate he was unable to shake his eastern establishment image with texas voters try as he might in the 1970s he was appointed ambassador to the united nations director of the central intelligence agency and head of the republican national committee rnc after bush s 1980 defeat in a rather bitter presidential primary battle with reagan in which the texan declared that his opponent a supply side theory advocate was proposing voodoo economics the gipper chose bush as his running mate they stood together at the helm of the executive branch for eight years though bush tended to work behind the scenes overshadowed by reagan s big personality though no doubt a conservative bush harkened back to the yesteryears of northeastern centrist country club republicanism by 1980 and especially by the time of his successful 1988 run for the presidency bush s credentials and tone made him an anachronism in a party vaulting rightward and increasingly in the grip of southern whites and evangelical christians who focused on social and cultural values bush tried to fit into the mold that his political base required but he was always a fish out of water his entire time as vice president and president from 1981 to 1993 was in a sense defined by his battles with the increasingly dominant right wing of his party bush was hardly less conservative for the most part than reagan but the earlier president with his soaring rhetoric charm and usually unfulfilled promises was more successful in holding the republican coalition together bush never really found the knack for it it probably cost him a second term although george h w bush can be viewed as perhaps the last of the relatively centrist republican presidents he was no friend to liberals as president his domestic policies were rather comparable to reagan s and at least on the domestic front he was never much of a bipartisan coalition builder he sought just as his predecessor had to destroy what remained of the liberal consensus as a result the opposition party moved rightward and increasingly conservative new democrats including one bill clinton would emerge and ultimately defeat him he was stronger on foreign policy where he was relatively cautious and methodical in his approach than on domestic policy nonetheless he was an avowed interventionist and threw u s troops into some unnecessary adventures after his death in the second decade of the 21st century he was canonized by nostalgic democrats and republicans alike some dubbed him the best one term president in u s history this was an overstatement undoubtedly but one can understand the sentiment looking back at his presidency from 30 years on bush 41 does appear to be a moderate and decent leader and a gentleman still a close look at the actual substance of his administration complicates this image and deflates many of its myths decent man nasty campaign the election of 1988 bush may have had a high bred pedigree and a gentile image seemingly from an earlier era but he was undoubtedly highly ambitious and willing to practice hard nosed even harsh politics he knew he would have to tack right in the 1988 republican primaries to best his two insurgent opponents sen bob dole of kansas and pat robertson the christian televangelist the race seemed tight at first but bush as reagan s anointed successor won the day at the republican national convention bush sought to balance his personal moderation with the increasingly right wing penchant of his base he delivered an acceptance speech that at times sounded reaganesque though he called for transforming america into a kinder and gentler nation he adhered to reagan s supply side economic dogma which many liberals and others had denounced as an expression of a regressive trickle down practice that benefited only those at the top read my lips no new taxes he bellowed finally to shore up his position with the religious right he named as his running mate the undistinguished at times buffoonish sen dan quayle of indiana a darling of the evangelicals bush s democratic opponent was gov michael dukakis of massachusetts who won the nomination after sen joe biden of delaware caught up in a plagiarism scandal and sen gary hart caught up in an infidelity scandal dropped out of the contest dukakis was a proud technocrat and a forerunner of the new democrats more centrist than their forebears but was both uninspiring and still far too traditionally liberal to win in a center right country in which the l word had become a pejorative still that was unclear at the time on the heels of the democratic national convention dukakis held an unprecedented 17 point lead in some public opinion polls over bush then the gentleman went on the attack bush held his nose and waded deep into the rancorous culture wars less than a decade earlier bush had held far more liberal views on abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment for women but by the 1988 campaign he had jettisoned those liabilities and unapologetically flip flopped on both issues he hired some of the most ruthless campaign consultants available notably lee atwater and roger ailes the latter a future fox news media mogul before the first debate with dukakis ailes gave bush some vicious advice as governor dukakis had supported the repeal of state laws against sodomy and bestiality ailes whispered in bush s ear if you get in trouble out there just call him an animal fucker after holding a focus group with swing voters in new jersey atwater and company flooded the market with attack ads that implied dukakis was somehow un american americans were told that the governor had vetoed a law requiring teachers to lead their class in the pledge of allegiance a genuine first amendment issue once called himself a card carrying member of the aclu a free speech matter itself opposed the death penalty as had most 1960s 70s liberals and most voters in the western world except americans and finally had overseen a program that gave a weekend furlough to a convict willie horton who failed to return and then raped and stabbed a maryland woman atwater was in his own words determined to strip the bark off the little bastard dukakis the willie horton scandal hurt dukakis the most the bush campaign conveniently ignored the fact that many states had similar furlough laws that dukakis republican predecessor had signed massachusetts legislation into law and that reagan when he was california governor in the 1960s had overseen a similar program this was a time for political war not nuance the most disturbing controversial but effective tv ad run by bush supporters lingered on a close up photo of horton an intimidating looking black man in what was obviously a race based message to voters bush was uncomfortable with the ad though his more conservative newly evangelical son george w bush thought it useful and it was indeed effective in moving toward atwater s stated goal by the time we re finished they re going to wonder whether willie horton is dukakis running mate the final nail in the democrat s coffin came when he refused during a televised debate to support the death penalty even in a hypothetical case in which his own wife had been raped and murdered it was an admirable stand one that was ideologically defensible but his intellectual courage won dukakis few votes the opinion polls rapidly shifted and in the end bush won with a slim 53 percent of the popular vote but a commanding 426 111 in the electoral college still americans were disgusted and uninspired with both candidates a paltry 50 1 percent of eligible voters turned out the lowest participation rate since 1924 in other words just over 25 percent of americans actively supported the new president lower turnout of course then as now favored the republicans especially with particularly low participation by the poor and minorities traditionally liberal voters in a country that despite the reagan revolution still counted more registered democrats than republicans when bush entered the presidency in january 1989 he hardly had massive public backing qualified confident and sometimes competent bush and the world ronald reagan had shocked the nation and the world with his stunning turnaround on cold war policy in regard to the soviets he proved his conservative detractors wrong premier mikhail gorbachev was a solid actually monumental partner to his credit bush would mainly continue the reagan relationship with gorbachev and work to bring the cold war to a bloodless and hopefully permanent end from the unexpected fall of the berlin wall to the withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern europe and finally to the eventual disintegration of the soviet union and resultant independence of the various soviet republics bush proceeded with caution competence and restraint the result was more nuclear limitation treaties and a relatively peaceable end to a half century standoff surely the world s most persistent of the 20th century bush even convinced gorbachev to stand aside and allow germany not only to reunite but join nato the catch was as bush was obliged to prudently promise the u s agreed not to trample on the soviet union s grave or expand the inherently anti russian nato alliance any further his successors would blatantly break that gentlemen s agreement and extended nato membership right up to the borders of russia including into the former soviet baltic republics this would prove decisive in the later hardening of tensions between the west and a circumscribed russian federation the result was a veritable cold war 2 0 in central america bush was far less responsible panamanian strongman manuel noriega an alleged cia asset had proved a useful partner so long as left leaning movements held or contested power in nearby guatemala nicaragua and el salvador by bush s term however the socialist sandinistas of nicaragua fell from power and suddenly noriega became a liability his drug trafficking which had previously been overlooked even amid the crack cocaine epidemic in the united states and the killing of a few american troops by noriega s security forces gave bush the justification necessary to invade the tiny country it unfolded like old school imperialism tens of thousands of u s paratroopers dropped on the narrow isthmus in the largest american combat action since vietnam noriega was captured and his diminutive military quickly beaten at the cost of some two dozen american lives it was an utterly unnecessary if popular patriotic display for the u s a display that killed hundreds of panamanian civilians in the most serious international challenge that bush weathered on aug 2 1990 saddam hussein s formidable iraqi army invaded and quickly conquered its tiny but oil rich neighbor kuwait this proved awkward for uncle sam perhaps half the world s oil flowed through the persian gulf mainly from iraq iran kuwait and saudi arabia iraq s threat to bordering saudi arabia was thus taken seriously bush seemed keen on military intervention from the start but there were problems saddam was fresh off an eight year aggressive war with iran during which the u s had supported him and even provided him vital satellite based intelligence furthermore just days before the invasion the u s ambassador to iraq in an epic gaffe told the iraqis that the u s had no opinion on arab disputes such as your border disagreement with kuwait a comment seen by the iraqis as a u s declaration that it would ignore an invasion of the neighboring country it s understandable then why saddam was soon surprised by the forcefulness of the american and international response without a declaration of war bush quickly dispatched 100 000 troops to protect saudi arabia this would soon alienate islamist veterans of the 1979 89 war with the soviets in afghanistan including osama bin laden who offered to defend saudi arabia against the iraqis and thus prevent an apostate occupation by westerners of islam s two holiest sites those chickens soon came home to roost for washington it seems that bush had decided on war from the first but he waited until after the november 1990 midterm elections before seeking u n and u s senate approval for military action he didn t have to do as much based on earlier troubling precedent but he chose to the u n quickly passed the resolution and bush then sent his effective secretary of state james baker on the road to form a representative international coalition he did so in dramatic and impressive fashion even signing on key arab states such as syria egypt and saudi arabia and thereby lending local muslim legitimacy to american military action it was all over in six weeks one can plausibly argue that bush could have dislodged saddam through means other than outright invasion and had he done so saved tens of thousands of iraqi lives in the minds of most his prolonged turkey shoot air bombardment of fleeing iraqi troops on the highway of death was excessive u s casualties were remarkably light with 148 deaths iraqi fatalities by some estimates would reach up to 35 000 soldiers and 3 000 civilians levels seen as disturbing by much of the world bush was soon horrified by images of the massacres and called an end to the war after just 100 hours while some burgeoning hawks especially neoconservatives thought the u s should seize baghdad and overthrow saddam bush prudently limited american objectives to the expulsion of the iraqi army from kuwait at that point even secretary of defense dick cheney supported bush s restraint though the future vice president would later enthusiastically repudiate this early opinion the bush decision in hindsight undoubtedly represented the prudent course as invading and then occupying sovereign nations historically has proved messy lengthy and bloody nonetheless after the u s military commander norman schwarzkopf hastily and unilaterally agreed to armistice terms that allowed saddam to keep his helicopters in the air bush s position deteriorated publicly when those crafts killed thousands of restive iraqi shiites and kurds groups long repressed by saddam s sunni dominated regime many on the american political right including bush s son the future president soon came to believe that the senior bush should have finished the job and driven to baghdad this lingering feeling and brutal sanctions that would result in some 500 000 iraqi children s deaths would prove to be the crucial tragic outgrowths of an otherwise neat victory in the persian gulf reagan s third term the last gasp of republican centrism frustrated liberals at the time joked that bush s administration was little more than reagan s third term more of the same and an extension of increasingly right wing policies in a sense it was bush initially doubled down on reaganomics and he too appointed a highly controversial and conservative supreme court justice and expressed scant concern for minorities civil rights they weren t part of his electoral base after all on the other hand bush often proved more practical and less enthusiastic about reagan s voodoo economics furthermore on the environment and a few other issues bush was far more liberal or centrist than either his old boss or certainly the party faithful this and his willingness to practically shift course on supply side dogma earned him the permanent animus of many far right and increasingly powerful conservatives it may have cost him the next election bush s postwar popularity as is often the case quickly diminished a serious recession in 1990 91 was persistent and raised unemployment to 7 9 percent by june 1992 the highest rate in a decade large companies such as at t and general motors fired tens if not hundreds of thousands many companies moved their manufacturing overseas into lower cost non unionized areas and it seemed that the japanese were buying up more and more american businesses former massachusetts democratic sen paul tsongas even joked that the cold war is over and japan won of course the recession wasn t solely bush s fault rather it was the expected by many economists fallout from reagan s high deficit low tax high military spending proclivities huge parts of the u s population especially urban blacks and rural whites lived in desperate poverty and overall income inequality had exploded in a genuine attempt to stem the recession bush forever angered betrayed said some of his erstwhile supporters his conservative base both in the populace at large and on capitol hill he increased domestic spending in a decidedly liberal keynesian stimulus package authorized a taxpayer bailout of the crumbing savings and loan industry another reagan era scandal and finally unforgivably to the political right backed out of his campaign pledge of no new taxes raising rates in order to lower deficits and slow the ballooning national debt during reagan s three terms after all the federal debt had jumped to 50 percent of the gross domestic product from 32 percent bush s moves may have been practical perhaps even an absolute necessity but they unleashed a congressional republican rebellion some decided then and there not to back him in the 1992 election house minority whip and future speaker newt gingrich by then a force on the hill walked out of a white house meeting with bipartisan legislative leaders just before bush was to announce a plan designed to avoid an income tax increase bush later chastised gingrich complaining you re killing us you re just killing us on environmental issues bush had some success and like president richard nixon proved willing to cross the aisle when he deemed a bill important enough he would claim accurately that environment issues should know no ideology no political boundaries it s not a liberal or conservative thing we re talking about history has shown that much of congress would not agree with that sentiment bush s support of the cap and trade compromise on greenhouse gas emissions whereby companies had limits on output of such emissions but could trade excesses among themselves turned out to be highly successful this key element of what became the 1990 clean air act lowered acid rain emissions by some 3 million tons in its first year it was a rare genuine bipartisan accomplishment though predictably it alienated dedicated deregulators in the reagan coalition if bush showed only minimal interest in african american or other race based civil rights he did secure the passage of the landmark americans with disabilities act ada undoubtedly the most significant civil rights legislation since the late 1960s which guaranteed various federal protections for over 43 million americans president bush surely considered his appointment of clarence thomas a conservative black judge to replace the esteemed first black justice the liberal thurgood marshall as a civil rights achievement this was debatable in the aggregate thomas moved the court further rightward and paradoxically was a long stated opponent of most federal civil rights legislation additionally the then 43 year old thomas had limited judicial experience having served just over a year on the d c circuit appeals court his one major qualification it seemed was being both an african american nominated for a seat vacated by a black judge and a rare black conservative he was extremely right wing in fact as reagan s head of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc he had ironically opposed affirmative action and other civil rights programs then one day before the senate judiciary committee confirmation vote a leaked fbi interview with law professor and reluctant whistleblower anita hill a 35 year old black former employee of thomas at the eeoc hit the media she listed a litany of examples of thomas longstanding sexual harassment of her during her tenure at the commission the judiciary committee chairman sen joe biden already knew about the charges but had chosen to move forward anyway at least until the fbi report went public biden reluctantly called hill to testify thomas was furious and called the hearings and allegations a high tech lynching for uppity blacks suddenly and ironically bringing race into the picture despite his longstanding opposition to racial protections hill was treated horribly by a room full of male mostly white and middle aged or elderly senators her character was immediately impugned by republican lobbyists and judiciary committee members themselves the hearings quickly shifted to a focus on her character rather than her accusations against thomas in the end even biden let hill down he once asked thomas whether the judge thought hill had made the whole thing up and then decided not to extend the hearings and seek testimony from other women who also allegedly suffered sexual harassment at the hands of thomas it was not the prominent senator s and future vice president s finest moment in the end the senate confirmed thomas by a highly partisan vote of 52 48 the narrowest margin in the history of supreme court nominations the next year los angeles exploded in a fit of racial angst and violence the immediate impetus was the shocking acquittal of four city police officers who had been caught on tape brutally beating a prostrate black suspect with their nightsticks relations between the mostly white police force and black angelenos had long been strained at the height of reagan era prosperity 20 percent of residents of south central los angeles then predominately black remained unemployed rather than persistently address poverty the los angeles mayor ordered police chief daryl gates to cut criminality to improve the city s image during the 1984 olympics thousands were arrested mostly for nonviolent offenses during indiscriminate police sweeps more severe was gates ongoing operation hammer a response to the spreading crack epidemic of the late 1980s the stated purpose of hammer was to make life miserable for gang members but the ultimate outcome was unending police raids that resulted in 20 000 arrests in the second half of the decade the civil violence that sprang up after the acquittal of the four policemen abated only with the arrival of the california national guard and u s marines the riots left 51 mostly blacks killed thousands more injured and 700 million in property damage more persistent and influential was the significant loss of trust in the police by urban blacks and a chasm nationwide between blacks and whites in how they viewed the riots bush may have appointed a black supreme court justice but clearly grievous problems from america s original sin of racial caste and inequality had not disappeared liberalism betrayed bush clinton and the election of 1992 single term presidents are more uncommon than it may seem in the 20th century only william h taft herbert hoover gerald ford who served only part of one term jimmy carter and george h w bush failed to be re elected in the immediate aftermath of the persian gulf war in the spring of 1991 bush s approval rating was through the roof and he looked unbeatable just a year later with the economy lingering in what was really a reagan induced recession and bush s own base frustrated with his tax hike and overall centrism the president s public approval ratings hit a pathetic 35 percent the incumbent faced a rare and serious challenge from the right wing of his own party with reagan communications director and culture warrior patrick buchanan unsuccessfully facing off against the president even after its candidate lost the buchanan wing of the party never fully embraced bush in the 1992 contest and in a speech nominally endorsing bush at the republican national convention buchanan threw gasoline on the fire of cultural conflict sounding very different from the establishment president buchanan declared war on liberals and democrats even implying that they weren t real americans my friends he said this election is about more than who gets what it is about who we are there is a religious war going on in our country it is a cultural war critical to the kind of nation we will one day be though bill clinton bush s opponent in the general election was a neoliberal new democrat far more conservative than almost all the democratic liberals of the past buchanan portrayed him and his wife hillary as radical godless leftists he told an impassioned convention audience the agenda that clinton clinton would impose on america abortion on demand homosexual rights discrimination against religious schools women in combat units is not the kind of change america needs piling on republican national committee chairman richard n bond gave a tv interview in which he claimed of the democrats these other people are not the real america despite these alarmist exaggerated attacks from the right wing base bill clinton refused to play into his opponents hands he would not make the same mistakes those of honesty and principle that dukakis had made four years earlier during the campaign gov clinton even made a show of flying back to arkansas to oversee the execution of a man so mentally impaired that he asked prison guards to save the dessert from his last meal so he could eat it later clinton then permanently alienated civil rights icon jesse jackson when appearing before the rainbow coalition he chose to denounce a rapper named sister souljah who had emotionally asked in the wake of the los angeles riots if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people clinton avoided the obvious nuance and hyperbole in the rapper s remarks and chose in what was forever dubbed his sister souljah moment to use the occasion to distance himself from traditional liberals clinton was a natural politician arguably one of the best in modern american history he knew what won elections kitchen table issues and fiercely counterattacked on the economy he portrayed the privileged bush juxtaposed with his own rise from poverty as out of touch with the daily financial struggles of average americans clinton on the other hand felt their pain or so he claimed the democrat s campaign was a slick public relations machine with laser focus in the campaign s war room a sign on the wall read it s the economy stupid it was indeed clinton would ride to victory on this economic wave aided significantly by the surprisingly potent self financed third party campaign of billionaire ross perot perot hammered bush about the rising deficits and national debt and virulently opposed the president s proposed north american free trade agreement nafta which ironically clinton would later support perot thereby stole deficit hawk republican votes from bush allowing clinton the democrat to oddly run as a beacon of fiscal conservatism the president was cooked clinton took 43 percent of the popular vote to bush s 38 percent with clinton aided further by the 19 percent who fled into perot s arms clinton had no mandate and he knew it his 43 percent portion of the popular vote was the lowest received by a winning presidential candidate since woodrow wilson his election was not a triumph of liberalism but a slick piece of political work almost wholly disjointed from any meaningful ideology so who exactly were the clintons well hillary clinton a lawyer and activist was a favorite target for conservative attack dogs according to buchanan she was a radical feminist she was hardly that hillary rodham began her political life as a strident republican as a youth she canvassed for richard nixon over john kennedy then backed barry goldwater for president in 1964 considering herself a goldwater girl at wellesley college she even served as president of the young republicans eventually however her principled opposition to the vietnam war and growing yet quite moderate feminism drove her to sign on with the democrats indeed hillary clinton would gradually shift rightward during her time as first lady then as u s senator from new york and finally as a two time presidential candidate yet all that lay in the future bill was a 46 year old charmer who had risen to become a youthful unlikely governor of arkansas he has been described as a bridge between the old democrats and the new as a southerner he could appeal to the party s traditional base but as a once progressive well educated professional he could also connect with the identity politics of the new base all the while clinton was as the historian jill lepore astutely labeled him a rascal during the primaries he hung in reports of alleged infidelities and shady real estate transactions came to light he never really admitted to much circumventing questions and equivocating time and again he managed to survive he would ultimately prove to be the ultimate political survivor and squeaked into the highest office in the land in the process he would become the undertaker for progressive hopes and dreams liberalism as americans had known it was dead by 1992 if reagan and bush knocked it down the new democrat clinton drove the fatal stake in its heart this would become ever so apparent during his proceeding two terms george h w bush the 41st president seems in retrospect a transitional figure wedged between the eisenhower republicans of old and the growing influence of neoconservatives and evangelicals who would come to dominate the party not that bush was a martyr or an inclusive bipartisan leader he was not he appointed advisers more ruthless than he and ran rather dirty election campaigns his administration was tarnished by a poor economy in recession though it must be said this was more an outgrowth of reagan and initially bush s dogmatic adherence to trickle down economics bush though far less vicious than his republican successors was no benefactor of the liberal social welfare state nor did he concentrate much on persistent issues of racial and economic inequality ultimately his was merely a kinder gentler perhaps less doctrinaire version of reaganomics on his watch hardly anything substantive was done to slow soaring income inequity as had been the case since the early 1970s the poor generally got poorer and the rich richer bush like john kennedy before him had always preferred and felt most comfortable in foreign affairs after all much of his career had prepared and suited him for global policy even here however bush s term was a mixed bag he waged grenada 2 0 the ludicrously unnecessary invasion of panama and probably killed many more fleeing iraqi troops than was necessary in the persian gulf war then again he carefully and deftly worked with russian premier gorbachev to finish the work he and reagan had begun ushering in an astonishing bloodless end to the cold war that monumental and dangerous affair certainly could have gone another way and though his leadership during the gulf war was uneven he demonstrated presciently prudent restraint limiting u s and coalition goals to the expulsion of the invading iraqi army from kuwait while eschewing a hasty march toward baghdad and regime change his son george w bush would prove far less judicious in 2003 on the surface bush and his opponent in 1992 bill clinton seemed polar opposites one was a war hero the other evaded service in vietnam one was born into wealth the other suffered poverty in tiny hope ark bush was at root an establishment yankee clinton southern born and bred bush was reserved awkwardly professional and at times stiff clinton was smooth played the saxophone and had smoked marijuana though he claimed never to have inhaled still politically clinton was not totally unlike his predecessor neoliberalism a cheap facile imitation of conservatism defined clintonianism the eight years that followed clinton s victory over bush in 1992 proved on a policy scorecard hardly divergent from reagan s three terms the old consensus forged by franklin roosevelt and lyndon johnson was finished defeated decisively in the many battles of the transitional 1980s in the following decades the culture wars divided republicans and democrats ever further apart but on foreign and fiscal policy there proved to be barely any light between two increasing corporate parties beholden to wall street

by dr george venturini at the end of second world war britain was more or less bankrupt so it was agreed that instead of paying cash for the shares of the bank shareholders would receive 3 per cent treasury stock instead with the 1946 bank of england act the bank was nationalised and all the bank shares were transferred into the possession of the treasury solicitor and there they are to this day it remains a corporation not a government department the government of prime minister clement attlee issued treasury notes in the sum of 11 015 100 all the stock was owned by the british government although the bank continued as a royal charter company with the absolute protection of confidentiality and security afforded by a royal charter and the official secrets act obviously the nationalisation was not welcomed by its shareholders or bankers of the day because of the abrupt resignation of prime minister harold wilson in april 1976 and the fact that the new government of prime minister james callaghan had virtually no majority u k ltd became vulnerable and effectively bankrupt with double digit annual inflation 70 per cent over three years incessant strikes the sterling frequently suspended on international exchange markets virtual parity with the united states dollar it seemed the ideal time for the shareholders to strike back and re take the bank of england on 6 april 1977 the bank of england formed the bank of england nominees limited b o e n a wholly owned subsidiary private limited company under no 1307478 with two of its 100 1 shares issued its memorandum and articles of association s objectives provided that b o e n was to act as nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others for any person or persons partnership company corporation government state organisation sovereign province authority or public body or any group or association of them the origin of b o e n is mentioned in a work by lynn picknett clive prince and stephen prior from which comes the following extract in early 1973 new legislation governing the ownership of shares proposed by heath government this would force stockbroking companies to disclose the names of the individuals on whose behalf they bought shares to prevent them gaining a controlling interest in a company by buying shares in several different names the queen was concerned that this would mean that details of her private investments would be made public which would allow her personal wealth to be calculated which the royal family had always strenuously avoided and asked her private secretary sir martin charteris who had succeeded sir michael adeane in 1972 to express her anxiety to edward heath the legislation was delayed but eventually became law under labour in 1976 as the companies act however a special clause was included which exempted a new shareholding company bank of england nominees this was established with the purpose of handling investments solely on behalf of heads of state and their immediate families this allowed the queen s investments and those of her family along with those of other heads of state such as the sultan of brunei bhumibol adulyadej the late king of thailand the kuwaiti royal family the late king fahd of saudi arabia and his then friend saddam hussein and other crowned oligarchs who were quick to take advantage of the exemption to be effectively concealed they all became clients of what appeared to be the queen s very private bank b o e n was only one of the many cut outs used to hide obscene profits from the sale of arms oil and nuclear material extraordinarily not even the chancellor of the exchequer permitted to know about the queen s personal investments andrew morton would write the result of this legislation has been to cocoon further the royal finances in a web of mystery journalists who delve into dusty share registers find the impenetrable phrase bank of england nominees staring back at them when they try to find a hint of royal investment in a company the justification for the clause was that public knowledge about where the queen invested her money might influence the market however that this was just an excuse is revealed by a memo sent from the palace to the government saying that it is to be congratulated on a neat and defensible solution in other words the palace were pleased that the government had come up with a way of justifying the secrecy l picknett c prince s prior war of the windsors a century of unconstitutional monarchy mainstream publishing edinburgh scotland 2002 questions were asked and quite frequently in both the house of commons and the house of lords the answers were always evasive vague inconclusive on 21 april 1977 to a question in the house of commons from mr blenkinsop who wanted to know from the secretary of state for trade whether b o e n was intended to hold shares on behalf of heads of state and certain others and whether he had granted any exemptions under section 27 9 of the companies act 1976 and if he would make a statement mr clinton davis replied the secretary of state has granted one exemption under section 27 9 of the companies act 1976 in favour of bank of england nominees ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank of england bank of england nominees ltd have given a number of undertakings about the use to be made of the exemption they will hold securities as nominee only on behalf of heads of state and their immediate family governments official bodies controlled or closely related to governments and international organisations formed by governments or official bodies they will in turn seek certain assurances from anyone in the eligible categories who wishes them to hold the securities as that person s nominee these assurances are to cover a the fact that the person is the beneficial owner of the securities to be held by bank of england nominees ltd b that the beneficial owner will not use his interest in any securities held by bank of england nominees ltd to influence the affairs of the company in which shares are held except as shareholders in general meetings of that company c that the beneficial owner is aware of his overriding obligation under section 33 of the companies act 1967 as amended to disclose his interest to the company in which shares are held if he is interested in 5 per cent or more of that company s share capital mr davies added bank of england nominees ltd has also undertaken to make a report annually to the secretary of state for trade of the identity of those for whom it holds securities and provided that it holds securities for two or more people the total value of the securities held the contents of such reports are to be confidential to the secretary of state

website there followed questions in the house of lords paul myners who was known as baron myners cbe a member of the house of lords and had been a businessman until he became the financial services secretary sometimes referred to as city minister in her majesty s treasury and then the finance ministry during the labour government of prime minister gordon brown rose to ask her majesty s government when the accounts of bank of england nominees limited were last published when they will next be published and whether they intend to review whether the company should remain exempt from company law disclosure requirements house of lords hansard the parliamentary under secretary of state department for business innovation and skills baroness wilcox replied the most recent accounts of bank of england nominees limited are available via the companies house website and were published on 14 june 2010 it can be seen from these accounts that the company is currently dormant the company is due to publish its next set of accounts by 30 november this year the company is no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements and currently no other persons are exempt from these requirements later on when lord myners rose to ask her majesty s government when the accounts of bank of england asset purchases facility fund limited will be published whether these accounts will take into account an indemnity from hm treasury and whether the accounts of the company are exempt from any company law disclosure requirements house of lords hansard lord sassoon the commercial secretary to the treasury replied the bank of england will publish accounts for the asset purchase facility apf for the year ended february 2011 before the summer parliamentary recess the amount due to or from hm treasury under its indemnity to the bank will be identified the accounts are not exempt from any company law disclosure requirements lord myners insisted and rose again to ask her majesty s government whether the accounts of the bank of england bank of england nominees limited and the bank of england asset purchase facility fund limited are all audited by the same firm of public accountants house of lords hansard to which lord sassoon replied kpmg are the external auditors for the bank of england and the bank of england asset purchases facility fund limited as a dormant company bank of england nominees limited is not required under the companies act 2006 to appoint an external auditor in 2011 b o e n was no long allowed disclosure exemptions from company law disclosure requirements as a written answer from the lords hansard on 26 april 2011 8 made clear the consequence of this was that b o e n was no longer granted an exemption under sec 796 of the companies act 2006 to the notification provisions required by sec 793 something to which it had been previously authorised to summarise as stated in hansard b o e n was a company set up with the intention of holding shares confidentially on behalf of heads of state whoever they might be and certain others one is perfectly entitled to presume from that that the queen and her immediate family however defined and certain bodies are included in that broad specification a mcconnachie investigating the bank of england nominees 11 october 2011 prosperityuk com there had been a statement by melanie johnson m p economic secretary to the treasury in 2000 to the effect that b o e n is a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank of england which was granted an exemption by edmund dell secretary of state for trade from the disclosure requirements under section 27 9 of the companies act 1976 because it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders a freedom of information request submitted in 2010 provided a similar answer because of the combination of the provisions of the royal charter and the official secrets act the bank enjoyed unusual confidentiality and security and was even untouched by questions being asked in the house of commons thus structured and protected b o e n became a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in united kingdom companies subject to approval from the secretary of state and providing they undertake not to influence the affairs of the company later on b o e n was is no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements it remained as a dormant company although dormancy did not preclude it from actively operating as a nominee shareholder officially b o e n had only two shareholders the bank of england and the secretary of the bank of england a fundamental question remained why form a wholly owned nominee company which since its establishment in 1977 had never traded and confined itself to lodging short form un audited accounts it was conceivable that sometime after 1977 the bank of england had been in effect privatised its shares being held in b o e n thereby making a closed loop although b o e n was a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank of england b o e n had effective control of the bank because the shares were in fact owned by the secret shareholders it seems that only 50 per cent of the shares were sold but they controlled all voting rights considering that shareholders appoint directors it was legitimately conceivable to conclude that the bank of england was covertly controlled if not by the banks then by a higher banking entity which had the interests of the banks at heart which justifies the rampant and systemic fraud perpetrated upon their customers with arrogance and impunity in 1997 after the three rivers district council had won their action against the bank of england for failing to control the bank of credit and commerce international b c c i would come under the scrutiny of numerous financial regulators and intelligence agencies in the 1980s due to concerns that it was poorly regulated subsequent investigations revealed that it was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes and illegally gained the controlling interest in the first american a major bank several persons and entities who had fallen casualties of banks made formal complaints against the bank of england for not enforcing control over their respective high street banks yet contrary to the bank s own statement of principles and the banking acts the complaints were rejected on the ground that the bank of england does not intervene between bank and customer within months the bank of england complaints staff and department had been transferred to canary wharf under the guise of the financial services agency who could not act on complaints emanating prior to their formation in 1998 the bank became an independent public entity wholly owned by the treasury solicitor on behalf of the government with independence in setting monetary policy the bank s monetary policy committee has a devolved responsibility for managing monetary policy the bank s financial policy committee held its first meeting in june 2011 as a macro prudential regulator to oversee regulation of the united kingdom s financial sector as a regulator and central bank the bank has not offered consumer banking services for many years but it still does manage some public facing services such as exchanging superseded bank notes until 2016 the bank provided personal banking services as a popular privilege for employees b o e n was quietly dissolved following liquidation on 27 july 2017 bank of england nominees limited insolvency commencement of winding up 13 october 2016 due to be dissolved on 27 july 2017 much mystery came to an end in part anyway when in a kind of return for fixing the 1997 elections and facilitating new labour into power parliament passed the bank of england act 1998 which gave the bank s court of directors complete independence with regard to monetary policy that brought about the operation of a nationally owned institution which has the monopoly in the production of the national currency and places independent control of the country s monetary policy in the hands of a court of directors who serve the private banking system as they have since the bank was established it means private banking control of the united kingdom s currency and monetary policy and all that fully independent of government since 1998 one witnessed the bank rapidly inflate the money supply while at the same time relaxing regulation on how banks could lend no longer were banks required to have cash in reserve for loans they made instead the vast majority of currency entering the economy did so as a result of commercial banks entering some numbers into a ledger money out of thin air literally working for the private bankers the bank of england set things up to maximise the returns for their banking colleagues speculative activities in the full knowledge that as a nationalised institution it would be the united kingdom taxpayers who were carrying all the risk and not as would have been the case before 1946 the shareholders the court of directors is working for a kind of combination the anglo dutch saudi empire the still alive and kicking hidden hand behind the british empire of the victorian age so it is no surprise that the solution they provide to today s manufactured monetary financial collapse is to print more money their ultimate aim could be that of destroying the last vestiges of british sovereignty prime minister gordon brown who had served as chancellor of the exchequer in the blair government from 1997 to 2007 announced the new financial infrastructure at the 2009 gathering of the g20 then he announced the possibility of a new global currency to be issued and managed by the newly reinvigorated international monetary fund protected by the royal charter and the official secrets act the b o e n never told anybody who are the shareholders who control the company who are the beneficiaries thereof the rothschilds perhaps the queen maybe nevertheless one would be surprised on finding out that the bank of england which is entitled to issue cash then lends it and charges interest to the government acting therefore like a private business this kind of operation is very much like that of the federal reserve bank of america which is a privately owned bank as all central banks of the world are including the bank for international settlements in switzerland which is the central banks clearing house if one day the one world government actually had an address this would be part of it the b i s another privately owned bank the central bankers central bank beyond the control of guaranteed by democratic practice yet able to influence events secretly from behind the scenes one thing is certain in times of financial crisis these central banking networks become supremely powerful the people wielding this power see the world s financial crisis as their moment of opportunity to seize greater power the scary part of that is that hardly a living soul even knows they exist now that is real power what s all this about the late carroll quigley a distinguished american historian and theorist of the evolution of civilizations noted for his teaching work as a professor at georgetown university for his academic publications wrote a book on who ruled the united states and great britain between 1870 and 1960 he called it tragedy and hope a history of the world in our time gsg and associates san pedro california 2004 the work is the ultimate view of a secret global élite which has impacted nearly every modern historical event the main thesis is that the anglo american banking élites were able secretly to establish and maintain their global power the book provides a detailed world history beginning with the industrial revolution and imperialism through two world wars a global depression and the rise of communism tragedy and hope is an important work on the world s power structure and an essential source material for understanding the history goals and actions of a possible new world order the gist of the work is that the power of the bank of england and of its governor was admitted by most qualified observers in january 1924 reginald mckenna who had been chancellor of the exchequer in 1915 1916 as chairman of the board of the midland bank told its stockholders i am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can and do create money and they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people quigley commented the powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole and again each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans to manipulate foreign exchanges to influence the level of economic activity in the country and to influence

by richard balzano links international journal of socialist renewal abstract this work presents a comprehensive definition of modern sanctions through a synthesis of scholarly interpretations followed by an outline of international legislation pertaining to sanctions and collective punishment and a scope and evolutionary sequence of washington imposed sanctions on venezuela the article then explores the polarized arguments for the causes of venezuela s economic crisis and makes a determination that washington imposed sanctions cross the threshold of international law while a case can and should be made that sanctions are issued in concert with democratic intervention subversion and a collaborative washington media narrative to hyperbolize venezuela s economic state as a means to make intervention palatable to domestic and international observers those elements are introduced but that determination is outside the scope of this article washington s twenty first century hostilities toward the bolivarian government of venezuela have manifested in policies of democratic intervention through subversive use of non governmental organizations attempts at diplomatic isolation frequent posturing towards military intervention and economic hostilities including the use of unilateral sanctions that have exacerbated ongoing economic challenges washington contends that the bolivarian government is an authoritarian regime in a state of humanitarian crisis whose economy is run aground by corruption economic mismanagement and socialism but with orwellian precision the impact of washington s economic hostilities and subversive efforts remain absent from the anti bolivarian narrative as it would delegitimize the ideological rationale for its continued aggression sanction induced deprivation herein referred to as sid is intended to generate anti government energy among the populations of targeted states to leverage the target to alter a behavior in compliance with the sanctioning bodies demands yet often the outcomes of economic sanctions if not their very premise are in violation of human rights protections and international law thoroughly defining economic sanctions within the context of human rights and international law and examining washington s unilateral sanctions imposed on venezuela in within this framework and mindful of ongoing economic challenges demonstrates that washington has crossed the threshold of international law and human rights protections as outlined by the united nations un the organization of american states oas and more challenging washington s humanitarian high road on which its ideological justifications for continued aggressions are sustained economic sanctions defined in the context of human rights and international law the origins of sanctions are rooted in premodern siege tactics whereby aggressors surrounded cities to deprive inhabitants to the point of submission if not starvation and in nineteenth century blockades mounted by powerful european states against smaller nations in europe and emerging nations in latin america legitimized under article 16 of the league of nations covenant and expanded under the un s original charter in articles 2 4 39 41 42 43 46 and the 1950 uniting for peace resolution the primary function of sanctions remained a strategic military endeavor through the second world war but sanctioning extended to the economic and diplomatic landscape as a mechanism for geopolitical behavior modification in the postwar era the un commission on human rights identifies sanctions as being both financial and non financial the former including trade restrictions and monetary constraints and the latter including diplomatic measures visa revocation travel prohibitions cultural restrictions abstaining from events and military measures embargoes and the withdrawal of training or assistance dursun peksen highlights the core of modern sanctions as the application of economic and diplomatic pressure on target countries to induce the target political leadership to comply with sender countries demands while jill jermono of the department of treasury provides a comprehensive explanation of sanctions the use of sanctions in coercive strategies to effect behavioral change involves the sender demanding that the target cease or reverse an action backing the demand by a credible threat sanctions aim to change a target s decision calculus about resisting pressure by increasing the cost and difficulty of the target s economic activity or financial transactions susan hannah allen further expands the operational dynamics of sanctions herein targeted states must sufficiently value the benefits gained by compliance when sanctions succeed the benefits of compliance exceed the value of the offending behavior that triggered the sanctions initially when the population feels the pinch of sanctions deprivation logic of sanctions anticipates a political response as the economic pressure rises coercive influence increases he deprivation perspective suggests that there will be a significant increase in antigovernment activity under sanctions as the public experiences economic hardship within the institutional and scholarly framework provided the mechanism for change in targeted states are populations engaging in antigovernment activity and the motivational element to induce antigovernment activity is sid the undesirable behaviors warranting the use of sanctions include peacekeeping and humanitarian initiatives ranging from preventing bloodshed between ethnic groups to punishing countries harboring terrorists restoring democratic regimes or ending the use of repression by the government and critical observers may consider the coercive nature in which these labels have been manipulated in rationalizing intervention if applied with integrity however few legal barriers existed to prevent states from issuing sanctions as article 2 4 of the un charter imposes no constraint on individual states undertaking coercive measures short of war lance davis and stanley engerman outline the expanding motivations for the application of sanctions herein n recent decades economic sanctions have been pursued for a much broader range of international goals forestalling war hastening the achievement of freedom and democracy cleaning up the environment strengthening human rights or labor rights nuclear nonproliferation the freeing of captured citizens and the reversal of captures of land sanctions have become a standard and routine policy tool of nations and international organizations for addressing any actions of a targeted nation that targeting nation or group of nations disagreed with in line with these closing remarks within the increasing application of sanctions emerged a key characteristic that exposes an imperialistic dynamic smaller states tended to be targeted by larger western states this asymmetrical pattern is not universal as smaller states may and have unilaterally sanctioned states of similar proportion but states with smaller or less dynamic economies are limited in their capacity to sanction states with larger economies by use of sanctions in consideration of sanctions origins in the premodern siege the surrounding force cannot starve a city if it has less food than lies within the city walls davis and engerman explore this dynamic in detail in the 115 cases of economic sanctions deployed since 1914 the gnp of the sender or principal initiator of sanctions was nearly always over ten times that of the target and in the majority of cases more than 50 times greater where modest policy changes were at stake the sender s economy was on average more than 200 times larger than the target s economy and where destabilization of the government was the goal the average ratio exceeded 400 only when relatively important goals were at stake were countries willing to pick on someone closer to themselves in size in a postwar context provided the relative effectiveness of sanctions is asymmetrical and lends to western hegemony as is demonstrated by their applications over time the un modestly applied sanctions on five occasions prior to 1990 but in the latter half of the twentieth century washington initiated the expansion of sanctions unilaterally through a significant role in un applications or by way of coalitions davis and engerman observe that over 145 sanctions were issued between 1950 and 2000 that between 1960 and 1990 the majority of sanctions were imposed unilaterally most frequently by the united states and that trade sanctions were imposed in 117 cases between 1970 and 1998 with the united states primarily responsible or part of the sanctions coalition in over two thirds of them washington s economic hegemony and to a lesser extent the larger european union states incentivized its use of sanctions and their application transformed into a preferred geopolitical mechanism for exerting western authority as the un began issuing sanctions more frequently in concert with the us the final years of the twentieth century became known as the sanctions decade the effectiveness of sanctions has been contested though scholars have observed both their ineffectiveness in promoting change and their tendency to create adverse humanitarian outcomes though a case can be made that the use of sanctions provides a non violent alternative to military intervention this argument only has merit if the motivations and desired outcomes are honorable and beneficial for targeted states and it disregards the prospect that the outcomes of sid may result in human suffering through passive means nonetheless comparable to the use of physical violence robert a pape contends that there is little empirical evidence that sanctions can achieve ambitious foreign policy goals convincingly challenging hufbauer schott and elliott s influential economic sanctions reconsidered 1985 and scaling back their assertions of the successful implementation of sanctions in the twentieth century from forty to five pape contends that economic sanctions come with significant human costs and that hostile rhetoric has the capacity to induce military intervention if and when sanctions are unsuccessful suggestinging that overreliance on sanctions may contribute to peksen argues that economic sanctions may cause disproportionate stress on ordinary citizens and that xtensive sanctions including comprehensive trade and financial restrictions appear to be detrimental to human rights concluding economic coercion remains a counterproductive policy tool even when sanctions are specifically imposed with the goal of improving human rights conditions use of sid to promote change has limited appropriate applicational space as compliance with the requests of sanctioning bodies is more likely when the targeted state is democratic and its population has the capacity to effectively generate change through productive antigovernment activity but less likely in repressive autocratic states in which the population is incapable of altering policy thus reducing the scope of the successful application of sanctions to target states in which state imposed humanitarian crisis is not present or where unwarranted international aggression is less likely this would suggest a reduction in much of the legitimate criteria under which sanctions are warranted prompting the issuing body to employ manipulative and at times hyperbolic justification to issue sanctions or otherwise do so in defiance of emerging legislation outlined below while davis and engerman argue that economic sanctions are most likelyto succeed they nonetheless conclude that sanctions have not proven very effective as a tool to secure foreign policy goals legal protections began to emerge in the latter third of the twentieth century in response to the growing use of sanctions and at present utilizing sid as a coercive mechanism for change violates multiple pieces of international legislation the un s long ignored 1970 declaration on the principles of international law s duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any state dictates no state may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another state in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind within the framework of this legislation use of sanctions requires the target be in violation of human rights and as such the applications of democracy promotion and dictatorship are often manipulated to initiate sanctions this pattern is ever present with washington s sanctions on venezuela which have been initiated by executive order eo since 2015 through invocation of the 1976 national emergency act hr3884 which sets no criteria for determining a national emergency and as such remains susceptible to manipulation and hyperbole despite increased un sanctioning activities in the 1990s several measures to preserve human rights and restrict coercive practices were adopted through resolutions in the general assembly human rights council hrc and commission on human rights while the world conference on human rights in 1993 called upon states to abide by international law regarding coercive practices the resolutions went ignored in the coming decades notably by the us and in september 2014 the hrc s resolution 27 21 human rights and unilateral coercive measures reaffirmed the illegalities of coercive practices highlighted the human toll of coercive practices on human rights and condemned their continued use in defiance of past resolutions and created the office of the special rapporteur to examine reports of human rights violations this was done without the supporting votes of the us and major western powers most recently draft resolution 40 the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights was adopted in response to washington imposed sanctions against venezuela but in maintaining consistency with its commitment to international cooperation the us was not in attendance for the vote further legislation outside the scope of the un challenges the use of coercive economic practices within chapter iv of the organization of american states oas charter article 19 stipulates no state or group of states has the right to intervene directly or indirectly for any reason whatever in the internal or external affairs of any other state the foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any other form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the state or against its political economic and cultural elements the oas charter s chapter iv article 20 confronts sanctions more directly insisting that o state may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind in consideration of sid international regulations prohibiting collective punishment can be found in article 50 of both the 1899 and 1907 hague regulations which specifically address civilians article 26 iii of the 1949 geneva convention which prohibits ollective disciplinary measures affecting food articles 87 iii and 33 iv of the 1949 geneva convention which prohibit collective punishment along with article 75 2 d of the 1977 geneva convention additional protocol i article 4 2 b of the 1977 additional protocol ii and article 20 f ii of the international law commission s 1996 draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind while several of the aforementioned protections are intended for conflict scenarios the applicability of these protections are relevant if and when the stated objective in imposing sanctions is regime change when desired outcomes are aided by subversion when the threat of military intervention is utilized by the sanctioning body and when sanctions escalate to armed conflict initiated by the sanctioning body in the case of venezuela the former three conditions are applicable at this time while the latter is according to us president donald trump on the table despite the aforementioned protections international law has proved an ineffective means of deterring sanctions perhaps due to the asymmetrical nature in which sanctions favor hegemony leaving no mechanism for accountability of comparable stature washington imposed sanctions on venezuela while many credit the obama administration for introducing sanctions on venezuela with the creation of the 2014 venezuela defense of human rights and civil society act the origins of us imposed sanctions are traced to the w bush administration s volatile relationship with the bolivarian republic as hugo chavez vocally denounced us imperialism he bush administration made no attempt to disguise its distaste for his personality and his policies the failed 2002 coup was credibly linked to washington and millions of us dollars were directed to ngos like the national endowment for democracy and the office of transition initiatives to unite opposition groups and fund subversive initiatives under the policy of democratic intervention cognizant of these ongoing efforts in 2005 chavez claimed that drug enforcement administration dea agents engaged in espionage and expelled them in response washington asserted with no substantive supporting evidence and in contrast to dea reporting that venezuela had aided colombian cocaine trafficking and failed demonstrably to adhere to their obligations under the international narcotics agreements under the 2000 foreign narcotics kingpin designation act 22 individuals and 27 companies were branded specially designated narcotics traffickers and sanctioned by the treasury department while democratic intervention practices intensified peter h smith contends that ver the years u s antidrug campaigns became linked to larger geopolitical goals and that in time the drug control policy had become part and parcel of the antiterrorist campaign in this context the w bush administration s hostile rhetoric towards venezulea expanded to include accusations of terrorism under which further sanctions could be rationalized in 2006 and annually thereafter the secretary of state asserted that venezuela fails to cooperate with anti terrorism efforts in accordance with the section 40a of the 1976 arms export control act washington discontinued arms sales to venezulea in 2006 and disrupted military sales agreements between the bolivarian government and spain norway and brazil and in 2008 the treasury department sanctioned two venezuelan nationals and two travel agencies for reporedly supporing hezbollah under the auspices of eo 13224 2001 that venezuela has been forced to purchase arms from other sources especially russia has fueled washington s rhetoric in categorizing the bolivarian government as rogue although sanctions issued during the w bush administration did not meet the humanitarian or coercive elements prohibited by international law the manipulation of criteria under which sanctions were issued set dangerous precedent for future administrations while the use of subversion remains illegal under the un charter the obama administration oversaw the venezuelan presidency transition to nicolas maduro tempering hostilities toward venezuela in the public sphere at the onset the obama administration later applied sanctions using exaggerated rhetoric under the pretext that venezuela presented an extraordinary threat to national security in 2015 targeted sanctions were issued in response to protests in 2014 led by opposition groups long fueled by us dollars and as protests had become violent the conduct of both government and opposition were mutually called into question opposition leader leopoldo lopez and other actors were arrested under accusations of inciting violence while washington condemned the actions of the bolivarian government as repressive and undemocratic the venezuela defense of human rights and civil society act of 2014 was enacted in december of that year to authorize the use of sanctions outlined herein among its provisions the law requires the president to impose sanctions asset blocking and visa restrictions against those whom the president determines are responsible for significant acts of violence or serious human rights abuses associated with protests in february 2014 or against anyone who has directed or ordered the arrest or prosecution of a person primarily because of the person s legitimate exercise of freedom of expression or assembly the act was extended by congress in 2016 and remains quite active at this time and under its provisions president obama issued eo 13692 which sanctioned targeted individuals that included the finance minister thus obstructing or making foreign transactions difficult similar to the previous administration sanctions imposed by the obama administration utilized questionable rationale most notably in the absence of accountability for the opposition in both cases the us initiated sanctions did not generate sid but the 2015 sanctions declared under a hyperbolic state of national emergency generated insecurity within the financial community and prompted the closure of two foreign owned manufacturing facilities in venezuela the trump administration initiated an unprecedented volume of sanctions on venezuela with menacing rhetoric manipulated logic and unreasonable objectives washington expanded targeted sanctions within the framework of alleged narcotrafficking and terror activities in 2017 and 2018 placed restrictions on transactions with venezuelan petro currency on the grounds that it was created to evade sanctions under eo 13827 in march 2018 and prohibited the purchase of venezuelan debt with stretched assertions of eliminating corruption under eo 13835 in may 2018 broader sanctions initiated through eo 13808 in august of 2017 were rationalized as necessary in order to encourage the government of venezuela to respect human rights yet were accompanied by threats of intervention from both trump and within his circle these sanctions prohibited the venezuelan government from borrowing within us markets and ostensibly imposed a financial embargo on an already recessed venzeuelan economy challenged by balance of payment issues and in dire need of debt restructuring while prohibiting pdvsa s affiliate citgo from returning its earnings to venezuela in september of that year the treasury department s financial crimes enforcement network put forth an advisory to financial institutions on widespread political corruption in venezuela which generated further borrowing limitations and account closures though eo 13850 of november 2018 initially introduced targeted sanctions on the high ground of challenging corruption with regard to the gold sector washington extended 13850 to encompass pdvsa s assets while declaring support for juan guiado s self declaration as interim president of venezuela in january 2019 this was followed by further extensions of 13850 in march and april that included multiple banking institutions and pdvsa s transport capacity specifically since 2017 the trump administration has sanctioned 63 persons one aircraft and six institutions under eo 13692 while five persons and 33 institutions were sanctioned under the kingpin act and seven persons 30 institutions one aircraft and 44 ships were sanctioned under eo 13850 on the whole over 150 persons have been sanctioned since 2017 and as of may 2019 the treasury department maintained sanctions on 112 individuals revoking the visas of 718 persons since recognizing guaido 107 of which were of diplomatic significance the leverage of washington s hegemony is evidenced in the recognition of juan guaido as echoed by the oas the inter american development bank eleven signatories of the lima group and fifty four countries along with the european parliament of the european union s issuance of a nonbinding resolution in march 2019 that called for additional sanctions reports in may 2019 indicate washington seeks to sanction clap a community food distribution program designed to relieve inflation related hunger under corruption allegations while the trump administration s rhetoric is reflective of the w bush administration s tone and while the sanctions issued by the trump administration are consistent with both the w bush and obama administrations hyperbolic claims of national security threats posed by venezuela the elevated objective of regime change has not been overtly present in collaboration with the use of sanctions and the impact of sanctions have not been so broad as to induce poverty in prior administrations ongoing economic hardships in venezuela were exacerbated by sanctions imposed by the trump administration prior to the 2017 sanctions the venezuelan economy was in a state of depression with inflation in excess of 750 percent and the 2019 sanctions have contributed to an astounding 37 4 percent drop in gdp as of march 2019 in historical perspective the most devastating economic sanctions to date are observed in iraq with a decline of about 48 percent gnp with a particularly heavy burden on the incomes and mortality of the poorer segment of the population while the only other cases in which sanctions impacted more than 10 of gnp include un sanctions on rhodesia between 1966 and 1979 and nigerian sanctions on biafra from 1979 washington boasts that 3 2 billion in venezuelan assets have been frozen abroad including 1 2 billion in gold seized by the bank of england and a colombia based agrochemical operation valued at over 250 million but the total loss of assets is much higher when factoring citgo valued at over 5 billion was granted to professed interim government of juan guaido gold transactions have declined and in some instances been terminated in response to international pressure while oil production has declined to half of its 2018 monthly output forcing caracas to sell at discounted rates oil production has further declined 36 4 percent between january and april 2019 and predicted to drop a cataclysmic and unprecedented 67 2 percent by year s end if sanctions persist venezuela has been sanctioned to a state of capital paralysis at present and hyperinflation and reduced import capacity have created what many deem a humanitarian crisis mark weisbrot and jeffrey sachs outline these dynamics for the center for economic policy research early all of the foreign exchange that is needed to import medicine food medical equipment spare parts and equipment needed for electricity generation water systems or transportation is received by the venezuelan economy through the government s revenue from the export of oil thus any sanctions that reduce export earnings and therefore government revenue thereby reduce the imports of these essential and in many cases life saving goods

but even he thinks 50 basis points is excessive as per his comments afterwards the question is what do the other members think and regardless of external pressure how close is the fed from going full

sommer johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year she was engaged working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance s mother died a week before their wedding day triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am said johnson 39 who lives in douglasville georgia an atlanta suburb i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever the economic expansion this week became the longest in u s history surpassing the 1990s boom which lasted exactly a decade the stock market is at record levels with the dow jones industrial average closing at a new high wednesday ahead of the july 4 holiday and president donald trump has made the economy s strong performance a centerpiece of his reelection campaign but this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles leaving many americans in a vulnerable position this is a two tier recovery said matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs about 60 percent of americans have benefited financially he said while 40 percent have not the 40 percent which mish calls the lower tier have seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt they tend not to own homes or many stocks in discussions with 30 americans unable to pay all of their bills a clear pattern emerged most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss cancer car trouble or storm damage the extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills and they never fully rebounded economists fear such precarious financial situations put many americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the great recession so many americans are living paycheck to paycheck said signe mary mckernan vice president of the center of labor human services and population at the urban institute we are headed toward a political crisis if not an economic one their vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors first the average american family has yet to recover fully from the crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year while wage growth has accelerated in recent months especially for the lowest paid workers families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing half of u s jobs pay less than 18 58 an hour and more than a third pay less than 15 which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future trump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more americans up financially including blue collar workers the formerly incarcerated and minorities in contrast democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality how to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race just because folks on wall street think things are fine doesn t mean most americans feel like things are fine said ray boshara director of the center for household financial stability at the federal reserve bank of st louis when every day is a rainy day for millions of families things are not fine to get by americans have borrowed heavily in recent years total u s household debt is now 13 7 trillion surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms according to the federal reserve bank of new york the surge in debt this time around is for cars and college not mortgages johnson knows these issues all too well her family of five including two teenagers and an infant daughter was making it on her 31 000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband s part time job as a clerk but it took longer to sell her mother in law s house than the couple expected the modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out but the bills for the funeral carrying the extra house rent health insurance and the new baby kept coming johnson s husband carl dunlap has applied repeatedly for full time jobs but has not been able to get one he picked up as many extra hours as he could at work but it wasn t enough already in debt for college and a used volkswagen passat she bought in 2017 johnson turned to friends and family for help but she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the 350 a month auto loan she picked day care and her family lost a vehicle she recalls the exact moment it happened 10 p m on a thursday night in early march she saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living room window and ran outside barefoot i just stood there and watched it go which was tough johnson said that was the first car i ever bought for myself and we needed it the couple carpool to work now trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the vw that is no longer in their possession older and wealthier and usually white americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession as home prices and stocks have soared in contrast data from the fed and the credit score company equifax show that families of color younger americans born after 1970 and households earning less than 60 000 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis and they tend to carry heavy debt loads often taking out loans for college which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy or loans to pay bills which can put them further behind the prevailing view among wall street investors and washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low meaning most people can make their monthly payments credit quality is about as good as i ve ever seen it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low income households certainly nothing compared to times past but boshara of the st louis fed pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year the opposite of what wall street expected in good economic times four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills despite the strong economy according to a quarterly survey by ubs that has shown no improvement since 2014 and looking at how households are doing by class race or age reveals a concerning picture for maddy dannemiller who lives outside columbus ohio the tipping point came when her then boyfriend hit a deer while driving her car the vehicle was badly damaged and the couple decided it was not safe enough for their children prompting her to buy another one her monthly payment jumped to over 450 a month because she didn t have a credit history dannemiller s late mother had co signed the loan on her first car then the couple broke up and dannemiller says she is supporting three children on her own as a nurse s aide she makes above ohio s 8 55 an hour minimum wage but not much over 10 her landlord is a relative who sometimes gives her a break on rent but she is routinely late on car and credit card payments
tokyo the once obscure school of macroeconomic thought known as modern monetary theory mmt has been attracting a lot of attention lately some us progressives such as representative alexandria ocasio cortez aoc and economists like james k galbraith now advocate including mmt in the policy conversation while others including kenneth rogoff dismiss it as problematic and even dangerous building on abba lerner s theory of functional finance mmt essentially argues that countries that issue their own currencies can never run out of money in the way private businesses can for us progressives like aoc and presidential candidate bernie sanders this implies that the federal reserve could print large amounts of money to fund initiatives with major long term benefits such as a job guarantee program or public infrastructure projects because the united states can borrow in its own currency the logic goes the surge in public sector debt would not pose any real danger to the economy 1 some mmt advocates including stephanie kelton a former economic adviser to sanders point to japan as proof that the approach works despite high public debt its economy is steadily recovering and standards of living are high moreover mmt advocates point out japan s expansionary monetary policies a central feature of prime minister shinzo abe s economic revitalisation strategy abenomics have not generated a much feared surge in inflation even within japan some argue that there is no need for a consumption tax hike to fund public spending but there is a serious problem with this logic japan s government is not as heavily indebted as is generally believed though japan s gross debt to gdp ratio at 240 per cent is the highest in the developed world what really matters for the government just like for private firms is the net debt to gdp ratio which accounts for real and financial assets and japan s public companies have very large real assets in fact by this measure japan is about on par with the us and doing much better than france and germany according to the international monetary fund s october 2018 fiscal monitor report managing public wealth further challenging kelton s assessment japan s primary balance has improved under abenomics thanks to its economic recovery this does not mean that mmt has no merit in japan or elsewhere in its campaign to increase consumption taxes japan s ministry of finance mof drilled into the public psyche the concept of ricardian equivalence a government cannot stimulate consumer demand with debt financed spending because people assume that whatever is gained now will be offset by higher taxes due in the future it was this campaign that drove the mof constantly to advertise the 240 per cent figure mmt can challenge this strict ricardian belief drawing attention to the potential of deficit financing say to boost employment through targeted social spending and indeed olivier blanchard and takeshi tashiro have already proposed using limited deficit financing to help bring japan s interest rates up to zero at a time when the government s borrowing costs are low and the effectiveness of monetary policy is weak implementing such a policy successfully however would demand careful attention to inflationary risks the current deflationary phase will not last forever eventually supply constraints will be reached and inflation will return if the government has been engaging in excessive deficit financed spending once inflation is triggered it could quickly spin out of control mmt lacks any safeguard against that outcome unlike for example the fiscal theory of the price level which expressly counts on an independent central bank to manage inflation in fact supplying money with a constant nominal interest rate as mmt seems to prescribe would be the worst thing to do during an inflationary period because the nominal market interest rate would probably be higher than the policy rate when discussing mmt i cannot help but recall goethe s poem the sorcerer s apprentice the sorcerer leaves his apprentice alone to carry out his chores rather than perform his duties as expected the apprentice decides to use the sorcerer s magic commanding a broom to carry buckets of water to fill a cauldron it helps for a while in fact for quite a long time but eventually the cauldron begins to overflow flooding the room and the apprentice cannot get the broom to stop adding more water when he splits the broom with an axe each piece becomes a new one fetching water at twice the speed just short of catastrophe the sorcerer returns and sets the situation right policymakers who recklessly implement mmt may find like the sorcerer s apprentice that once the policies are set in motion they will be difficult to stop and while a central bank can with the requisite authority and independence potentially step in to save the day it is no all powerful sorcerer koichi hamada is professor emeritus at yale university and a special

washington as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the great recession began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines advertising the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality said gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley and a leading expert on income and wealth distribution household wealth the value of homes stock portfolios and bank accounts minus mortgage and credit card debt and other loans jumped 80 in the past decade more than one third of that gain 16 2 trillion in riches went to the wealthiest 1 figures from the federal reserve show just 25 of it went to households in the middle to upper middle class the bottom half of the population gained less than 2 nearly 8 million americans lost homes in the recession and its aftermath and the sharp price gains since then have put ownership out of reach for many would be buyers for america s middle class the homeownership rate fell to about 60 in 2016 from roughly 70 in 2004 before the housing bubble according to separate fed data and the sharpest increases occurred in richer cities like san francisco where prices have more than doubled in the past decade or phoenix where they ve surged 80 by contrast in lower cost charlotte n c home prices have risen by only about a third in cleveland by less than one fifth overall in fact middle income households on average now have less home equity than they did before the recession fed data show the other major engine of household wealth the stock market hasn t much benefited most people either the longest bull market in u s history which surpassed its own 10 year mark in march has shot equity prices up more than four fold yet the proportion of middle income households that own shares has actually declined advertising the fed calculates that about half of middle income americans owned shares in 2016 the most recent year for which data is available down from 56 in 2007 that includes people who hold stocks in retirement accounts the decline in stock market participation occurred mainly because more middle income workers took contract work or other jobs that offered no retirement savings plans the fed concluded in other cases people who face major expenses for say health care or who have heavy student loan debt find it hard to save and invest much even if they do have access to retirement accounts many households find it challenging to make key middle class investments because incomes at the middle are not keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership and it is difficult to save enough lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said in a speech in may hannah moore now 37 has struggled to save since graduating from college in december 2007 the same month the great recession officially began she has worked nearly continuously since then despite a couple of layoffs moore who studied interior design in chicago at a for profit college began job hunting just as many architecture and design firms were downsizing for several years she did freelance design projects and worked in retail jobs sometimes working 30 days without a day off none provided health insurance or a retirement savings plan i had many jobs all at the same time she said it s just not been the easiest of decades if you re trying to jump start a career advertising her situation stabilized when she found full time work in 2013 three years later she moved to los angeles where she works for a design firm that contracts with luxury apartment developers that build rental housing marketed to high tech employees she loves the work but she struggles with los angeles high costs moore says she could afford a monthly mortgage payment but she lacks the savings for a down payment about half her income she calculates is eaten up by rent health insurance and student loan payments of 850 a month as financial inequalities have widened over the past decade racial disparities in wealth have worsened too the typical wealth for a white household is 171 000 nearly 10 times that for african americans that s up from seven times before the housing bubble and it primarily reflects sharp losses in housing wealth for blacks the african american homeownership rate fell to a record low in the first three months of this year if wealth inequality has worsened because fewer americans own homes and stocks should the government try to reverse that trend president george w bush spoke optimistically in the 2000s about an ownership society the idea was that a larger proportion of americans would achieve prosperity by buying homes and investing in the stock market through retirement savings plans such discussion has faded since the housing bust many economists argue that what s needed is simply higher incomes so more americans can save and build wealth zucman favors a higher minimum wage cheaper access to college education and more family friendly policies to enable more parents to work he and his colleague emmanuel saez also an economist at the university of california berkeley helped formulate sen elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on fortunes above 50 million to help pay for those proposals advertising as the wealth gap has widened income gains have remained anemic for americans at all levels for the past decade that is particularly true relative to the sizable pay gains that flowed to households during the robust expansions of the 1980s and 1990s if you compare the economy now to where it was before the recession the most important fact has been its relatively slow growth said jason furman an economist at harvard university and a former top adviser to president barack obama data compiled by zucman saez and thomas piketty show that incomes grew much faster for the top 1 in the 1980s and the 1990s than over the past decade yet inequality has captured much more attention now than it did then in part that may be because middle class and poorer americans haven t enjoyed the fruits of this expansion compared with other recoveries incomes for middle class americans grew nearly twice as fast in the 1980s expansion and about 1 5 times faster in the 1990s than in the current recovery for many people inequality carries less sting when their own fortunes improve the more people are struggling to make ends meet themselves the more they may notice inequality said elise gould an economist at the liberal economic policy institute income growth has lagged partly because for most of the expansion employers have had a surfeit of workers to choose among when filling jobs leaving them little pressure to raise pay not until 2016 did the unemployment rate fall below 5 average hourly pay finally began to pick up with the lowest income workers receiving the fastest average gains though this trend has helped narrow income inequality vast disparities remain overall there s growing inequality gould said with signs of hope at the bottom it s just taken a very long time

located outside of liberia as per page 11of the 2017 cbl financial statements 211m in 2016 minus 136m in 2017 neither did her administration disclose the purpose for which cbl withdrew 93m 165m 2016 minus 72m in 2017 of government s deposits held at cbl see page 11 of the 2017 cbl financial reports were the withdrawals necessary for former president sirleaf and president weah to cover up budgetary shortfalls for instance the 2018 222m if the administrations borrowed from cbl were they not in violation section 2 part iii 41 1 5 of the 1999 bank act the act limits the amount to be borrowed and limits the period within which government i e parent should repay the loans more so why did the government not borrow from the market by selling treasury bills better yet why the government did not use the borrowing arrangements provided by the imf further why is liberia having a cashflow problem since liberia s combined revenue is about 1b since 2006 i e 500m grants loans from our international partners plus our 500m of domestic revenue the citizens budget of 2018 2019 reported that liberia receives 500m from its development partners the oﬀ budget money is usually given to non governmental organizations ngos working in liberia or to government agencies also the imf country report no 18 172 provided more information on liberia s combined revenue page 88 of the imf country report no 18 172 stated that nongovernmental agencies used the 500m grants loans from the world bank etc to work on twenty one projects within liberia s fifteen counties according to page 10 of liberia citizens budget some of the twenty one projects include support project west africa power pool liberia health systems strengthening liberia accelerated electricity expansion project liberia public sector modernization project liberia strengthening the national statistics liberia forest sector project liberia youth opportunities project and liberia renewable energy access project liberia social safety nets project liberia urban according to page 88 of the imf country report no 18 172 well guess why liberia is underdeveloped even though it has and continues to receive a combined 1b cash every year since 2006 if international transparency is correct nongovernmental agencies and multinational institutions are the first culprits who usually offer bribes to government bureaucrats in exchange of fraudulent transactions presumably that corrupt attitude has become contagious encouraging liberian officials to accumulate wealth at the expense of society consequently while expatriates are siphoning liberia s grants loans liberians officials are using domestic revenue to accumulate personal wealth the temptation to use liberia s resources to accumulate wealth is part of the reasons why cbl employees have and continue to withdraw cash in violation of banking regulations and accounting guidelines for instance in 2018 cbl withdrew 18m from foreign banks without following regulations and guidelines additionally cbl did not increase its investments savings accounts with the 48m and 11m it received as deposits from government and commercial banks respectively neither did it increase its cash equivalents with the 37m when it postponed the payment of 37m to its clients cbl illegally using government money was not limited to the secret withdrawals detailed within the schedule above in 2018 kpmg audit firm stated in its audit findings that cbl gave 19m to shareholders depositors managers etc in violation of cbl guidelines and banking regulations additionally the imf reported that cbl used government cash to reimburse ebola money received from liberia s international partners these violations at cbl did not occur because of the absence of internal control or the lack of banking regulations presumably former president sirleaf had and president weah have undue influence over the authorities at cbl and unfortunately liberia s negative cash position will continue to increase thereby making it difficult for cbl to perform its statutory functions such stabilizing the economy and managing liberian dollars inflation and interest rates

u s highlights news of a trade truce between the u s and china buoyed equity markets at the start of the week the ceasefire put additional tariffs on hold and there were some modest concessions on both sides on the economic front messages were decidedly mixed this week the ism manufacturing and non manufacturing indexes moved lower in june while the payroll report showed a reacceleration in hiring with 224k jobs created last month given the balance of risks there is still a solid case for a 25 basis point insurance cut when the fed meets later this month but insurance is likely to mean one or two rate cuts this year and not four or five as markets are pricing canadian highlights financial markets were relatively quiet this week the s p tsx posted a modest gain whereas opec announced an extension of the group s oil supply cuts grabbing the bulk of the attention this week was a surprise trade surplus in may due to an impressive surge in exports the shortened week also saw a decent labour force survey for june with the headline print remaining flat but the details of the report further supporting the narrative of healthy labour markets u s markets celebrate the u s china trade truce news of a trade truce between the u s and china kicked off this holiday shortened week the ceasefire puts additional tariffs on hold there were some modest concessions on both sides the u s will allow american companies to continue selling equipment to huawei although specifics are still pending while china will buy more american agricultural goods the outcome was broadly in line with analyst expectations but still positive enough to bouy equity markets especially in sectors such as semiconductors hit by trade uncertainty on wednesday the s p 500 reached an all time high on the economic front messages in this week s data releases were decidedly mixed the ism manufacturing and non manufacturing indexes moved lower in june and are significantly below year ago levels still both remain in expansionary territory implying slower but not negative economic growth chart 1 more concerning is that the greatest weakness was in the forward looking indicators the new orders subcomponent narrowly avoided contraction in june while pending orders have already slipped below the 50 point threshold it is not surprising that activity is slowing from its 3 plus stimulus fueled pace of a year ago but it makes reading the economic tea leaves more difficult it is hard to know in real time if the economy is returning to a healthy trend like pace or pushing past it into a slump tariffs and trade uncertainty further cloud the mix and signs globally point to a less benign slowdown america s saving grace may be that a large share of its economy is relatively shielded from global events still while its service sector is less impacted by trade it has not been spared entirely indeed comments from non manufacturing survey respondents highlighted concerns about tariffs in several industries including construction retail trade health care social assistance and professional and technical services the best evidence that the american economy is headed for a soft landing is the continued resilience in the labor market that had been brought into question with the may payroll report job growth slowed to just 72k but doubts were assuaged with this week s report showing a reacceleration to 224k in june the only fly in the ointment was that there were no signs of faster wage growth instead average hourly wage growth remained unchanged at 3 1 for the third consecutive month given the balance of risks there is still a solid case for a 25 basis point insurance cut when the fed meets later this month but as long as signs point to continued albeit slower economic growth insurance is likely to mean one or two rate cuts and not four or five as financial markets are currently pricing fed speeches over the next two weeks will be key in communicating this to the public and financial market participants canada canada s q2 defying global headwinds financial markets were relatively quiet this week the s p tsx composite followed its global peers higher recording a modest 0 7 gain as of writing sentiment was lifted by a positive conclusion to the g20 meeting and expectations of more stimulus forthcoming by the ecb this september meanwhile the decision by opec to extend supply cuts for nine months was met with a subdued market reaction in fact oil prices fell on the week as markets weighed weak global manufacturing and pmi data that bodes poorly for oil demand growth against an opec decision that was largely priced in kicking off the canadian data release schedule was a surprise trade surplus for may driven by a spike in exports part of the 4 6 surge in exports should be discounted given transitory factors these include a resumption of activity following temporary disruptions in motor vehicle plants and a surge in the volatile aircraft category still the details of the report were unambiguously positive with 9 of the 11 product groups recording increases in both nominal and real terms chart 1 the week also saw some regional housing data releases which while mixed should not change the narrative of stabilizing housing markets preliminary data suggests that existing home sales advanced in toronto for the fourth consecutive month pullbacks occurred in vancouver and calgary but these followed outsized increases in the prior month capping this week s data calendar was a decent labour force survey report for june net job gains were flat on the month but the details of the report further confirm that the canadian labour market has been firing on all cylinders full time jobs advanced by a healthy 24k in june but the highlights of the report were a 3 6 increase in year over year wage growth for permanent employees chart 2 and a surge in full time hiring in alberta 37k this run of positive data surprises stands in contrast to ongoing deceleration in economic momentum abroad taken together recent releases are pointing to some upside to our already strong second quarter tracking and the bank of canada s very cautious 1 3 forecast and with core and headline inflation measures also running slightly above target and wage growth finally picking up this further justifies our expectation that the bank of canada is likely to leave its policy rate unchanged at 1 75 next week of course some moderation in growth is to be expected in the next few quarters as trade uncertainty and weaker foreign demand act as headwinds to export demand and manufacturing activity nevertheless policy rates in canada are likely to remain unchanged this year financial stability concerns related to elevated household debt levels temper the better than expected economic momentum this sets up the case for divergence between the federal reserve s and the bank of canada s monetary policy paths as the most likely outcome later this year u s upcoming key economic releases u s consumer price index june release date july 11 2019 previous result 0 1 m m core 0 1 m m td forecast 0 0 m m core 0 2 m m consensus 0 1 m m core 0 2 m m we look for headline cpi to slow a further two tenths to 1 6 y y in june on the back of a flat monthly print as negative non core inflation will be balanced by firm underlying price gains we

release date july 9 2019 previous result 202k td forecast 210k consensus 209k housing starts are forecast to recover to an annualized 210k in june on a partial rebound in multi unit construction apartments and other multi unit projects were the main drivers behind the may slowdown and continued strength in permit issuance suggests this pullback will be short lived permits for multi dwelling buildings rose by 40 to a non annualized 18 3k in april the last month available which stands as a new record for monthly issuance while permits are just as volatile as starts the trend still points continued sustained strength in residential construction despite moderating demand in certain regions bank of canada rate decision release date july 10 2019 previous result 1 75 td forecast 1 75 consensus 1 75 td looks for the bank keep rates unchanged at 1 75 in july and provide limited guidance as it awaits more clarity surrounding the global outlook since december the bank has been primarily focused on housing energy markets and global trade and we have seen a number of conflicting developments to global trade tensions since the april mpr us china escalation vs steel aluminum tariffs removal the bank has also signaled it is keenly focused on incoming data which has surprised materially to the upside since april and pushed q2 tracking towards 3 well above official estimates all this suggests the boc is in no rush to follow g10 central banks lower and will require more time to assess global trade conditions and their impact on growth before shifting from the current policy stance

sommer johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year she was engaged working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance s mother died a week before their wedding day triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am said johnson 39 who lives in douglasville georgia an atlanta suburb i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever the economic expansion this week became the longest in u s history surpassing the 1990s boom which lasted exactly a decade the stock market is at record levels with the dow jones industrial average closing at a new high wednesday ahead of the july 4 holiday and president donald trump has made the economy s strong performance a centerpiece of his reelection campaign but this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles leaving many americans in a vulnerable position this is a two tier recovery said matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs about 60 percent of americans have benefited financially he said while 40 percent have not the 40 percent which mish calls the lower tier have seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt they tend not to own homes or many stocks in discussions with 30 americans unable to pay all of their bills a clear pattern emerged most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss cancer car trouble or storm damage the extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills and they never fully rebounded economists fear such precarious financial situations put many americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the great recession so many americans are living paycheck to paycheck said signe mary mckernan vice president of the center of labor human services and population at the urban institute we are headed toward a political crisis if not an economic one their vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors first the average american family has yet to recover fully from the crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year while wage growth has accelerated in recent months especially for the lowest paid workers families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing half of u s jobs pay less than 18 58 an hour and more than a third pay less than 15 which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future trump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more americans up financially including blue collar workers the formerly incarcerated and minorities in contrast democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality how to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race just because folks on wall street think things are fine doesn t mean most americans feel like things are fine said ray boshara director of the center for household financial stability at the federal reserve bank of st louis when every day is a rainy day for millions of families things are not fine to get by americans have borrowed heavily in recent years total u s household debt is now 13 7 trillion surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms according to the federal reserve bank of new york the surge in debt this time around is for cars and college not mortgages johnson knows these issues all too well her family of five including two teenagers and an infant daughter was making it on her 31 000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband s part time job as a clerk but it took longer to sell her mother in law s house than the couple expected the modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out but the bills for the funeral carrying the extra house rent health insurance and the new baby kept coming johnson s husband carl dunlap has applied repeatedly for full time jobs but has not been able to get one he picked up as many extra hours as he could at work but it wasn t enough already in debt for college and a used volkswagen passat she bought in 2017 johnson turned to friends and family for help but she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the 350 a month auto loan she picked day care and her family lost a vehicle she recalls the exact moment it happened 10 p m on a thursday night in early march she saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living room window and ran outside barefoot i just stood there and watched it go which was tough johnson said that was the first car i ever bought for myself and we needed it the couple carpool to work now trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the vw that is no longer in their possession older and wealthier and usually white americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession as home prices and stocks have soared in contrast data from the fed and the credit score company equifax show that families of color younger americans born after 1970 and households earning less than 60 000 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis and they tend to carry heavy debt loads often taking out loans for college which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy or loans to pay bills which can put them further behind the prevailing view among wall street investors and washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low meaning most people can make their monthly payments credit quality is about as good as i ve ever seen it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low income households certainly nothing compared to times past but boshara of the st louis fed pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year the opposite of what wall street expected in good economic times four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills despite the strong economy according to a quarterly survey by ubs that has shown no improvement since 2014 and looking at how households are doing by class race or age reveals a concerning picture for maddy dannemiller who lives outside columbus ohio the tipping point came when her then boyfriend hit a deer while driving her car the vehicle was badly damaged and the couple decided it was not safe enough for their children prompting her to buy another one her monthly payment jumped to over 450 a month because she didn t have a credit history dannemiller s late mother had co signed the loan on her first car then the couple broke up and dannemiller says she is supporting three children on her own as a nurse s aide she makes above ohio s 8 55 an hour minimum wage but not much over 10 her landlord is a relative who sometimes gives her a break on rent but she is routinely late on car and credit card payments i m 25 but i feel like i am in my late 30s dannemiller said shortly before heading to work right now i m two months behind on my car payment

our hypothesis that the market had reached peak dovishness toward the fed remains intact after the employment data job growth was the strongest since january the participation rate and the unemployment rate ticked up average hourly earnings edged 0 2 higher and with revisions maintained a 3 1 year over year pace which is a bit disappointing the jobs report trumps the pmi ism data and suggests that although the economy slowed in q2 the sky is not falling there is no great urgency for the fed to act and surely not by the half a percentage point move that many economists have advocated the market quickly took the odds of such a move from a little more than a 1 in 4 chance to about a 1 in 50 chance the backing up of us yields spurred a sharp sell off in europe that offset most of draghi lagarde inspired rally and will spur a sharp sell off in asia to start the new week coupled with a still robust labor market the us is expected to report in the coming week that disinflationary forces remain in check while headline cpi may ease it is mostly because of food and energy prices the core rate is expected to remain steady at 2 0 prior or january 2012 the federal reserve did not have a formal inflation target the mandate from congress is for price stability greenspan had famously defined price stability as that level of inflation that does not impact businesses given the lack of a scientific basis or what passes for it in the dismal science and the imprecision of our measurements is there really a need to make a fetish of two percent inflation the federal reserve should declare victory it has achieved price stability with full employment in a record long expansion cycle powell is unlikely to do that at his congressional testimony on july 10 and 11 yet if he were going to lean against the rate cut that is nearly fully discounted by the market for later this month this would be the venue it might be too late to persuade the market that it will not cut rates now but powell can lean against the idea that it will cut rates 75 bp this year by emphasizing the still robust expansion hard data jobs and auto sales strong financial conditions that many think is frothy and perhaps couching a cut in terms of insurance besides the market has already done a lot of the lifting while the fed has been patient the 10 year note yield has fallen nearly 65 bp this year and the two year yield has fallen a little more than 60 bp the fed has already signaled the end of its tightening cycle to much effect the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet leaving it larger than many had previously expected at the same time there are indeed storm clouds on the horizon or what powell called crosscurrents the uk seems to be drifting toward a no deal brexit as both candidates to replace may are campaigning on ideas like renegotiating the withdrawal agreement eschewing the backstop that the ec has already rejected and rest assured the new configuration of the ec will be no more sympathetic to the uk s posture the uk economy appears to have bounced back in may from a poor april the monthly gdp is expected to have risen by 0 3 after a 0 4 contraction in april it was likely fueled by a strong recovery in industrial production 1 5 in may after a dismal 2 7 decline in april and a slight expansion of services 0 1 from flat the trade deficit is expected to have widened and perhaps there is some pre brexit inventory stocking taking place yet boe governor carney s recent rhetoric has turned more gloomy and this likely presages a change in the central bank s rhetoric and forward guidance at the next meeting on august 1 the unexpected sharp drop in german factory orders snapped a two month advance and dashed the signal of the composite pmi reaching a seven month high in june it warns of downside risk to industrial output figure that starts the new week a 0 3 gain had been expected after the outsized april drop of 1 9 french and italian data are due out in the middle of the week small increases are expected spain reported a better than expected 0 3 gain 0 5 median forecast in the bloomberg survey between draghi s recent comments and the nomination of lagarde as his replacement has sparked a dramatic rally in fixed income many see lagarde as an extension of draghi s commitment and general strategy rather then draghi s predecessor and fellow countryman trichet however even before we get there the ecb record of last month s meeting will be released on july 11 they will be scrutinized for the extent of the easing bias the market accepts that the ecb will cut rates the question is when and by how much the current pricing in the derivatives market suggests around a 1 in 3 chance the ecb will cut the deposit rate by 10 bp to minus 45 bp later this month and by the end of the year the deposit rate will be minus 60 bp or lower an unanswerable question a decade after the great financial crisis and is how low can interest rates go many real money managers appear to be building cash holdings on ideas that the negative rates out 30 years in switzerland are not sustainable rising stocks amid falling earnings cannot persist yet many observers have been arguing this for years interest rates were supposed to rise when the central banks stopped buying them but they didn t asset managers and many businesses do not seem prepared for the persistence of lower and negative rates though in our understanding it is the most likely scenario trade tensions represent a significant unknown and cross current the resumption of talks while freezing the tariffs at the new elevated level is a holding pattern and the outlook does not look particularly favorable both sides are demanding actionables that the other rejects china wants to talk about huawei and resolve that and requires assurances any agreement will include the lifting of all punitive tariffs trump signaled the willingness to allow us companies to sell some products and services to huawei though it is not precisely clear what this entails or whether the stigma remains the us appears to demand a fundamental shift in china s economy away from the statist command model china of course is not the only source of trade tension for the us between retaliation for subsidies for airbus that the wto ruled illegal the eu s attempt to create a special purpose vehicle designed to facilitate trade in medicine and food initially the persistent haranguing about nato contributions even though the eu spends four times more than russia on defense and the threat of auto tariffs promise many potential flashpoints the us levied a 400 tariff on steel from vietnam amid signs that korean and taiwanese producers may have been re exporting from vietnam to circumvent tariffs separately trump was explicit accusing vietnam of being among the more egregious currency manipulators more broadly trump s penchant for verbally intervening in the foreign exchange market and now implicitly threatening intervention may risk weaponizing the currency market like firing of special investor mueller or demoting powell if not firing him trump has been unable to follow through with such threats which we suspect speaks to the institutional resilience in the us despite claims in the us that china s economy is genuinely hurting under the impact of 25 tariffs on roughly half of their exports to america officials have been reluctant to provide significant stimulus it has encouraged financial institutions to lend and lend they have aggregate financing for june is expected to show the second consecutive increase through the first five months of the year it is running a little more than 25 higher than the same year ago period money supply measured by m2 has risen at an average pace of 8 4 through may this year which is slightly faster than in the first five months of 2018 china will report june reserve figures and trade reserves probably increased slightly in june likely reflecting valuation shifts contrary to trump s claims that china is manipulating its currency or some economists claim that a weaker yuan is desirable to offset the tariff increase the pboc appears to have consistently set the yuan stronger than private sector models suggest both imports and exports are expected to have fallen for the past seven months chinese exports have alternated in a sawtooth pattern between year over year gains and drops in dollar terms may s 1 1 gain is expected to have been followed by a 0 6 decline in june china s imports are expected to

written by ben casselman a decade after the great recession released its grip on the us economy the job market shows no sign of falling into another slump advertisement weak hiring in may had given rise to fears that the long running expansion was foundering in the face of trade tensions and cooling growth overseas but job growth rebounded sharply in june the labor department reported friday employers added 224 000 jobs a larger figure than expected and manufacturers who are bearing the brunt of president donald trump s trade war added jobs at the fastest pace since january that resilience is good news for workers who are benefiting from what is now at least unofficially the longest economic expansion on record and it is a boon to trump who is expected to make the economy s strength a centerpiece of his reelection campaign advertisement our country s doing unbelievably well economically he told reporters friday yet even as trump celebrated the robust hiring numbers he called again for the federal reserve to cut interest rates a step that would ordinarily suggest worries about the economy s direction growth would be like a rocket ship if the fed acted he declared fed policymakers are expected to take that course at their meeting this month though the strength of the latest job figures makes it likely that the reduction will be modest stocks initially fell almost 1 friday on the rate outlook but by the end of the day the s p 500 was down only 0 2 advertisement the job market has lost some momentum since last year when tax cuts and increased government spending gave the economy a jolt employers have added an average of 171 000 jobs over the past three months down from 223 000 per month last year wage growth which picked up late last year appears to have stalled again average hourly earnings were up 3 1 in june from a year earlier a pace that has barely budged in months the unemployment rate rose slightly although at 3 7 it remains near a multidecade low overall friday s figures indicated that the economy is gradually cooling not headed for a deep freeze separate data from the institute for supply management this week showed that both the manufacturing and services sectors grew in june by a variety of measures though more slowly than in may the housing market has shown signs of weakness but that hasn t yet discouraged consumers from spending money perhaps because layoffs are near record lows everyone knew the pace was going to slow said brett ryan an economist at deutsche bank the question is if it s going to slow more sharply advertisement the strength of the u s economy stands in stark contrast to weakness overseas data released friday showed that german factory orders fell sharply in may the latest sign of trouble in europe s largest economy the european central bank is widely expected to take action to stimulate the economy when it meets this month china s manufacturing sector has likewise been struggling in part because of tariffs imposed by the united states the conflicting signals being sent by the domestic and global economies are complicating the fed s decision on interest rates when its policymaking group meets july 30 31 investors had been expecting a cut of as much as half a percentage point but that s probably off the agenda said ian shepherdson chief economist for pantheon macroeconomics advertisement economists and investors still think a quarter point cut is likely however some fed officials are concerned by the stubbornly low rate of inflation which has fallen below the central bank s 2 target for them june s strong job growth will matter less than the weak growth in hourly earnings which will do little to push up prices they are also worried about the trade war and its effect on global output in a report to congress on friday the fed said it was seeing signs that uncertainty surrounding trade policy was leading companies to delay investment decisions which could in turn slow economic growth at taco metals a miami based manufacturer of equipment for the recreational marine industry tariffs have meant higher costs for the raw materials and parts it imports from china and other countries that has added to fears from boat builders and dealers about how long the good times can last in an industry that is highly sensitive to the broader economy advertisement the tariffs just kind of forced people to think twice about is this going to continue said bill kushner a vice president at the company there s starting to be more hesitation on both the manufacturing side and the dealer side as customers pull back kushner s company which employs about 150 workers in florida and tennessee is doing the same it is holding off on some equipment purchases and waiting to fill some positions it s just caused us to take a little step back and reassess some of the direction and make sure we re not jumping the gun kushner said it s like well are we sure we re going to need to do this or should we try to outsource advertisement however there is little evidence that those concerns are spreading beyond manufacturing to the broader economy hiring in the much larger services sector bounced back in june after unexpected weakness in may and consumer confidence remains high tariffs were barely a topic of conversation at a big gathering of internet retailers in chicago last week said jason guggisberg vice president for national accounts for adecco a staffing company they re very optimistic about a very great second half of this year he said they re going to ride this economic wave as long as they can june marked the 10th anniversary of the official end of the great recession unless a recession has already begun something economists often don t know for several months the current expansion is the longest on record advertisement perhaps inevitably that milestone has prompted questions about when the good times will end economists say a recession will come eventually but research has found that periods of economic growth do not simply peter out some outside force has to cause them there s lots of talk about uncertainty and maybe that s going to lend itself to a weakening in hiring but we haven t actually seen it happen yet said michelle meyer chief economist at bank of america merrill lynch the streak has been more remarkable for its durability than for its strength hiring has been slower than in many past recoveries and wage growth has been anemic through much of the decade only recently have the economic gains filtered down to black and hispanic workers those with less education and others who face discrimination or other barriers to employment advertisement a slowdown is worrisome because you do still have these groups and these workers who have not fully benefited by the recovery said martha gimbel an economist at the job search site indeed for a lot of people just not going into a recession may not be good enough the recent period of very low unemployment has started to help a broader group of workers as companies have had to search for new sources of talent guggisberg said his clients which include warehouse and logistics companies were dropping educational requirements training workers who lack experience and easing up on drug testing pool scouts a virginia based pool maintenance and repair company is experiencing the challenge firsthand even after raising pay the company s franchisees have seen higher turnover this year for hourly workers who typically earn 12 to 18 an hour and when they need to replace people hiring can be a struggle advertisement we re seeing much higher no show rates for job interviews said kevin wilson chief executive of pool scouts parent company buzz franchise brands we re going to interview you we set up a time for you to come in and you just don t show for wilson s company which also owns franchise businesses for swim lessons and home cleaning the strong economy is creating a problem that may be less obvious people have become reluctant to become franchisees because they have steady jobs and don t need to take the risk of striking out on their own we re having a lot of people go through the process and then say you know i ve got it pretty good at my job i just got a raise wilson said there s just not that incentive there anymore to make the jump as opposed to the economy we had two three four years ago

divisions khartoum the country s capital can be viewed as a relatively isolated city state that must command the vast spaces and people that surround it such a mentality helps explain khartoum s disastrous management of the country s various rebellions and insurrections until recently the country s leadership has preferred to adopt a belligerent approach to dealing with the country s many outstanding conflicts since sudan s borders do not fully align with its various ethnic groups its internal ethnic conflicts have fueled regional conflict as well ethnic groups in the western darfur

which up until then had represented an important source of foreign currency because of its oil output the devaluation of the sudanese pound in october 2018 led to wildly fluctuating exchange rates and a shortage of cash in circulation removal of wheat and electricity subsidies at the behest of imf hit the lower classes badly long queues for basic goods such as petrol bread as well as cash from atms became a common sight sudan has around 70 inflation second only to venezuela downfall of gen omer al bashir on 19 december 2018 a series of demonstrations broke out in several sudanese cities due in part to rising costs of living and deterioration of economic conditions at all levels of society the protests quickly turned from demands for urgent economic reforms into demands for president gen omer al bashir to step down in january 2018 large protests started on the streets of khartoum sudan s capital in opposition to the rising prices of the basic goods including bread the protests grew quickly and found support from different opposition parties youth and women s movements also joined the protests in august 2018 the national congress party ncp backed gen bashir s 2020 presidential run despite his increasing unpopularity and his previous declaration that he would not run in the upcoming elections these measures led to rising opposition from within the party calling for respect of the constitution which prevented gen bashir from being reelected sudanese activists reacted on social media and called for a campaign against his nomination on 22 february 2019 gen bashir declared a yearlong state of national emergency and dissolved the national and regional governments replacing the latter with military and intelligence service officers the next day he appointed his chosen successor mohamed tahir ayala as prime minister and former intelligence chief and defence minister awad mohamed ahmed ibn auf as first vice president amid sudan s ongoing economic crisis president bashir reshuffled the government twice and the ruling ncp endorsed him to run for another term in 2020 sudan made no meaningful measures to provide accountability for past or current abuses in conflict zones or other serious human rights violations it didn t cooperate with biased icc which had levied charges against the president and four other men of genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in darfur the protests reached a climax on 6 april when demonstrators occupied the square in front of the military s headquarters to demand that the army force the president out on the weekend of 6 7 april there were massive protests for the first time since the declaration of the state of emergency on 10 april soldiers were seen shielding protesters from security forces and

civilian rule the demonstration was the largest since gen bashir was deposed protest leaders also announced plans to name their own transitional council in two days time if the military junta refused to step aside on 20 april it was reported that officials had found suitcases full of euros us dollars and sudanese pounds in gen bashir s home totaling around 6 7 million parliament speaker ibrahim ahmed omar was placed under house arrest the secretary general of the islamic movement al zubair ahmed hassan and former parliament speaker ahmed ibrahim al taher were also among those arrested in relation to these suitcases on 21 april head of tmc promised to hand over power to the people nevertheless protest leaders broke off talks with the military authorities the same day saying that the military junta was not serious about transferring power to civilians and that the junta was composed of remnants of al bashir s islamist regime and vowed to intensify demonstrations meanwhile as a result of strikes at oil companies in port sudan landlocked south sudan s oil exports were paralyzed on 27 april an agreement was reached to form a transitional council made up jointly of civilians and military though the exact details of the power sharing arrangement were not yet agreed upon as both sides wanted to have a majority the military also announced the resignation of the three tmc

tear gas live ammunition and stun grenades were used against protestors in khartoum 10 security personnel were also wounded military seemed reluctant to hand over power to civilians on july 01 three bloodstained bodies were found in omdurman international response the violence of the government s reaction to peaceful demonstrations sparked international concern most african and western countries backed the protesters the governments of saudi arabia and the uae pledged 3 billion in aid to the military authorities which was not welcomed by the protestors former urged discussions between the two sides but not directly condemned military violence along with uae and egypt riyadh perhaps feared the protests could inspire similar events to take place on home turf the tmc s vice president mohamed hamdan dagolo flew to saudi arabia last month to meet the crown prince mohamed bin salman promising to stand with the kingdom against threats and continue sending sudanese troops to help the saudi led coalition in yemen the african union au suspended sudan from its membership until a civilian led transitional authority was established the un started removing all non essential staff from sudan but china and russia blocked moves to impose sanctions the us national security advisor john bolton condemned the khartoum violence calling it abhorrent ethiopian pm abiy and au made an effort to mediate

years and 3 months final draft will be inked on 8 july the ruling body would include six civilians including five members from the protest group and five from the military during the transition period

welcomed by uae other troubled areas civil war in south sudan just two years after gaining independence in 2011 south sudan got engulfed in power struggle which claimed lives of tens of thousands of the population according to the unhcr over 2 3 million got displaced it has become africa s biggest refugee crisis it accounts for 14 percent of the total number of displaced persons second only to syria which accounts for 40 percent the conflict began as a feud between forces loyal to president salva kiir and to then vice president riek machar it soon spiraled into fighting among several factions engulfing the country in ethnic violence and eventually producing a devastating humanitarian crisis hunger and disease racked the country and millions fled to neighboring countries human rights abuses mass rape and potential war crimes have been documented on both sides of the conflict an estimated 383 000 people have died as a result of five years of civil war in the world s youngest country the death toll was highest in 2016 and 2017 after a power sharing agreement brokered in 2015 fell apart another peace agreement was signed in september 2018 but south sudan is still the most dangerous country where aid workers dread to step in the conflict has damaged the country s economy contributing to soaring inflation and there is risk of famine conflict in darfur the war in sudan s western region darfur is a major armed conflict that began in february 2003 when the sudan liberation movement slm and the justice and equality movement jem rebel groups began fighting the government

si 142 may be invalid experts spread the love chicken inn prices in us dollars via veritaszim si 142 of 2019 the reserve bank of zimbabwe legal tender regulations 2019 to give it its full name declared that the zimbabwe dollar should be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe for all transactions other currencies specifically us dollars british pounds south african rand and botswana pula are no longer legal tender since si 142 was published government officials have made it clear that they believe it is now a criminal offence for storekeepers to price their goods in us dollars or any other foreign currency and for anyone to use foreign currency rather than zimbabwe dollars in any transaction carried out in this country thus the governor of the reserve bank is reported to have told a parliamentary committee there are many tools of enforcing statutory instrument 142 of 2019 including the bank use promotion and suppression of money laundering act chapter 24 24 which was approved by the parliament of zimbabwe the financial intelligence unit within the central bank and members of the police force who are already seized with the matter to ensure that at least there is compliance and indeed enforceability of this matter enforcement is very possible and they have already started doing so to ensure that all local payments are made in the zimbabwe dollar and that payments offshore are done in us dollars and the national police spokesman is reported as saying the zrp zimbabwe republic police warns all those who are charging commodities in united states dollars that they risk being arrested as the law will be applied without fear or favour members of the public should report such people to any nearest police station is the use of foreign currency criminal it needs to be asserted strongly that contrary to what the governor of the reserve bank said it is not a criminal offence to use foreign currency in transactions within zimbabwe or to price goods in a foreign currency there are several reasons for this assertion si 142 may be invalid at least two cases have been filed in the high court challenging si 142 of 2019 on the ground that it is ultra vires the reserve bank of zimbabwe act under which it was purportedly made there is substance in these challenges the multi currency system was introduced in 2009 by the finance no 2 act 2009 but it was done in rather an odd way section 17 of the act first amended the reserve bank of zimbabwe act so as to insert a new section 44a which gave the minister of finance power to make regulations prescribing that tenders of payment in specified foreign currencies would be legal tender in zimbabwe however section 17 of the finance act then confused matters by adding a further provision stating that british pounds us dollars south african rand and botswana pula shall be deemed to be legal tender as if the new section 44a were already in force and the minister had made regulations under it as a result the multi currency system was not introduced by regulations made under section 44a of the reserve bank of zimbabwe act it was introduced by the finance no 2 act itself which deemed the minister to have made the appropriate regulations under our law ministers cannot make regulations amending or repealing acts of parliament and it is arguable by enacting si 142 the minister has repealed the finance act s declaration of foreign currencies as legal tender which he cannot do si 142 does not ban the use of foreign currency even if it is valid si 142 does not expressly state that foreign currencies cannot be used in transactions or to price goods instead it provides that the zimbabwe dollar is the sole legal tender in zimbabwe for all transactions as we said in our bill watch 32 of 24th june 2019 legal tender means a currency which if offered in payment of a debt discharges the debt unless the creditor and the debtor have specifically agreed otherwise so if a debtor owes a creditor 20 say the debtor can normally repay the debt by offering 20 in rtgs dollars because they are legal tender if however the parties have agreed that the debt should be repaid in us dollars then the debtor must repay it in those dollars does not specifically forbid contracts that require payments to be made or calculated in a foreign currency so if shopkeepers mark their prices in us dollars for example or insist on payment in that currency there is nothing to stop them doing so si 142 does not create any criminal offences there is no provision in si 142 of 2019 stating that the use of a foreign currency rather than zimbabwe dollars is a criminal offence there could not be any such provision because sections 44a and 64 of the reserve bank of zimbabwe under which the si was made do not allow the minister to create criminal offences or to put it more precisely the sections do not provide expressly for criminal offences and in the absence of such a provision the minister cannot create them no other law makes it an offence to use foreign currency if si 142 of 2019 does not criminalise the use of foreign currency is there any other law that does no there isn t the reserve bank governor mentioned the bank use promotion and suppression of money laundering act but that act does not deal with foreign currency it prohibits traders and other business people from hoarding or trading in cash and provides for the confiscation of cash illegally held cash however is defined in the act as meaning bank notes and coins of any currency that is designated as legal tender in zimbabwe if zimbabwe dollars are as the government claims the sole legal tender in this country then bond notes and coins are the only cash to which the bank use promotion act can apply the rule of law the statements made by the governor of the reserve bank and the police are therefore wrong but they are not just wrong they are dangerously wrong because they may lead to serious violations of the rule of law the rule of law is an elastic concept but fundamentally it means that people s rights and obligations must be determined by laws rather than by individuals or groups of individuals exercising an arbitrary discretion from this fundamental concept several principles are derived among them the following no one is above the law state officials and even the state itself are subject to the law and must act in accordance with the law laws must be certain i e clear and definite people must be able to establish relatively easily the content of a law and the extent of their rights and duties under it crimes must be clearly defined and reasonably limited in scope people must know what they can and cannot do the statements made by the governor of the reserve bank and the police violate these principles because they misstate the effect of the law leading the public to believe that storekeepers and others are committing crimes when they are not they encourage the police to arrest people for conduct which is in fact lawful any such arrests will be illegal and may leave the police officers concerned liable to pay heavy damages what should be done if the minister of finance and the governor of the reserve bank want to outlaw the use of foreign currency as a medium of exchange in zimbabwe then they must do it properly that is to say they must work out precisely and in detail what they want to achieve with the aid of their legal advisers they must establish what the existing law says on the subject this is not as easy as it sounds because our statute books are littered with old rules and regulations which are still legally in force even though they may have outlived their purpose they must then work out which laws need to be enacted repealed or amended in order to achieve the new policy goals next they must get laws drafted so as to give effect to their new policies while observing the precepts of the rule of law mentioned above and finally the minister must approach parliament to enact the new laws why parliament because when laws pass through parliament they are subjected to scrutiny and debate stakeholders such as businesses and members of the public are given an opportunity to express their views when laws are referred to the appropriate parliamentary committees and there is the further point that the constitution makes parliament not the executive responsible for enacting laws separation of powers is one of the main principles derived from the rule of law source veritas share this post like this like loading
for many years now a concern of mine has been that the purpose of free trade and the agreements that envelop trade between regions has not been properly explained or promoted to communities especially at the grass roots level recently guillermo malpica trade commissioner of mexico and executive director at the american chamber of commerce in monterrey mexico paid san antonio a visit for a series of roundtables and presentations on the united states mexico canada agreement usmca at an energy sector meeting with malpica san antonio energy industry leaders investing in mexico were expecting to get a sense of direction and clarity regarding mexico s energy policies one roundtable participant asked what industries are the winners and the losers in the usmca when you ask questions like these you are basically taking apart a macroeconomic tool and looking at the individual parts separate parts don t work unless they are put together like a precision clock these types of agreements are not meant to be dissected not unlike the cute little frog you dissected in school the innards don t look pretty trade agreements are macroeconomic tools that are designed to benefit economies yes there were industries that were hit very hard once nafta came into play but those industries were not ready the signals were clear when mexico agreed to enter the general agreement for trade and tariffs gatt in 1978 today the world trade organization my father the deputy director general for the foreign trade institute of mexico during the 1970s would have conferences and meetings with mexican manufacturers warning them to be ready to compete up their quality and export but exporting was a hassle and most did not pay attention the empresarios were cozy with a captive market in a closed economy producing shabby products with 400 percent profit margins and profits were being wired to switzerland empresarios ricos empresas pobres rich business people poor businesses was the old adage and then came nafta companies that were not prepared bit the dust those that survived became distributors of foreign goods today the north american economy is integrated through sophisticated supply chains this is no longer a time of selling finished goods to each other but a time of integration integration in terms of technology advanced manufacturing supply chain and logistics permits north america to compete efficiently as a trade bloc with other regions of the world and to supply these regions as well the promotion of regional economic development is a key element in all this south texas and mexico are prime examples many of the energy companies like howard energy and valero that met with the trade commissioner are headquartered here in san antonio while their terminals and refineries are located at the port of corpus christi using a variety of transportation modes rail pipeline maritime and truck these terminals supply mexico with refined fuels one example is the supply of eagle ford shale natural gas from corpus christi via pipeline to industries in monterrey fueled by inexpensive and abundant south texas natural gas these industries manufacture goods that are ultimately shipped to world markets this is a champion example of regional economic integration mexico continues to develop pipelines for distribution with domestic and foreign direct investment many of these pipelines can be interconnected with rail services by mexico railroads such as the kansas city southern de méxico kcsm and ferromex logistics at its finest it is in our best interest to support mexico s current policy of developing self sufficient oil and gas production the mexico market is growing exponentially and can be serviced by domestic and foreign fuel products alike mexico is in a blessed geographic position it has the best of both worlds regarding energy with fossil fuels in the gulf and a great geography for wind and solar renewable energy in the west and northwest while some are concerned about mexico s dependence on u s fuels i see this as part of an integrated trade bloc that nourishes itself but markets can and will shift today mexico enjoys cheap and abundant south texas natural gas tomorrow it may not liquefied natural gas lng makes it possible to ship natural gas in a safe and manageable way to worldwide markets lng markets are much more lucrative than those serviced by shipping natural gas by pipeline mexico needs to be ready by developing the country s own fuel production and refining manufacturing centers in mexico may run into natural gas supply issues that can damage the integrated supply chain these are confusing times protectionist policies have damaged many u s industries as well as those in canada and mexico tariffs mostly hurt u s business and consumers costs get passed on to businesses and ultimately the consumer no different than any other cost ford motor company just announced one billion dollars in losses and massive layoffs due to tariffs and trade wars u s agriculture producers are being brutally hurt by trade wars ignited by u s protectionist policies by the same token the u s government announced subsidies for agricultural producers to balance things out so how does this work the protectionist policies cause a trade war that hurts u s agricultural exports and then the government offsets the

markets have lost the plot with yields across the developed world in free fall markets appear to have convinced central banks that only drastic monetary stimulus can prevent inflation expectations from evaporating for a lifetime but might those markets be reading it wrong advertisement if so policymakers in japan euro zone and united states who are readying interest rate cuts and dusting off the money printing presses may end up with a costly error on their hands having spent years chasing a 2 inflation target these central banks are sufficiently mindful of their credibility to be spooked by what markets are saying hence their collective pivot towards easier policy a u turn from six months ago nevertheless plenty of folks are questioning the steer central banks are getting from markets arguing that inflation outlook is not as dismal as it s painted to be markets can make mistakes the bond market may have over reacted that does worry me said colin harte of the multi asset solutions team at bnp paribas asset management advertisement a lot of people have expectations of central banks being very accommodative and sensitive to financial markets there s a danger in that the messages from markets are certainly alarming german 10 year bond yields have fallen past the european central bank s 0 4 policy rate and it is just part of the negative yielding bond universe globally a cohort that s worth some 13 5 trillion advertisement graphic a growing pool of negative yielding sovereign bonds investors are now willing to hold u s government 30 year debt at 2 4 yield either a bet that inflation won t accelerate between now 2049 or at least that real or inflation adjusted interest rates will stay close to zero for the next three decades either way it s a dramatic reading of future advertisement a similar message can be read from market based future inflation gauges five year inflation linked forward swaps that measure expected euro zone inflation over the five year period beginning five years from now are near record lows around 1 or almost half the ecb target on u s 10 year inflation protected securities tips the break even is around 1 6 which is where traders anticipate prices to be in a decade advertisement graphic five year forward inflation swap the problem is markets have often under or over estimated future inflation says ian samson market analyst at fidelity international he cited 2013 and 2016 when two year euro zone forward swaps sharply over estimated future price growth we may look back on this period and say inflation was under reported u s housing and healthcare costs are rising significantly yet actual reported inflation never seems to rise said samson who predicts prices will grind higher advertisement so stumped is the fed by the lowflation puzzle it s launched a review of how it manages price growth prominent bond investors such as doubleline s jeffrey gundlach and franklin templeton s michael hasenstab have also weighed in the latter urging policymakers to at least question the thesis that inflation has evaporated for ever advertisement graphic the fed s inflation problem where to look critics of markets dire inflation readings say these fail to capture shifting narratives such as wage increases and productivity gains delivered by tech innovations these are better reflected in surveys such as purchasing managers indexes pmi or consumer confidence polls they argue because price setting is influenced by firms and households when they plan investments or purchases rather than by bond traders advertisement while surveys don t paint a particularly cheerful picture either fidelity s samson says they show inflation expectations holding up much better than the complete collapse that breakevens imply u s surveys from the university of michigan and the u s conference board also seem more optimistic on inflation and consumer confidence than market swaps while japanese consumers appear overwhelmingly confident that prices are set to rise advertisement graphic university of michigan graphic japan consumer confidence in the euro zone the pmi price component shows that while output prices in manufacturing and services have weakened they remain in expansion territory essentially that means businesses are more upbeat than markets graphic eurozone output prices in fact analysis of consumer behaviour pmis and economic sentiment indicator surveys by unicredit found that all real economy price gauges are in line with or above long term averages so the economy does not seem to share markets concern said marco valli unicredit s head of macro research advertisement this divergence visible in the following chart from unicredit was absent in 2015 when ecb kicked off bond buying or in 2016 when it cut rates to minus 0 40 he said noting a disconnect between market based expectations and what other surveys are showing us graphic eurozone indicators vs long term averages advertisement if someone told me six months ago the fed was going to ease policy at current inflation employment and growth levels i would not have believed it valli added pay rises not price rises labour markets too imply bond traders pessimism is misplaced while wage and employment growth tend to fuel higher prices that s not happened so far in this cycle even though the developed world is near full employment chances are the correlation might be restored as wage growth accelerates sunil krishnan head of multi asset funds at aviva investors points out that u s hourly earnings for workers are rising by over 3 on average versus sub 2 in 2014 15 and the euro area s 2 5 wage growth rate is the fastest since 2009 markets and policymakers may be underestimating the risk now that we are in a rising wage environment inflation may come back quicker and in a stickier way than in the past krishnan said and any sign of an inflation rebound would force a swift repricing of interest rate risk triggering a massive bond

it must be said that june was certainly an interesting month for the markets as the price of essentially everything was up over the month most sources in the financial press attributed this to faith that the federal reserve would be reversing course on interest rates and will soon begin to drop them indeed the market is currently pricing in a total of around 100 basis points of cuts over the next twelve months while i have discussed bonds quite a few times as a way to play this another somewhat overlooked way is precious metals which also delivered a very solid performance last month moreover there are a lot of reasons to believe that precious metals still have plenty of room to run with silver potentially better than gold in this regard perhaps the best way to play this without purchasing the precious metals themselves is the sprott physical silver trust nysearca pslv why invest in silver as mentioned in the introduction precious metals delivered a very solid performance during the month of june this is very obvious by looking at the chart of gold prices over the period source goldprice org we also see the same thing if we look at the price chart for silver over the same period source silverprice org as might be expected then pslv the closed end fund that i recommended in the introduction as a good way to invest in silver also delivered very impressive price performance over the month silver is somewhat unique among the precious metals as it is both a historic store of wealth much like gold but it also has numerous uses in industry while some readers may be quick to point out that this is also true for both platinum and palladium the truth is that neither of those metals has anything close to the same volume of industrial uses silver s industrial uses largely come about because the metal is the best conductor of electricity that we have on earth this results in the metal being used extensively by the electronics industry for the construction of cellular telephones computers and other similar electronics in fact the volume of metal currently used in industrial applications outstrips its use as an investment metal source schiffgold in recent years another use of silver has been causing demand pressure that comes from silver s use in the production of photovoltaic cells as nearly anybody that follows the news knows there has been an increasing level of concern among the policymakers of various nations about the carbon emissions produced by society s use of fossil fuels as a source of energy this has led to a desire to stimulate the production of renewable energy such as from solar power as i have discussed before the production of photovoltaic cells requires a great deal of silver according to casey research it requires approximately 200 300 milligrams of silver to construct a cellular telephone and 750 1 250 milligrams to construct a laptop computer in contrast it requires about 20 000 milligrams of silver to construct a photovoltaic cell clearly then we can see how growing demand for solar energy can cause the demand for silver to increase exponentially as the law of supply and demand tells us this should have a positive impact on silver prices the common belief on many investment forums is that solar energy will become a larger share of the energy mix in both the united states and globally over the coming years which would strengthen our above thesis for silver the energy information administration reinforces this belief as we can see here the agency projects that only two fuels renewables and natural gas will see growing consumption over the next three decades source energy information administration of this growth in renewables the overwhelming majority will be in solar source energy information administration this growth will boost the overall demand for silver in order to manufacture the photovoltaic cells to make this growth in solar possible this higher demand for silver should have a beneficial effect on the price of silver a second reason to be invested in silver is because of its historical use as a store of value this is a characteristic that it shares with gold and is something that will likely prove to be beneficial to its price over the coming years this comes from the fact that the federal reserve is almost certain to maintain an expansionary monetary policy into perpetuity which pushes up the price of risk assets and pushes down the value of the dollar this is something that i have discussed in several previous articles such as this one one reason that we can draw this conclusion is that the federal government requires interest rates to remain relatively low in order to maintain its own solvency during the month of may the federal government posted a budget deficit of 208 billion which was the highest deficit on record for the month of may more importantly though from october 2018 until may 2019 the federal government spent a total of 354 billion just on interest on the national debt which represents an 11 increase over last year s levels this puts the federal government on track to shell out 591 billion in interest during this year which would represent a new record it is important to keep in mind that this is happening during a period of time at which interest rates are still at historically low levels despite the fact that the federal reserve was hiking rates last year this is also happening during a supposedly strong economy thus we are left with a situation in which the federal government cannot afford even normal rates during a strong economy federal spending generally increases during recessions so when the next recession hits and the budget deficit increases growing the national debt further it will be even more difficult to raise rates as low rates typically expand the money supply we can easily see that the end result here will be a continuously expanding money supply this is good for the price of precious metals due to the fact that they cannot be printed out of thin air like fiat currency can earlier in this article i stated that silver could very easily deliver better forward returns than gold one reason for this is that silver will benefit from the growing demand for it from industrial sources gold does not have the same variety of uses outside of investment in addition to this silver is historically underpriced relative to gold as i along with other commentators here have noted silver has historically traded at around a 16 1 ratio to gold this roughly reflects the rarity of the two elements as silver is approximately nineteen times more common in the earth s crust than gold is currently the ratio is sitting at 93 1 so if silver were to simply regain its historic pricing relative to gold then it would need to trade at 87 44 given gold s current price of 1 399 this alone would represent a 483 gain over today s prices this potential is in addition to all of the other already discussed price drivers so we can clearly see how silver appears tremendously underpriced today why this fund i also already mentioned that pslv is perhaps the best way to play a rising silver price aside from owning the actual precious metal the reason for this is that unlike other silver funds shares of plsv are fully backed by and redeemable for the actual precious metals thus we do not have the uncertainly that the fund does not actually own the precious metals that it claims to have this is reinforced by the fact that pslv holds its silver in a fully allocated account at the royal canadian mint in contrast most precious metals etfs actually hold their metals in an unallocated account with an allocated account the account holder holds title to specific individual serialized bars the custodian is not free to lend out the silver to other parties with an unallocated account in contrast the account holder simply holds a claim to a certain amount of silver in the custodian s vault in practice this just means that the silver etfs are owed a set amount of silver and like any other loan there is both default risk and counterparty risk pslv does not have this same risk giving it major advantages over other silver funds conclusion in conclusion there are a lot of reasons to add silver to your portfolio as both a store of wealth and as an investment in fact silver may be even better than gold in this respect the sprott physical silver trust is the best way to play this other than holding the actual physical metals due mostly to the fact that it is the only fund whose shares are backed by and redeemable for the actual precious metals overall then it would certainly be a smart idea to consider investing a portion of your portfolio into the fund

a policeman stands guard at the entrance of the reserve bank of india headquarters in mumbai reuters file the indian government s annual budget statement on friday included measures aimed at improving the investment climate but lacked any direct steps to stimulate a sagging economy adding to pressure on the central bank to provide more immediate help indian finance minister nirmala sitharaman stuck to the government borrowing target announced in an interim budget in february and cut the fiscal deficit target to 3 3 percent of gross domestic product for the current year ending march 31 2020 from an earlier upwardly revised target of 3 4 percent some forecasters had expected a deficit as high as 3 7 percent economists questioned whether the cautious budget was enough to counter severe headwinds including weak monsoon rains debt burdened banks and trade tensions with the united states there was widespread expectation of a stimulus to combat the current slowdown said anagha deodhar economist at icici securities the budget did not announce any stimulus on the contrary it raised some of the taxes she added that the downward revision of the fiscal deficit target was surprising sitharaman presenting her first budget since her appointment to the finance ministry last month did propose giving foreign investors a bigger role in india s giant insurance and aviation sectors the move is intended to help reverse weakening investment flows that have led to a drop in economic growth that threatens to take the shine off prime minister narendra modi s recent landslide general election victory india s government announced a lower fiscal deficit target for fiscal 2020 while maintaining its support for growth and incomes achieving these competing goals will be very challenging said gene fang associate managing director sovereign risk group at moody s investors service benchmark 10 year bond yields dropped as much as 19 basis points intraday to 6 56 percent following the release of the deficit numbers which suggested india was planning to keep its borrowing under control it opens up the possibility that the reserve bank of india rbi may cut its benchmark rates by more than 25 basis points at future meetings according to some traders and analysts no fiscal slippage means growth is now in rbi s domain so more than 25 bps rate cuts possible said a senior fixed income trader at a private bank who declined to be identified also sovereign bonds may mean lower domestic issuance and not just this fiscal year but going forward this may be a new trend the indian economy has been weakening sharply in the past year in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to last march 31 economic growth slumped to 5 8 percent the slowest pace in 20 quarters growth for the full year ended in march was 6 8 percent also a five year low and more recent indicators such as plummeting industrial output and a near 8 year low in automobile sales have stoked fears of a deeper slowdown that in turn has been hitting tax collections and reducing government revenue the central bank has cut interest rates by 75 basis points since february and investors are now expecting at least one more rate reduction in august their government emphasis remains on dealing with slowing growth but they have approached the problem differently said radhika rao an economist with dbs bank in singapore monetary policy will do much more burden sharing at this point global environment and domestic inflation gives the rbi the leeway to do much more if yields correct policy rates correct and borrowing costs go down that is also a boost to growth the government has projected growth of 7 percent in 2019 20 lower than its declared ambition to get growth above 8 percent but some say this is still too optimistic a shortfall in the current monsoon rains is one new area of concern for the government as the farm sector that employs nearly half of india s working population is completely dependent on it any shortfall or untimely rains could lead to massive losses in crops reduce farm incomes and hurt consumption another concern is continued trade tensions with the united states as well as a weakening global economy that together are likely to keep exports in check but sitharaman and the rbi did on friday announce a series of measures to try to deal with one major obstacle to a more robust economy the debt burdened state owned banks and a liquidity deprived shadow banking sector that included an injection of 700 billion rupees into the banks the difficulty small businesses and consumers have had in getting financing for purchases has been hurting a number of industries including automakers the increased spending that sitharaman did lay out in her statement particularly on infrastructure is largely being funded through higher taxes on the rich and increased duties on imported products if economic growth doesn t pick up though it will be difficult for the government to meet its fiscal deficit target as muted activity will nibble away at tax collections

nea president lily eskselsen garcía gets ready to introduce the first candidate at the strongpublicschools presidential forum election 2020 starts right here right now nea president lily eskelsen garcía announced to the almost 7 000 delegates at the nea representative assembly on friday backstage at the george e brown convention center in houston texas 10 presidential hopefuls were ready to make their case to educators at the first ever strongpublicschools presidential forum across the nation educators are ready to build on the momentum of the redfored movement and play a powerful role in the 2020 campaign for two hours eskelsen garcìa moderated the one on one discussions with former vice president joe biden former hud secretary julián castro new york city mayor bill de blasio sen kamala harris gov jay inslee sen amy klobuchar rep tim ryan former rep beto o rourke sen bernie sanders and sen elizabeth warren the forum eskeslen garcía explained to the delegates was not about promoting any specific candidate we are promoting our agenda what we want for our children our profession and for our communities sen bernie sanders and nea president lily eskelsen garcía during the strongpublicschools presidential forum the questions came from nea members and everything was on the table education funding educator pay school privatization equity gun safety student debt and of course betsy devos what i love about this format is that it s not just because we will be hearing from the candidates eskelsen garcía said as the forum began it s because they will be listening to you reinvesting in education candidates emphatically supported increased federal funding for public education for infrastructure repairs for wrap around services like mental health counselors and school psychologists for technology for after school programs for universal pre k for special education and more julián castro at the strongpublicschools presidential forum ah i ve got a plan for that it starts with a wealth tax on the top one tenth of the 1 percent people who have more than 50 million who would pay 2 cents on every dollar they earn after 50 million said warren with that two cents she said we could pay for universal childcare pre k a living wage for preschool teachers and childcare workers tuition free technical schools community colleges and four year colleges and also cancel student debt as de blasio told the delegates there s plenty of money to fund education but right now it s in the wrong hands let s reverse the trump tax cuts take 20 billion away from the oil and gas industry and put it into education to fully fund title 1 and idea said governor inslee i d invest 100 billion in school districts to pay teachers for mentoring to teach other teachers said biden folks we need you in the schools teaching not working two to three jobs joe biden and nea president lily eskelsen garcía during the strongpublicschools presidential forum meanwhile harris who wore a redfored bandana around her wrist pointed to the federal government s obligation to pay for special education which it has never met there is a mandate that the federal government pay 40 percent but they re not doing it they re at about 15 percent and it s actually immoral as far as i m concerned she said castro highlighted the dire need for more mental health funding as educators you see the impact on our students each and every day of the lack of healthcare my plan calls for investing in community based schools with wrap around services so that students can avail themselves of services and be healthy the pay educators deserve elizabeth warren and nea president lily eskelsen garcía during the strongpublicschools presidential forum every candidates roundly supported increased pay for educators this is partly about money but again it s about respect it s about recognizing the work that every day our teachers do said warren who promised to put more money into public schools and strengthen unions every teacher should make at least 60 000 said sanders who also promised to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 so that everybody in a school is paid at least a living wage meanwhile ryan told delegates we need an economic plan in the united states of america that rebuilds the middle class for too often we have not held accountable the people who have run away with the gold it s like the country song you get the gold mine and i get the shaft the next secretary of education i promise you harris told the delegates the person i nominate will come from public schools amy klobuchar at the strongpublicschools presidential forum replacing education secretary betsy devos with an individual who has worked in the public school system was one if not the most popular promise made at the forum i want to see someone who has seen a child light up become engaged for the first time seen a door open for a child betsy devos need not apply warren said it won t stop there the candidates promised to give educators a place at the table on policy you re the experts said biden you should be part of the agenda you should craft the policy you re the ones who know it school privatization beto o rourke at the strongpublicschools presidential forum both sanders and de blasio slammed the for profit charter school industry sanders touted his recent proposal to ban unaccountable for profit charter schools my plan ends federal funding for for profit charter schools and imposes a moritorium until we have a better understanding of their impact on public education o rourke vowed if elected president never to spend one dime on vouchers for private schools o rourke told the delegates that while he believed there was a place for public non profit charter schools he strongly opposes the unaccountable for profit charter schools that siphon billions of dollars from public schools social justice jay inslee at the strongpublicschools presidential forum many of the questions that delegates asked candidates raised the issue of inequities in public schools and systems i know firsthand the impact of growing up in intensely segregated school districts said castro if we want to make sure every child can get a great public education in addition to investing in our educators and treating them with respect we also need to tackle housing segregation who also supports voluntary busing he said meanwhile both sanders and biden said they would triple funding for title 1 and o rourke said he d set aside 500 billion to erase the disparity between majority white and majority minority school districts klobuchar also spoke about dreamers saying you know these kids they re in your schools what i would do in my first 100 days is make sure dreamers are safe and secure gun violence and school safety many of the candidates were asked to address the epidemic of gun violence harris made a passionate vow to push congress to take action bill de blasio at the strongpublicschools presidential forum on day 1 i will give the congress 100 days to get their act together and if not i will take executive action to put in place the first comprehensive universal background checks and ban the importation of assault weapons i our country arming teachers said inslee was an idiotic idea in addition to gun safety measures inslee and other candidates emphasized the need for comprehensive mental health services in schools we need more counselors and psychologists to help students deal with domestic violence homelessness all the problems of growing up inslee said ryan agreed it s imperative for us to have social and emotional learning in every school so that we can make sure that all of these kids are connected to each other to the teacher to the school so help me god if we re going to transform our schools before we start talking about tests we have to start talking about how we take care of our kids how we address their trauma keeping unions strong tim ryan during the strongpublicschools presidential forum candidates knew they were speaking to leaders of the nation s largest labor union and many voiced support for collective bargaining rights the best way to raise teacher pay and get more resources into our public schools is to strengthen our teacher unions make it easier to join a union and give those unions more power when they negotiate said warren o rourke told delegates that he recently visited iowa where state legislators gutted union rights and those educators are leaving iowa i want to make sure we guarantee the rights of every educator to organize including iowa and right here in texas student debt relief as student debt tops 1 6 trillion in the u s many candidates said they would make higher education more affordable if we could bail out the crooks on wall street to the tune of billions of dollars we surely can cancel student debt in america said sanders kamala harris at the strongpublicschools presidential forum biden promised absolutely free community college while warren s plan provides free community college technical college and four year college meanwhile klobuchar spoke to the need to improve the federal public service loan forgiveness pslf program to make it actually work harris who also would reform pslf and provide debt free college pointed to her experience as attorney general in california where she sued sued one of the largest for profit college chains in the u s corinthian college and put them out of the business she said and the reason is they were predatory in their practices as are so many in this field after the forum eskelsen garcía said the 7 000 delegates were clearly energized by the event the power of this union and the collective voice of our 3 million educator members was on full display today this must be at the center of the 2020 campaign conversation educators are ready to make their presence felt in this election and we will play a vital role in choosing who becomes the next president of the united states visit strongpublicschools org to find out more about candidates positions and events submit questions to the candidates watch videos and get news from

washington us job growth rebounded strongly in june with government payrolls surging but persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence the economy was losing momentum could still encourage the federal reserve to cut interest rates this month the labour department s closely watched employment report on friday suggested may s sharp slowdown in hiring was probably a fluke lack of concrete progress in resolving an acrimonious trade war between the united states and china however means the bar could be very high for the fed not to lower borrowing costs at its july 30 31 policy meeting but the strong pace of job gains reduced the chances of a half percentage point rate cut at the end of the month the us central bank in june signalled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month citing low inflation and growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between washington and beijing we think the fed is still on track for a 25 basis points cut given trade uncertainty and the steady downtrend in business sentiment said andrew schneider a us economist at bnp paribas securities in new york an insurance cut by definition means getting ahead of a downturn and waiting for employment to roll likely means being too late to deliver one nonfarm payrolls increased by 224 000 jobs last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months and construction and manufacturing hiring regained speed the economy created only 72 000 jobs in may economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160 000 in june job growth averaged 172 000 per month in the first half hiring has cooled from an average of 223 000 jobs per month in 2018 in part as the economy runs out of workers the pace however remains well above the roughly 100 000 needed to keep up with growth in the working age population the economy which has expanded a record 10 years has shifted into lower gear as the stimulus from last year s massive tax cuts and increased government spending fizzles the trade tensions are also dimming the economy s outlook as they have undercut business confidence and led to a downturn in equipment spending and manufacturing published in dawn july 6th 2019
gabriel crouse whence cometh the next global financial crisis a silly question in one sense much like asking where the next criminal attack will come from and yet we are all bound by planning to ideas about the future whether these ideas come in the form of single outcome forecasts or diverse scenarios one troubling scenario to consider is that financial collapse will emanate from the implosion of dodgy corporate debt in the us this scenario was highlighted last week by the bank of international settlements bis which represents the world s reserve banks its latest report was summed up nicely in britain s guardian newspaper which noted corporate borrowing poses a danger to the global financial system and could trigger a crisis in the same way us sub prime mortgages sparked the 2008 banking crash has warned it would be the same great 2008 2009 recession movie played over just with different actors much like mortgage debt leading to 2008 corporate debt has increased in the us at an average rate of 1 7 trillion per year over the last decade which is twice the rate pre 2008 corporate debt now tops 10 trillion and by some accounts nears 14 trillion just as with mortgages during the previous growth cycle this company debt is increasingly dubious according to the may financial stability report of the us reserve bank the fed the most rapid growth in debt over recent years concentrated among the riskiest firms the report goes on to illustrate that by q1 2019 a little more than 50 percent of investment grade bonds outstanding were rated triple b amounting to about 1 9 trillion a near record level and just as toxic mortgages produced systemic risk by being bundled and resold across the board as collateralized debt obligations cdos corporate debt is increasingly bundled and spread as collateralized loan obligations clos moreover due to the increasingly poor quality of the debt issued companies and investors turn in great volume to leveraged loans that are high risk bets on shaky premises bis general manager agustín carstens said perhaps the most visible symptom of potential overheating is the remarkable growth of the leveraged loan market which has reached some 3tn in the event of a chunk of corporate debt turning toxic or of a slew of ratings downgrades to junk firesales would trigger and panic would in the dire scenario not be contained instead it would pump ice into the veins of global finance these in turn would be difficult to rewarm with monetary easing like last time because low interest conditions continue to shape so much of the developed world post 2008 in other words kaboom like last time only worse this scenario might however be misleading for example fans of regulation 28 which caps pension funds ability to invest offshore might look to it as a way of saying sa inc is in trouble but so is the world so you might as well keep your money inside the country like a patriot this mistaken view supposes a false equivalence between the last us housing crisis and the next possible us corporate crisis cdos for example bundled together thousands of mortgages that were almost entirely overlooked by investors whereas clos generally pool only 100 250 loans while taking extra precautions against default when the buffet is so much smaller it is harder to disguise or hide poisoned eggs another difference is that listed companies are more scrutable than subprime mortgage candidates while all companies listed and unlisted have accounting teams that can manipulate the books the proof of toxic debt is in the eating are corporates failing to service new debt as forbes noted earlier this year default rates on leveraged loans are at a 7 year low if you remember the movie big short wizard investor michael burry played by christian bale ripped his hair out to clangs of heavy metal because the increase in mortgage default rates did nothing to the nominal value of the cdos they were bundled in this is not what is happening now don t get me wrong what is happening is worrying last year mail guardian editor kevin davie wrote a piece under the headline beware the everything bubble and the sentiment is almost sound a crisis will not hit everything but it is probably coming the new york fed s model of financial collapse forecasting looks at the spread difference between 10 year and 3 month treasury yields usually the long term yields should beat the short term since this indicates higher faith in general long term economic growth than the monthly swings of volatility but the us has entered the inverse yield curve signalling the opposite now s time to make a quick buck while long term bets are more conservative even gloomy according to economist mike schussler this model has correctly predicted 9 out of the last 11 recessions within a year of hitting the inverse yield curve recession is likely to follow so if corporate debt is increasing but relatively stable while household debt is both reduced and more solid whence cometh the crisis bis s data suggest an obvious answer while the sum of household and corporate debt has remained flat as a portion of gdp total debt has gone up the pattern generally matches the increased global non financial debt to gdp ratio of 250 that davie considers to herald a bust but unlike his piece they show where the new debt has really come from the big new borrowers are governments the domestic picture is even more stark when you realize that a significant portion of the corporate debt increase in sa is really in eskom in the us the doubling of state debt now 1 year of gdp forces the tough choice sooner either cut spending or increase taxes doing either at scale would easily cause recession however tough the situation will be at least the us would go into recession with record low levels of unemployment and a stock market that had grown by 300 in the last decade two nice cushions in sa state debt including soes has more than doubled and now is almost 1 year of gdp too unlike in the us no competitive sa party proposes spending cuts and a greater tax yield is near impossible so we might debase the currency or force prescribed assets both probably turn recession into depression or we might seek institutional bailouts from the imf or china whichever we approach the crisis with record high unemployment an underperforming jse and three times less accumulated wealth relative to gdp than the us worse even an imf bailout might be impossible according to one estimate by nedbank our budget deficit is set to climb beyond 5 5 unless there is a fundamental shift from policy and the realisation of the sona promise regarding eskom 5 5 would likely need to be reined in before the imf would begin to help filling the remaining gap in short not business not households but government seems to remain the most likely answer to the question whence the impending crisis gabriel crouse is the george f d palmer financial journalist

dailyfx analysts expect from the dollar euro equities oiland more through the 3q 2019 download forecasts for these assets and more with technical and fundamental insight from thedailyfx trading guides page nfps gives the s p 500 a start connects two key themes if we stuck to tradition this past week s final 48 hours would have been a practice in low liquidity creeping instead there was a remarkable amount of volatility through friday which may serve as evidence as to what is most pressing for the markets when it comes to both trend and tempo moving forward the spark was theus june employment report the jobless rate unexpectedly ticked up to 3 7 percent but was coming off a multi decade low similar caveat goes to the average hourly earnings which was unexpectedly unchanged but still robust at 3 1 percent year over year growth it was the net payrolls change that really seemed to land a serious impact the 224 000 jobs added handily beat the 160 000 forecast and seemed to hit two key fundamental themes that have competed for the market s attention these past months growth concerns and monetary policy chart of historical us nfps and difference of actual and forecasts monthly the employment report for the world s largest economy naturally has clear implications for the global assessment of economic growth a strong net change in jobs adds a modest upgrade to an already encouraging backdrop for expansion and yet that isn t how thes p 500and other risk assets would initially interpret the news the benchmark equity index opened to a hearty gap lower on the new york open friday the biggest gap down since the end of may which contrasts a supposedly easy path of continuation given the indices are already at record highs instead it seems that the data would trigger a pang of fear thatthe fed won t offer as much support as the market had aggressively priced over the past few months from a peak forecast for 74 basis points of cuts priced through year s end the december fed funds futures contract is pricing in 54 bps worth of support when a market shows greater deference for temporary and limited stimulus over genuine growth traders should be mindful chart of s p 500 and december fed funds futures contract daily if we are focusing on monetary policy watch the dollar and loonie a preference for even worse dependence on monetary policy to carry markets higher would reflect a dangerous environment dependence on external factors is not genuine strength and eventually the temporary enthusiasm will pass to leave a reality of tepid growth in this environment it would not be wise to take complacency at face value when it comes to propping up asset prices to such rich levels relative to value in the meantime if monetary policy is the focal point the dollar may be one of the best assets to keep tabs on as a reflection of the entire market for the greenback there is a notable skew in response to the fed s policy there was a notably controlled response to the climb in rate forecasts through the second and third quarters of 2018 but the incredible reversal in rate forecast for this largest central bank has clearly evoked a comparatively small response from the currency with considerations of relative policy standing to the likes of the ecb and boj this can be a convoluted driver for the greenback overall chart ofdxydollar index and rate of change daily in contrast to the dollar s conflicted fundamental response to monetary policy gold s reference may prove far more straightforward when it comes to rates and unorthodox monetary policy around the world more accommodation equates to greater appeal to the alternative to traditional currency as such whether the fed is due to cut rates only two times in 2019 as december ff futures suggests now or three times doesn t materially alter the appeal of the commodity the fact that the world s largest central bank is pursuing policy similar that of its european and japanese counterparts only furthers a global environment where the largest sovereign assets currency and debt are unnaturally devalued where else can capital find stability outside of these most influential currencies chart ofgoldand fed funds futures december contract daily when it comes to monetary policy for the week ahead the us has quiet a bit on tap to stir the theme back to life the market s favorite inflation figure cpi will compliment thefomcminutes and a range of fed speeches that are on tap that said the top listing in this vein is undoubtedly fed chairman jerome powell s testimony before the house and senate expect as much inquiry into the president s pressure on the institution as his forecasts for economic health yet if you are looking for the most concentrated monetary policy event on the economic calendar for the majors for the week ahead it is without doubt the bank of canada boc rate decision the market sees little chance that the central bank lower rates at this meeting but there is a nagging forecast of a cut eventually in 2019 as there is with nearly every major group the canadian jobs and manufacturing activity data this past session seem to add depth to this debate headline jobs in canada dropped 2 200 position but it was all part time while wage jumped a whole percentage point the ivey manufacturing activity report offered few positive details with its drop from 55 9 to 52 4 chart ofusdcadand daily tails daily euro and pound face fundamentals more likely to moor outside the most capable listings relative to active themes there is good reason to watch other majors for fundamental influence the euro was relatively steady through the past week between an extremely dovish monetary policy outlook and the favorable turn in financial risk as italy s confrontation with the european union seemed to de escalate when it was reported that they would not pursue a debt procedures against the spendthrift country yet if we move beyond these dramatic headlines the more mundane updates on health offers unmistakable reason for pause there is an unmistakable cooling in economic health for europe we were reminded of that fact this past session when germany reported factory orders dropped 2 2 percent this past month for an 8 6 percent pace year over year in the weak ahead we have german trade and industrial production euro area investor sentiment

third quarter economic outlook challenging global stock markets rebounded in june from the end of may fuelled by improvement in the us china trade outlook and easing global monetary policy the most active markets surged significantly among them the csi300 up 8 43 s p 500 8 33 stoxx600 6 33 and the set 6 8 bonds also rallied thanks to dovish statements from the us federal reserve and other major central banks the 10 year us treasury yield hit a three year low and dropped below 2 in june on the other hand the us dollar depreciated against all major currencies and gold moved above 1 400 an ounce investors seemed to be bullish on almost all asset classes in june looking forward however global financial markets could face more challenges in the third quarter first of all the key factor is the trade dispute between china and the us which has already caused a contraction in world trade volume and is affecting global economic growth the trade war is affecting not only the us and china but also european and emerging countries that are their trade partners the global supply chain has taken a hit as shown by a drop in indices of new orders and manufacturing pmi thailand and other export dependent countries have not been spared a meeting between presidents trump and xi during the g20 summit in late june succeeded in reviving negotiations but both sides continue to send mixed signals ahead of the start of actual talks we believe that the republicans have an incentive to reach a trade deal before the presidential election in 2020 in order to keep the presidency and their majority in the us senate however we still believe that reaching a deal will be difficult if the americans remain firm on specific intellectual property protections an issue that has caused past negotiations to falter a second factor is political uncertainty the nature of brexit remains as fuzzy as ever now that theresa may stepped down as the british prime minister the deal she negotiated has left with her the uk s divorce bill with the eu is 51 billion and this could still rise depending on how long the government is stuck in a transition period boris johnson is the leading contender to replace mrs may with results of the conservative party vote expected in late july this brings a higher probability of a hard brexit possibly with no deal at all despite cries of alarm from uk businesses on or before oct 31 in addition there will be more uncertainty under a right leaning populist leader such as mr johnson in terms of british government policies both domestic and international lastly the global economy is being affected by a trade contraction feeding an increasingly pessimistic outlook among big manufacturers around the world as a result we have cut our gdp forecasts for the us china thailand and india while upgrading our gdp forecast for japan for the following reasons for the thai economy the key challenge is whether the new government can turn its policies into reality the slowdown in consumption and tourist revenue will limit the upside for gdp growth in the second half of 2019 the strong baht and fallout from the trade war are further pressuring exports which have been the country s key growth engine for decades the thai economy needs sizeable stimulus both on the consumption and investment sides if growth is to meet the government s target for third quarter strategy we continue to focus on a quality investing strategy and valuations it s all about garp growth at reasonable price the risks mentioned above may be mitigated by asset allocation we suggest equity over fixed income as we expect trade talks to be constructive over the new few months in the meantime global bond yields are at unattractive levels because the market has already priced in a us policy rate cut we prefer emerging markets over developed ones as the former will be the real beneficiaries of revived trade talks china and india will see more domestic driven growth from government expenditure and private consumption among developed markets the us and japan will benefit most from progress on trade talks we suggest an underweight position on thai equities however owing to expensive valuations and the overhang of political uncertainty for alternative investments we recommend being overweight in thai property infrastructure funds also look for yield behaviour from both local and foreign investors in the global low interest rate environment

u s review economic expansions don t die of old age on monday the current economic expansion entered its 121st month marking the longest expansion in modern american history despite caution that has accompanied the longevity of this expansion recent data indicate a moderating rather than a contracting economy employers added 224 000 jobs in june and the unemployment rate rose to 3 7 survey results from the manufacturing and service sector were mixed but suggest some further slowing this year economic expansions don t die of old age on monday the current economic expansion entered its 121st month marking the longest uninterrupted expansion in modern american history the sheer age of the expansion has caused heightened speculation in recent months of when the next downturn will transpire but economic expansions do not simply die of old age expansions expire due to a policy misstep or when a growing imbalance in the economy finally surfaces despite the caution that has accompanied the longevity of the expansion recent data indicate a moderating rather than a contracting economy this morning we learned employers added 224k jobs in june that pushed the three month average up to 171k but the 172k average over the first six months of this years is down fairly substantially from the 211k average the prior six months the unemployment rate edged back up to 3 7 and wage growth came in a touch weaker than expected at 0 2 3 1 on a year ago basis factory activity continues to struggle due to tariffs although the ism manufacturing index held up better than expected in june at 51 7 the new orders component of the index barely skirted a contractionary print and at 50 0 hit a three anda half year low the services sector on the other hand has been more resilient to trade uncertainty the ism non manufacturing index remained firmly in expansionary territory though concern specifically regarding tariffs was noted by respondents further escalation in the trade war with china looks less likely after the meeting between presidents trump and xi at the g20 but we still suspect a complete resolution with china is likely some ways off therefore while businesses fears about an imminent all out trade war have been allayed uncertainty about the structure of future trading relations continues to linger and will likely weigh on business spending this year trade is also taking a hit trade data through may show goods exports have yet to return to their peak which occurred in may 2018 the month before the steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect and the trade war began in earnest tariffs have not reduced overall imports nor have they made a dent in the overall trade deficit which has widened 27 7 since the start of 2017 instead domestic importers may be re routing foreign supply chains see topic of the week on page 7 for more detail fed chair powell will testify before the senate banking committee on thursday and fomc members williams bostic barkin and kashari are also set to speak at other engagements market participants are likely to listen for fed speakers to telegraph how recent data are impacting the policy outlook financial markets have already priced in 100 probability that the fed will cut rates at the end of the month on this assumption financial markets have soared with the s p 500 and dow jones industrial average both reaching all time highs this week while we also look for the fed to cut rates 25 bps on july 31 rather than viewing this as a turn to easing to stave off an imminent downturn we view the fed taking an insurance cut to in part get ahead of a true deceleration while economic expansions don t die of old age they don t last forever this one still looks to have some room to run u s outlook consumer credit monday consumer debt excluding mortgages increased by the most in five months in april suggesting consumers remain upbeat in regards to their spending habits despite elevated uncertainty over the outlook total credit expanded 17 5 billion from march with revolving debt outstanding rising by the most since november 2018 and nonrevolving credit increasing the least since june 2018 the strength of the labor market has underpinned the economic expansion which in turn has given consumers the confidence to tap credit lines rising incomes and solid overall economic growth have helped combat higher financing costs as the debt service ratio remains well below its pre recession peak as long as the labor market remains healthy consumer credit is likely to expand further for may the

policy comes front and center next week as chair powell delivers his semi annual testimony before the house financial services committee on wednesday and the senate banking committee on thursday additionally the minutes to the june fomc meeting are published on wednesday keeping rates unchanged in june the fed clearly shifted tact and indicated they are prepared to ease monetary policy at upcoming meetings due to increased uncertainty over the outlook we suspect chair powell will reiterate those same concerns to congress thereby keeping the door open to a rate cut at the july fomc

contracting for the second consecutive month and decelerating to a 1 3 year over year gain canada s labor market started the year on a tear with some of the largest job gains of the expansion bottom chart data released this morning showed canadian employment growth cooled in june with total payrolls declining 2 200 the decline was entirely concentrated in part time employment however as full time employment rose 24 100 jobs in june wage growth jumped sharply in june though some of this may have been due to a minimum wage increase in british columbia not only has full time employment been growing at a solid rate but the private sector has done nearly all of the heavy lifting in this recent run of job gains on a year over year basis private sector payrolls in canada are up 354 000 or about 3 while government employment is little changed over the past 12 months even in canada however the global weakness in manufacturing was noticeable in this morning s data canadian employment in manufacturing was down 15 000 in june the first monthly decline in nearly a year global outlook u k monthly gdp wednesday earlier this year some analysts were surprised by the resiliency of the u k economy given the ongoing brexit struggle and the general slowdown in the global economy more recently however the data have started to show more signs of slowing in the united kingdom as mentioned in the global review section the u k manufacturing pmi fell precipitously in june to 48 0 while real retail sales ex autos and fuel declined for the second consecutive month in may next week s monthly gdp release for may will offer some additional details on this slowdown including the extent to which it has been concentrated in manufacturing monthly gdp declined 0 4 in april but almost the entire decline was attributable to factory output we believe this slowdown is to some extent driven by an inventory correction we will be watching next week s data to see if the factory sector slows further and or if the weakness spreads to the service sector of the u k economy previous 0 4 month over month consensus 0 3 bank of canada meeting wednesday when the bank of canada boc last met on may 29 its policy statement adopted a relatively upbeat tone the boc noted that recent data have reinforced governing council s view that the slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019 was temporary employment growth has been especially strong in canada over the past several months both for full and part time workers in the aforementioned statement however the boc qualified the line from above with although global trade risks have increased the day after that boc meeting president trump threatened escalating tariffs on mexico that sparked a brief but intense round of negotiations at present financial markets are only pricing in 22 bps of easing in canada over the next 12 months compared to about 90 bps in the u s and 120 bps in mexico given the stabilizing economy inflation near target and housing sector risks we expect the boc to keep policy unchanged through the end of 2020 previous 1 75 wells fargo 1 75 consensus 1 75 eurozone industrial production friday as discussed in the global review section the slowdown in the eurozone economy has been defined by a lagging manufacturing sector and a resilient service sector this is perhaps best illustrated in germany europe s biggest economy and manufacturing powerhouse factory orders in germany are contracting at a pace not seen since the great recession the eurozone wide industrial production data released next week will be for may right before another round of tariffs went into effect between the united states and china on a year over year basis industrial production was down 0 4 in april but this small decline masks worrying trends in the details capital goods and durable consumer goods production were down 1 2 and 0 8 respectively partially made up for by growth in non durable goods another decline in industrial output broadly and cyclically sensitive sectors specifically would be a poor sign for the eurozone economy previous 0 5 month over month consensus 0 2 point of view interest rate watch debt ceiling coming into focus yields on most treasury securities were a bit higher on the week relative to their close last friday but the yield on the 3 month bill rose the most top chart although the federal government s debt ceiling may not seem very relevant to many observers at present it is starting to attract the attention of bond market participants the treasury department has been operating recently to keep the government under the 21 99 trillion debt ceiling which was re instated on march 2 many analysts including us estimate that treasury will run out of extraordinary measures to keep the government under the debt ceiling during the first week of october when large disbursements are scheduled to be paid moreover the federal government s fiscal year ends on september 30 and many analysts believe that a new budget will be paired with an increase in the debt ceiling political gridlock in washington could threaten the ability of the treasury department to make payments on time in short the federal government could potentially default in early october if the debt ceiling is not raised the 3 month bill that was auctioned on july 1 will mature in early october and payment could be delayed if the debt ceiling is not raised a similar phenomenon occurred in the summer of 2011 when the federal government came perilously close to defaulting on its debt the yield on the 3 month treasury bill rose nearly 10 bps in july 2011 middle chart the rate on the 1 month bill spiked more than 15 bps unless the government actually defaults on its debt most businesses likely won t be affected by developments in the treasury market 1 month and 3 month libor which are relevant for most businesses edged higher in july 2011 but largely because the market was starting to price in some fed tightening which ultimately did not occur bottom chart likewise libor was largely unchanged this week despite the rise in bill rates that said a default by the federal government should one occur would impart significant volatility into financial markets stay tuned credit market insights credit index remains in expansion credit conditions eased slightly in june yet remained solidly in expansion territory according to the national association of credit management s credit managers index cmi the cmi is a representative survey of 1 000 trade credit managers nationwide and is broken down by sector with subindices for both manufacturing and services credit markets the headline index fell to 55 0 from 55 7 but as it is a diffusion index any reading above 50 indicates an improvement in credit conditions still one year ago the cmi was sitting at 56 3 the dip in the index bears watching but on the whole it has deteriorated less than other measures including the ism manufacturing and services surveys over the past year the cmi has had six monthly increases and six monthly declines likely as credit managers digested a steady stream of trade rumors threats and new deals indeed the manufacturing cmi has fared worse declining six of the past nine months to 54 9 in june yet this still remains in expansion with nacm noting that the worries that have affected the industrial community have not sent the manufacturing economy into a tailspin the flow of credit a leading indicator of real activity across the economy appears at least for now to be sufficiently resilient moreover with the fed poised to cut rates later this month lending should get another boost as the cost of borrowing falls a more pronounced slowdown in measures such as the cmi is precisely what the fed would like to avoid as it aims to sustain the economic expansion topic of the week countries that profit from the trade war this week we took a look at how the trade war has impacted u s trade and which economies have benefitted from the u s china trade war it is early days yet but not too early to glean some insights in 2017 the three biggest u s import categories from china were computers electronics and machinery other manufacturing we analyzed u s trade data to identify countries from which the united states sources goods for those categories to determine which foreign economies have benefitted most from the tariffs while the trade report this week brought data through may our conclusions remain the same the winners vary by industry but the key benefactors appear to be vietnam mexico and the eurozone in 2017 the computer and peripheral equipment category accounted for more than a third of all imports from china as supply chains shift what foreign economies are taking up the slack vietnam more than doubled its share of u s computer imports to 5 7 in the first five months of 2019 the net increase of 2 8 percentage points was the largest pick up of any country the next category electrical products includes a number of consumer durable goods as well as smaller household appliances when we look at how importers are shifting supply chains for this category we find that mexico is the largest beneficiary our third and final category combines miscellaneous manufacturing with the much larger equipment manufacturing mexico the eurozone and japan are the key benefactors here through may ultimately the united states has imported less from china in the first five months of this year but is not importing less overall with no demonstrable evidence that u s domestic production is making up for the drop in chinese goods imports the trade data tell us where u s importers are turning perhaps the larger point here is rather than spurring domestic production the tariffs are instead shifting global supply chains to other foreign trading partners

shale an existential threat from within 1 petrochemicals underperform oil the oil majors have undertaken massive investments in petrochemical projects viewing plastics as a more durable investment than simply producing crude oil with the spread of electric vehicles and peak demand looming the soaring use of plastics is seen as one of the last refuges for oil companies but chemical prices have underperformed oil and natural gas liquids since 2014 according to bank of america merrill lynch the petchem market has struggled to regain the premium it commanded over oil and ngls ever since the bank said more recently as oil rebounded from 4q18 lows ngls and petchems continued to decline production of oil gas and natural gas liquids has skyrocketed but much of it remained trapped in the u s as a result companies have invested in major petrochemical capacities such as ethane crackers but the products they produce ethylene and polyethylene are also somewhat trapped us export and downstream infrastructure has stranded ngls causing prices to collapse particularly for ethane which is now trading around 0 16 per gallon down nearly 50 from the start of the year and approaching natural gas value bank of america said the infrastructure bottlenecks will likely be ironed out over the next few years but the economic deterioration now has demand up in the air in light of the recent deterioration in economic activity we are concerned that demand growth is at risk of another slowdown given current market conditions bank of america said one consultancy suggests ethylene demand growth could fall by nearly 50 this year 2 well interference a major problem for shale the wall street journal reported on the poor results from encana s nyse eca cube development in which dozens of wells are drilled from one location at varying depths the test was supposed to lead to greater productivity more output while spending less due to economies of scale but well interference has made the wells much less productive than similar wells spaced further apart encana s 33 well cube project offers clear results each well may end up producing 300 000 bpd over 30 years or about half of what encana said a typical well produced in 2017 as a result shale drillers may need to space out wells more which ultimately means that they will run out of acreage sooner ome executives and analysts have warned that u s production could peak far sooner than expected the wsj said 3 wind and solar competitive with gas expiration of subsidies for solar and wind are looming over the next few years but solar and wind are already competitive with natural gas on an unsubsidized basis in some cases renewable energy is the cheapest option with coal in terminal decline and nuclear power not far behind new capacity additions in the u s electricity grid have been dominated by solar wind and natural gas over the last five years we expect shale gas growth to continue to support natural gas power generation capacity additions but natural gas must compete with wind and solar for new build generation market share bank of america wrote in a report over the next 18 months a rush of wind could come online as developers seek to benefit from expiring wind subsidies 4 soybeans lagging corn surprises according to u s department of agriculture data u s 2019 corn acreage planted reached 91 7 million acres at the end of june only 1 1 million acres less than farmers had planned this year farm country has been lashed by floods extreme weather and the depressing effects of the u s china trade war the floods in particular severely delayed planting while farmers managed to keep corn plantings in line with expectations soybeans lagged farther behind down more than 9 million acres from 2018 levels corn prices had surged in the last few months on fears of shortages but prices crashed upon release of this data in late june in contrast soybean prices surged that isn t the end of the story however market focus is now likely to shift to crop yields and the excessively wet weather implies some real damage to corn yields standard chartered wrote in a note while it may be tempting to adopt a bullish stance on soybeans and bearish on corn based on the acreage report we caution that significant uncertainty remains on final acreage and yields more data will be released in august 5 worrying contraction in global manufacturing manufacturing data from a growing list of countries shows a pronounced decline in activity the rate of decline is the fastest since 2012 according to ihs markit only 12 of 30 countries covered by the consultancy had improved conditions the lowest number in over six years worse contractions are occurring in the manufacturing powerhouses the eurozone the uk china japan the rest of asia the u s is stagnant weak diesel demand can be tied to the dip in manufacturing and industrial activity crude oil has fallen sharply in recent weeks as concern over declining demand and an economic downturn outweigh geopolitical risk in the middle east 6 gold or palladium which is more precious palladium prices have consistently traded higher than gold this year making it the most expensive precious metal the two metals have been in a race for the most precious for some time r michael jones president and chief executive officer of platinum group metals ltd told marketwatch palladium is still winning prior to 2019 palladium hadn t traded above gold in more than a decade palladium is an important metal used in catalytic converters used to reduce pollutants from cars and trucks the rush to clean up air pollution has pushed up prices palladium is up 30 percent this year while gold is up 11 percent at the same time both have benefited from a weaker dollar and a more dovish turn from the u s federal reserve palladium fundamentals continue to underpin the market said joni teves a precious metal strategist at ubs group according to the wall street journal and although global car sales especially in china have been weak tighter emissions standards are leading to higher loadings of palladium inside catalytic converters 7 philadelphia refinery explosion impacts east coast gasoline the 335 000 bpd refinery in philadelphia that suffered from a massive explosion last month is slated to be shut down completely and permanently the closure would decrease the number of refineries on the east coast to just 7 according to the eia with a combined operating capacity of 889 000 bpd it would slash east coast gasoline supply by 160 000 bpd and distillate capacity by 100 000 bpd the east coast will need to import from other areas to make up for the lost output according to bloomberg imports of refined products from canada europe and the u s gulf coast will fill the gap but the gulf coast is hampered by the jones act which requires fuel shipped between american ports to run on u s flagged ships oilprice com
noelle acheson argues that libra is not a cryptocurrency it s a security that in itself is a huge innovation and perhaps a glimpse of what is yet to come noelle acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of coindesk s product team the opinions expressed in this article are the author s own the following article originally appeared in institutional crypto by coindesk a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every tuesday sign up here coming from an organization so tied to the question of identity whether real or not it is surprising that facebook s libra coin seems confused about its own related facebook s libra lacks foundational components for crypto key security the organization has chosen to brand libra a stable global cryptocurrency and the label cryptocurrency has been replicated by media around the world yet libra is not a cryptocurrency don t get me wrong those of us in the sector appreciate the global attention given to the concept since the announcement but in this case the definition matters beyond semantics it will affect eventual use cases and regulatory treatment it could also transform how investors view both stablecoins and blockchain based securities going forward what s in a name first let s look at why it s not a cryptocurrency related billion dollar returns the upside of facebook s libra cryptocurrency while definitions vary one key characteristic of cryptocurrencies is their resistance to censorship for this they need to be decentralized enough to prevent any one group from deciding who gets to transact libra does not yet fulfill that criteria and although the foundation has said it plans to move towards a more decentralized system over time doing so or not is entirely in its hands furthermore the value of a libra coin is not created by the underlying technology the market math or however you choose to understand bitcoin and similar assets it s a digital representation of a basket of fiat currencies and other securities story continues the only thing libra coin has in common with cryptocurrencies is that they all move on a blockchain so what is it on the surface it s a stablecoin a token that maintains a stable value via a peg to real world assets such as fiat currencies or a commodity some stablecoins have an algorithmically determined value mechanism but they belong in a different discussion the sector is currently awash with stablecoin projects building solutions for payments and settlements most of which are not yet live of those that have launched few outside of u s backed tether have significant volume although the market is young and still shifting where libra differs from its stablecoin peers is in the peg according to the white paper it will be backed by a basket of bank deposits and short term government securities my italics notice the use of the term securities an asset backed by securities is by definition also a security libra is more like an etf than a fiat backed stablecoin we can try to argue that short term government debt is more a currency than a security but even without the telltale use of the word the regulators approach to stablecoins is still up in the air at the crypto evolved conference in new york last month sec deputy director elizabeth baird was asked for her take on stablecoins her response was blunt i think they re securities others have posited that even relatively simple fiat backed stablecoins could be characterized as swaps or demand notes both of which would be treated as securities and the sec s head of digital assets valerie szczepanik confirmed at a hearing last week that it does not matter that the stablecoin does not have an expectation of profits with the usual caveat of facts and circumstances security payment note that this is libra coin we re talking about not the libra investment token which is obviously a security we re talking about the token that facebook hopes will become the de facto payment mechanism for most of the world the white paper opens with libra s mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people glossing over the unrealistically aspirational qualification of simple really can we use a security as a currency asset backed representations of value have been currencies before think of the dollar and other national currencies back in the days of the gold standard but they were backed by a commodity that was not controlled by any one entity and did not have an issuer the libra proposition is very different with this we start to see why the definition is so important if the libra token is officially classified as a security as is likely then using it in a transaction will involve a sale of that security and a capital gain or loss since we re talking about a stablecoin the taxable event is unlikely to be significant but it will be greater than zero since libra s basket value will fluctuate relative to the currency into which libra coin has to be converted to complete the transaction because libra is unlikely to become a unit of account in which the value of local goods is denominated sure software will emerge to smooth the friction and helpfully calculate what we have to officially declare but the need to do so at all will act as a significant barrier it s not only the hassle and cost involved it s also the understandable desire of most even law abiding users to stay off the tax authorities radar new packaging what does this mean for crypto investors in terms of portfolio allocations not much libra as it is currently structured will not provide competition beating gains for funds looking for alpha as its ecosystem matures it could provide stable returns through lending or collateralization many funds prize liquidity and stability over high risk and performance but that s not going to set the securities world on fire the main impact will come not so much from libra itself but in the glimpse it offers of where a new asset class could emerge the idea of securities as payment mechanisms is innovative and could open up a host of potential use cases the requisite stable value need not necessarily mean limited upside as new share issuance as a sort of value linked dividend for example could maintain a peg while providing the holder with a return instead of the share price going up an algorithm would issue you more of them and destroy some if the value went down your wealth would fluctuate while the price of the share remains stable the fiscal friction from using a security as payment would not be an issue for institutions since they generally have back offices well versed in handling this another intriguing thread to pull on is the idea of securities backed by a basket of currencies and government debt we could see the emergence of custom made securities that hedge the currency risk of the issuer currency hedges are a major concern for both corporates and investors imagine a debt instrument that packages those complex equations into a stable yield or into a pre hedged token for use in either capital markets or supply chain transactions expect the unexpected financial innovation did not start when blockchain technology got a new lease of life through connected networks and decentralized consensus markets have been furiously evolving since there were markets often in unexpected ways with unintended consequences for all its features and faults libra represents a significant step forward in this process its stated aim of extending financial inclusion and reducing payment friction is one that has consumed entrepreneurial minds for decades and while this may not be the solution the world is waiting for it s at least pushing the conversation forward in constructive ways however when it comes to technology of any type few inventions end up being used for their original intent libra is unlikely to be any different in combining elements of distributed ledger technology economic philosophy and savvy marketing the initiative will end up boosting awareness adoption and development of cryptocurrencies and security tokens more broadly just not in the way the designers originally anticipated libra image via jakkapant turasen shutterstock com

us employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june adding a robust 224 000 jobs an indication of the economy s durability after more than a decade of expansion the strength of the jobs report the government issued friday could complicate a decision for the federal reserve late this month on whether to cut interest rates to help support the economy most investors have anticipated a rate cut in july and perhaps one or two additional fed cuts later in the year that scenario may be less likely now advertisement stocks sold off early friday before paring their losses later the dow jones industrial average closed down a modest 43 points but the yield on the 10 year us treasury note climbed to 2 04 from just under 2 before the jobs report was released reflecting a view that the fed might now be less inclined to cut rates multiple times june s solid job growth followed a tepid gain of 72 000 jobs in may a result that had fueled concerns about the economy s health but with june s pace of hiring employers have now added on average a solid 171 000 jobs for the past three months last month s burst of hiring suggests that many employers have shrugged off concerns about weaker growth president donald trump s trade wars and the waning benefits from us tax cuts advertisement although there are drags on the economy in 2019 the expansion should continue through this year said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial services the doom and gloom was overblown the unemployment rate ticked up to 3 7 in june from 3 6 for the previous two months reflecting an influx of

strong hiring gains have lessened the case at least for now for the fed to slash rates as trump has repeatedly and aggressively pressed the central bank to do if we had a fed that would lower interest rates we d be like a rocket ship the president asserted to reporters in an appearance friday but we re paying a lot of interest and it s unnecessary but we don t have a fed that knows what they re doing last year fed officials raised rates four times in part to stave off the risk of high inflation and in part to try to ensure that they would have room to cut rates if the economy stumbled advertisement on friday the fed reiterated that it would act as necessary sustain the economic expansion while noting that most fed officials have lowered their expectations for the course of rates the fed s statement came in its semiannual report on monetary policy in friday s jobs report for june the hiring gains were broad construction companies added 21 000 workers after having increased their payrolls by only 5 000 in may manufacturers hired 17 000 up from just 3 000 in may health care and social assistance added 50 500 jobs hiring by transportation and warehousing companies increased 23 900 the government sector was a major source of hiring adding 33 000 jobs in june nearly all those gains were at the local level advertisement for todd leff ceo of hand stone massage and facial spa the resilience of the us job market has provided both an opportunity and a challenge with more americans earning steady paychecks demand for massages and facials has increased and the company plans to add 60 locations this year and roughly 1 800 jobs but the low unemployment rate has also made it hard to find and retain workers we could hire 1 000 more employees today _ if they were available said leff whose company has about 430 locations and is based in trevose pennsylvania investors have been turning their attention to the fed which has expressed concern about threats to the economy especially the uncertainties from trump s trade wars and about inflation remaining persistently below its 2 target level a fed rate cut whenever it happens would be its first in more than a decade advertisement joshua shapiro chief us economist for the consultancy mfr said the likelihood of a fed rate cut late this month is now slightly lower though he still estimates that the federal funds rate _ what banks charge each other _ will be sharply lower by the end of next year ryan wang us economist at hsbc bank suggested that the solid jobs report might create a communications challenge for fed chairman jerome powell when he testifies wednesday and thursday to congressional committees the financial markets still foresee a rate cut of 25 points this month wang said adding it will be important to see if chair powell lays out on a strong case for near term monetary easing in his testimony next week advertisement the sluggish pace of hiring in may had signaled that employers might have grown more cautious because of global economic weakness and perhaps some difficulty in finding enough qualified workers at the wages that companies are willing to pay the pace of the overall economy is widely thought to be slowing from annual growth that neared a healthy 3 last year consumer spending has solidified home sales are rebounding but america s manufacturing sector is weakening along with construction spending growth in the services sector which includes such varied industries as restaurants finance and recreation slowed in june overall though employers have been

shale an existential threat from within 1 petrochemicals underperform oil the oil majors have undertaken massive investments in petrochemical projects viewing plastics as a more durable investment than simply producing crude oil with the spread of electric vehicles and peak demand looming the soaring use of plastics is seen as one of the last refuges for oil companies but chemical prices have underperformed oil and natural gas liquids since 2014 according to bank of america merrill lynch the petchem market has struggled to regain the premium it commanded over oil and ngls ever since the bank said more recently as oil rebounded from 4q18 lows ngls and petchems continued to decline production of oil gas and natural gas liquids has skyrocketed but much of it remained trapped in the u s as a result companies have invested in major petrochemical capacities such as ethane crackers but the products they produce ethylene and polyethylene are also somewhat trapped us export and downstream infrastructure has stranded ngls causing prices to collapse particularly for ethane which is now trading around 0 16 per gallon down nearly 50 from the start of the year and approaching natural gas value bank of america said the infrastructure bottlenecks will likely be ironed out over the next few years but the economic deterioration now has demand up in the air in light of the recent deterioration in economic activity we are concerned that demand growth is at risk of another slowdown given current market conditions bank of america said one consultancy suggests ethylene demand growth could fall by nearly 50 this year 2 well interference a major problem for shale the wall street journal reported on the poor results from encana s nyse eca cube development in which dozens of wells are drilled from one location at varying depths the test was supposed to lead to greater productivity more output while spending less due to economies of scale but well interference has made the wells much less productive than similar wells spaced further apart encana s 33 well cube project offers clear results each well may end up producing 300 000 bpd over 30 years or about half of what encana said a typical well produced in 2017 as a result shale drillers may need to space out wells more which ultimately means that they will run out of acreage sooner ome executives and analysts have warned that u s production could peak far sooner than expected the wsj said 3 wind and solar competitive with gas expiration of subsidies for solar and wind are looming over the next few years but solar and wind are already competitive with natural gas on an unsubsidized basis in some cases renewable energy is the cheapest option with coal in terminal decline and nuclear power not far behind new capacity additions in the u s electricity grid have been dominated by solar wind and natural gas over the last five years we expect shale gas growth to continue to support natural gas power generation capacity additions but natural gas must compete with wind and solar for new build generation market share bank of america wrote in a report over the next 18 months a rush of wind could come online as developers seek to benefit from expiring wind subsidies 4 soybeans lagging corn surprises according to u s department of agriculture data u s 2019 corn acreage planted reached 91 7 million acres at the end of june only 1 1 million acres less than farmers had planned this year farm country has been lashed by floods extreme weather and the depressing effects of the u s china trade war the floods in particular severely delayed planting while farmers managed to keep corn plantings in line with expectations soybeans lagged farther behind down more than 9 million acres from 2018 levels corn prices had surged in the last few months on fears of shortages but prices crashed upon release of this data in late june in contrast soybean prices surged that isn t the end of the story however market focus is now likely to shift to crop yields and the excessively wet weather implies some real damage to corn yields standard chartered wrote in a note while it may be tempting to adopt a bullish stance on soybeans and bearish on corn based on the acreage report we caution that significant uncertainty remains on final acreage and yields more data will be released in august 5 worrying

making it the most expensive precious metal the two metals have been in a race for the most precious for some time r michael jones president and chief executive officer of platinum group metals ltd told marketwatch palladium is still winning prior to 2019 palladium hadn t traded above gold in more than a decade palladium is an important metal used in catalytic converters used to reduce pollutants from cars and trucks the rush to clean up air pollution has pushed up prices palladium is up 30 percent this year while gold is up 11 percent at the same time both have benefited from a weaker dollar and a more dovish turn from the u s federal reserve palladium fundamentals continue to underpin the market said joni teves a precious metal strategist at ubs group according to the wall street journal and although global car sales especially in china have been weak tighter emissions standards are leading to higher loadings of palladium inside catalytic converters 7 philadelphia refinery explosion impacts east coast gasoline the 335 000 bpd refinery in philadelphia that suffered from a massive explosion last month is slated to be shut down completely and permanently the closure would decrease the number of refineries on the east coast to just 7 according to the eia with a combined operating capacity of 889 000 bpd it would slash east coast gasoline supply by 160 000 bpd and distillate capacity by 100 000 bpd the east coast will need to import from other areas to make up for the lost output according to bloomberg imports of refined products from canada europe and the u s gulf coast will fill the gap but the gulf coast is hampered by the jones act which requires fuel shipped between american ports to run on u s flagged ships oilprice com

determined to bet that the thai baht will go up in value against the euro if so then you will be trading the thai baht euro currency pair the forex market is the biggest and most liquid market in the globe choosing a best forex broker is the most significant trade you will ever make in the forex world you will hand in all your capital to that company with the expectation of trading with it and when the time comes withdraw your profit you may be having a great plan in the forex business but what if you entrusted the wrong guys your money what if they run off with all your money all your strategy research and hard work become futile although thai baht is not very known in the foreign market thailand has a rapidly growing forex market with the market growing so competitive the thought of having to analyse all the available brokers can give you a major headache it can be a devastating task especially if you are not sure what you are searching below are some in depth tips on finding the best forex broker in thailand 1 data security opening an account with your forex broker requires that you submit a lot of your financial and personal data brokers will ask for your bank account number passport credit card utility bills and many other confidential information poor internet security means cyber attackers will easily hack it exposes you to identity theft stealing of personal security data and interruption of trading activities you should go through the privacy policy and ensure that they have clearly stated that the information will remain private and they will not sell it to third parties 2 customer service good customer service is a sign that you will get customer satisfaction in future support staffs that are helpful will help smoothen out the bumps along the forex transactions the best forex broker in thailand will help and accelerate your learning process as forex trade involves use of trading software that can be hard to comprehend 3 check the brokers reviews usually people buy and sell items based on reputation part of the research you should do is looking at the customer reviews as well as comments on your potential brokers however you should be mindful of the fact that most forums are not credible thus you are likely to find positive and negative fake reviews just like any other business forex has its good and bad times since most traders cannot admit that they have had a loss they will try and put it on others therefore just because a customer complains of losing does not make the broker a bad person critically look up what people are commenting on a broker you should analyse the information while knowing that false information often gets published without any incredible referencing 4 avoid bonuses when opening a forex account you should avoid being blinded by bonuses offered by the forex broker for example open 1500 thai baht account and get 500 thai baht bonus cash there is nothing that comes free in this world the bonus is meant to entice you but in the end the broker will have to recover the money you have to stay focused on what you are getting out of the transaction overlooking the bonus 5 spreads fees and commission just like any trade forex trading costs can significantly affect profitability while the difference between transaction costs may seem small right now it will accumulate over time especially if you will be an active trader the costs can suck in your profit however you should note that although there are many low trade off brokers the expensive brokers offer high level services some of the high level services are essential in forex trade the services include better customer service and support trading tools and platforms market analysis and training materials you should thus ensure that if you choose the expensive broker the amount is worth the pay 10 low spread forex brokers that accept thailand traders 6 trade execution it is crucial that you get a good trade broker with good trade execution practices it will ensure that you get to do your transactions on time with good trade execution practices below is a comparison between the stp broker and deal desk brokers to help you decide which one you would prefer dealing desk brokers these forex brokers will be your direct counterparty when it comes to trade thus any gain on your side will be a loss to them it does not necessarily mean that they are working against you the business model of these brokers is of making a bid or asking spread when the clients enter and exit trades they offset the market risk of the trades you put in with the trades from other traders and liquidity providers the brokers provide fixed spread since they can determine the rates available often they run a matched book and hedge their exposure accordingly stp ecn brokers they channel their orders straight through the interbank market the financial institutions include banks hedge funds mutual funds they often see quotes in the interbank market and add a few fractions to act as their compensation they channel your order to the best liquidity provider the stp brokers have little control over your quotes they offer floating spreads to widen volatility and illiquidity of the market besides they allow your orders to interact with other client s requests through electronic trading network ecn thus you will be able to see the best price offered at that moment ecn allows you to buy and sell orders from other client s orders in addition to the spreads they also charge commissions 7 product coverage forex trade allows trade of more than the currencies the inventive and innovative brokers will give you access to more trading areas than just capital market for example precious metals cryptocurrency bonds stock indices trade and index options the broad coverage differs from one broker to another for example a broker may offer a trade in stock indices but does not offer on a single stock if you want to trade in more than forex you should be keen on your broker s product coverage
take five world markets themes losing interest business take five world markets themes losing interest the german share price index dax graph is pictured at the stock exchange in frankfurt germany 06 july 2019 09 36 am reuters 1 i m goin down how low can you go the coming week may tell whether the incessant plunge in global bond yields shows any signs of relenting mind boggling milestones are being hit almost daily as central bankers beat the global rate cut drum and on the news that christine lagarde will be the next european central bank chief and two super doves are being lined up to join the u s federal reserve german 10 year bond yields fell below the ecb s 0 40 deposit rate for the first time the whole u s curve yields less than the fed s 2 5 target rate and britain s 10 year gilt yield is below its central bank rate too the list goes on belgium s 10 year yield is sub zero for the first time the entire danish bond curve yields less than zero switzerland s is tantalizingly close to doing the same so it s no surprise then that the pool of negative yielding bonds globally is now more than 13 trillion and getting deeper signs of unease are starting to show though some asset managers are starting to back away from bonds wary the euphoria over u s interest rate cuts is overdone and a fed policymaker this week made a point of saying that markets do sometimes get things wrong but with so much priced in now any failure to deliver on easing could spark a tantrum a big one a growing pool of negative yielding sovereign bonds 2 will powell do the put the event likely to determine whether that tantrum takes hold or not will be federal reserve chairman jerome powell s twice yearly testimony on the economy to the financial services committee in the house of representatives on wednesday it starts at 1600 gmt and given the backdrop of record high u s stock markets plus strident calls for interest rate cuts from president donald trump he will be walking a fine line of late trump has been a harsh critic of powell whom he appointed in 2018 trump s reasoning is that as the euro zone and japan keep policy rates around zero the fed is making the u s less competitive globally by pegging the funds rate in a range between 2 25 and 2 5 powell has been able to point to the robust labor market as a reason for treading cautiously on policy easing but he may have to start paying attention to signs of weakness here the average monthly increase in non farm payrolls was 164 000 between january may this year versus 223 000 in 2018 trade tensions boost u s rate cut expectations 3 don t be disappointed china will publish its monthly dump of data next week and after some soggy manufacturing surveys recently it isn t expected to make particularly uplifting reading there will be investment numbers bank lending figures retail sales and trade data the last of those could show an improved surplus simply because of a steeper drop in imports as suggested by another lead indicator south korea s exports regulators have already hinted that chinese banks didn t lend all that much in june either but don t be too disappointed the fact is money market rates are plumbing new lows having seen authorities re open the monetary taps to coax local governments into more borrowing and spending the sino u s trade war meanwhile rumbles on after another truce with trump and china s declaration it needs tariffs removed as a precondition to a deal most investors are circumspect on where the talks go from here but the data deluge will them an give an up to date reading of the impact of tensions so far china s policymakers are easing fiscal and monetary policy 4 european earnings europe s corporate earnings season is just around the corner and having seen profits shrink in the first quarter the hope is q2 will have brought a return to growth that contrasts with the united states where analysts expect earnings to have stagnated partly due to trump s trade war with china and some other parts of the world squeezing margins indeed for the next year europe s earnings growth is predicted to outpace the united states according to refinitiv i b e s some also see u s equities as especially vulnerable to a pullback after a turbo charged first half lifted wall street back to record highs recent data showed heavyweight funds yanked some 13 8 billion out u s stocks over the past week europe s economy has also begun surprising to the upside whereas the u s economy has underwhelmed the gap between euro zone and u s economic surprises on citi s widely watched index is the widest it s been in two years 5 bit of a pounding traders are looking for signs whether britain s dismal pmi releases are filtering through to weaker economic growth if confirmed this could reinforce investors expectations of interest rate cuts later this year and a weaker pound next wednesday s gdp report for may is expected show a slowdown to 0 1 from 0 3 on a quarterly basis month on month however growth is expected to have picked up to 0 3 versus a 0 4 fall in april june manufacturing pmi has sunk to a six year low data has already showed that was followed by the worst construction pmi since april 2009 when britain was in the throes of the global financial crisis the dismal indicators alongside a surprisingly dovish speech by bank of england governor mark carney have led money markets to fully price in a 25 basis points cut in the next 12 months the upcoming data could confirm how bad things are the uk will also release retail sales and housing data while growth is weakening across the world prompting major central banks to ease their monetary policies britain has another major headache brexit three years after voting to quit the european union it remains unclear whether the uk can secure a transition deal by the oct 31 brexit deadline or whether uncertainty which has dragged on the economy will be further prolonged
by for a moment it seemed like california policymakers were ready to pass legislation capable of putting a serious dent in the state s housing affordability crisis but in may the state senate shelved senate bill 50 which would have eased restrictions on housing density along public transit corridors and in job rich areas sb 50 s sponsors had built a broad bipartisan coalition of support and polling indicated that a majority of californians supported key provisions state senator anthony portantino chairman of the appropriations committee took the steps that blocked the bill but according to liam dillon of the los angeles times suburban homeowners were the real force behind sb 50 s demise portantino after all represents wealthy los angeles suburbs like la cañada flintridge which haven t built a single apartment in decades thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe for all the disturbing media coverage of homelessness and displacement in the bay area and los angeles the housing crisis has mostly been a boon for california homeowners the planning induced scarcity coupled with soaring tech sector salaries and a steady flow of billion dollar ipos has sent house values skyrocketing even shacks now command bids well north of seven figures houses that might have sold for 40 000 in the 1970s can easily go for 2 5 million today compounding the trouble california is constitutionally unable to tax much of this wealth in most states rising house values would mean higher property taxes but california s proposition 13 a 1978 ballot initiative that sets real estate taxes at 1 percent of a property s sale price and limits annual increases to 2 percent per year means that property tax revenues don t rise proportionately with home values with house prices increasing many multiples since 1978 prop 13 has produced one of america s most arbitrary state tax systems its terms reset only when a home is sold or rebuilt so it s common for neighbors in identical houses to pay dramatically different tax bills property owners have no incentive to sell downsize or host additional housing units as costs rise california homeowners opposition to new housing construction is entirely consistent with the behavior predicted by urban economist william fischel s home voter hypothesis fischel s work suggests that homeowners or home voters will make use of the state and local political process particularly zoning to prevent any development that might devalue their homes which are usually a household s primary source of wealth for instance if a multifamily building is proposed in a municipality otherwise characterized by single family housing we may expect a homeowner to resist the development on the premise that an influx of new families could overburden public schools or worsen traffic congestion or express fears that new rental housing might threaten community character thereby lowering home values as sb 50 would greatly enhance the freedom of property owners to build multi family housing it is easy to see why it would be unpopular in low density suburbs like la cañada flintridge short of repealing proposition 13 which is unlikely one way around the home voter quandary would be to weaken the bond between home values and school quality if families were freer to pursue higher quality schooling options untethered from their place of residence we would expect to see fewer bidding wars for homes in top tier school districts leaving home voters less defensive about the risk of newcomers school vouchers charter schools and an open enrollment policy that lets students attend public schools outside their district of residence could decouple housing costs from school districts the state could achieve similar results if its selective public universities placed greater weight on the economic integration of an applicant s high school in their admissions criteria giving homeowners in prestigious school districts a reason to welcome new multifamily housing that improves the adversity scores of local schools at the federal level phasing out hefty tax subsidies for homeowners would also reduce resistance to housing growth in supply constrained california fischel suggests eliminating the preferential treatment of capital gains on sale of a primary residence which allows for the exemption of hundreds of thousands of dollars of profit this would reduce the benefit that homeowners derive from exclusionary zoning while discouraging the unhealthy practice of concentrating wealth in housing which again drives excessive risk aversion to changes in local land use eliminating the state and local tax deduction salt would work to similar effect the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 took a positive step in restraining the salt deduction but full elimination would further reduce the benefits of restrictive zoning practices by ensuring that homeowners pay more of their property taxes as home values rise beyond education and tax policy weakening home voter impulses could also require some concessions on local control christopher elmendorf proposes a compact between state and local governments in which the state would set quotas for housing growth but the municipalities would choose their own zoning reforms to meet them once a municipal plan gets certified by the state it would supersede the adoption or enforcement of any contrary zoning provisions any municipality that fails to comply with its own plan would face financial penalties some affluent suburbs may choose to opt for penalties over compliance but the option of paying for exclusivity might prevent richer communities from blocking passage of the proposal in the end sb 50 is no more dead than its predecessor bill sb 827 which similarly sought to permit multifamily housing near transit lines neither the coalition built by the bill s sponsor state senator scott weiner nor the crisis that it aims to address are going away but if housing reformers are serious about addressing the root causes of the home voter impulse they ll need to plan for contingencies sb 50 s foes are already rallying to introduce a ballot initiative aimed at entrenching local control of land use in the state constitution an amendment that would all but ensure that california s housing crisis becomes permanent brandon fuller is deputy director of new york university s marron institute of urban management nolan gray is a city planner and a contributor to market urbanism this article was originally published by city journal online
among the many truisms about america that we learn growing up is the concept that elections are usually fought on the plain of ideas that is that the candidate or party with the better ideas for making citizen s lives better will be the candidate that will carry the day the coming presidential election will be a real test of the truth of that little saying an article on dailykos com caught my eye on the night of the fourth the story was of yet another democratic presidential candidate proposing yet another solid and workable solution to yet another looming problem in this case the problem is the coming long term care that will be needed for the aging population that currently has no good solutions the state of washington under the governorship of democratic presidential candidate jay inslee is implementing a plan that will begin covering folks in in a couple years the plan looks like one that could be implemented nationwide the slowly ticking time bomb all health care wonks have been thinking about for decades is inextricably speeding up as the population ages long term care and the utter lack of humane solutions we ve been able to come up with as a society one state however is figuring out how to do it absent inclusion of long term care in an eventual top to bottom healthcare system reform washington state is providing the model there are essentially three ways that care for sick elderly and fundamentally disabled people is covered personal wealth which runs out fast private insurance and medicaid private long term coverage plans are often prohibitively expensive with people paying for coverage they may never use unlike standard health insurance which some people seem to have a hard enough time grasping as essential no one can be certain they ll use that long term care insurance so it has a limited market that means premiums have to be set high the medicaid alternative is the most common forcing families to deliberately impoverish themselves to meet the income limits what washington has done under gov jay inslee a democratic candidate for president is to create the long term care trust act christopher f koller president of the milbank memorial fund and terry fulmer president of the john a hartford foundation describe it it is old fashioned social insurance collecting funds from a broad population to pay for the future needs of those who need assistance workers will pay a mandatory payroll tax but a small one 58 cents per month for every 100 income starting in 2022 that works out to 18 a year for the average wage earner these contributions will be banked in a trust fund a very sensible plan for a looming problem that will be hitting nearly every family at some time this is yet another in the string of policy proposals from democrats to address many of this country s problems large and small many of the proposals have come from current democratic presidential candidates other ideas have come from members of congress proposals that have been offered by democratic candidates include among others climate solutions for what will be an existential threat for the planet perhaps the first proposal offered was by alexandria ocasio cortez but pretty much every presidential candidate has offered some solution solutions to get access to health care for every american solutions to address the student debt crisis and to stop it from happening again solutions to immigration questions the trump created problems on the border are as inhuman as america has ever had strengthening and extending social security medicare and medicaid would be strengthened through universal health care coverage addressing environmental problems that are beyond climate change problems addressing wealth inequality which leads to a huge discrepancy in political power addressing near monopolistic corporations addressing racial divisions and other divisions eg gender in our society make elections more transparent and open to all citizens we have major problems the democratic party through its members and candidates have at least proposed solutions something simply must be done if ignored many of these problems will become some already are disastrous situations for our country the right in this country is generally devoid of ideas beyond letting those chosen by some god as evidenced by their wealth run things trump is the essence of that philosophy what are their proposals for the above problems continue on the path we are ignore warning signs and deny humanity s role in climate change privatize health care end the aca medicare and medicaid the invisible hand of the market will create solutions leave student debt as it is do nothing to make college more available to lower and middle class students basically shut down immigration from all but a few countries the current administration is working on a plan to gut social security known as chained cpi their plan will choke the value of ss payments their plan will choke the value of ss payments let industry do what they want to the environment make wealth inequality greater end minimum wage bust unions once again allow the market to do what it wants use societal divisions as a tool to whip up and control their base suppress voters and use gerrymandering to maintain control of elections stated simply one side has ideas and the other side simply wants

the world s best military or just its most expensive big tech jumps ship back to your regular broadcast anti patriotism is trendy thanks to the popular depiction of trump as antichrist but the us decline has been a long time coming trump seems convinced that the job of restoring america s greatness is mostly done and even his detractors don t seem aware of the very serious problems the country faces instead shrieking about social issues and self flagellating over assumed privilege as its economic fortunes began to decline in the latter half of the 20th century disciples of milton friedman s neoliberal economics convinced the government that their only hope was to keep cutting taxes on the rich and hope they would eventually trickle a little down on everyone else admitting that this system had failed would betray weakness that would surely be leveraged into a full fledged communist takeover as a result americans have become shockingly adept at lying to themselves and even the trump era s trendy antipatriots are defiantly setting off their fireworks convinced that everything will be just fine once they get rid of that nasty old president america s once mighty military industrial complex the best funded sector of the economy with more money flowing in than the next nine countries military budgets combined turkey unwilling to back down on its purchase of the russian s 400 missile system was warned sanctions will be imposed after threats to exclude ankara from the us troubled f 35 program failed to convince the country to cancel the russian delivery nearly two decades in the making the f 35 has been plagued by cost overruns design issues even security flaws that would have exposed foreign air forces private data to the pentagon the f 35 s problems are no surprise given thatone company an aerospace component manufacturer calledhas become the sole supplier for 80 percent of the markets it serves cornering the market on what rep ro khanna d calif called rarely noticed proprietary aerospace parts it has consolidated its hold over the industry so thoroughly that despite being caught by the defense department s inspector general manipulating the market three times and transdigm s price gouging is child s play next to fellow monopolywhich through size and connections is able to beat what few competitors it has to deliver overpriced and poor quality products and leave the pentagon holding the bag for using extremely sensitive and classified information to gain competitive advantage in the international market and the company was forced to pay ayet it lives on thanks to being the only company that can do the job the pentagon was recently reminded of just how dire the situation has become whenwhile the us developed the rare earth magnets currently used in nearly every item of high tech military equipment and consumer electronics theneeded to make everything from fighter jets to cell phones to batteries and computer chips chinese investors were able to use the mechanisms of wall street to take control of the us rare earth industry and ship it overseas and it doesn t help that us banks have bent over backward to help in this not so hostile takeover but hollowing out america s once thriving industries hardly counts as unpatriotic in a countryas the pinnacle of human achievement transdigm and l3 are praised in wall street publications for their shrewd business decisions transdigm managers don t think like engineers the street gushes in an article about how the company is poised for supersonic growth in the new age of killer drones the government conditioned by decades of neoliberal dogma that regulation spells doom for an economy merely continues to throw money at the pentagon with a quasi religious faith that they can spend their way out of any problem once the last hope for a nation that no longer builds anything over the past decade thanks in large part to hedge funder paul singer who has worked hand in hand with pm benjamin netanyahu through histo make big tech an offer it can t refuse often compared to the american nsa and tempting them with a buffet of ripe for acquisition innovation rich startups with foreign investment in the israeli tech sector nearly quadrupling over the past four years he s largely succeeded at the expense of silicon valley was followed by hundreds of stateside layoffs the

even paid them almost 197 million over the past four years as they expanded their footprint overseas nice work if you can get it which should be sounding the alarm over the increasingly desperate looting of the nation is instead a microcosm of the same catastrophe best exemplified by the grotesque pageantry of the media was until a few years ago exclusively deployed to tell americans that everything was just fine at home it s the rest of the world we have to bomb until they accept our superior freedoms cnn s second quarter average daily viewership was 541 000 a drop of 18 percent from last year that figure includes all the waiting rooms bank lobbies airports and other passive screens that run cnn all day every day no matter who is or isn t watching even the top rated network fox had just 1 32 million viewers on an average day less than one percent of the american population these networks are barely keeping the american exceptionalism narrative together and indeed wouldn t stand a chance if denial wasn t so firmly instilled in our national character americans need not be ashamed of their patriotism it s only natural to feel a sense of pride for the country of one s birth but if we really love america
to the editor i voted for donald trump in 2016 because i felt that i couldn t trust hillary clinton mr trump was preaching as if he supported populism and draining the swamp he failed to live up to both miserably the two democratic candidates i am supporting are bernie sanders and andrew yang i would also be happy with elizabeth warren or tulsi gabbard i feel that bernie and andrew genuinely want to help the average person and have the ideas and willpower to get things done mr trump has turned his back on me my family and the entire rust belt he s helped to divide this country to where it almost feels beyond repair i feel genuine guilt for throwing my vote in his direction last time around and i certainly won t make that mistake again aaron bitz monroe mich to the editor yes i ll be voting for donald trump again and proudly so why he is the classic american underdog story he not only has to combat the raging left with its give away the store mentality but also 95 percent of the media which is hellbent on reporting something ominous in his every twitch and sneeze and tweet get over yourselves guys he might not fit your preconceived ideals of presidential but that s just fine with me the ball is moving forward and that s what s important

washington d c nina turner isn t running for anything at the moment but the longtime cleveland politico still spends most of her time on the campaign trail the ex cleveland council member and ohio state senator is traveling the country on behalf of vermont sen bernie sanders democratic presidential bid often introducing him onstage in the early primary states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina and speaking as a campaign surrogate at events he can t personally attend you need the opposite of what s in the white house right now turner said to warm up a greenville south carolina crowd for sanders as she praised his support for universal medicare and a 15 minimum wage he is a visionary and he sets the tone and he doesn t wait for polls and special interests to tell him what is right

and that s why she left a post as the ohio democratic party s political engagement chair to campaign with sanders in 2015 and has been on the bernie bandwagon ever since he really gets it and it is not political speak for him says turner that is why being on this mission with him to transform this nation for the overwhelming majority of people that have been left behind is personal to me sanders first drew turner s attention with his 8 1 2 hour filibuster of a 2010 tax cut bill that president barack obama negotiated with congressional republicans she recalls her husband jeffrey telling her baby this is your candidate when sanders announced his first presidential run because they had similar stances on issues like voting rights and wages she felt that he spoke unfettered truth to power without really caring as much whose feathers were ruffled as she did she also liked that he didn t mind going against the status quo for what s right their paths crossed backstage when both were speakers at a 2015 democratic national committee women s forum turner subsequently issued an endorsement of sanders that dismayed many ohio backers of his rival for the democratic presidential nomination former secretary of state hillary clinton they thought turner supported clinton as she had volunteered for the ready for hillary superpac that was formed to draft clinton into the race turner says the superpac was separate from clinton s campaign and her agreement to participate in its activities occurred before she knew other candidates were entering the race while turner liked that sanders opposed trade deals and wars that made no sense she said his promises to unrig the system on behalf of the poor and barely middle class resonated most with her as they reminded her of her mother who died at age 42 after struggling to support seven children turner was a 22 year old college student when her mother died and managed to complete degrees at tri c and cleveland state university while helping her family get by my family s struggle my family s story and what the senator was fighting for made me say i have to support this candidate i can t go with the status quo on this one i have to do it she says he will say the word poor where most candidates won t say the word poor because it s a delusion that everyone is in the middle class it s politically correct to only talk about the middle class but who s going to talk about the poor who s going to talk about the people in the communities i serve that don t have food or the people elders in my community that can t pay for their prescription drugs who s going to talk about them he talks about them all the time turner s support for sanders wasn t the first time she bucked ohio s democratic political establishment after a corruption scandal in cuyahoga county resulted in the racketeering conviction of former commissioner jimmy dimora and ensnared dozens of others turner backed a successful reform referendum known as issue 6 that created the current county government system headed by a county executive as the most prominent black official to support the proposal turner faced numerous attacks from other black democrats who threatened to ruin her politically more than my political affiliation i consider myself a hellraising humanitarian says turner hell raising in the sense that i don t just go along to get along i stand up for what is right even if it puts me in a political conundrum supporting senator sanders was one of those moments when the status quo said uh uh bad girl clinton defeated sanders in ohio s democratic primary and won her party s nomination in 2016 but lost the november election and the ohio vote to republican donald trump meanwhile turner became president of our revolution a nonprofit dedicated to pursuing sanders political message she participated in a unity reform commission that altered the democratic party s nomination process in ways that disempowered superdelegates who had helped to seal clinton s primary victory and made it easier for people to participate in caucuses when sanders entered the 2020 presidential race she became one of four sanders campaign co chairs in that capacity turner says she acts as sanders chief deputy people raiser in addition to appearing at rallies and making fundraising calls on his behalf she discusses sanders vision with grassroots leaders around the country and attempts to secure political endorsements in many ways i see this as a ministry says turner i am on a mission to help make this world a better place i couldn t think of anything better to be doing right now than to help the man who has the heart soul agreement to bring about a revolution in this country the type of revolution that will not leave working class blacks whites latinx asian and indigenous people behind there are many things i could be doing right now but i m on a mission this is personal turner says she believes sanders can defeat trump because of his crossover appeal to independent voters and the deep passion of youthful millennial and generation z voters who preferred him to both trump and clinton in 2016 more of them will be of legal voting age in 2020 she says although sanders is one of the oldest candidates currently running for president turner says younger voters like his authenticity and concern about issues like climate change and equal justice and rights for everyone in this country she says younger voters don t care that sanders has identified as a socialist many are concerned they ll have a worse quality of life than their parents she says and they appreciate that sanders calls for free college for all and ensuring that tax cut benefits don t all go to the wealthiest in society she says the excitement sanders brings to the race will bring voters to the polls more than middle ground stuff the shoulders we stand on in this struggle our campaign is about bringing our people together to take on the powerful forces of greed bigotry and authoritarianism posted by bernie sanders on tuesday may 14 2019 he s going to tell us the truth and young people want that more than anything says turner they ve got a bs meter and i m not talking about a bernie sanders meter they can sniff out political bs a mile away turner is often mentioned as a potential candidate for elective jobs in ohio she ran for ohio secretary of state against incumbent jon husted in 2014 getting 35 percent of the vote in a year of steep losses for ohio democrats in 2011 she weighed a primary challenge to warrensville heights democratic rep marcia fudge but decided against it after declaring the state s newly redrawn congressional maps were manipulated to guarantee incumbent re election she s widely expected to run for cleveland mayor in 2021 if sanders doesn t become president and give her a post in his administration she could do a lot of great things says political ally eric kearney of cincinnati who served in the ohio senate with turner she could run for u s senate from ohio she has a lot of passion for the city of cleveland and would make an excellent mayor i am not sure exactly what nina wants to do but whatever it is i think she will be a great success at it another political ally ohio democratic party chairman david pepper describes turner as one of the more inspirational people anyone will ever see in politics i don t know anyone in politics who gives a more impassioned or inspiring speech says pepper she has a very broad network more than most people in ohio and the country and a devoted set of followers behind whatever she decides to do turner puts off queries about her personal political ambitions by saying her only goal at the moment is electing sanders she says hometown supporters often ask if she ll run for office again and she s leaving her options open we ll cross that bridge when we get to it she says i want to see him elected as president i have not made any decision beyond that although turner currently works out of washington she says she still regards cleveland as her home and often returns to see her husband and adult son she says ohio s march 17 primary could be key in determining who secures the democratic presidential nomination and that sanders will make more visits to the state in addition to his april town hall meeting in warren to decry general motors closure of its lordstown assembly plant and his june appearance at a national newspaper publishers association meeting in cincinnati turner says the trump administration has been bad for ohio in numerous ways such as failing to make good on his promise to save lordstown jobs hurting farmers by engaging in tariff wars with mexico and china and attempting to dismantle the affordable care act which would cancel millions of people s health insurance she argues that trump won ohio by speaking to the anxiety of the people and sanders is in the best position of the democratic candidates to win back the state because of his consistent opposition to bad trade deals like the north american free trade agreement and the trans pacific partnership there is no reason why the right democratic nominee can t win ohio says turner president obama did it twice in 2008 and 2012 it just can t be business as usual
when state lawmakers pushed through a trio of tax breaks in spring 2017 the idea was to ease some of the financial pain caused by mayor rahm emanuel s series of major property tax hikes on chicago homeowners especially senior citizens the changes however also had an unintended consequence thousands of homes in south suburbs such as harvey and park forest fell off the tax rolls meaning those homeowners no longer pay any property taxes at all and an even greater number are paying less while that s good news for many it s also resulted in tens of millions of dollars in property taxes being shifted onto remaining homeowners and businesses they are now being hit with even higher bills in an impoverished long struggling largely african american region where an outsized property tax burden already made it difficult to attract the retail shops and industry needed to reverse economic woes made worse by the great recession adding to the economic challenge is an impending change to a business tax break that was a prime development tool for the area as of saturday cook county will require businesses that get the job creation perk to pay prevailing wages which could increase labor costs south suburban mayors say that will lead some businesses to avoid setting up shop in their towns and also further a trend of companies crossing borders to northwest indiana or will county to escape high property taxes cook county now is facing a perfect tax storm in the south suburbs and it s going to be devastating hazel crest village president vernard alsberry jr recently told county leaders at a public hearing you gotta remember the tax levy stays the same it s just paid by other taxpayers asked about the lopsided effect of the tax breaks on the south suburbs an emanuel spokeswoman noted the mayor had sought property tax relief for just the city that was deemed unworkable and eventually assessor joseph berrios got lawmakers to approve a plan that covered the entire county aides to both emanuel and berrios said the idea was to help seniors and working families cause and effect the homeowner tax breaks took the form of higher property tax exemptions which are reductions in the assessed values used to calculate individual tax bills the lower a property s assessed value the lower its taxes the homestead exemption was increased to 10 000 from 7 000 the senior homestead exemption an additional reduction for those 65 and older was boosted to 8 000 from 5 000 at the same time the state allowed more seniors to qualify for a break that freezes the value of their homes for tax purposes seniors with a household income of 65 000 or less can take advantage up from the old threshold of 55 000 the effects of that change were less pronounced and are more difficult to measure but added to the shift in tax burden g artboard margin 0 auto g charts mobile position relative overflow hidden width 280px g aiabs position absolute g aiimg display block width

setattribute rel stylesheet link setattribute href url document head appendchild link document the increased exemptions which applied only in cook county mean most homeowners pay less in property taxes than they otherwise would have but local governments especially school districts and villages aren t asking for less money the cash has to come from somewhere so more of the load shifts to owners of higher valued property that means industrial commercial and rental properties that aren t owner occupied and to a lesser extent the owners of more expensive homes the government still needs the money to pay for its operations and so it just has to increase the amount that is contributed from businesses or other nonexempt properties said laurence msall president of the civic federation a nonpartisan budget watchdog group largely funded by corporate interests giving tax breaks reduces the overall county tax base which is the total value of all properties for taxing purposes places that have a lot of industry or high priced homes are better able to absorb the hit because the tax base is larger a tribune analysis of county clerk data found that in chicago just 1 9 percent of the assessed value was lost in evanston the figure was 2 2 percent while in schaumburg it was 2 2 percent in river forest which boasts many high priced homes it was 1 9 percent similarly situated glencoe saw a 0 9 percent drop but the effect of the tax breaks was particularly dramatic in the south suburbs and a few west suburbs where home values tend to be lower and there are not as many businesses from dolton on the north end to sauk village on the county s southern end 31 towns lost between 5 and 16 percent of their equalized assessed value the most visible effect of higher exemptions was that thousands of homes came off the tax rolls entirely because the value of the increased exemptions was greater than each home s value as calculated for tax purposes homeowners no longer had to pay any tax if their property was assessed at a market value of 60 755 or less which translates to an equalized assessed value of 18 000 and they were getting both the homeowners and senior homeowners exemptions that meant tens of thousands of homeowners across the county were given tax refunds earlier this month because they already had paid the first installment of their tax bill in march in all county treasurer maria pappas returned 19 5 million to about 53 000 homeowners hardest hit was harvey where 700 homes came off the tax rolls bringing the total number of homeowners who don t have to pay taxes to 1 030 according to the clerk s office in all harvey lost 12 million or 5 6 percent of its assessed value in park forest 271 homes came off the tax rolls the town lost 13 3 million or 11 percent of its assessed value in the cook county portion of the village in tiny phoenix 48 homes came off the tax rolls the village lost more than 1 million or 15 8 percent of its assessed value each of those suburbs have tax rates that are three to four times higher than they are in the city a homeowner in any of those towns could easily end up paying as much in property taxes as in principal and interest on a 30 year mortgage according a 2015 tribune analysis many many people are saying it s not financially beneficial for them to pay the taxes they pay on their homes when every 11 to 13 years they re paying the total costs of their home in taxes said harvey ald keith price economic development committee chairman i ve talked to a couple of people that have personally told me that they are not paying their taxes anymore they re going to save their money and within the two years they have before they lose the house they ll just save all their money and leave in a zip code that includes harvey and phoenix one of every 62 homes was in foreclosure at the end of june more than three times the national average according to attom data solutions a firm that tracks real estate trends in addition nearly two in three homes with mortgages were deemed seriously underwater meaning the amount owed equaled 125 percent or more of the home s value in park forest one in every 49 homes was in foreclosure and about 40 percent were seriously underwater clifton graham at his home in country club hills on aug 28 2018 foreclosure rates are particularly high in country club hills where one in every 25 homes is in foreclosure in part because the tax rates are among the highest in the region resident clifton graham notes that the property tax bill on his home has more than doubled in the 18 years since he bought it the outspoken critic of south suburban taxes paid more than 13 600 this year graham bought the house for 235 000 but records indicate it hasn t grown in value even so he s on pace to pay as much in property taxes every 17 years as he paid for the home in the first place it s ridiculous said graham who added that some homeowners in his town have stopped paying property taxes let the home go into foreclosure then rented other nearby properties to drive down their yearly housing expenses for business owners the tax burden is far greater in cook county the assessed values of businesses are 2½ times higher than they are for homes so in some south suburbs commercial property owners can end up paying the same amount in taxes over seven years as they did for the property itself tony sanchez of sanchez paving co at his business in markham on aug 28 2018 paving company owner tony sanchez knows that all too well the 3 7 acre property in markham he s owned for decades has an assessed value of about 511 000 this year his tax bill topped 86 000 more than three times as much as he would be paying for a chicago business property worth the same amount at that rate he s paying as much in taxes every six years as the property is worth you just keep buying and buying and buying your property over and over when you can go buy it one time in indiana pay a little bit of a decent tax and you own the property said sanchez who s not sure he could even unload the land at this point the problem is when you try to sell and you see those taxes nobody wants to buy it he said it s not easy to sell it unless you give it away economic struggles to be sure some south suburbs have been plagued by financial mismanagement harvey is in so much trouble that earlier this year the state withheld funding until the town came up with a plan to pay overdue police and fire pension fund debt but the region s economic woes date to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the term rust belt was in vogue to describe the midwestern loss of jobs industry and population as a result of a changing economy during the 1990s and 2000s african americans began to move from the city to the south suburbs which experienced some of the same white flight that had occurred decades earlier on the south and west sides the regional phenomenon of a growing south suburban minority population particularly between 2000 and 2010 coincided with job losses and an overall population decline in an analysis last year by the metropolitan planning council that s when tax rates began to swell as government and schools struggled to maintain services as the tax base shrank south suburban leaders came together as those trends worsened and were making progress in promoting redevelopment and creating jobs in the early 2000s said john watson jr director of economic development in south holland the planning council s study found the town bucked some of the downward economic trends then came the 2008 housing bubble burst and its rippling economic effects the recession was the killer watson said folks were kind of holding on before that a decade later the lingering effects are visible vacant storefronts a hospital that s closing in chicago heights dozens of lots in harvey where houses once stood turned to small grass fields a bulldozed lincoln mall in matteson empty buildings that once housed big box stores throughout the region but there also are scattered success stories office buildings new retailers and restaurants industrial expansions nearly all lured with a tax incentive the cook county board created in 1984 the special program lowered assessment levels for expanding or relocating businesses in the south suburbs and other economically struggling areas known as the class 8 incentive it lowers assessment levels to 10 percent of market values the same as residential assessments for 10 years or more without that break the assessment level would be 25 percent which results in a tax bill that is 2½ times greater in south holland the incentive helped bring tax paying businesses to vacant properties including the redevelopment of five parcels that once were home to car dealers the tax break also helped existing businesses that were contemplating leaving town such as the ed miniat meat packing plant that spent 30 million to expand adding about 100 jobs to the 500 or so already there watson said earlier this year however the county board changed the rules for several business tax breaks including class 8 incentive that take effect saturday in september companies will have to pay the so called prevailing wage pushed by unions the county also will require many construction firms to take part in apprenticeship programs if they get work at class 8 properties south suburban leaders fear that the changes will make it even harder to attract development and spur businesses to set up shop in neighboring indiana or will county the key way to lower the overall tax burden they say is to bring in new business and industry which expands the tax base and eventually results in lower tax rates the property tax exemptions coupled with the changes to the tax incentive program make it harder to attract investors said kristi delaurentiis executive director of the south suburban mayors and managers association we think it s potentially going to have impact around the region but more significantly here thus make the gulf between the haves and the have nots a whole lot wider developer ralph edgar of ralph edgar properties visits one of the construction projects he is developing at south park avenue and 162nd street in south holland on aug 28 2018 developer ralph edgar who has been granted class 8 incentives to redevelop at least six properties in south holland and other south suburbs said it will make him and the businesses to which he rents think twice edgar who declares himself the poster child for class 8 in cook county said he no longer does developments without tax incentives because they re the only thing that makes his rents affordable although the firm that hires his janitors painters and landscapers often uses union labor that s not always the case there s nothing about what s being proposed that encourages me to do anything edgar said south suburban municipal leaders opposed the prevailing wage requirement and influential commissioner john daley voted against it after touring the area but county board president toni preckwinkle s labor allies pushed through the measure i don t know if they have a master plan to make the south suburbs a ghost town but it s working said derrick burgess president of sauk village we need tools to combat will county and indiana john roberson preckwinkle s director of external affairs defended the change saying commissioners made it very clear that there is a desire for the opportunity for people to be paid wages that allows them to be able take care of their families the solutions former gov jim edgar who lived in park forest for a couple of years as a young man said it s tough to get the chicago region s movers and shakers to understand the woes of the south suburbs those problems were one reason he backed a south suburban airport in the early 1990s he said describing the region as something of a forgotten area reviving it and significantly lowering the area s overall tax burden would still be a tough task if the prevailing wage requirement were revoked and the homeowner exemptions went away although neither seems likely even with new development barring some ground shaking influx of new industry the area s property taxes would still be high that s because of illinois heavy reliance on property taxes to fund schools as well as the responsibility of cities towns and states to pay the bulk of police and fire pension costs approved by the state drives up property tax rates especially in areas with limited amounts of businesses and lower home values illinois funding for schools is last in the nation in terms of the percentage of funding it provides for public elementary and high schools according to 2017 data from the national education association the state covers 24 percent of the overall cost compared with a national average of 45 6 percent the data show to really fix the problem you really need to fix state finances and state funding of education said ralph martire executive director of the center for tax and budget accountability a union backed bipartisan research group he suggested the state borrow money to pay pension obligations and flatten out skyrocketing costs in that area to allow more education spending that s really the long term solution state rep robert martwick a northwest side democrat said his intent in pushing the expanded exemptions through the general assembly was to spare lower income homeowners from some of the tax burden property taxes he said are inherently regressive meaning they are not based on a person s ability to pay and thus pose a greater hardship for people who make less money i will be the first to say that this is not the best solution to higher property taxes conceded martwick who said the solution is to put in place a progressive income tax to bring in more money for schools and government worker pensions and allow for property tax relief what the exemption increase does do is shift the burden if you are a homeowner it does reduce the regressivity of the system hdardick chicagotribune com twitter reporterhal more coverage

but your article continues below article content even the ndp has gotten wise to the affordability concerns making commitments to introduce universal pharmacare head to toe health care including eye care and mental health care and a cap on cellphone bills yet to this point we have heard very little from the liberals when it comes to reducing the cost of everyday living that will change when the writ is dropped the liberals will make the case that they are the solution to a problem created by the laissez faire conservatives we have not seen justin trudeau in shameless unrestrained campaign mode yet the hopeful narrative this time will echo morneau s claim that the average family is 2 000 better off thanks to income tax cuts for the middle earners and the canada child benefit it will point to the canada workers benefit for low income workers and the increase in the guaranteed income supplement as a social welfare safety net plus an enhancement of the canada pension plan crucially

indicators suggest spending is under control advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content this year s budget forecast a debt to gdp ratio that is continuing to tick downward and personal income tax revenues are robust up six per cent last year thanks to the strong labour market the liberals could just add the cost of a tax cut onto the deficit or pay for it by sticking it to wealthier taxpayers perhaps in the form of an increase to the capital gains inclusion rate which would see costs rise on the sale of non registered stocks bonds and mutual funds the point is we have not seen justin trudeau in shameless unrestrained campaign mode yet as sun columnist lorrie goldstein pointed out last week the liberal leader is a populist even if he uses the label in a derisory fashion to attack his opponents he may eat more oysters than the aristocracy but he was elected on a ticket of protecting the middle class

with this we start to see why the definition is so important if the libra token is officially classified as a security as is likely then using it in a transaction will involve a sale of that security and a capital gain or loss since we re talking about a stablecoin the taxable event is unlikely to be significant but it will be greater than zero since libra s basket value will fluctuate relative to the currency into which libra coin has to be converted to complete the transaction because libra is unlikely to become a unit of account in which the value of local goods is denominated
