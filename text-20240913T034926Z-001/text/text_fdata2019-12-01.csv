the perspective atlanta georgia november 3 2019 dr togba nah tipoteh editor s note as the challenges of the liberian economy and the sufferings of the liberian people intensify the perspective welcomes the following paper put together by dr togba nah tipoteh and his group with the hope that it would encourage increased interests in the discussions and writings on the issues confronting the liberian economy obviously one paper or a position from one group of economists may not represent a consensus of the views of the majority of the liberian economists and policy researchers on the causes and solutions to liberia s current economic and social problems notwithstanding the paper raises alarm and draws attention to some of liberia s major problems culture infrastructure and poverty it certainly does not provide a silver bullet to address all of liberia s current economic problems nevertheless we at the perspective encourage all liberian economists researchers policy enthusiasts ordinary liberians etc to give more attention to liberia s challenges by contributing to the discussions and writings on the economy to move the country forward please read the statement from leg and join the debate 1 0 introduction with the experience of the 1989 2003 civil war in liberia with its dismal consequences of nearly 300 000 deaths and more persons injured covering ten percent of the population of liberia the people of liberia spoke loudly and clearly to the effect that they prefer peace to war this preference of peace over war emanates from the reality of perennial and pervasive poverty in liberia 1 0 in the evolution of the liberian society former president of liberia ellen johnson sir leaf correctly designated this prevailing situation as being dominated by corruption that has now attained the vampire status state of the nation address 2015 in such a situation several state pronouncements have announced that mass poverty will be eliminated but the situation worsens as seen in the deterioration of the liberian dollar ld from ld130 to one united states dollar usd in december 2018 to ld215 to usd1 in september 2019 with the attendant dismal impact on mass living conditions through the cost of living especially with respect to food this prevailing situation breeds frustration that becomes violence oriented leading to the preference of war over peace as witnessed in liberia s civil war 1 2 it is against the foregoing background that some independent liberian professionals have come together to form themselves into the liberian economy group leg these liberians seven in number are scientists with extensive working knowledge about problem identification and problem solution with respect to the liberian economy and are prepared to use such knowledge to promote peaceful actions that lead to the elimination of mass poverty in liberia 2 0 identification of the problem the main societal problem in liberia is longstanding and widespread poverty with two thirds of the children who should be in school not in school the world s worst record according to unicef world authority on children unicef annual report 2017 additionally liberia is the second poorest country in africa and the fourth poorest country in the world adb wb imf annual reports the unbearably high and rising foreign exchange rate between the liberian dollar and the united states dollar became the pretext for the massive outdoor protest of june 7 2019 3 0 identification of the solution to the problem the recent ebola epidemic experience in liberia provides highly useful knowledge about how to solve societal problems upon becoming aware of the ebola problem through the spread of knowledge by credible persons communities throughout liberia took ownership of the anti ebola process and what happened ended the ebola epidemic in liberia prior to the identification of the solution to the problem it is most important to know the source s of the problem this is why the publication of the late veteran journalist stanton peabody in the daily observer newspaper is most instructive here journalist peabody said that the main problem of liberia is the over americanization of liberia peabody was correct because it is the making of national decisions on the basis of american cultural values rather than liberian cultural values that lead to the worsening of the living conditions of liberians the living conditions of liberians become bad and worse when liberians prefer what is american over what is liberian the living conditions of liberians become bad and worse through the production of liberian raw materials mainly for export where value is added abroad in america and europe rather than in liberia it is impossible to solve liberia s problems with the understanding of america s problems rather than liberia s problem therefore the most important problem solving action to be taken is the raising of consciousness by all sectors of liberia families communities schools civil society including religious houses and political parties government and private businesses 3 1 what does this raising of awareness consist of in the first place the people should be informed about the nature of mass poverty by credible persons meaning honest persons with the relevant record of performance then the people should be informed about the action steps that they can take to solve the problem of mass poverty this awareness raising function is at once the right and duty of all liberian citizens under the constitution of liberia 3 2 how can this raising of awareness be done this awareness raising can be done through the meetings gatherings of families communities civil society organizations the government and private businesses private and public media meaning the radio stations and newspapers as well as social media should be used to reach the people everywhere because the people can only take action to solve problems when they know about the problems and the sources of the problems the people should be made aware that the only way to solve any societal problem is through the rule of law as found in the constitution of liberia for communicating with the people it is most useful to use liberian languages liberian english and of course standard english 4 0 the problem solving action steps in the pursuance of their rights and duties under the constitution of liberia the people of liberia can take action in their interest where the people want change they can bring about change through the rule of law therefore it is precisely through the rule of law that the following changes should be made to change liberia for the betterment of all liberians 4 1 change the electoral system to make sure that it operated according to the constitution of liberia in order for fair elections to be held to get persons with good records of taking actions in the people s interest to become elected it is only through fair elections that good leaders can be elected to engage in good governance which ends systemic corruption and eliminates mass poverty thereby promoting the sustainable improvement in the living conditions of the masses of the people 4 2 use the value addition approach value addition must be used first to increase the value of human resources through education so that they can learn and become committed to make choices that help to make liberia better for all liberians such education must necessarily be based on the use of liberian culture as the basis for educational development in liberia the persistence of the longstanding domination by western culture especially american culture in liberia s educational system makes it impossible for liberians to understand liberia s problems and take action steps to solve these problems it is essentially this domination by western culture that explains principally the longstanding and widespread poverty in liberia it is impossible to solve liberia s problems by learning mainly about western problems value must be added to liberia s natural resources as in the production of raw materials mainly for local consumption rather than for foreign consumption liberia must stop adding value in foreign economies as seen in liberian raw materials being exported to foreign countries where value is added through manufacturing instead liberia must add value to our raw materials through manufacturing to provide for local consumption and have the rest to be exported state managers in liberia explain the economic malaise in liberia by pointing to the fall in the global prices of raw materials and the high price goods imported by liberians were liberia not to produce raw materials mainly for export and import goods manufactured from liberia s raw materials the problem of falling global prices of liberia s exports and high global prices of liberia s imports would not arise the people s republic of china prc promotes the value addition of resources in prc and this is how prc thrives well having reduced the poverty rate in prc from 80 percent to 3 percent as prc celebrates 70 years of existence as a republic this mode of decision making in prc has resulted in prc having a near 7 per cent rate of economic growth while western economies are struggling to get positive growth rates and the united states of america owes prc 1 2 trillion united states dollars and prc has 4 7 united states dollars as part of prc s reserves despite the global financial crisis of 2008 liberia s state managers continue to be engaged in national decision making that makes nearly all liberians poor and poorer while making the state managers and foreigners rich and richer witness what happens in the commercial sector dominated and controlled by foreigners who continue to collect from the liberian economy at least usd50 million fifty million united states dollars a month doing jobs and owning businesses that liberians can do and own 4 3 use the local purchasing approach liberians must not import what can be produced in liberia liberians must not facilitate the importation of products that can be produced in liberia or products that cannot be produced in liberia but are imported by liberians the central bank of liberia cbl must facilitate the flow of commercial bank loans to mainly liberian businesses rather than foreign businesses as continues to be the practice and 4 4 use the savings generation approach liberians should generate savings privately and publicly to finance what liberians can do but foreigners are doing 5 0 savings per year from families communities civil society as the result of awareness raising through the use of private and public people can b convinced to buy liberian made and owned products as well as what liberians sell that cannot be produced in liberia at this time savings can be made minimally in the amount of usd100 000 000 one hundred million united states dollars given the average of such spending in one year by nearly ten per cent of the people who are not poor meaning that they live on more than usd2 two united states dollars a day 6 0 savings per year from the government of liberia gol under the 2019 2020 national budget and the gol budgets in the next four years 6 1 proposed salaries per year usd but paid in ld deductions from the respective offices below

and two respectively are to travel abroad on gol missions while the finance and development planning minister and the central bank executive governor with entourages of two respectively can attend the adb wb imf annual meetings ambassadors could represent liberia adequately with the strengthening of the embassies legislators who are members of the ecowas parliament can travel to ecowas parliament meetings with no entourage 6 3 use of vehicles only the president the vice president and the foreign minister are to have official vehicles with provisions for petroleum products and repairs gsa is to have a pool of vehicles for use by gol foreign guests upon the directive of the president 6 4 purchases to be credible gol must lead in purchases by purchasing only from liberian businesses what they can produce in liberia and what they sell that cannot produce in liberia at this time 6 5 remuneration gol must pay only salaries and do so in liberians dollars with no allowances vehicles credit cards except for the exceptions mentioned above 6 6 the budget the budget must be designated in liberian dollars according to the constitution of liberia 6 7 cut off all donations made by public corporations and autonomous agencies direct such amounts to the gol treasury and 6 8 revamp nocal 7 0 the total savings are as follows 7 1 non gol usd 100 000 000 7 2 gol usd 245 000 000 7 2 1 president s office 2 000 000 7 2 2 vice president s office 1 000 000 7 2 3 nsa 5 000 000 7 2 4 eps 2 000 000 7 2 5 grants 40 000 000 7 2 6 infrastructure 20 000 000 7 2 7 legislature 20 000 000 7 2 8

increased by at least usd2 000 000 000 two billion united states dollars however as the committee has not submitted its final report and the likelihood of the collection of the stolen assets remains unknown this amount has not been included in the savings under this report 8 0 having pointed out several areas for savings usd the uses of these savings are indicated below 8 1 food production and distribution could be enhanced through the purchasing and use of 100 caterpillars for land clearing in all of the counties 5 000 000 8 2 hiring liberian contractors to do farm to market roads 35 000

regularizing teachers salaries 20 000 000 8 6 regularizing health workers salaries 10 000 000 8 7 financial assistance training to get excess gol employees into income generating situations in the private sector 20 000 000 8 8 road construction road maintenance 200 000 000 8 9 sensitization and action on sanitation 3 000 000 8 10 sensitization and action on climate change 2 000 000 total uses of savings 345 000 000 p s were savings to be generated from the assets recovery efforts by gol then such savings directed towards road construction road maintenance 9 0 how the liberian dollar will get better and the mass poverty reduced the liberian dollar is high and rising with liberians catching hard times because liberians prefer the united states dollar to the liberian dollar too much liberian dollars are running after united states dollars and the united states dollar is playing hard to get while making his statement at the senate confirmation hearing the former executive governor of the central bank of liberia mr nathaniel patray said that ld16 billion sixteen billion liberian dollars were imported by the gol into liberia between 2016 and 2018 but by july 2018 ld15 242 000 000 fifteen billion two hundred and forty two billion liberian dollars were outside of the banking system in liberia therefore to get the united states dollar more liberian dollars have to be used and with the use of more liberian dollars the foreign rate of exchange will continue to go up to get the foreign exchange rate to go down liberians will have to prefer the liberian dollar to the united states dollar such preference takes place when raw materials in liberia are produced mainly for local production and consumption through manufacturing liberians have to produce what they can produce and stop importing products that they can produce liberians have to buy from liberian owned businesses paying in liberian dollars the government has to pay salaries in liberian dollars and collect taxes in liberian dollars when liberia adds value to the production of liberia s raw materials through manufacturing and export the manufactured products after attending to local consumption then we get needed foreign exchange to import products that we cannot produce when liberia imports only those products that we cannot produce at his time while concentrating on local production and consumption of products from liberian businesses the liberian dollar gets stronger local prices become bearable and mass poverty elimination moves towards reality liberian economy group leg togba nah

it might surprise even the well informed to know that when the us federal reserve was constituted in 1913 it was not as a central bank to start with the fed was positioned as a private institutional mechanism to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper and for other purposes its functions and operations today have little semblance to its original intended mission and other purposes has become the overarching goal through a series of mission creeps when the epitaph of the us dollar in its current avatar is written in perhaps less than a decade from now three years would stand out as witnessing epochal moments that lead to the eventual demise 1913 1971 and 2019 though most readers would be aware of the significance of the first two i presume the criticality of these events in the larger context of the ongoing monetary fiasco is probably worth explaining 1913 formation of the federal reserve up till this point in time the us dollar was on the classical gold standard i e absence of a central bank or equivalent the us dollar was defined as 1 20th an ounce of gold and the coins were privately minted and the money supply interest rates were market determined in fact the word dollar comes from the anglo saxon version of thalers the most reputed private mint for gold coins it might surprise even the well informed to know that when the us federal reserve was constituted in 1913 it was not as a central bank to start with deliberately so as explained in the creature from jekyll island primarily because of the historical misgivings of the general population against having a central bank given that the first two experiments in trusting governments on monetary issues ended in disasters first bank of the united states 1791 1811 and second bank of the united states 1816 1836 the federal reserve was therefore positioned as a private institutional mechanism to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper and for other purposes of course like the proverbial camel s nose under the tent the functions and operations of the us fed today has little semblance to its original intended mission and other purposes has become the overarching goal through a series of mission creeps i am fairly sure had the current dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability been included in the federal reserve act of 1913 the bill would have been laughed out of the house 1971 closing the gold window though the us fed had surreptitiously monopolised the monetary function of the free markets for more than half a century the us dollar was still loosely tethered to gold the dollar now defined as 1 35th an ounce of gold by the bretton woods agreement of course even private ownership of gold let alone convertibility of the us dollar in the us had been effectively eliminated through executive order 6102 during 1933 so when nixon claimed that he was temporarily closing the gold window in 1971 very few understood the significance of the event of course not everyone was naïve easily the most scholarly and principled politician on the planet today dr ron paul joins politics for the very same reason in 1971 the reason why nixon had to close the gold window is all too easy to understand i e governments trying to live beyond their means lyndon johnson in running the great society guns and butter program during the 1960 s ran up deficits which meant that the us fed had to create dollars far in excess of their gold reserves sensing this the french president charles de gaulle tried to convert their us dollar holdings to gold at which point the us had no option but to default on its promises under the bretton woods agreement of course the longer term consequences of closing the gold window should have been very obvious i e an exponential increase in the monetary base as shown in the chart freed of the linkages to gold that placed a restraint on federal budgets the us government could now indulge in all kinds of excesses in a truly bipartisan manner unlimited never ending wars a military budget calling it a defence budget is a travesty of the word defence when there s no enemy worth the name that is greater than all other countries budgets combined free education healthcare war on drugs the list is practically endless the us fed could just create the dollars needed for these programmes out of thin air this apparently unlimited credit card in the hands of the government had another far more nebulous and insidious side effect i e an ability to temporarily set interest rates far below what the markets would have priced them at which sounds fairly innocuous till one understands the austrian business cycles theory and the consequent malinvestments which brings us to 2019 2019 start of qe in perpetuity perhaps a recap of the first two parts of this series published in january and june 2019 would be in order proceeding the essential summary being that the market consensus at the start of 2019 of the us fed hiking 2 to 3 times and quantitative tightening qt to continue on autopilot at 50 billion a month was completely off base i had speculated that bursting of any of the asset bubbles equity bonds or housing would cause the fed to embark on a rate cutting cycle and that qt would be replaced with qe in perpetuity of course we did not have the crash but just a minor 20 per cent minor in the context of what lies ahead for these markets correction in the equity markets was enough for powell to embark on the rate cutting cycle and qe s with alacrity just that the market still seems to believe in the fed fable that the current easing is a mid cycle correction insurance cut but as i have written we are well on the way to zirp and qe in perpetuity i e qe p so how was i sure that the us fed would reverse course going into 2019 any number of leading indicators did point to a slowing economy as i had pointed out in the earlier articles but the best and the most reliable indicator is the growth in rothbard salerno true money supply talk about returning to the monetary basics lest the wrong lessons are drawn from the above let me explain some of the fundamentals here the mistakes happen when the tms growth exceeds the growth of real gdp given that the us growth has averaged around 2 per cent for the last decade there was no fundamental reason for the tms to grow beyond 2 per cent technically we can operate even with a 0 per cent tms growth but for a society addicted to easy money and artificially low interest rates that would have been the death knell decades ago anyway the consequence of this excessive tms growth is asset bubbles or more appropriately malinvestments projects that should have never seen the light of day get massive allocations of capital e g wework uber smile direct lyft etc the problem then is that these businesses need continuous infusions of ever increasing amounts of capital just to stay solvent invariably correction sets in and the market liquidation of these malinvestments create the recession just to make it abundantly clear the solution does not lie in keeping these intrinsically worthless businesses afloat but to ensure that they do not start in the first place given the current situation the best solution is to pull the plug and allow these companies to go bankrupt at the earliest these zombie companies are gobbling up precious capital that would otherwise be made available to profitable opportunities i have taken the specific examples from nasdaq bubble 2 0 but the situation is similar across the general equities bonds and real estate markets plethora of assets are awaiting their day of reckoning had andrew mellon been around today he would have suggested liquidate stocks liquidate bonds liquidate real estate perhaps he might even have started with liquidate the federal reserve but just as his advice was ignored in 1929 so too would it be today so will 2019 be a 1929 most of the economic indicators pointed in the earlier articles retail closures housing prices auto sales industrial output etc continue their downward trajectory in q4 after a temporary bump up on account of the rate cuts and qe p but the plumbing in many critical parts of the system are just coming apart with the most obvious case being that of the repo market in the last two months a confluence of the sky rocketing debt in the system that couldn t be serviced on account of the falling true money supply tms growth rates and deterioration of the asset quality that has made collateralisation very risky very few are even doubting a 2020 recession these days excepting the us fed and trump of course even the fed s own forecast for q4 gdp has fallen to 0 3 per cent with assumptions that i would consider as being very optimistic and this with a scenario of an exceptionally accommodative fiscal as well as monetary policy environment that we will have a recession in the months ahead is a given but where most forecasts continue to get it wrong is in the duration and severity of the same as i said in the first part this period 2019 20 203x would make the 2008 crisis look like a sunday school picnic and would eventually be termed as the greater depression and precisely because of the us fed s solution to this recession in the form of qe p the us dollar would probably be turned into confetti as well also read will 2019 be a 1929 part ii also read will 2019 be a 1929 all the elements of a volatile cauldron are in place
liquidity will return to the foreign exchange market and volatility may increase the three month implied volatility of the euro and yen fell to record lows last week 4 35 and 5 06 respectively extending a multi year trend the dollar is threatening to break out of recent ranges that have been historically narrow a breakout could underpin volatility however low volatility is not just about the foreign exchange market the volatility of the s p 500 vix is below 12 and near the year s low set in april a similar metric in the bond market move is below its 200 day moving average the risks of an escalation in the us china trade conflict and an inconclusive uk election appear to have diminished president trump signed the hong kong bills in part on the assumption that it will not derail the trade talks if trump did not sign the bills they would have become law but this ploy was not needed china made the same unspecified threats before advanced weapons sales to taiwan sanctioning companies involved with human rights violations and blacklisting huawei bejing could bar the bill sponsors from entering great china mainland hong kong and macau but it is largely symbolic it would become a badge of honor for those subject to it moreover china knows as well as anyone that a law on the books means little without enforcement the market expected the 15 tariff on around 160 bln of chinese goods that the us threatened for the middle of december will be waived and a scaled back version of phase one will be struck it is quite clear from the recent industrial profits report that the sectors that have been subject to us tariffs have been walloped while the seconds that are more domestic like infrastructure for example have fared considerably better the polls suggest the tories can secure a parliamentarian majority at the december 12 election labour s strategy of being nearly agnostic on brexit and promising a referendum the deal seems to be failing to inspire the escalation of antisemitic accusations does the party no good the lib dems remain message has not been able to break the hold of the duopoly the scottish nationalists will do well and this will begin to lay the groundwork for another referendum for independence the economic data in the days ahead will set the tone for the remainder of the month last week s data prompted the ny fed gdp tracker to tick up to 0

gm workers will lift the nonfarm payrolls by around 45k and most economists look for an increase of a little less than 200k year to date the us is averaging 167k net new jobs a 25 decline from the same period last year in the first ten months of 2018 the us created an average of 226k jobs a month average hourly earnings growth is expected to be steady at 3 0 a robust job market creates the fuel of consumption that drives the economy yet the relationship is more complicated and anything but straightforward consumption appears to be slowing it grew by 4 6 in q2 and 2 9 in q3 it is off to a soft start in q4 real personal consumption expenditures rose 0 1 in october the weakest since february at the time the strong durable goods orders and shipments suggest the composition of gdp growth

well this year in comparison japan will report november auto sales on december 2 and in october were off 26 4 year over year the uk will report new car registrations a proxy for sales were off 6 7 year over year in october in the us year to date average is about 16 9 mln vehicles at an annualized pace this is a little slower than the 17 03 mln vehicle average in the first 10 months of 2018 november sales figures are expected to have ticked up from october s 16 55 mln which was weakest in six months china reported an unexpected jump in its official november pmi the manufacturing index rose to 50 2 from 49 3 and the non manufacturing pmi rose to 54 4 from 52 8 this lifted the composite reading to 53 7 the highest since march from 52 0 the national report focuses on large state owned businesses while the caixin measure puts more weight on smaller firms the caixin pmi will be reported around the time shanghai markets open on monday investors appear more skeptical of strong than weak data from china given their preconceived notions the eurozone sees the final november pmi and october retail sales the flash composite pmi fell to 50 3 from 50 6 however both the german and french composite pmi edged higher germany s composite rose to 49 2 from 48 9 and the french composite firmed to 52 7 from 52 6 this means that there was deterioration outside of germany and france it most likely points to dramatic weakness in spain and or italy the economic strain can only exacerbate political pressures the uk s final pmi will most likely confirm the weakness of the flash report declines in both manufacturing and services sectors saw the composite tumble to 48 5 from 50 0 a new cyclical low the bank of england meets december 19 two members dissented at the november 7 meeting

the change in the value of its reserve holdings on december 4 this is not a market moving report but the uk has accelerated the pace of reserve accumulation likely in anticipation of brexit reserves

forward to beat the tax increase when it is reported at the end of next week the october pace is expected to have fallen 2 5 from a year ago the risk is on the downside after japan reported that retail sales plummeted 14 4 in the month of october as the tax hike and typhoon spurred a greater than expected contraction the reserve bank of australia and the bank of canada meet next week a cut by the rba is unlikely but it would be less of a surprise than a move by the bank of canada the rba cut rates in october and saw the justification for a rate cut in november but did not move the bank s statement may be more important to the short term price action barring a surprise the bank of canada softened the language around its neutral stance but is in no hurry to ease policy where officials argue the benefits do not outweigh the potential costs as parliament returns the government will push middle class tax cuts which may also take some pressure off monetary policy the trump administration assault on the world trade organization and nato will be in the spotlight next week nato meets next week the us has insisted and the allies have agreed to a new funding formula that will result in a smaller contribution from the americans previously the us provided for 22 of the alliance s direct funding of around 2 5 bln the us will scale back its contribution to 16 in line according to reports of germany s contribution 14 8 since 2014 when russia invaded crimea defense spending in europe has risen by around 100 bln according to reports the increased spending which has long been sought by us administrations is partly a functioning of the increased risk threat previous commitments to boost spending and arguably the hectoring by the trump administration meanwhile nato has also become a bone of contention in europe macron said it was suffering from brain death as he advocates a stronger european military presence that german as the biggest economy would be expected to fund while france would likely provide important parts of the command structure merkel on the other hand who has yet to present a pathway fulfilling its 2 of budget commitment to nato gave a spirited defense of the alliance many are aware of the us attack on the world trade organization s conflict resolution mechanism which is one way it differed from its predecessor gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade the us has been blocking the appointment of new appellate judges for nearly two years around 70 of the initial judgments are appealed when fully staffed there are seven appellate judges and three are needed to make a decision there are three members now and the term of two ends on december 10 as of december 11 there will no longer be sufficient judges to issue binding decisions the us argues that the appellate body oversteps its mandates and judges stretch out a case to earn more money few seem aware of the us threat to block the wto s 2020 budget chf200 mln where unanimity is necessary it made two dramatic proposals without promising to allow new appellate appointments it proposed that the operating fund be limited to chf100k which represents a 95 reduction the us also proposed that now more than chf100k be earmarked for the appellate body which represents about an 87 reduction from the full budget allotment the us also seeks to stop the end run by the eu norway and canada who have created a parallel dispute settlement system to work around the american s obstructionism the trump administration insists that going forward only the wto secretariat can approve of funding for such efforts not the appellate body itself there appear to be some ways that if the us proposals are not accepted the wto can limp into next year the sums are not particularly large the us share in 2018 was about 11 5 of the general budget or around chf23 mln and the wto enjoys a small surplus chf40 mln the budget will be discussed next week and it seems that in any case the wto will be further weakened there is are two other meetings next week that could have far reaching implications first the eu finance ministers meet on december 5 among the issues to be discussed will be updating the rules on biofuel taxation and related matters in particular there seems to be a push afoot to phase out the preferential treatment for aviation fuel under a new set of regulations this could have far reaching implications carbon pollution from international aviation has doubled since 1990 according to reports while total carbon emissions have fallen by a little more than a fifth recall rules that forced ocean tankers to generate less pollution saw shipping costs soar earlier this year as shipping capacity fell while operators were having their ships retrofitted the other meeting is the german social democrat party conference on december 6 8 as we have discussed previously the spd is fighting for its survival it has in coalition with merkel s cdu for 10 of the past 14 years it appears to have lost its identity and has seen its public support dwindle regardless of who wins its leadership contest the rank and file will vote at the conference whether to stay in the coalition if it chooses not to it would likely force a national election early next year

by uri avnery uri avnery argues that foreign aid and israeli handouts from stolen palestinian tax revenue provide only temporary relief from israel s economic strangulation of the palestinians and that a palestinian spring targeted at the occupation may come sooner rather than later visiting ramallah after an absence of several months i was again amazed by the ongoing building activity everywhere new high rise buildings are going up and many of them are beautiful arabs seem to have an innate talent for architecture as any world anthology of architecture affirms the building boom seems to be a good sign confirming israeli assertions that the economy in the occupied west bank is flourishing but on second thought my enthusiasm faded after all the money invested in residential buildings does not go to factories or other enterprises that provide jobs and promote real growth it only shows that some people are getting rich even under the occupation my destination was a diplomatic reception some high functionaries of the palestinian authority pa and other upper class palestinians attended i exchanged pleasantries with the palestinian prime minister salam fayyad and some of the well dressed guests and enjoyed the delicacies i did not discern any excitement palestinian journalists told me that the price of petrol in the west bank is almost the same as inisrael about eight shekels per litre since the minimum wage in the west bank about 250 us dollars per month is only a quarter of the israeli minimum wage that is atrocious nobody would have guessed that at that very moment in the centre of the city a stormy demonstration was taking place it was the beginning of a massive protest that is still going on the demonstrators in ramallah and other towns and villages in thewest bankare protesting against the high cost of living and the economic hardship in general palestinian journalists told me that the price of petrol in the west bank is almost the same as inisrael about eight shekels per litre that would be about eight dollars per gallon in theusor 1 7 euro per liter ineurope since the minimum wage in the west bank about 250 us dollars per month is only a quarter of the israeli minimum wage that is atrocious this week the palestinian authority hastily lowered the price recently on the muslim eid al fitr holiday ending the ramadan month of fasting the occupation authorities surprisingly allowed 150 000 palestinians to enterisrael some went straight to the sea shore which many of them had never seen before though they live less than an hour s drive away some went to visit ancestral homes but many others went on a shopping spree it appears that many goods are actually cheaper inisraelthan in the impoverished occupied territories by the way not a single incident was reported that day the protests were against the pa it s a bit like a dog biting the stick instead of the man who is wielding it donor nations can give some money to the pa to keep it alive but they cannot change the situation nor would the abolition of the paris protocol change much as long as the occupation is in place any progress if there is any is conditional and temporary actually the pa is quite helpless it is bound by the paris protocol the economic appendix of theosloagreement under this protocol the occupied territories are part of the israeli customs envelope and the palestinians cannot fix their own customs duties amira hass of the haaretz newspaper cites the following conditions inhabitants of the gaza strip are not allowed to export their agricultural products israelexploits the water minerals and other assets in thewest bank palestinian villagers pay much higher prices for water than israeli settlers gazafishermen cannot fish beyond three miles from the shore palestinian inhabitants are forbidden to travel on the main highways compelling them to make costly and time consuming detours but more than any restrictions it s the occupation itself that makes any real improvement impossible what serious foreign investor would go to a territory where everything is subject to the whims of a military government which has every motive for keeping its subjects down a territory where every act of resistance can provoke brutal retaliation such as the physical destruction of palestinian offices in the 2002 operation defensive shield where goods for export can rot for months if an israeli competitor bribes an official donor nations can give some money to the pa to keep it alive but they cannot change the situation nor would the abolition of the paris protocol as demanded by the demonstrators change much as long as the occupation is in place any progress if there is any is conditional and temporary still the situation in thewest bankremains far better than that in the gaza strip true as a result of the turkish flotilla the blockade of the strip has been lifted to a large extent almost everything can now be brought into the strip fromisrael though almost nothing can be brought out also the naval blockade is in full force however lately the situation there has been improving rapidly the hundreds of tunnels under the egyptian gaza border are in practice bringing in everything from cars to gasoline to building materials and now with the muslim brotherhood in power inegypt this border may be opened completely a step that would radically change the economic situation of the strip nabeel shaath the top palestinian diplomat told me at the reception that this may actually be a major obstacle to reconciliation between the palestine liberation organization plo and hamas hamas may want to wait until the economic situation in the strip surpasses that in thewest bank reinforcing their chances to win all palestinian elections again mahmoud abbas on his part hopes that the new egyptian president will convince the americans to support thewest bankand strengthen the pa when i reminded shaath that years ago i attended his wedding atjerusalem s now desolate orient house he exclaimed we thought then that peace was just a step away since then we have been thrown a long distance back despite the economic troubles the picture of the palestinians as a helpless pitiable victim is far removed from reality israelis may like to think so as well as pro palestinian sympathizers around the world but the palestinian spirit is unbroken palestinian society is vibrant and self reliant most palestinians are determined to achieve a state of their own sooner or later the wrath of the palestinian poor will change direction instead of blaming the palestinian authority they will turn against their real oppressor the occupation on the way to the reception i did not see a single women in the streets with her hair uncovered the hijab was everywhere i remarked on this to a palestinian friend who is quite unreligious islam is gaining he said but that may be a good thing because it is a moderate form of islam that will block the radical ones it is the same as in many other arab countries i did not perceive any sympathy for the ayatollahs ofiran but nobody wished for an israeli attack ifiranbombsisraelin retaliation nabeel shaath remarked their missiles will not distinguish between jews and arabs we live so close to each other that palestinians will be hit like the israelis since my visit the demonstrations in ramallah have intensified it seems that fayyad serves as a kind of lightning rod for abbas i don t think that this is just fayyad seems to be a decent person he is a professional economist a former official of the international monetary fund he is not a politician not even a fatah member his economic viewpoint may be conservative but i don t think that this makes much of a difference considering the situation inpalestine sooner or later and probably sooner rather than later the wrath of the palestinian poor will change direction instead of blaming the pa they will turn against their real oppressor the occupation the israeli government is aware of this possibility and therefore made haste to pay the pa an advance on the tax money thatisraelowes the pa otherwise the pa by far the biggest employer in thewest bank would be unable to pay salaries at the end of this month but that is only a stopgap measure binyamin netanyahu may stick to the illusion that all is quiet on the palestinian front so that he can concentrate on his efforts to get mitt romney elected and frighteniran after all when palestinians are protesting against palestinians that s ok the israeli palestinian conflict is frozen no problem but this illusion is well an illusion in our conflict nothing is ever frozen not only are the settlement activities going on steadily if quietly but on the palestinian side too things are moving pressures are building up at some point they will explode when the arab spring finally arrives in palestine its main target will not be abbas or fayyad abbas is no mubarak fayyad is the very opposite of a gaddafi the target will be the occupation some palestinians dream about a new intifada with masses of people marching non violently against the symbols of the occupation this may be too much to hope for but the demonstrations in ramallah andhebron may be a sign of things to come there is still truth in the old saying that the conflict here is a clash between an irresistible force and an immovable object
president muhammadu buhari seeks to increase nigeria s total debt portfolio to about 97billion by borrowing about 30billion from external sources to execute critical infrastructure projects while the argument on the part of government has always been that nigeria s debt to gdp ratio remains low experts are worried that paying back the burgeoning debt is a major concern as generating enough revenue to meet its budgetary obligations is still a nightmare for the government kunle aderinokun and bamidele famoofo report president muhammadu buhari last week returned to the national assembly to re present the federal government s request for a 29 96 billion fresh foreign loan buhari in presenting the external borrowing plan 2016 2018 which had earlier been rejected by the eighth national assembly asked the legislature to reconsider and approve the proposal to take the 29 96 billion loan pursuant to sections 21 and 27 of the debt management office establishment etc act i hereby request for resolutions of the senate to approve the federal government s 2016 2018 external borrowing plan as well as relevant projects under this plan he said reason for fresh loan according to the president the federal government was seeking the new loan to finance key projects in different sectors of the economy specifically the government decided to borrow such a huge amount of money to enable it execute infrastructure projects across the country thirty nine critical projects under execution by the federal government at the moment will be financed with the loan the president has said in his letter titled request for the national assembly to reconsider and approve the federal government s 2016 2018 external borrowing plan buhari pointed out that in the plan which was first presented in 2016 but disapproved by the legislature were outstanding projects critical to the delivery of the government s policies and programmes specifically the senate is invited to note that a while i have transmitted the 2016 2018 external borrowing plan to the eight national assembly in september 2016 this plan was not approved in its entirety by the legislature only the federal government s emergency projects for the north east s four states projects and one china assisted railway modernization projects for lagos ibadan segment were approved out of the total of 39 projects b that outstanding projects in the plan that were not approved by the legislature are nevertheless critical to the delivery of the government s policies and programmes relating to power mining roads agriculture health water and educational sectors he informed the lawmakers buhari explained these outstanding budgets are well advanced in terms of the preparation consistent with the 2016 date sustainability analysis undertaken by the debt management office were approved by the federal executive council in august 2016 under the 2016 2018 external borrowing plan accordingly i have attached for your kind consideration relevant information from the minister of finance the specific outstanding projects under the 2016 2018 external borrowing plan for which legislative approval is currently being sought i have also directed the minister to make herself available to provide any additional information or clarification which you may require to facilitate prompt approval of the outstanding projects under this plan he further stated burgeoning debt if the national assembly approves the proposal of president muhammadu buhari to secure a fresh 30billion loan for nigeria the federal government will be increasing the total debt stock to about 97billion about n30trillion when in 2016 the then lawmakers of the 8th assembly turned down the loan request they noted it was not in the best interest of nigerians for the government to accrue such huge debt figures made available by dmo showed that nigeria recorded a government debt equivalent to 17 50 per cent of the country s gross domestic product in 2018 government debt to gdp in nigeria averaged 32 40 percent from 1990 until 2018 reaching an all time high of 75 per cent in 1991 and a record low of 7 30 per cent in 2008 reactions former chairman senate committee on local and foreign debt in the 8th assembly senator shehu sani in a statement issued on friday said the proposal by the federal government will constitute a perpetual debt trap for africa s most populous nation he recalled the reasons why he and his colleagues at the senate then turned down the request to borrow such humongous amount of money in a statement titled why we rejected the 30billion loan request from the fg sani noted we turned down the fg loan request for 30 billion to save nigeria from sinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap we don t want our country to be recolonised by creditor banks he explained our external debt in 2015 was 10 32 billion and it escalated to 22 08 in the second quarter this year which is 114 per cent if we had approved that loan request our external debt could have catapulted to over 52 billion and that is not sustainable with the current escalation of borrowing we will be walking into debt slavery and move from landlords to tenants in our country they will always tell you that even america is borrowing and i don t know how rational it is to keep on borrowing because another country is borrowing if we keep listening to bankers and contractors we will keep borrowing and burying ourselves and leave behind for our children a legacy of debt burden loans are not charities most of those encouraging more borrowing are parasitic consultants commission agents rent seeking fronts and contractors we must be cautious sani warned lagos based economist mr marcel okeke expressed concern that the request by president buhari was ill timed it is really a cause for worry that at a time the imf is warning nigeria about its burgeoning external debt profile the fg is pushing to borrow more according to okeke a huge chunk of nigeria s annual national budget at the moment is going into debt servicing with the external debt standing at about 22billion as at june 2019 an additional borrowing of 30billion will bring total external debt to about 52 billion certainly this quantum of debt will not be sustainable neitti figures show that not more than a total of 21billion had been realised in any year from 2014 2018 from oil gas it beats the imagination how nigeria will service a 52billion debt if the 30billion borrowing request gets approved okeke expressed worry about nigeria s scanty forex inflow from any other source other oil his words unless the new finance act on which the funding of the 2020 budget is predicated contains some hidden magic nigeria could irreversibly be going into a dangerous debt trap the economist who was once chief financial analyst at zenith bank was more worried because he said more loans do not translate into better or more rapid development for nigeria loan management administration has always been a serious challenge for the country so borrowing additional 30bn at this point in time will rather cripple the economy than boost it he argued financial consultant dr boniface chizea who told thisday there was nothing wrong for any country to borrow if only they do so for the right reasons said nigeria s case is one that is peculiar in the sense that recourse to borrowing has been to subsidise consumption and to pay salaries in the past once you verge into that territory you are asking for problems as repayment is bound to be problematic it is even worse when the proceeds from debts are either misapplied or out rightly embezzled so the view that our current challenge is more of inadequate revenue inflow is to a large extent correct because ideally we should be able to meet our recurrent expenditure from internally generated revenue which is most certainly not the situation now he said chizea said sustainability challenges arise when a nation had to keep fidelity to repayment of debt with over 50 per cent of its revenue as at last measure nigeria will be committing more than 50 per cent of its revenue if it must meet its debt obligations failing which default follows and the debt situation is compounded leading inexorably to debt overhang he alleged chizea added this explains why the rash of measures to boost revenues hike in vat rate border closure sudden levy of n50 on point of sale purchases using your debit card etc we hope that these measures will be impactful to make a dent on the problem and that the nation will find greater discipline as it utilises debt inflow to underwrite the amelioration of terrible infrastructure situation boost productivity grow job opportunities and ultimately reduce the misery index in the land with its accompanying social tensions govt s position meanwhile buhari has said the country s economy was on a sustained path of growth since exiting recession he said one of the positive signs of progress in the economy was nigeria s place on the recent ranking on the world bank s 2020 doing business index in which the country moved up 15 places from the 2018 position of 146 to 131 the president used the opportunity to ask state governments to intensity efforts to instill improved fiscal transparency and accountability in order to ensure optimum use of scarce resources buhari whose speech was read at the 18th edition of the national productivity merit award investiture ceremony held in abuja yesterday by the secretary to government of the federation sgf boss mustapha also said that the country s journey to food security and self sufficiency was well underway our economic diversification programmes are yielding positive results our ease of doing business policies and programmes are already impacting micro small and medium enterprises as well as manufacturing mining and agriculture among other key sectors we are now ranked 131 on the world bank s 2020 doing business index by moving up 15 places from the 2018 position of 146 we have made outstanding progress in almost all segments of the agriculture value chain consequently tens of thousands of jobs in agriculture logistics manufacturing and real sectors are being created we shall sustain these policies to ensure additional investments are channeled thereby creating more jobs in the sector he stated he added that the focus of his administration is to consolidate on the achievements made in the last four years by intensifying efforts on security restructuring the economy and fighting corruption correcting the lapses made tackling emerging challenges facing the country and taking bold steps in transforming our country and setting her on a sound and sustainable path to an enviable height according to him his administration has since its re election in march been mapping out new strategies aimed at fostering unity and at the same time liberating the citizens from poverty the president also identified the major cause of inequality and insecurity in the country as pervasive corruption he urged nigerians to collectively resolve to fight and expose corruption and the corrupt as by so doing the country can foster a broad based prosperity required to create a country that is not only for a few privileged but caters for all nigerians dmo s analysis the debt management office said nigeria s external debt position is generally robust in the medium term while the impact of the shocks would lead to a deterioration of the revenue based indicators in the long term if adequate measures are not taken to improve revenue and boost exports as well as shore up the level of other forms of non debt creating flows such as foreign direct investment fdi dmo s annual stress test showed that over the period 2017 2027 a shock which combines lower gdp growth weaker exports a lower gdp deflator and a fall in non debt creating flows would weaken the export and revenue indicators for instance the ratio of external debt to exports moved upwards from 46 5 percent in 2017 to 188 5 per cent in 2019 in the same manner the ratio of external debt to revenue increased from 73 4 percent in 2017 to 157 4 per cent in 2022 the ratios of external debt service to exports and external debt service to revenue also deteriorated throughout the projection period thus indicating that nigeria s total debt portfolio is highly susceptible to revenue shocks there is therefore the need to sustain the ongoing reforms and initiatives aimed at boosting non oil revenue by government which include the broadening of the tax base increasing tax revenue collection blocking of leakages and the diversification of the economy
why corporate tax cuts and austerity plans are behind ecuador s violent protests plus effects of japan s abenomics a rebellion against inequality austerity and the politics of more of the same is growing in latin america and is springing from what looks like the most innocuous changes it is not dissimilar to uprisings elsewhere in chile the rise of train fares led to street protests and calls for an end to neoliberalism in argentina a sitting president was voted out of power after a protest over austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund imf as a condition of a 57bn bailout and in ecuador it was the imf s involvement which forced the president and cabinet to escape the capital quito the size of the imf bailout was similar to the size of unpaid corporate taxes as highlighted by former economy minister wilma salgado ecuador requested a 4 2bn loan from the imf and a condition of that was to cut the budget deficit the ecuadorian government decided to cut fuel subsidies which were costing 1 3bn a year but the decision led to protests forcing the government to walk back the proposal still the government pressed ahead to wipe out much of the taxes owed by ecuadorian corporations otaviano canuto a senior fellow at the policy center for the new south who has also held roles at the imf and the world bank tells al jazeera that the scrapping of fuel subsidies had differentiated impacts on the social structure in ecuador cutting the fuel subsidies paradoxically while in some other countries it might benefit particularly the poor because as long as it is accompanied by compensatory social policies the fact is that the major beneficiaries very often are the middle classes who use cars who benefit from the oil subsidies and so on canuto says but in the case of ecuador apparently the burden is split between the fractions of the population i know for one that the preference of the imf for instance was on adjusting value added taxes not attacking the fuel subsidies has shinzo abe s economic policy helped japan recover from its lost decades on november 20 shinzo abe served his 2 887th day in office making him the longest serving prime minister in japanese history but abe s first term lasted only a year he quit amid accusations that he violated electoral laws and there were five other prime ministers between his first and second terms all of which only lasted about a year each at the start of his second term in 2012 abe s namesake economic policy grabbed the attention of economists and policymakers japan s economy was struggling with deflation and slowing growth after a stock market and property crash in the 1990s and abe promised to combat the slow growth with a three pronged economic plan known as abenomics the plan involved the bank of japan using its powers to buy government bonds and stocks the second step of the plan was to increase infrastructure spending and the third was to make structural changes to the world s fourth largest economy for the most part economists have said the policy has been a failure but questions have also been raised about his over friendly relationship with us president donald trump who finally delivered a trade deal that avoided a protracted trade war takuji okubo managing director of japan macro advisors notes that abe has implemented several important economic policies but has also benefitted from a bit of luck he has been lucky in the sense that the global economy has not had a major recession in the past 10 years so that has been a very favourable environment for japan s economy to prosper

tomorrow president trump arrives in london for the annual nato summit despite the boasting and the trappings of superpower status he is an emissary from a country whose economy and society are in increasing difficulty and whose global leadership is under challenge not just from the usual suspect china but from europe with the unerring capacity to be wrong that defines the brexit right britain is about to decouple itself from a continental economy beginning to get things right and hook up with one that is palpably beginning to fail this is not the conventional wisdom the eu is sclerotic undynamic stifled by quasi socialist red tape and hostile to insurgent startups it is so degenerate it cannot even defend itself as trump will undoubtedly remind its leaders over the next two days the us is the mirror opposite a free trade agreement post 31 january with the us is the number one strategic policy aim for brexit britain unshackling the uk from the declining old and embracing the english speaking dynamic new best be nice to the donald except the latest research demonstrates the reverse is true britain is about to make a vast mistake in the recently published the great reversal leading economist thomas philippon of new york university and member of the advisory panel of the new york federal reserve mounts a devastating attack on the conventional wisdom so perfectly embodied by the witless boris johnson the news is that over the last 20 years per capita eu incomes have grown by 25 while the us s have grown 21 with the us growth rate decelerating while europe s has held steady indeed accelerating in parts of europe what is going on philippon s answer is simple the us economy is becoming increasingly harmed by ever less competition with fewer and fewer companies dominating sector after sector from airlines to mobile phones market power is the most important concept in economics he says when firms dominate a sector they invest and innovate less they peg or raise prices and they make super normal profits by just existing what economists call economic rent so it is that mobile phone bills in the us are on average 100 a month twice that of france and germany with the same story in broadband profits per passenger airline mile in the us are twice those in europe us healthcare is impossibly expensive with drug companies fixing prices twice as high or even higher than those in europe health spending is 18 of gdp google amazon and facebook have been allowed to become supermonopolies buying up smaller challengers with no obstruction this monopolising process gums up everything investment in the us has been falling for 20 years because prices stay high wages buy less so workers lifestyles unless they borrow get squeezed in real terms while those at the top get paid ever more with impunity inequality escalates to unsupportable levels even life expectancy is now falling across the us but why has this happened now philippon has a deadly answer a us political campaign costs 50 times more than one in europe in terms of money spent for every vote cast but this doesn t just distort the political process it is the chief cause of the us economic crisis 0 50 jeremy corbyn trump farage johnson pact would threaten rights in uk video corporations want a return on their money and the payback is protection from any kind of regulation investigation or anti monopoly policy that might strike at their ever growing market power boeing for example ensured as one of the us s biggest lobbyists that regulation was friendly to its plans to shoehorn heavier engines on to a plane not designed for them the fatal shortcut behind the two crashes of the 737 max 8 philippon shows this is systemic how both at federal and state level ever higher campaign donations are correlated with ever fewer actions against monopoly price fixing and bad corporate behaviour in europe the reverse is true it is much harder for companies to buy friendly regulators the eu s competition authorities are much more genuinely politically independent than those in the us witness the extraordinary fines levied on google or the refusal this february to allow siemens to merge with the french giant alstom as a result it is europe albeit with one or two laggards such as italy that is bit by bit developing more competitive markets more innovation and more challenge to incumbents while at the same time sustaining education and social spending so important to ordinary people s lives even starting up businesses is now easier france is generating multiple hi tech startups with unemployment falling parts of paris barcelona amsterdam or even milan are now rivalling san francisco s bay area the eu s regulations are better thought out so in industry after industry it is becoming the global standard setter its corporate governance structures are better and last week to complete the picture christine lagarde the incoming president of the european central bank in the most important pronouncement of the year said the environment would be at the heart of european monetary policy in other words the ecb is to underwrite a multitrillion euro green revolution in short bet on europe not the us thus jeremy corbyn seizing on leaked documents showing how us trade negotiators want uk drug prices to rise to us levels is on to something much bigger than the threat to the nhs fatal though that is any trade deal with the us will require the uk to accept the protections that are making us capitalism so sclerotic predatory and high priced while dissociating itself from a european capitalism that is not only beginning to outperform america s but so much better reflects our values this election is set to seal not just the geopolitical but geo economic mistake of britain s recent history the tragedy is that our national conversation is hardly aware of how high the stakes have become

feature article 01 12 2019 listen fellow ghanaians sometimes it is more tearfully painful than menstrual cramps to note that many of our leaders are nothing more than political vultures leeches and scammers masquerading as public officials and their sole aim not of service but to downplay the intelligence of the citizens even if by crossing the line of decency in our moral fabric in book of luke 17 1 we read that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come is it not fascinating that a political party that claims to be a liberal democrat has studiously ignored the principles of liberal democracy and rather clinched to the principles of social democracy they constantly bastardize the national democratic congress ndc espouses social democracy as its ideology and approach to governance and the new patriotic party npp claims to be liberal democratic political party but one finds that both political parties appear confused whereas the npp deserts its ideals of liberal democracy and finds comfort in social democracy its biggest opponent ndc appears to have also found tranquility in the ideals of liberal democracy yet both political parties communicators beat their chests and claim to be affiliated with what they are not for instance president akufo addo in the 2016 npp manifesto bragged that ghanaians know them npp to be staunchest liberal democrats and that they always stand for their values as liberal democrats since their formation years president akufo addo pointed out that unlike the national democratic congress ndc that seems to have just woken up one morning to call themselves social democrats with little or nothing to show for it the npp has always stood for what they believe in but one is rather at a lost why such a liberal democrat can vamoose and vacate his party s ideals and cling to what he always lambaste is it ignorance or incompetence isn t something fishy about that indeed there s something fishy which i want to uncover in this epistle for those who are not political first class animals and do not know what these approaches of governance mean social democracy and liberal democracy claimed to be championed by the ndc and the npp respectively is let me with all political jargons put aside define them for you social democracy is a method of governance or governmental ideology in which much effort is made by government to try to regulate the affairs of the people s endeavors especially in the markets there s some degree of monitoring by government every now and then to ensure the well being of the citizens in social democracy government embarks upon social intervention programs by lessening citizens stress on the other hand liberal democracy is the opposite of social democracy where there is a kind of free range economy or markets governments that champion liberal democracy allows the system to work for itself citizens find themselves under liberal democracy in a state of survival of the fittest kind of environment only the might the smartest and the wisest should dominate competition is higher government hardly comes in to provide a level playing field for all and there are no social intervention policies in summary social democracy tends to exhibit features of socialism that was championed by the soviet union and the liberal democracy tends to portray the characteristics of capitalism championed by the united states of america one striking difference is that social democracy cherishes social intervention programs and liberal democracy does not now my ghanaian readers should look at the methods or approaches to governance by both the npp and the ndc and identify which political party belongs to what it is quite clear that both npp 1 under former president kufuor and the current npp 2 under president akufo addo prioritized social intervention policies thus abandoning the ideals of liberal democracy and holding tightly onto the values of social democracy at least under former president kufuor we witnessed national health insurance scheme nhis and the school feeding program as a major social intervention programs carried out by a supposed liberal democratic party then in this current npp government 2 under president akufo addo we are witnessing again social intervention programs embarked upon by the npp as a liberal democratic party why are the members of the npp confused or they simply have zero knowledge about what liberal democracy is all about i would try to find answers to these pugnacious questions and point out the reason why the npp always try to steal or snatch the ideals of social democracy proclaimed by the ndc to the neglect of their own values and how that is related to their much celebrated competence in economic management i would try to also point out why the ndc is the major believer in social democracy but refusing sometimes to utilize its ideals and rather relying on seemingly liberal democratic ideals espoused by the npp and with this i will draw a conclusion to prove which political party between the ndc and the npp has ghana at heart now when we talk about economic growth according to kimberly amadeo and riane eisler in his book the real wealth of nations it is an increase in the production of goods and services over a specific period kimberly continued that economic growth creates more profit for businesses as a result stock prices rise that gives companies capital to invest and hire more employees as more jobs are created incomes rise consumers have more money to buy additional products and services purchases drive higher economic growth so the main drivers of economic growth are one world class education social programs and high standard of living these factors create a skilled and motivated workforce as a result the best way to measure a country s economic growth is to use its gross domestic product gdp there are two forms of gdp according to kimberly real gdp and nominal gdp with the former considered the best there are factors responsible for a gdp growth as well such as land natural resources labor capital equipment and entrepreneurship which has a reflection and correlation with the drivers of economic growth stated above world class education social programs and high standard of living what happens is that countries which cannot rely on these factors of economic growth to spur their economies growth due to lack or insufficiency of them thereof tend to adopt other palliative measures in order to spur and realize economic growth as the second or alternative way of growing economy these palliative measures as alternative ways of growing economies that do not have world class education strong entrepreneurship high standard of living etcetera like ghana are expansionary fiscal policy which have a link with expansionary monetary policy and contractionary fiscal policy also having a correlation with contractionary monetary policy according to kimberly amadeo expansionary fiscal policy is when the government expands the money supply in the economy using budgetary tools to either increase spending or cut taxes both of which provide consumers and businesses with more money to spend purposely this policy is to boost growth to a healthy economic level which is needed during the contractionary phase of the business cycle according to kimberly to do this the government reduces unemployment increase consumer demand cuts taxes and embark upon social intervention policies on the other hand contractionary fiscal policy is when the government either cuts spending or raises taxes it gets its name from the way it contracts the economy it reduces the amount of money available for businesses and consumers to spend according to kimberly with this policy government also cuts subsidies unkind to social intervention programs but raises taxes purposely contractionary fiscal policy is to slow growth to a healthy economic level to between 2 percent to 3 percent a year with these two types of economic growth methods we can see that one is sweet and cool with the citizens and the other is bitter and hot with the citizens the expansionary fiscal policy makes live comfortable though in a short term but with dire consequences in the long term especially if debt to gdp ratio is inching up like we have in ghana 62 billion gdp and over 210 billion debt stock hence expansionary fiscal policy is not the best policy to be used to spur economic growth in ghana at the moment now let s analyze we find clearly that the npp aligns itself with the expansionary fiscal policy over the years while the ndc aligns itself with the contractionary fiscal policy at least in 2014 meanwhile ordinarily per the ideologies of both political parties the social democrats which is espoused by the ndc should have rather championed the expansionary fiscal policy and the liberal democrats settle for the contractionary fiscal policy however the reverse is the case why according to kimberly amadeo politicians or elected officials hardly use the contractionary fiscal policy because citizens always want it cool even though there are consequences responsible politicians who have the people at heart do not use the expansionary fiscal policy unless in some acute circumstances for example in 1929 president franklin d roosevelt of the usa used this policy to counter the usa economic depression president george bush also used it after the 911 terrorist attack president obama used it because of the global financial crisis in 2008 therefore expansionary fiscal policy is always and only resort to in acute economic situations by countries that have drivers of economic growth such as world class education skilled labor entrepreneurship capability etc to help stage a come back in terms of economic development after experiencing a nosedive but in countries where the choice is only between contractionary and expansionary fiscal policies due to lack of vibrant economic drivers many serious economists prefer the former that is countries that have little or nothing of these drivers of economic growth have a choice to squeeze their citizens to attain economic growth with the contractionary fiscal policy which is nobler or expansionary fiscal policy by comforting the citizens but with an economic danger looming at the long run to substantiate this view my readers should refer to the imf economic measure or method suggested to the ndc in august 2014 when the mahama led government went to the imf for bailout the institution suggested cutting subsidies raising taxes placing ban on employment and generally limiting the government expenditure that was contractionary fiscal policy why didn t the imf suggest the expansionary fiscal policy your guess is as good as mine the holy qur an says in 2 216 that you may dislike a thing yet it may be good for you or a thing may haply please you but maybe bad for you only god has knowledge of both the bad and good things and you do not know ghanaians could not tolerate that hardship in that short term with better conditions in the long term under the mahama led government with this economic policy in operation so they voted for change with the new government that came to power on the back of economic hardship inflicted by contractionary fiscal policy endorsed by the imf it was unwise to continue with it they had to adopt it s opponent expansionary fiscal policy quickly the npp went and opted out of the imf literally putting an end to contractionary fiscal policy because of the expansionary policy that is juicy in the short term but disastrous in the long term there is a reason to that i shall uncover in my next epistle to be continued long live ghana god bless us all the writer iddrisu abdul hakeem is a mastercard foundation scholar alumnus at knust e mail phone 0261669954 what sapp only
after more than four decades of dominance free market capitalism is facing a challenge its rival the blandly named modern monetary theory mmt has entered the ring promising to return economic planning to a less ideological footing it s also keen to strike a blow against the surplus fetish that many economists now blame for declining public services and growing inequality the rise of mmt has received little attention in australia but it s increasingly gaining exposure in the united states ahead of the 2020 presidential election in its corner are australian based economist bill mitchell and stephanie kelton the senior economic advisor to democratic contender bernie sanders but free market capitalism is unlikely to go down without a fight former us treasury secretary larry summers has dismissed mmt as voodoo economics here s how the contenders shape up the title holder whether we like to acknowledge it or not free market capitalism often disparagingly referred to as neoliberalism dominates current thinking on both the centre right of politics and the centre left once considered radical it was legitimised in the late 1970s and early 1980s by political heavyweights ronald reagan and margaret thatcher reagan gave it an emblematic war cry government is not the solution to our problem he famously intoned government is the problem and thatcher set fast its legitimacy with her uncompromising declaration there is no alternative ronald reagan and margaret thatcher championed free market capitalism getty bettmann at the heart of the free market model is the mantra of smaller government less taxation and less regulation over the decades this has led to the privatisation of many government functions and agencies the privatisation of many government functions and agencies a rejection of progressive taxation policies in favour of cutting tax levels for the wealthy referred to by critics as trickle down economics a rejection of progressive taxation policies in favour of cutting tax levels for the wealthy referred to by critics as trickle down economics and the re badging of virtually all forms of economic regulation as a burden red tape crucially as part of the smaller government approach free market capitalism embraced the idea that elected representatives should be limited in their powers to manage and stimulate the economy that role was given over to central banks using monetary policy essentially raising and lowering interest rates to effect change there was also an emphasis on limiting public spending in order to achieve or maintain a surplus budget deficits were not just undesirable but irresponsible the contender mmt on the other hand points an accusing finger at neoliberalism blaming it for rising economic inequality and corresponding reductions in the quality and scope of essential services both public and privatised mmt s proponents argue that the current surplus obsession is at best misconceived and at worst ideological a deception to justify reductions in government spending in order to fund taxation cuts for the wealthy they argue that governments shouldn t be afraid of pushing the economy into deficit if that deficit helps fund further economic growth budget deficits have come to be seen as irresponsible but not everyone agrees getty hiroshi watanabe traditional monetary policy they say no longer makes sense in an era of record low interest rates or in the case of japan negative interest rates and they believe there is a democratic as well as economic benefit to be had in once again having elected politicians more directly involved in efforts to stimulate and manage the economy handing responsibility for economic stimulus over to central banks was simply another example of neoliberal inspired outsourcing they argue what s needed instead is a raft of stimulus measures including a greater emphasis on what s called fiscal policy the use of tax rates as a control lever light weight or heavy weight the major critique of mmt by conventional economic theorists is that it s built on wishful thinking and treats the economy as a magic pudding they deride mmt as unsophisticated as little more than a call for governments to simply print more money to fund their programs going into deficit to fund government spending free market economists say can only ever lead to hyperinflation and risk sending the economy into recession usually defined as general economic decline over at least two consecutive quarters hence the need to prioritise surpluses over deficits unlimited government spending that s the idea at the heart of the fight over mmt getty bjorn forenius economist steven hail a supporter of mmt rejects that characterisation as deliberately misleading what we are saying is that when there is a lack of spending in the economy when there is already a lot of people with precarious employment or people who are underemployed and when nobody in the medium term is forecasting any significant inflation then under those circumstances the appropriate thing for the government to do is to stop talking about balancing its budget he says the appropriate thing to do at that moment is to run a deficit deliberately to support the economy in other words all government borrowing that s spent on infrastructure or services helps to create consumer demand and further commercial opportunity which then helps grow the size of the overall economy by contrast if you cut back on spending to ensure a budget surplus all you will really do is restrict the opportunities for further economic growth at least that s the mmt argument the question then is whether you deliberately run a fiscal deficit in order to support the economy and to support employment dr hail says or whether you allow the economy to sink into a recession in which case you will end up with a deficit anyway but a bad one rather than a good one professor mitchell a mmt pioneer from the university of newcastle argues the cap on the size of government stimulus spending and therefore any deficit should be determined by the productive capacity of a country that level will differ from country to country he says depending on an individual nation s potential for growth the second limiting factor is inflation once it becomes clear that inflation is likely to kick in the government should then limit spending and therefore the size of the deficit he rejects criticism of mmt theory as ideological and hypocritical there was never a question in 2008 when the world was about to collapse into financial ruin when governments around the world pumped billions of their currency into the banking system to bail out the banks professor mitchell says none of the bankers ever blinked and then as soon as their positions were safe they started again criticising governments for various things welfare spending unemployment benefits pensions all the rest of it a nod to past form leading financial commentator peter martin sees mmt as a modern iteration of the theory that dominated economics in the boom decades after wwii before the advent of free market thinking modern monetary theory makes sense to me perhaps it makes sense to me because i went to university and i learnt keynesian economics he points out that the surplus good deficit bad mantra is a relatively recent manifestation almost all australian governments since federation ran budget deficits not surpluses he says even governments that proudly considered themselves fiscally conservative in 1961 menzies noticed that unemployment was growing it was growing from 2 per cent to 3 per cent that doesn t sound a lot these days but it was a big change and menzies decided to put the budget into deficit big time he says as a result he got unemployment down again this was not regarded as controversial then this was standard keynesianism the founder of modern macroeconomics what mattered was employing people and the accounting framework was unimportant signs that neoliberalism could be on the ropes one area of unacknowledged agreement between supporters of mmt and conventional economic practitioners is over the failure of standard monetary policy as a tool of economic management specifically the manipulation of interest rates to slow or speed economic growth in october this year paul keating declared conventional monetary policy had run its race there is no more that central banks can do he said in an interview with news corp paul keating believes stimulus spending is vital news video the former prime minister and treasurer then went further calling on the current australian government to abandon its ongoing pursuit of a budget surplus and to focus instead on stimulus spending he hasn t been alone in adopting such a position in the next recession central banks will once again be back at zero interest rates and it will be very very hard then for monetary policy to have the usual stimulative effect says james mackintosh a senior columnist with the wall street journal certainly the central banks themselves are worrying about this so it seems reasonable that other people should too clearly even those who are strong believers in the idea of monetary policy mario draghi president of the european central bank for example or bill dudley who ran the new york federal reserve until recently even these sorts of people are very much saying that governments need to come out and run big deficits because the central banks just can t cut interest rates enough which sounds remarkably like an argument for mmt the view from outside the ring the one sticking point though is trust in politicians or more precisely trust in their ability to once again act as responsible economic managers would the general public be happy with parliamentarians having a greater hands on role in stimulating and managing the economy mackintosh has doubts it could in principle work that if governments focused on inflation they could in principle raise taxes and cut spending when inflation got out of hand he says but history tells us that what governments do is they cut spending after elections and they raise spending just before elections so that they are more popular and likely to win that of course is why democratically elected governments chose to outsource monetary policy to arm s length central banks in the first place it was precisely to try to overcome this boom bust link to the electoral cycle and it seems many senior australian financial experts feel the same way mr martin recently conducted a survey of 13 economists in response to the question of who was best placed to boost the economy all 13 declared their preference for the reserve bank over the federal government although perhaps again with a nod to mmt none suggested the reserve bank should be left to fight the current economic downturn on its own
u s steel is laying off up to 40 employees at its taconite mines on minnesota s iron range in october it also announced that it was idling one of its production lines at its minntac plant near the town of mountain iron julius nyerere father of tanzania s independence in the 1960s would not be surprised slowing in the u s steel industry which includes u s steel closing two major blast furnaces supports the old african leader s position in a long term debate about the competitiveness of natural resource extraction relative to manufacturing and other sectors donald trump and his economic advisers would have done well to ponder nyerere s predictions minnesotans also should understand the debate since natural resource based issues including forest products iron ore and farming remain important in our economy nyerere who had studied anthropology and political economy at st andrews university in scotland in the 1950s argued that natural resource products were doomed to fall in value relative to manufactures africa then almost entirely dependent on a colonial based system of exporting only natural resource products and importing nearly every manufactured item needed was doomed to being squeezed ever tighter as its terms of trade the unit prices of its exports relative to its imports eroded continuously over time the continent needed to industrialize or it would be condemned to poverty other economists from wealthy countries challenged nyerere s argument saying there was no long term downward trend in the prices of agricultural products and minerals the patterns in african economies simply reflected relative resource endowments africa and other ex colonial countries in asia and latin america were rich in natural resources but poor in capital and educated laborers the concentration in selling cacao hemp coffee sugar copper tin iron ore and myriad other primary commodities reflected market forces yes if these nations accumulated capital as japan had done and educated their peoples the relative endowments of natural resources labor and capital might change but the scales were not inherently tilted against raw resources neo malthusian environmentalists like paul ehrlich writing the population bomb in the late 1960s and the club of rome issuing the limits to growth in the early 1970s led many to believe that resource exhaustion would soon put human life in peril the oil price shock of the 1970s combined with the sharp rise in global prices of wheat and other farm commodities added to a general sense of scarcity and higher prices nyerere then was deemed wrong natural resource exporting countries would see their exports prices rise relative to manufactured imports and to services that faded with decline of ag commodity prices in the 1980s followed by widespread farm failures in the united states and the collapse of the traditional steel industry in the u s and parts of europe minnesota s iron mining sector underwent brutal restructuring cutting employment from 20 000 to 2 000 oil prices fluctuated with global politics and mideast wars but had many slumps perhaps nyerere and others with dismal forecasts for natural resource commodity prices were right after all this view persisted through the 1990s but the dramatic double digit percentage growth in the chinese economy year after year from 1978 through the 1990s led to a global commodities supercycle in the new millennium prices rose for farm products imported by china especially soybeans and corn and also for metals ores and other raw materials by the spring of 2008 u s iron ore prices neared 200 per metric ton they had stagnated in the 30 range in the 1990s chinese demand seemed insatiable minnesota taconite pellets usually had to travel less than 100 miles by rail before loading onto the bulk carriers that provide dirt cheap transportation but suddenly 10 000 ton trainloads were rolling on rails more than 2 000 miles to the british columbia port of prince rupert corn hit record highs soybeans approached records briefly set in 1975 that had led to gerald ford s short term export embargo moreover some strong farm and minerals prices persisted even after the financial sector debacle of 2007 09 put the general u s economy into recession and poleaxed the stock market by 2014 for example the farm price of milk was about twice what it had been in 2002 iron ore eroded from extreme highs but remained above 100 a ton into 2013 there were problems first chinese demand for commodities could not continue to expand at the same rate forever secondly producers everywhere responded by putting more acres into production re opening idled mines and starting development of new ones thirdly the enormous agricultural and metals production capabilities of the ex soviet union that had stagnated for more than a decade through painful structural upheavals were now in the hands of private firms however thuggish production rose from painful lows odessa after a hiatus of a century once again became a major farm export port in the go go years irrationally exuberant farmers had once again bid up the price of farmland to levels that would prove unsustainable over the long run the near zero interest rate policies of the federal reserve and other central banks played a malign role in this as they did in mining expansion globally even after the peak of the boom had passed thus farmers are now some years into a painful adjustment that is being exacerbated by president donald trump s trade wars trump predicted almost immediate construction of new steel mills in his initial announcements of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports these hit china but also nato friends such as canada that had shipped metals through four wars in the 20th century u s steel companies did experience a transient rise in prices and production but what trump and his trade guru peter navarro do not realize is that metals and ag commodities are classic homogeneous commodities they trade in extremely efficient global markets and are produced in many countries most such rival producers have at least some capacity to expand production and exports one can ignore the wisdom of the multi lateral approach to trade that our country followed from 1934 into 2017 and impose tariffs on a handful of current exporters however this does not mean that imports will fall by the amount of these targeted nations shipments other potential exporters will step into the breech and since most affected commodities are truly homogeneous transshipment through another nation may mean that materials from the targeted countries continue to flow almost as before perhaps only fraudulent preparation of shipping documents will be needed economic efficiencies are lost dead weight losses to the u s and global economies rise but promised booms never materialize the president and his advisers seem ignorant of economic history and the record of trade wars yes existing industries can be maintained behind high tariff walls as british landowners were by the corn laws albeit at great cost to consumers yes the infant industry strategy of tariff protection can work korea s auto industry brazil s auto and commercial aviation manufacturing and most of japan s industrial growth from the 1950s through the 1970s took place behind high tariff walls but the track records of nations attempting to restore growth and vigor of already existing mature technology declining sectors like coal and steel through trade restrictions are dismal the u s steel industry was far from dead when trump fired the opening shots of his trade wars it still produces over 80 million tons a year more than half of our consumption the oldest most obsolete facilities have been closed for years it had lowered labor costs by breaking its unions so it was not doomed but the idea that it would undergo a brilliant resurgence with myriad new mills and burgeoning employment was a silly dream moreover commodity based industries are affected by business conditions globally the world economy is slowing even as the u s boom hangs on but even here downside potentials greatly outweigh upside ones shrinking steel demand worldwide inevitably means declining prices here even if flows of imports that happened to prevail in 2016 have been dammed up looking at commodities more broadly if one takes prices over the past 60 years adjusts them for inflation and charts them over time a long term downward trend is clear nyerere was right in his argument even if his prescription of non marxist african socialism as a remedy to his nation s problems failed minnesota taconite prices are down from extreme highs and have fallen over recent months the sector is not going to die but the next years will be rough corn soy and other crop commodity prices are in the doldrums milk has recovered somewhat over the past year and cheap feed helps a bit so farming and other resource based sectors are not doomed but the long haul will be a grinding one
activity in china s factories unexpectedly accelerated in november according to an official measure ending six months of contraction both domestic and external demand showed improvement but economists say it is too soon to conclude that the world s second largest economy is back on track uncertainties include rising consumer inflation and lingering doubts about whether beijing and washington can reach a partial trade deal china s official manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 50 2 in november the national bureau of statistics said saturday up from 49 3 in october and the first time since april that this key gauge of manufacturing activity registered above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction the median forecast of 11 economists polled by the wall street journal was 49 5 tang jianwei an economist at china s bank of communications chalked it up to thawing tension between the u s and china and the beijing government s growth supporting measures which he said finally showed its effect the production subindex for november was 52 6 up from 50 8 in october a reading of total new orders rose to 51 3 from 49 6 new export orders to 48 8 from 47 import orders improved to 49 8 from 46 9 zhao qinghe an economist with the official statistics bureau said after the data release that the export subindex was boosted by increased overseas orders for the christmas season while import orders were helped by recovering domestic demand he didn t elaborate on the reasons for the improvement in domestic demand the recovery in manufacturing activity also boosted china s measure of activity outside factory gates nonmanufacturing pmi rose to 54 4 in november from 52 8 in october as services and logistics related to factory productions registered big jumps the statistics bureau said but mr zhao warned that continued external uncertainty means the manufacturing sector still faces the prospect of downward pressure nearly two years into their trade war china and the u s have been working to strike a phase one deal the two sides spoke by phone again this week and president trump said earlier this week that talks were near completion but mr trump s signing of a bill supporting hong kong s antigovernment protesters could be a complication china decrying what it calls interference in its domestic affairs warned of unspecified countermeasures mr tang the bank of communications economist said smooth progress to a deal is critical if november s nascent signs of recovery are to sustain themselves the chinese government too he said needs to maintain its easing stance beijing in recent months has talked up the prospect of more countercyclical policies which analysts generally interpret to mean measures to fight the current downward pressure on the economy overall economic growth slowed to 6 0 in the third quarter matching the government s full year growth target after injecting billions of dollars of liquidity into the financial system china s central bank earlier this month bid to encourage individual and corporate borrowing by cutting the reference interest rates that banks are asked to use as the basis for the rates they charge on loans and earlier this week the finance ministry assigned a new quota of 1 trillion yuan 142 billion for local government bonds to use next year primarily to fund infrastructure projects that assignment ahead of schedule allows local governments to receive funding and launch projects before an annual legislative conclave in march where total bond issuance quotas are typically set some economists say beijing needs to sustain its active policy support to keep the economy from deteriorating further mr tang the economist called on the central bank to free up more funds for lending by further reducing the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside in order to keep this good momentum the government still needs to continue its countercyclical adjustment said mr tang source dow jones
liquidity will return to the foreign exchange market and volatility may increase the three month implied volatility of the and fell to record lows last week 4 35 and 5 06 respectively extending a multi year trend the is threatening to break out of recent ranges that have been historically narrow a breakout could underpin volatility however low volatility is not just about the foreign exchange market the volatility of the is below 12 and near the year s low set in april a similar metric in the bond market move is below its 200 day moving average the risks of an escalation in the u s china trade conflict and an inconclusive uk election appear to have diminished president trump signed the hong kong bills in part on the assumption that it will not derail the trade talks if trump did not sign the bills they would have become law but this ploy was not needed china made the same unspecified threats before advanced weapons sales to taiwan sanctioning companies involved with human rights violations and blacklisting huawei bejing could bar the bill sponsors from entering greater china mainland hong kong and macau but it is largely symbolic it would become a badge of honor for those subjected to it moreover china knows as well as anyone that a law on the books means little without enforcement the market expected the 15 tariff on around 160 bln of chinese goods that the u s threatened for the middle of december will be waived and a scaled back version of phase one will be struck it is quite clear from the recent report that the sectors that have been subject to u s tariffs have been walloped while the sectors that are more domestic like infrastructure for example have fared considerably better the uk polls suggest the tories can secure a parliamentarian majority at the december 12 election labour s strategy of being nearly agnostic on brexit and promising a referendum on the deal seems to be failing to inspire the escalation of antisemitic accusations does the party no good the lib dems remain message has not been able to break the hold of the duopoly the scottish nationalists will do well and this will begin to lay the groundwork for another referendum for independence the economic data in the days ahead will set the tone for the remainder of the month last week s data prompted the ny fed gdp tracker to tick up to 0 8 fro 0 7 form the atlanta fed s model jumped to 1 7 from 0 3 the optimism could be challenged by the week ahead reports which are headlined by the the return of striking gm workers will lift the nonfarm payrolls by around 45k and

created an average of 226k jobs a month growth is expected to be steady at 3 0 a robust job market creates the fuel of consumption that drives the economy yet the relationship is more complicated and anything but straightforward appears to be slowing it grew by 4 6 in q2 and 2 9 in q3 it is off to a soft start in q4 real personal consumption expenditures rose 0 1 in october the weakest since

this is a little slower than the 17 03 mln vehicle average in the first 10 months of 2018 november sales figures are expected to have ticked up from october s 16 55 mln which was weakest in six months china reported an unexpected jump in its official november pmi the rose to 50 2 from 49 3 and the rose to 54 4 from 52 8 this lifted the composite reading to 53 7 the highest since march from 52 0 the national report focuses on large state owned businesses while the caixin measure puts more weight on smaller firms the will be reported around the time shanghai markets open on monday investors appear more skeptical of strong than weak data from china given their preconceived notions the eurozone sees the final and october the flash fell to 50 3 from 50 6 however both the and composite pmi edged higher germany s composite rose to 49 2 from 48 9 and the french composite firmed to 52 7 from 52 6 this means that there was deterioration outside of germany and france it most likely points to dramatic weakness in spain and or italy the economic strain can only exacerbate political pressures the uk s final pmi will most likely confirm the weakness of the flash report declines in both and sectors saw the tumble to 48 5 from 50 0 a new cyclical low the meets december 19 two members dissented at the november 7 meeting for an immediate cut about a one in nine chance of a rate cut has been discounted but a cut next year seems increasingly likely that said carney is due to step down on january 31 the uk will announce the change in the value of its reserve holdings on december 4 this is not a market moving report but the uk has accelerated the pace of reserve accumulation likely in anticipation of brexit reserves have risen an average of 1 53 bln a month this year compared with a 720 mln average last year the sales tax in japan and typhoon saw the october composite pmi fall to 49 1 from 51 5 the flash report suggested the situation stabilized in november with a bounce to 49 9 the impact is likely to linger because labor earnings have been weak labor cash earnings rose 0 5 year over year in september and the october pace is expected to have slowed to around 0 3 real cash earnings were up 0 2 year over year in september surged 9 5 year over year in september as activity was brought forward to beat the tax increase when it is reported at the end of next week the october pace is expected to have fallen 2 5 from a year ago the risk is on the downside after japan reported that plummeted 14 4 in the month of october as the tax hike and typhoon spurred a greater than expected contraction the and the meet next week a cut by the rba is unlikely but it would be less of a surprise than a move by the bank of canada the rba cut rates in october and saw the justification for a rate cut in november but did not move the bank s statement may be more important to the short term price action barring a surprise the bank of canada softened the language around its neutral stance but is in no hurry to ease policy where officials argue the benefits do not outweigh the potential costs as parliament returns the government will push middle class tax cuts which may also take some pressure off monetary policy the trump administration assault on the world trade organization and nato will be in the spotlight next week nato meets next week the u s has insisted and the allies have agreed to a new funding formula that will result in a smaller contribution from the americans previously the u s provided for 22 of the alliance s direct funding of around 2 5 bln the u s will scale back its contribution to 16 in line according to reports of germany s contribution 14 8 since 2014 when russia invaded crimea defense spending in europe has risen by around 100 bln according to reports the increased spending which has long been sought by u s administrations is partly a function of the increased risk threat previous commitments to boost spending and arguably the hectoring by the trump administration meanwhile nato has also become a bone of contention in europe macron said it was suffering from brain death as he advocates a stronger european military presence that german as the biggest economy would be expected to fund while france would likely provide important parts of the command structure merkel on the other hand who has yet to present a pathway fulfilling its 2 of budget commitment to nato gave a spirited defense of the alliance many are aware of the u s attack on the world trade organization s conflict resolution mechanism which is one way it differed from its predecessor gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade the u s has been blocking the appointment of new appellate judges for nearly two years around 70 of the initial judgments are appealed when fully staffed there are seven appellate judges and three are needed to make a decision there are three members now and the term of two ends on december 10 as of december 11 there will no longer be sufficient judges to issue binding decisions the u s argues that the appellate body oversteps its mandates and judges stretch out a case to earn more money few seem aware of the u s threat to block the wto s 2020 budget 200 mln where unanimity is necessary it made two dramatic proposals without promising to allow new appellate appointments it proposed that the operating fund be limited to chf100k which represents a 95 reduction the u s also proposed that now more than chf100k be earmarked for the appellate body which represents about an 87 reduction from the full budget allotment the u s also seeks to stop the end run by the eu norway and canada who have created a parallel dispute settlement system to work around the american s obstructionism the trump administration insists that going forward only the wto secretariat can approve of funding for such efforts not the appellate body itself there appear to be some ways that if the u s proposals are not accepted the wto can limp into next year the sums are not particularly large the u s share in 2018 was about 11 5 of the general budget or around chf23 mln and the wto enjoys a small surplus chf40 mln the budget will be discussed next week and it seems that in any case the wto will be further weakened there is are two other meetings next week that could have far reaching implications first the eu finance ministers meet on december 5 among the issues to be discussed will be updating the rules on biofuel taxation and related matters in particular there seems to be a push afoot to phase out the preferential treatment for aviation fuel under a new set of regulations this could have far reaching implications carbon pollution from international aviation has doubled since 1990 according to reports while total carbon emissions have fallen by a little more than a fifth recall rules that forced ocean tankers to generate less pollution saw shipping costs soar earlier this year as shipping capacity fell while operators were having their ships retrofitted the other meeting is the german social democrat party conference on december 6 8 as we have discussed previously the spd is fighting for its survival it has in coalition with merkel s cdu for 10 of the past 14 years it appears to have lost its identity and has seen its public support dwindle regardless of who wins its leadership contest the rank and file will vote at the conference whether to stay in the coalition if it chooses not to it would likely force a national election early next year
the euro us dollar eur usd exchange rate struggled at the beginning of last week after germany s ifo expectations index undershot projections at 92 1 in november leaving some traders jittery over the

exchange rates were held back by concerns over the german economy with continued us china trade uncertainty threatening to weaken the eurozone s largest economy thursday saw the eurozone s business climate indicator for november sink to a worse than expected 0 23 while economic confidence beat forecasts and rose to 101 3 this was followed by the release of germany s harmonised inflation index

core inflation figure beat forecasts and rose from 1 1 to 1 3 in november bert colijn senior economist for the eurozone at ing was downbeat in his assessment however saying advertisement as the economic environment is unlikely to be strong enough to see inflation move sustainably towards 2 over the course of 2020 this means that the forward guidance in place since september could keep ecb

began last week down against many of its competitors after october s us chicago fed national activity index fell below forecasts from 0 45 to 0 75 and exacerbated concerns of a slowing us economy us china trade deal optimism also weakened market demand for the safe haven greenback after developments between the world s two largest economies hinted at a possible phase one trade deal in the near term analysts at reuters commented u s president donald trump and chinese counterpart xi jinping on friday expressed a desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16 month tariff war that has lowered global growth however after us president donald trump signed the hong kong bill into law by mid week us china trade tensions escalated after beijing perceived washington as being involved in sinister intentions with china wednesday saw the usd eur exchange rate improve after the us growth figure for the third quarter was revised up to 2 1 due to better than expected inventory and business investment craig erlan the senior market analyst at oanda said that the us growth figure was a decent result under the circumstances as the economy continues to outpace many of its peers however the

much more positive local economic news released over this last week has failed to lift the kiwi dollar out of its tight trading range between 0 6400 and 0 6450 against the usd as expected there was a significant improvement in business confidence during the month of november following the more positive tone on the economic outlook from the reserve bank of new zealand earlier in the month retail sales for the september quarter released 26th november were also very positive with a 1 6 increase over the june quarter well above all prior forecasts the growth in consumer spending defying the gloom merchant who had been predicting a slowing and stalling of the nz economy all year the widely forecast not by this columnist slowdown in the economy in 2019 never actually eventuated it is more reassuring that the rbnz and bank economists are now predicting more positive economic growth in 2020 on the back of lower interest rates a lower exchange rate high export commodity prices and fiscal stimulus from the government the only remaining obstacle to improved nz business investment and economic activity is the global uncertainty from the china us trade wars any form of resolution to the trade stoush will certainly be positive for the global economy the nz economy and therefore the nz dollar value reflecting back on the nzd usd exchange rate movements over the past year it was largely the widespread forecasts from the aforementioned rbnz and bank economists of a weaker economy that drove expectations of successive cuts to the ocr interest rate to near zero that in turn pushed to kiwi dollar to lows of 0 6240 in early october the currency speculators who sold the kiwi dollar must have trusted the accuracy of those negative economic forecasts however the economic forecasts have been proven inaccurate therefore it seems inevitable that the speculators still holding short sold nzd positions will unwind by buying the nz dollar back before the end of the year it was thought the much improved local business confidence would have been a catalyst to prompt the speculators to unwind however unfortunately president trump signing the hong kong democracy support legislation threw more doubt on the trade talks progressing thus counteracting any kiwi dollar positives looking ahead over coming weeks the stream of positive news for the new zealand economy is set to continue and should be sufficient to cause a break above the solid 0 6450 resistance level in the nzd usd rate the terms of trade index export and import prices for the september quarter released on monday 2 december is expected to increase by another 1 0 to above 1 450 further increases in dairy commodity prices over the last two months seem likely to send the index above the record high of 1 472 recorded in the december 2017 quarter gdp growth data for the september quarter released on thursday 19th december may come out too late before christmas to have an impact on the currency value however all indications are that the quarterly increase will be well above current bank and rbnz forecasts of a 0 30 increase retail spending and agriculture production through that quarter would point to a 0 50 or 0 60 outcome however the timing of inventory changes can throw these numbers around finance minister grant robertson is announcing the fast forwarding of several infrastructure projects in a budget policy statement on december 11th the labour coalition government is finally reacting to the calls to take advantage of the super low interest rates to invest now for the future offshore economic condition and outlook also important australian economic data has not been all that positive in recent weeks causing the aud usd exchange rate to sag from 0 6900 to 0 6760 the

positive for the currency with a 0 60 increase expected chinese manufacturing numbers also appear to have turned the corner upwards and this will be positive news for the aud as the australian economy remains heavily dependent on china the us dollar itself is still expected to weaken against all currencies if and when the phase one trade deal between china and the us is announced the usd strengthened as a safe haven currency to be in when the trade wars blew up 18 months ago three cuts by the fed to us interest rates over recent months was expected to weaken the us currency however that has not occurred as the trade wars drag on and outweigh the interest rate influence whilst the us support of the demonstrators in hong kong damages the sino us relationship there still has to be confidence that the trade negotiators are close to the phase one deal and a time place for president trump and premier xi to sign will be announced sometime in the next two weeks it appears that the chinese are now changing internal laws regulations on intellectual property and technology transfers something the americans have been pushing hard for the complete global economic outlook improves dramatically when the trade wars end and tariffs are removed the new zealand economy is well positioned to advantage from the expected offshore upturn and the kiwi dollar will follow email roger j

week subscribe at globaltaiwan org subscribe i wei jennifer chang is a research fellow at the global taiwan institute on november 4 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations asean and five regional nations announced at the 35th asean summit in bangkok that a major regional free trade agreement the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep 區域全面經濟夥伴協定 will be signed next year rcep will establish the largest free trade area in the indo pacific region comprising 10 asean countries china japan south korea australia and new zealand and notably without the united states since rcep negotiations began in 2013 taiwan has expressed interest in joining the regional trade pact as well as other multilateral agreements such as the trans pacific partnership tpp and its successor the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp as part of broader efforts to participate in multilateral economic cooperation and free trade negotiations as well as to institutionalize bilateral and multilateral cooperation with asean countries as the most economically dynamic region of the world the indo pacific region has been the focus of several multilateral trade negotiations over the past decade most notably the tpp cptpp and rcep southeast asian countries occupy important nodes in the supply chains connected to the more industrialized economies of taiwan china south korea and japan over the last few decades there has been a consistent push within the region towards economic integration and greater connectivity sometimes led by the united states and other times by regional economies once the economic anchor of the barack obama administration s pivot rebalance to asia the tpp which did not include china was already losing steam before and lost us support soon after donald j trump assumed the american presidency indeed a major impetus towards a final agreement on rcep has been attributed to the us china trade war us protectionism under president trump and their negative spillover effects onto regional economic growth the united states is not a participating member of either cptpp nor rcep leaving major regional economies such as china and japan and sometimes india and rapidly growing southeast asian countries to play larger roles in forging and institutionalizing these multilateral trade mechanisms in the indo pacific region contrary to the common perception that rcep is led by china asean s involvement helped steer multilateral cooperation under rcep a proclaimed objective of rcep is to significantly contribute to an open inclusive and rules based international trading system and expansion of value chains after seven years of negotiation 15 of the 16 countries said they have concluded text based negotiations for all 20 chapters and essentially all their market access issues and tasked legal scrubbing by them to commence for signing in 2020 the rcep participating countries will also work with india which opted out of the final negotiations in bangkok to resolve all outstanding issues india declined to join rcep pointing to significant issues of core interest that remained unresolved some analysts argued that india remained concerned about the potential surge of chinese imports and lack of progress on service market access india s decision to not join rcep at the moment due to domestic protectionist concerns came as disappointing news japan and other countries saw india s presence as a counterweight to china which is likely to play a major role in asia pacific connectivity china meanwhile lauded rcep s announcement with chinese state media calling rcep a boost to its international campaign to preserve economic globalization against protectionism and unilateralism namely from the united states a chinese editorial said that rcep s progress may quicken the pace of a potential china asean free trade area and china japan south korea free trade area in addition to rcep the china and asean countries issued a joint declaration in bangkok on synergizing china s belt and road initiative and the master plan on asean connectivity 2025 further seeking to strengthen economic and trade relations between the two sides for taiwan exclusion from rcep could have significant implications for its economy which is heavily dependent on foreign trade rcep countries which account for nearly 60 percent of taiwan s foreign trade with china constituting 25 percent of the island s foreign trade and taiwan s major trade partners and investment centers china asean and japan are also rcep member countries in response to the announcement on rcep taiwan s minister of economic affairs shen jong chin 沈榮津 downplayed the impact on taiwan arguing that 70 percent of trade between taiwan and rcep countries are already tariff free taiwan also has two free trade agreements ftas with new zealand and singapore signed in july and november 2013 respectively at the 2013 signing of the agreement between singapore and the separate customs territory of taiwan penghu kinmen and matsu on economic partnership astep taipei said that such an fta demonstrates taiwan s commitment to trade liberalization and internationalization and will pave the way for taiwan s entry into the tpp and rcep after rcep is formally inaugurated in 2020 taxes levied on taiwanese exports to rcep countries could weaken the competitiveness of taiwanese products in rcep countries the taiwanese industries most likely to be affected include textiles petrochemicals and automotive components minister shen said these potential effects of the rcep agreement could be mitigated by industrial changes and that taiwan s government will assist traditional industries to enhance their services another potential impact is that taiwanese and foreign capital may be channeled towards the rcep countries and diverted away from taiwan in 2014 taiwan said it would like to join rcep because the countries covered by the agreement are also taiwan s main export market and investment region also taiwan s entry into rcep could bring additional benefits including improving taiwan s industrial structure attracting foreign trade and investment to taiwan and strengthening the industrial supply chain links between taiwan and rcep members thereby enhancing taiwan s competitiveness and assisting taiwanese manufacturers to achieve a more level playing field in the international market furthermore given that taiwan lacks the experience in participating in regional ftas and liberalization with many countries taiwan s participation in rcep could help its laws and regulations conform to international standards once the rcep completes negotiations it will definitely have a major impact on asia pacific economic integration and the global economic situation according to taiwan s national development council the regional economic integration of major trading partners under rcep will create an uneven playing field for taiwanese businesses to compete in the international market said the national development council taiwan could potentially apply for rcep membership after the rcep negotiation is completed in 2020 as long as it is an asean fta partner and a trade partner who has not participated in the rcep negotiations and is subject to the consensus of rcep members taiwan s president tsai ing wen 蔡英文 has long supported taiwan joining rcep though with china s participation as a member state that would be a long shot in her inaugural address in may 2016 tsai mentioned joining rcep the first step of reform is to strengthen the vitality and autonomy of our economy reinforce taiwan s global and regional connections and actively participate in multilateral and bilateral economic cooperation as well as free trade negotiations including the tpp and rcep under tsai s new southbound policy 新南向政策 taipei seeks to pursue institutionalized bilateral and multilateral cooperation with asean and south asian countries one of the main economic and trade objectives of the new southbound policy is to make progress on signing bilateral investment and taxation agreements with asean countries south asia new zealand and australia for doing so would strengthen taiwan s efforts to join tpp and rcep after the recent rcep announcement taiwan s foreign minister jaushieh joseph wu 吳釗燮 pointed out that since china is a rcep member taiwan s chances of joining the trade agreement are not very high foreign minister wu said the rcep mechanism is not a friendly mechanism for taiwan but taiwan will seek to seriously participate in other regional economic integration mechanisms such as cptpp wu said the island has a higher chance of entering cptpp comprised of australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam and notably without chinese participation than rcep from a comparative standpoint cptpp admission is more open politically towards taiwan than rcep though rcep countries account for 59 percent of taiwan s trade compared to cptpp at 24 percent in terms of investment rcep accounts for 65 percent of taiwan s foreign investment while cptpp only accounts for 14 percent due to china s inclusion in rcep therefore rcep is economically more beneficial to taiwan than cptpp the inclusion of china coupled with the current absence of the united states and india in rcep may serve to weaken the us indo pacific strategy and create a bigger space for china to set the rules and norms of regional economic integration alongside china s massive belt and road initiative also known as one belt one road and its extensive economic outreach to southeast asian countries rcep may further strengthen china s role in asia pacific connectivity particularly in southeast asia meanwhile taiwan s exclusion from rcaep could make taiwanese exports less competitive than other economic competitors such as south korea who are participating members of rcep a weaker taiwanese economy relative to rcep countries could also hurt taiwan s political standing in the region and affect its foreign relations while the economic benefits of taiwan joining rcep are clear under pressure from beijing it may only realistically be able to join cptpp as the next best option the main point once rcep is formally established in 2020 taiwan s exclusion from rcep

yoni assia johannes rude jensen and omri ross e toro the libra project originally sets forth the long term vision of a permissionless consensus layer governed wholly by disparate regulated entities validating transactions on the network collectively the network is intended to support the libra a supranational currency unit made available initially to verified users of the calibra wallet software a subsidiary of facebook inc as the libra currency unit is intended for commercial use and marketed for global peer to peer transactions amongst the 2 7 billion users of whatsapp and facebook it is critical that the unit will not be subject to the precarious volatility characterizing national currencies as is widely known the relative purchasing power of a given national currency is not only subject to inflation and domestic monetary policy but to a broad array of externalities spanning the complexities of global trade and political shifts addressing this issue in congressional testimony david marcus explained the intentions of minimizing exposure to the nominal volatility of national currencies by collateralizing the currency unit with reserves held in strategically dispersed locations scattered across the globe ostensibly the currency reserves would act as the key mechanism in the value preservation of the libra currency granting holders the lawful claim to a reserve of currencies including the u s dollar the british pound the euro and the japanese yen not dissimilar to that of the imfs special drawing rights the intended strategy by which to achieve relative stability is to maintain a weighted basket of fiat currencies evaluated against strict fiscal and monetary procedures in the effort of preserving relative stability for those denominating transactions in the unit by collateralizing each unit with the lawful claim to a relative distribution of highly liquid assets the assumption was that regulators would accept the legitimacy of the libra currency as a synthetic asset at face value that was far from the case the cost of innovation
protesters took to the streets of iran on nov 15 after oil prices soared by as much as 50 oil prices remained unchanged despite regular yearly inflation rates of as high as 10 30 though subsidies were needed the budget balance saw considerable deficits due to the direct financial transfers public debt became unsustainable reaching 30 the long awaited price hike was announced nov 14 with the decision of the supreme council of economic coordination of iran led by president hassan rouhani the reinstatement of u s sanctions following washington s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action or the iran nuclear deal on may 8 2018 really hurt the economy though the sanctions did not take effect until november 2018 negative projections for iran s economy began surfacing in january 2018 when u s president donald trump set demands that were hard to meet for the continuation of the deal starting in early 2018 several macroeconomic indicators such as economic growth unemployment and inflation deteriorated iran s economy contracted 4 in 2018 and is expected to contract by another 9 5 during 2019 the currency plummeted to record lows in the past 22 months in january 2018 1 dollar was equal to 4 000 iranian toman however free market rates absolutely exploded in october 2018 and the exchange rate shot up to a whopping 17 000 iranian toman per dollar the currency was able to slowly recover starting ar the end of 2018 down to 12 000 toman this nevertheless means the toman lost more than two thirds of its value since january 2018 the foreign currency crisis in iran triggered an increase in inflation as well the inflation rate dropped from 40 to 8 in rouhani s first term between 2013 and 2017 however the increasing foreign exchange rates were passed on to prices the inflation rate rose sharply to 50 and food prices rose by 70 iran has a young population the average age is around 28 another 1 million people are looking to enter the workforce each year which would only be possible with a 6 7 economic growth however unemployment is on the rise in iran due to the lack of investments more than 40 of college graduates are unemployed thus the young population is a big part of protests which are called bread riots or youth riots fundamental macroeconomic indicators draw a pessimistic picture of the future of the economy and people in the streets are feeling more deeply each day because or the sad state of affairs the protests are sociologically different from earlier cases the post election protests in 2009 and the 2017 2018 protests attracted mostly middle class iranians both of these protests were conducted in various cities in iran but these protests were not socio economic issues oriented people marched through the city centers and carried out large scale but mostly non violent protests protests in the last two week were also multi city in nature however instead of gathering in the city centers protesters marched in small groups of 100 to 1 000 people in various districts the densities were especially high in poor neighborhoods in addition the violence level of the protests in ethnic and religious minority areas of khuzestan and kurdistan were substantially higher compared to previous protests most people who have lost their lives were from these regions the fact that the protesters are now also damaging public and private property shows under just how much pressure the public is under because of political and economic problems unless these problems are solved or relieved and the iranian public finds hope to break out of the downward spiral it seems protests will continue to damage the iranian state according to iranian officials the u s was secretly involved in the protests officials reported that the protesters were more reckless than ever because they have set fire to gas stations banks and vehicles it was also said that some protesters were using firearms in certain areas such acts used to be uncommon there are protests all over the world and many states have to try and cope with them the situation in iran is unique in one way the government shut down all internet access to prevent protesters from organizing internet based social media platforms are being criticized for cooperating with western governments to help suppress riots but not with less developed countries the government completely shut down all internet acess to remove this risk access was forbidden for almost a week throughout the country which proved to be very effective for suppressing riots the clock is ticking against iran structural issues and u s sanctions are continuing to damage the country the u s is expecting to get iran to the negotiating table as the islamic republic would not be able to withstand sanctions and pressure much longer iran is looking to minimize its losses establish as much control as possible internally and dissuade other countries from taking steps against it in hopes the u s might decide to rejoin the jcpa in case the trump is not re elected in 2020
last week the economic counsellor of the embassy of spain pedro pascual briefed the members of the spanish chamber of commerce on the prospects of the world economy from 2020 and beyond we are headed for challenging times global growth is seen to decelerate from 3 8 in 2018 to 3 in 2019 and further down to 2 7 world bank data in 2020 due to several reasons the most significant of which is the trade war waged by the us against china and the eu the effect of these trade wars is a reduction in global trade from its normal growth rate of 3 to just 1 in the next two years exacerbating matters are the political uncertainties that persists in every continent of the globe from brexit in europe to the specter of a presidential impeachment in the us from hong kong s civil unrest to the chilean riots in latin america all these dampen global investments which is seen to decrease by as much as 40 the united states will likely post a growth rate of 2 4 in 2019 decelerating to 2 1 in 2020 this is because the pump priming initiatives of 2017 tax cuts will lose their effect while employment will remain stable investments in new enterprises are seen to drop similarly consumption is seen to soften as the tariff increases on chinese products begin to translate to higher retail prices as for china it too will slow down from a likely growth rate of 6 1 in 2019 it is seen to decelerate to just 5 8 in 2020 public construction will ease dramatically as the communist government reigns in its massive debts the trade war s effect on china has not been as significant as one may expect this is because the chinese economy is now transitioning from an export lead economy to one that is consumption lead the slack in demand for chinese goods abroad are off set by a spike in local consumption hence a rise in the production of consumer goods is foreseen while production of capital goods will drop as for the eu growth is seen to be almost static from 1 2 in 2019 to 1 4 in 2020 among the bigger economies of the eu spain will post the fastest growth rate of 2 2 and 1 8 this year and next germany will struggle with growth of only 05 in 2019 and 1 2 in 2020 at the heart of the eu woes is the drop in the production of automobiles the production of cars trucks and their supply chain of parts comprises the largest chunk of the eu s industrial output for the first time in a decade demand for automobiles is seen to drop by 3 across the board due to the rise of ride sharing services and a shift in preference away from diesel and gasoline to electric vehicles the trade war will also affect the eu adversely especially spain whose biggest export destination outside the eu is the united states investments in new factories will decrease but consumption will remain steady emerging markets including the philippines will continue to drive global growth among the larger economies in this category india the philippines vietnam and indonesia will post growth rates of between five and seven percent in 2019 and 2020 the philippines is seen to grow by 5 7 in 2019 and 6 3 in 2020 the country is on track towards graduating to an upper middle income economy early next year since consumption and government spending drives the economy the effects of the trade war is minimal economic indicators in the philippines are stable inflation stood at 1 7 as of august the current account deficit is forecast to reach 2 4 of gdp by year end a level that is still manageable unemployment was at 5 4 as of july and gross international reserves stand at 85 7 billion equivalent to 7 5 months of imports these numbers suggests that the economy is healthy but there are fundamental weaknesses too the most serious of which is the drop in foreign direct investments fdis by a massive 40 this is due to many reasons among them is the uncertainty in the tax environment due to citira and the slower than expected roll out of infrastructure projects which has turned off many investors it must be stressed however that the negative list of industries where foreigners are precluded or limited from participation as prescribed by the 1987 constitution is still the biggest dampener in the country s ability to attract fdis president duterte has yet to fulfill his promise to amend the charter doing so will open the floodgates of fdis other weaknesses that government has been slow to resolve are the relatively low education and talent quotient of the workforce relatively slow adoption to information and communication technologies low innovation capability corruption bureaucratic red tape and a lethargic corrupt justice system these weaknesses taken collectively have eroded philippine competitiveness as i have always said foreign direct investments is the silver bullet that can make the philippine s growth story sit on solid ground even today despite the economy s growth of 6 or more i worry that our growth is driven by public consumption and government spending the former is fueled by ofw remittances while the latter is funded by debt foreign direct investments brings in capital technologies jobs and export earnings the fdi growth path is fundamentally more solid as it based on productivity as we move forward to the 2020s the world will face new realities said mr pascual immigration will persist due to economic reasons climate reasons erosion of coastal areas and extreme weather changes as well as for reasons of domestic conflict robotics and automation will take over manual labor modes of mobility will change away from private cars to public transportation rider sharing and bicycles and innovative services will continue to disrupt brick and mortar businesses these changes will bring about massive disruption to industries worldwide but they will also bring forth many opportunities the losers will be those who resist change and fail to adapt but the winners will be those who evolve innovate and create andrew j masigan is an economist

john bellamy foster is editor of monthly review and a professor of sociology at the university of oregon brett clark is associate editor of monthly review and a professor of sociology at the university of utah hannah holleman is a director of the monthly review foundation and an associate professor of sociology at amherst college the expropriation of the mass of the people from the soil constitutes the basis of the capitalist mode of production karl marx 1 the power of abstraction karl marx noted is absolutely crucial to the theoretical analysis of historical systems as exemplified by his critique of capitalist political economy 2 but while the force of abstraction is indispensable to any attempt to grasp the inner character of capital also implicit in marx s historical materialism is the notion that capitalism can never be reduced simply to its internal logic 3 rather it is also the product of numerous contingent historical conditions that form the empirical boundaries and limits within which the system operates and are integral to its functioning thus historical capitalism cannot be understood aside from its existence as a colonial imperialist world system in which the violent exercise of power is an ever present reality in order to uncover the material conditions governing concrete capitalism including its interface with land nonwage labor and corporeal life it is therefore necessary to go beyond the inner reality of exploitation and address expropriation or the process of appropriation without equivalent or without reciprocity through which capital has sought to determine its wider parameters the concept of expropriation is commonly seen on the left as a mere synonym for the notion of primary accumulation a category derived from classical liberal political economy that marx subjected to ruthless critique 4 in fact even in those instances where he referred to so called primitive accumulation taking this concept directly from adam smith who had introduced the notion of previous accumulation or previous stock marx immediately sought to transform this into the altogether different question of expropriation seeing this as constituting the essential precondition of capitalism as well as its continuous reality 5 for marx the expropriation on which capitalism was based had nothing to do with so called previous accumulation or the nursery tale propounded by classical political economy that the capitalist system had its origin in abstinence and the consequent buildup of savings 6 indeed marx as marxian political economist michael perelman writes adamantly dismissed smith s mythical previous accumulation in order to call attention to the actual historical experience characterized by rampant expropriation 7 the preconditions of capitalism marx explained were to be found in a brutal system of robbery manifested in the form of enclosures the usurpation of the land the dispossession of the peasantry and the pillage of the colonized world giving rise to proletarianization genocide and slavery all of this involved the transfer of claims to existing property wealth along with the wholesale expropriation of populations who were subjected to some of the worst forms of forcible oppression removing them from the land and ownership of the means of reproduction and transforming them into proletarians who had no way to live except by selling their labor power this extended as well to capitalism s expropriation of the soil itself such violent expropriation characterizing the entire mercantilist era was not merely a predatory precursor to capitalism proper as thinkers like max weber and joseph schumpeter asserted in the twentieth century but was integral to historical capitalism and colonialism determining the very boundaries of the system and carried forward into the modern era 8 thus expropriation of the masses of the people from the soil the dispossession of indigenous populations and the pillage of the americas africa and asia by colonial conquest set the stage for the rise of industrial capitalism and the new system of accumulation 9 it was this marx stressed not previous accumulation based on abstinence that led to the genesis of the industrial capitalist 10 expropriation constituted the starting point of the capitalist mode of production 11 such ruthless expropriation did not end with the mercantilist era rather the bloody usurpations of land labor and corporeal life on a world scale has continued to form the boundary conditions of capitalism up to the present day although marx s key concepts of exploitation and expropriation necessarily overlapped to some extent they were nonetheless analytically distinct forming an identity in difference and at the same time difference in identity or a dialectical relation exploitation related primarily to the appropriation of surplus value through a formal process of equal exchange in which surplus value was extracted from the direct producers conversely expropriation was directed at those conditions where a quid pro quo did not operate even formally and where outright robbery or profit upon expropriation occurred 12 in late capitalism and late imperialism equal exchange is increasingly a veil concealing a robbery system with widening spheres of unequal exchange this system of robbery implemented by monopolistic multinational corporations encompasses natural conditions of production and life itself as michael d yates argues in can the working class change the world there can be no separation between exploitation and expropriation while the former allows us to understand the specificities of the appropriation of unpaid labor from workers in the production process the latter brings to the fore racism patriarchy environmental catastrophe and imperialism 13 hence marx s concept of expropriation seen in a complex dialectical and historical relation to exploitation is the key to understanding the multiple oppressions that constitute capitalism as a historical system and its overall relation to its material environment the concept of expropriation in marx s analysis had its locus classicus in his critique of james stewart s eighteenth century treatment of profit upon expropriation as opposed to profit upon accumulation which was to influence his two major discussions of primary expropriation in the grundrisse and capital for marx expropriation was appropriation without equivalent or appropriation without reciprocity 14 although there is a vast literature on the concept of primitive accumulation the term primitive was a mistranslation as marx was referring to what in classical political economy was designated as previous or primary accumulation 15 moreover marx treated the phrase pejoratively entitling his discussion so called primitive accumulation and indicating in a number of places his disdain for the term which in classical political economy had been designed to justify the current order 16 for marx the inner logic of capital was explained as a product of exploitation in a theoretical context that specified equal exchange yet he never failed to stress that the background conditions of the system along with its external development and expansion were governed by force and fraud 17 this aspect of his critique was meant to be taken up systematically later on as he moved from the abstract to the concrete from the pure logic of capital to the ground of the world economy and crisis that is imperialism 18 an underlying perception of the role of expropriation in determining the historical boundaries of capitalism informed his and frederick engels s discussions of slavery patriarchy and the metabolic rift or the irreparable rift in the interdependent process of social metabolism a metabolism prescribed by the natural laws of life itself 19 a renewed focus on expropriation is therefore essential today if we want to understand the historical relation between the accumulative society processes associated with exchange value and capital s continuing robbery of various nonaccumulative societies processes related to use value 20 the issue here becomes not simply one of the exploitation of labor but the expropriation of household economies and household subsistence labor corporeal life the periphery and the planetary environment historically appropriation without equivalent is the most common form of class hierarchal relations manifested in complex ways in various tributary modes of production 21 however serving to distinguish capitalist society historically from its precapitalist precursors in this respect is the greater systematization and scale assumed by profits upon expropriation beginning with the mercantilist period but extending into all the later stages of capitalist development in the ruling liberal ideology such expropriation whether in the form of slavery war genocide unequal exchange or the exercise of monopoly power is treated as either an accident unrelated to the capitalist system or as an inevitable product of human nature raised to the level of society as a whole violence and robbery despite their pervasiveness in global capitalism are thus commonly portrayed as disconnected from the inner nature and logic of the economic system rooted in quid pro quo nevertheless the sordid history of capitalism is hard to pass off as a series of accidents or anomalies the last five centuries involve a dismal chronology of colonialism imperialism racial capitalism wars of aggression and patriarchal expropriation of household labor these particular social ills of capitalism are accompanied by the systematic violation of what the great german chemist justus von liebig called the law of compensation or the need to replenish the constituent elements taken from the earth 22 while marx devoted the greater part of his critique of political economy to analyzing capital s inner dynamic of exploitation the wider reality of expropriation was thus never far from his mind and it was revealed in the margins of his analysis it was clearly slated to be taken up more fully in his planned volumes on landed property wage labor the state international trade and the world market and crises all of which represented successively more concrete levels of analysis in marx s view colonization was never simply about the expropriation of the land but also encompassed the extirpation enslavement and entombment in mines of the indigenous population 23 it was this recognition of the role of expropriation of the land and people that accounts for much of the extraordinary richness and power of marx and engels s historical observations the revolution against capital necessitated the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the people or in other words the expropriation of the expropriators 24 crucial investigations into the role expropriation played within marx s critique of capitalism and the application of this to the historical analysis of capitalist development have emerged recently in a number of places including social reproduction theory for example the work of nancy fraser analyses of racial capitalism as in the writings of michael dawson and sven beckert and marxian ecological theory particularly treatments of marx s theory of metabolic rift 25 glen sean coulthard has argued in red skin white masks that examination of the violent expropriation of indigenous peoples requires that we see dispossession as a co foundational feature of our understanding of and critical engagement with capitalism open up the possibility of developing a more ecologically attentive critique of colonial capitalist accumulation 26 our analysis in what follows is designed to illustrate the crucial importance of the theoretical insights stemming from activation of marx s concept of expropriation we focus on three historical moments of massive expropriation of people and the earth moment i the industrialization of agriculture and the metabolic rift moment ii dust bowls of empire and moment iii imperialism in the anthropocene the intention here is obviously not to provide a detailed much less comprehensive analysis of any of these critical phases of development but rather to highlight in each case how a historical materialist method encompassing expropriation as well as exploitation can help capture the various contradictions and conflicts of capitalism within a wider lens 27 if marx famously said that the main internal barrier to capital was capital itself he also indicated that capital s main external limit was its refusal to accept any limits whatsoever turning all boundaries into barriers to be transgressed by the capitalist juggernaut faced with capitalism s destruction of the irish ecology in the nineteenth century he raised the question of ruin or revolution a question even more relevant in the twenty first century in the context of capitalism s disruption of the entire earth system 28 moment i the industrialization of agriculture and the metabolic rift the industrialization of agriculture in the nineteenth century rested upon the long historical emergence of capitalism as a distinct socioeconomic order as beckert details in the empire of cotton imperial expansion expropriation and slavery were critical to its formation 29 throughout the age of mercantilism from the mid fifteenth to mid eighteenth centuries a period beckert refers to as war capitalism earlier property forms and productive relations were dissolved via the enclosure of the commons and imperialism formally transferring title of land to the bourgeois class the racialized characteristics of capitalism were embedded from the start as africa asia and the americas were colonized while genocidal campaigns were waged against indigenous peoples and africans were enslaved to work on plantations 30 these conditions contributed to the massive transfer of wealth to england and other european nations marx explained that this process of primary expropriation was pivotal to the english industrial revolution 31 cotton was associated with the robbery of nature and nonwaged labor as well as the exploitation of waged labor providing the cheap materials essential to the rising textile factories where industrial laborers subsisted on imported potatoes from the increasingly exhausted fields of ireland the first agricultural revolution in the capitalist age coincided with the enclosures from the late fifteenth to early nineteenth centuries and the formal transfer of land titles peasants and small land holders were driven from the land pauperized proletarianized and forced to sell their labor power for wages to purchase the means of subsistence these changes ushered in a heightened alienation from nature a more distinct town country division and specialized food and fiber production the second agricultural revolution from 1830 to 1880 was characterized by the development of soil chemistry the growth of the fertilizer trade and industry the increase in the scale and intensity of agricultural production and land improvements such as imposing uniformity across fields making them easier to apply modern technologies additionally intensified agricultural production required massive fertilizer inputs in order to enrich the soil 32 in numerous ways this period is the embodiment of appropriation without equivalent and without reciprocity liebig played a pioneering role in studying the changing soil chemistry in relation to the advancing capitalist industrial agriculture he noted that the production of crops depended on the soil containing essential nutrients such as but not limited to nitrogen phosphorus and potassium he explained that a rational system of agriculture must be governed by the law of compensation or the law of replacement 33 the nutrients that are absorbed by plants as they grow must be restored to the soil to support future crops but this was far from the case in western europe and the united states in the nineteenth century liebig noted that the british high farming techniques constituted a robbery system leading to the despoliation of the soil 34 marx who studied liebig s work detailed how the application of industrial practices to increase yields and the transportation of food and fiber to distant markets in cities were generating a rift in the soil nutrient cycle in capital he famously observed that capitalist agriculture progressively disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth preventing the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil as a result all progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art not only of robbing the worker but of robbing the soil all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is progress towards ruining the more long lasting sources of that fertility 35 marx thus presented a systematic analysis of how industrialized agriculture robbed the land of necessary nutrients but he also recognized and provided the basis for assessing the interlocking oppressions and processes of expropriation that accompanied this soil crisis as the nutrients from the countryside accumulated as waste in the cities or were washed away to sea as part of urban refuse a variety of means were sought to replenish the land 36 in particular between 1840 and 1880 an international fertilizer trade was established which involved shipping millions of tons of guano and nitrates from peru and chile to the global north the mining of guano was largely rooted in expropriation of land labor and corporeal life all of which were necessary to make this fertilizer so profitable initially male convicts and slaves worked as forced labor on the guano islands using picks shovels wheelbarrows and sacks as the availability of slaves declined chinese workers were imported as part of the coolie labor system 37 former slavers used coercion deceit kidnapping and questionable contracts to set up this new racialized regime of bonded labor which supplied workers for colonies and former colonies throughout the world over ninety thousand chinese workers were shipped to peru during the heyday of the guano trade approximately 10 percent died in passage due mainly to poor treatment and malnourishment the most unfortunate unfree laborers were sent to the guano islands where the total workforce fluctuated between two hundred to eight hundred workers at any given moment but where lives were used up rapidly considered of less value than the guano that they dug up 38 only men were sent to these islands where over one hundred armed soldiers kept guard preventing workers from committing suicide by running into the ocean 39 marx described this coolie system as a form of disguised slavery 40 eye witness accounts noted that these chinese workers were treated as expendable regularly flogged and whipped if they did not fulfill the demanding work expectations they labored in the hot sun filling sacks and wheelbarrows with guano which they then transported to a chute that loaded the boats guano dust coated their bodies and filled their lungs the smell was overwhelming one account described the conditions as the infernal art of using up human life to the very last inch as the lives of the workers were very short 41 several british shipmasters were horrified at the cruelties inflicted on the chinese whose dead bodies they described as floating round the islands 42 here we see how expropriation works at the boundaries of the capitalist system guano which had been used for thousands of years to enrich the fields of peru was quickly being exhausted to replenish the fields of the global north the sea birds that deposited hundreds of feet of guano on the islands were often killed as they were deemed a nuisance to extractive operations guano was being removed at a much faster rate than it accumulated the new racialized labor system that was imposed was largely predicated on brutally expropriated bonded labor enhancing accumulation at the core of the system the conditions resulted in a corporeal rift which undermined living conditions leading to poor health and an early death for many of the workers who were simply replaced by other imported laborers all of this moreover was meant to make possible a continuation of a robbery system where the soil in europe and north america was being systematically robbed of its nutrients these conditions of expropriation were a central component of supporting the second agricultural revolution accompanying the industrial revolution the industrial revolution in which cotton was so integral had been based on the triangular slave trade it was after the slavery abolition act of 1833 which formally abolished slavery within most british colonies that the british turned to the coolies from asia a disguised form of slavery as a way of replacing open slavery with new forms of bonded labor guano in this sense was part of a second triangular trade geared to the industrialization of agriculture british high farming and the need to restore the impoverished soil by means of an imperial system involving the worst extremes of labor exploitation and the expropriation of corporeal life in the nineteenth century women were at the center of the industrial revolution constituting the majority of the core industrial workforce in england especially in the cotton silk wool and lace sectors of textile production 43 marx took detailed notes regarding their positions within the workforce and the conditions under which they labored along with engels he documented the specific types of hazards that these women were exposed to which created an array of health problems that shortened their lives such as respiratory issues from inhaling fibers both working class men and women experienced forms of corporeal degradation associated with their working conditions but the specifics varied according to the types of work in which they were concentrated 44 additionally women received much lower wages than men and had a disproportionate responsibility for social reproductive work to support whole families to the extent that this additional activity was possible given the long working hours 45 women in this period were superexploited in the industrial workforce producing a large share of surplus value in factories while at the same time they were compelled to produce use values which served as a free gift to capital through their work in the home in the process of reproducing labor 46 under these conditions which threatened the very existence of the working class family women though responsible for the social reproduction of the family and the labor force could scarcely maintain their own existence the double day was not a creation of late capitalism but rather was present at the very birth of industrial capitalism at a time when the working day including the time necessary to get to and from work for women was often twelve hours or longer six days a week for the working classes wage exploitation was also in a sense nutritional exploitation as wages were mainly expended on the most basic foods necessary for survival intensive agricultural production in england which was supported by imported fertilizer contributed to the creation of a new international food regime after the irish potato famine and the end of the corn laws in 1845 46 what marx himself called the new food regime involved a shift toward more of a meat based system in which additional land was being devoted to animal production geared to serving the upper classes 47 in contrast as marx and engels detailed the working class subsisted on poor quality and inadequate diets consisting largely of bread and very few vegetables 48 to make matters worse the food drink and medicine that was available was adulterated containing a vast array of contaminates such as mercury chalk sand feces and strychnine regular consumption of these materials contributed to various health ailments chronic gastritis and death women tended to be the most malnourished as they consumed less food and ate last within families conditions were worse in england s colony of ireland which was forced to export its soil nutrients and its capital to england 49 the industrialization of agriculture was intimately connected to the transgression of natural limits given the interlocking expropriation of land labor and corporeal life that shaped the social metabolism and that constantly expanded capitalism s intensive creative destruction the new system required the exponential growth of external inputs from the environment metabolic rifts the imperial draining of wealth from the global south and a system of exploitation that had expropriation as its background condition defined the rise of capitalism in the nineteenth century moment ii dust bowls of empire the age of so called primitive accumulation or primary expropriation was the era of early colonialism including the development of white settler colonialism of which the united states was a prime example the united states was seen from the beginning in the words of george washington as a rising empire the american revolution was induced in part by the british proclamation of 1763 which limited the movement of settlers into the ohio valley to the west with the victory of the thirteen colonies the land in the ohio valley was opened to land speculators and settlers the iroquois confederacy so admired by marx and engels was swept aside in around a dozen years almost all of their land was expropriated and they were forced onto a few small reserves washington termed the indians beasts of prey and ordered his troops during the american revolution to invade the iroquois villages killing men women and children and destroying their crops in a war of absolute extermination 50 with the advent of the industrial revolution the demand for u s cotton boomed to feed the textile industries of england giving new life to the slave system as marx emphasized plantation slavery with its monocrops and brutalized slave labor was ecologically inefficient however successful it was in terms of capital accumulation it rapidly exhausted the soil generating a westward movement as plantation owners sought to bring virgin land into cultivation 51 agriculture in new england was only marginally less destructive to the soil and forests pushing populations and capital ever further to the west while much of the grain produced following the abolition of the corn laws in britain in 1846 was being exported to england in a global environmental rift 52 in his excerpts from agricultural chemist j w johnston s notes on north america marx emphasized the former s observation with respect to the common system of north america of selling everything for which a market can be got and taking no trouble to put anything into the soil in return 53 the building of railroads the industrial revolution in the united states in the 1830s and 40s and the opening up of the far west partly through the seizure of lands from mexico all went hand in hand with a process of genocide and displacement of native americans while coupling ecological destruction with capitalist development in 1890 the bureau of census declared the frontier closed while the indian wars were declared over with the massacre at wounded knee that same year after which figures such as frederick jackson turner and theodore roosevelt argued for the extension of the u s frontier abroad leading to the spanish american war 54 the coming of monopoly capitalism and the age of the giant corporation only expanded the realm of expropriation of people and nature into entirely new spheres in visiting indian territory in oklahoma at the very beginning of the twentieth century where the extractive petroleum industry was booming next door to expropriative farming practices weber documented some of the destruction wrought on the earth and the indigenous populations with almost lightning speed he observed everything that stands in the way of capitalistic culture is being crushed 55 the subjection of the land along with the indigenous population pointed to the socioecological catastrophe that was to ensue the dust bowl in the 1930s is known as the drought of record in the united states in many ways symbolizing ecological crisis in the twentieth century as environmental historian donald worster wrote in the 1970s in no other instance was there greater or more sustained damage to american land and there have been few times when so much tragedy was visited on its inhabitants not even the depression was more damaging economically and in ecological terms we have nothing in the nation s past that compares 56 almost everyone has heard of the dust bowl and can picture the billowing dust storms on the great plains and the mass migration of the okies millions of acres were affected and some counties in the heart of the region lost a third of their population while in oklahoma almost a third of the farmers were dislodged from their farms 57 the plight of the dust bowl region became emblematic of the enormous hardship associated with the great depression and rapacious capitalism the dust bowl era despite its vast impact remains in some contemporary accounts a localized unforeseeable and even purely natural disaster one that occurred at a particular time and that is unlikely to ever happen again as it was simply an event irrevocably of the past nothing however could be further from the truth the dust bowl was the social historical product of expanding capitalism empire and white settler colonialism all of which contributed to the destruction of land cover and soil erosion it arose out of the expropriation of indigenous lands the indigenous peoples themselves and the fertile soils every aspect of the dust bowl era was connected to imperial advance it was international in nature the result of a widespread rift in the metabolism between human beings and nature brought on by capitalist production and culminating in the age of monopoly capital today similar conditions are emerging on a more planetary level with the result that the dust bowl is becoming a prominent historical referent of the climate change era to get a concrete sense of the historical underpinnings of the dust bowl it is useful to turn to thorstein veblen whom c wright mills called the best critic of america that america has produced 58 for veblen writing in 1923 in absentee ownership and business enterprise in recent times the united states was built on the seizure of the fertile soil and its conversion to private gain there was no question whom it had been seized from since it was a product of the debauchery and manslaughter entailed on the indian population of the country aligned with this was the turning of people into assets to be held in usufruct through the practice of systematic slavery in all the american plan or policy veblen wrote was a settled practice of converting all public wealth to private gain on a plan of legalised seizure 59 a key element in this rapacious advance was the destruction of forests and land cover capitalizing on natural resources by treating them as a source of free income veblen argued encouraged waste and destruction on a vast scale constituting the normal practice of colonization and empire for instance the wasted timber associated with logging and land clearing practices was so great that this enterprise of lumber men during the period since the middle of the nineteenth century has destroyed very appreciably more timber than it has utilised 60 most important of all was the sclerosis of the soil brought on by processes of expropriation of the earth without the least attention to conservation 61 in this respect developments in the united states were similar to other white settler colonies where indigenous populations were displaced and a process of unlimited ecological destruction was unleashed resulting in the detachment of people from any form of ecological culture related to being settled inhabitants of a place veblen stressed that this problem stemmed from absentee ownership which was endemic to capitalism the dust bowl crisis in the 1930s was a product of the historical factors raised by veblen the seizure of the land the genocidal approach to native americans the effects of slavery the denudation of the land the sclerosis of the soil due to soil exhaustion and soil erosion and the devastating effects of all this on the working population were all evident in their 1930s book the rape of the earth a world survey of soil erosion graham vernon jacks and robert orr white wrote the history of erosion in the united states is bound up with the pioneer phase in the nation s development through the stages of deforestation for agricultural land timber fuel and potash in the east the development of the monoculture system of agriculture for maize in the corn belt and cotton to the south overstocking and ploughing of the natural grassland areas of the great plains gross overstocking and maltreatment of the range country overgrazing and over cultivation on the pacific coast and deforestation in the pacific north west 62 hence it is abundantly clear that dust storms on the plains were not freaks of nature but products of conditions that had long been developing as a result of the robbery and abuse of the land exacerbated by a shift from subsistence to commercial cash crop agriculture 63 the colonial history that shaped and propelled these developments also determined their differential effects across communities in the dust bowl region and elsewhere on top of previous losses including repeated dispossessions and forced relocation native american communities in the great plains dust bowl region lost some 90 percent of their remaining landholdings between 1890 and 1933 and had among the highest poverty rates in the country in the oklahoma region with its historic indian territory whites were doing everything they could to wrest the better part of the lands originally set aside for native americans as the new era of crisis descended appeals for relief went unanswered and then inadequately answered black and latinx farmers too were hit particularly hard by the dust bowl and depression and new deal programs were intentionally discriminatory with the result being that black and latinx farmers did not receive the same relief as white farmers and migrant farmworkers were often the targets of racist deportation laws and other forms of abuse 64 this led to further concentration of the land primarily in the hands of white inhabitants and wealthy absentee landlords oklahoma had been the epicenter of a powerful and in some parts multiracial and multiethnic progressive movement in the southeast and southwest the movement pushed for economic social and land reform some called for revolution significant multiracial alliances were sustained into the 1930s even in the face of organized and violent forces of reaction yet despite the movements significant accomplishments and all the relief measures associated with the new deal economic and environmental injustice prevailed given the racialized structure of power in the u s political economy 65 in all the efforts to engineer more stable relations between human beings and the environment on the great plains following the dust bowl were plagued by the persistent fundamental problem a voracious system of expropriation of the earth for profit rooted in the progressive seizure of natural resources and their conversion to private gain 66 its operations widened the rift between human beings and nature accumulating in a potential for larger catastrophes the social relations of expropriation that lay behind the economic and ecological contradictions of the period were extended rather than transcended in the decades that followed dust bowl like conditions or what is now sometimes called dustbowlification did not occur only in the united states in the 1930s but also in other colonial frontier regions in 1923 the south african drought commission reported that as a result of conditions created by the white civilization in south africa the power of the land as a whole to hold up and absorb water has been diminished herein lies the secret of our drought losses 67 a leading south african botanist and critic of the destruction of south africa s soil as well as a leading opponent of apartheid was the south african marxist ecologist edward roux author of both the veld and the future a book on soil erosion for south africans 1946 and time longer than rope a history of the black man s struggle for freedom in south africa 1948 in the veld and the future he wrote to save the soil we must all work together the black man and the white man the man and the woman the soil does not really belong to this person or that who has the right to use a bit of land it belongs to the nation that is the people as a whole especially he insisted the indigenous african population struggling for freedom and the children who are yet unborn 68 yet roux s ecosocialist vision dominated neither in south africa nor in the united states racial and class divisions as well as the metabolic rift continued to reinforce each other within capitalist relations of production these problems persist today as a consequence of agribusiness production and hence society is increasingly vulnerable in the face of climate change and land degradation this is especially evident in the original dust bowl region prompting questions regarding what was learned by the crisis in 2016 scientists from the university of chicago and the national aeronautics and space administration published a study in nature plants entitled simulating agriculture in a modern dust bowl drought investigating the potential for drought induced agricultural losses from global warming they concluded that the advent of conditions similar to those in the 1930s dust bowl would have unprecedented consequences despite the growth of ecological science joshua elliott a research scientist and coauthor of the article declared in an interview we expected to find the system much more resilient because 30 percent of production is now irrigated in the united states and because we ve abandoned corn production in more severely drought stricken places such as oklahoma and west texas but we found the opposite the system was just as sensitive to drought and heat as it was in the 1930s today both the scale of production and the field for the accumulation of catastrophe are much vaster intensifying the expropriation of land labor and corporeal life without any regard for reciprocity 69 moment iii imperialism in the anthropocene the dust bowl crisis of the 1930s was the culmination of a series of ecological crises associated with the era of early monopoly capitalism assuming particularly acute forms in white settler colonies and colonial frontier regions around the globe 70 today in the era of monopoly finance capital and late imperialism vast regions of the planet are being converted into dust bowls not through the action of the climate itself but as a result of the logic of a global economic system that promotes the conquest of nature as a means to the exploitation and superexploitation of the world s population the global commons are being destroyed everywhere as reflected in the burning of the amazon the bleaching of coral reefs the depletion of the oceans the mass extinction of species and the drying up and contamination of the world s freshwater sources the reality is thus one of a growing planetary ecological holocaust bearing down especially on the most vulnerable populations particularly frontline communities and in the global south nearly half a century ago in 1971 barry commoner warned that human beings have broken out of the circle of life driven not by biological need but by the social organization which they have devised to conquer nature means of gaining wealth that are governed by requirements that conflict with those which govern nature the end result is the environmental crisis a crisis of survival once more to survive we must close the circle we must learn to restore to nature the wealth that we borrow from it the world is being carried to the brink of ecological disaster not by a singular fault which some clever scheme can correct but by the phalanx of powerful economic political and social forces that constitute the march of history anyone who proposes to cure the environmental crisis undertakes thereby to change the course of history 71 the contemporary rift between humanity and the earth s metabolism to which commoner alluded is signified by the designation of the new geological epoch the anthropocene which represents a quantitative and qualitative break with all previous epochs 72 a scientific consensus is emerging that the anthropocene began around 1950 marked by the introduction of artificial radionuclides from thermonuclear bomb testing mass production of plastics and in particular the great acceleration of capitalist development the ferocious growth imperative of capital which recognizes no limits has led to the socioeconomic system transgressing an array of planetary boundaries associated with climate change ocean acidification ozone depletion loss of biodiversity freshwater depletion pollution the disruption of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and chemical pollution 73 the very operations of late capitalism and imperialism are today generating a global ecological crisis undermining the conditions that support life raising the issue of omnicide the destruction of life in general under the dominant economic order the earth is merely the source of free gifts of nature to capital justifying what amounts to a robbery economy 74 in this system of generalized commodity production quantity rules absolute as exchange value is deemed the universal measure 75 the essence of capitalism michael parenti explained is to convert nature into commodities and commodities into capital transforming the living earth into inanimate wealth this capital accumulation process wreaks havoc upon the global ecological system it treats the planet s life sustaining resources arable land groundwater wetlands forests fisheries oceans rivers air quality as dispensable ingredients of limitless supply to be consumed or toxified at will 76 the ongoing growth of this system is predicated on expanding and deepening the scope of expropriation of the environment labor and the corporeal life of all species these lethal contradictions are clearly evident throughout the earth system including the world ocean following the second world war industrial fishing fleets underwent a major transformation as part of the great acceleration of capitalist operations over time massive ships equipped with state of the art technologies such as sonar and gps systems for locating fish became the norm for industrial fishing operations trawlers and longlines are able to capture a record number of target fish those species that are desired for the market using lines that are miles long with hundreds of hooks as well as nets that are over a mile in circumference these ships harvest tons of fish in a single haul a third of which are unwanted species including marine mammals which are killed and discarded 77 on large ships which are really factories at sea the fish are processed onboard despite the effects of overfishing in all ocean systems in reducing fish populations global captures of marine fish by means of this new technology of expropriation increased from twenty million tons in 1950 to about ninety million tons in 2000 78 while there are currently 3 5 million fishing vessels only 1 percent of these ships account for 60 percent of seafood catch highlighting the significant role of monopoly capital in this sector 79 these operations are extremely efficient at capturing fish leading to widespread depletion of fish populations as they are harvested at rates faster than they can reproduce the scope of these actions has only worsened oceanic conditions because as one species is fished out firms simply move onto the next species in a process known as fishing down the marine food webs 80 combined with habitat destruction due to the earth system crisis as a whole fisheries scientists are predicting a collapse of all marine species currently being fished by the middle of the century 81 despite these natural limits imperial nations are engaged in aggressive ocean grabbing campaigns to expropriate as much as possible from the oceans through a variety of management arrangements and trade agreements the global north is progressively enclosing the oceans gaining access to fisheries around the world including those within the exclusive economic zones of nations in the south increasingly small scale fishers are being blocked from access to traditional fisheries undermining the subsistence of their families and communities 82 for many nations in the global south seafood is a major export to the north supplying food for people and pets as well as valued fertilizer to enrich depleted soils 83 for example thailand is the third largest global exporter of seafood commodities which amount to over 7 billion per year 84 in order to keep costs low especially given the additional expenses associated with ships such as the equipment and fuel required to chase depleted fish stocks many fishing operations in thailand use slave labor which is estimated to be between 145 000 to 200 000 people 85 these enslaved workers are forced to work long hours sleep very little receive minimal nourishment and are bound in chains and restraints to the ships like the chinese workers on the guano islands in the nineteenth century they are physically beaten if they are working too slowly or make mistakes handling the fish from time to time they are sold to other fishing operations many of these workers migrated from places such as the philippines cambodia laos and indonesia searching for employment but ended up being trafficked into slave labor 86 some of the fish being captured on these ships are being directed to shrimp aquaculture operations in order to supply needed feed for this thriving industry which is leading to widespread marine pollution and contamination these conditions are undermining small scale fishers creating a situation where the shrimp eat better than they do 87 the commodity fetishism associated with seafood obscures not only the expropriation of fish and the slave labor used to capture them but also the superexploitation in the processing plants in thailand these extensively taylorized plants increase profits through the employment of low wage children and women who head gut skin fillet peel clean and sort the fish international organizations have documented the poor working conditions the injuries and the lack of schooling that thousands of children are receiving while employed in this industry 88 the current earth system crisis extends from oceans to freshwater and beyond the dynamic of imperialism and omnicide in the anthropocene is associated with alterations in the earth s hydrological cycle including changes in precipitation the drying up and contamination of freshwater sources and the melting of mountain glaciers with their indispensable water towers 89 as climatologist james hansen indicates under a continuation of business as usual over the next several decades low latitudes during the warm seasons could become so hot and inhospitable to human livelihood as to generate an unstoppable drive for emigration that potential future is emerging into view for regions as populated as india bangladesh southeast asia and huge swaths of africa 90 under these conditions sea level rise dustbowlification and extreme weather in general will force hundreds of millions of people in low latitudes in the global south to migrate from their homes either in the form of internal migration within countries or mass emigration abroad in 2017 68 5 million people were forcibly displaced from their homes approximately one third of these due to extreme weather according to a world bank study internal migration alone in the three regions of latin america sub saharan africa and southeast asia accounting for a little more than half the population of the global south will rise to 143 million by 2050 91 meanwhile wealthy countries while frequently superexploiting populations in the global south via multinational corporations are already building walls enhancing the militarization of borders to keep refugees including climate refugees out we live in an era of capitalist globalization without end where the struggle for diminishing freshwater runs parallel to the search for new sources of fossil fuels which in turn heighten the carbon emissions behind climate change resulting in the rapid heating up of the earth and increasing drought in a kind of frenzy driven by a capitalist system that knows no restraint there is a desperate worldwide competition to control the last remaining sources of freshwater and fossil fuels along with other scarce resources 92 conclusion beyond the robbery system profit upon expropriation was the key economic category that marx used in his critique of smith s notion of previous stock accumulation 93 smith s theology of previous accumulation perelman writes suggested that capitalists commanding position was due to their past savings a view that marx debunked 94 so called previous accumulation was thus for marx simply an ideological device of classical political economy meant to disguise the reality of the expropriation of the immediate producers 95 from this perspective capitalism was only possible due to the alienation or expropriation of nature and the self alienation or expropriation of human powers and corporeal life expropriation was characteristic of all previous class civilizations but it took on a far more systematic character and assumed a vastly greater scale under capitalism where it became part of a dyad together with exploitation giving rise to the capitalist juggernaut as a whole the drive to endless exponential expansion and finally the movement toward socialism the negation of the negation in the new capitalist bourgeois society expropriation was not the essence of the system as in tributary modes of production instead it was to give rise to a whole new inner dynamic of exploitation that had its own self propelling logic manifested in the accumulation of capital exploitation in turn created the demand for ever wider circles of expropriation expanding the boundaries of the system the dialectic of exploitation and expropriation that constituted capitalism was thus all the more a vicious spiral associated with the logic of the accumulation of capital arising in the early modern era capitalism led to the most brutal systems of expropriation the world has ever seen slavery misogyny wife selling burning of witches the superexploitation of women and children land grabbing genocide and the destruction of the earth extending to the entire planet acutely aware of these contradictions marx wrote if money according to augier comes into the world with a congenital blood stain on one cheek capital comes dripping from head to toe from every pore with blood and dirt 96 it is customary in mainstream political circles as well for some further to the left to treat these horrors associated with the development of capitalism on a world scale as mere birth pains if they are acknowledged at all too often they are treated as phenomena of the distant past to be forgotten to be papered over by a triumphalist story of capital s inevitable rise or to be hidden away by the nursery tale of so called primitive accumulation whereby individual capitalists rose to riches by virtue of their own abstinence pulling themselves up by their bootstraps 97 yet the horrors of the expropriation of the direct producers including nonwaged workers and the earth are not simply an original sin but a constant reality of capitalism by which it establishes its earthly domination and polices the suffering on its borders 98 in twenty first century late capitalism and late imperialism this expropriation is in some ways going further than ever before with the deepening of imperialist value chains whereby much of the surplus value of the entire world is siphoned off via a process of value capture to feed the coffers of multinational corporations and the wealthy at the center of the system 99 this is accompanied by renewed battles over the misogynistic basis of private property involving the control of women s bodies the resurgence of racial capitalism and the destruction of the planet as a place of human habitation breaking the chain of human generations 100 many attempts to advance theory and practice on the left have sought to connect the marxian theory of exploitation to other intersecting oppressions that are integral parts of the reality of historical capitalism our analysis suggests that making these connections requires understanding both the significance of the concept of expropriation in classical historical materialism and the dialectic of expropriation and exploitation in saying that the patriarchal family was the basis of all class development and of private property institutions engels was not going against the critique of exploitation at the center of the theory of capitalism but recognizing that the entire development of oppression in history was rooted in the subjugation of women which gave rise via private property to what he called three basic forms of slavery of slaves serfs and wage slaves 101 this was a history of expropriation of land labor and corporeal life of which the capitalist system of exploitation was to be the most developed and most barbaric form the various historical moments of expropriation that we have described the industrialization of agriculture and the global metabolic rift the dust bowl era of the 1930s and the imperialism of the anthropocene are all particular historical moments reflecting the barbaric heart of the system 102 the justice of nature epicurus wrote in antiquity is a pledge of reciprocal usefulness neither to harm one another nor be harmed 103 capitalism in its pursuit of abstract value destroys such reciprocity and justice at every level going so far as to threaten the very basis of planetary existence in fact behind capitalist exploitation lies a wider set of inequities consisting of various forms of expropriation or robbery that establish the boundary conditions of the system it is here in multiple hidden abodes that we discover the secret not only of capitalist exploitation but also of racial capitalism misogynistic capitalism and the creative destruction of nature 104 all of this highlights the fact that it is impossible to understand the totality of capitalist relations apart from the conditions of both exploitation and expropriation which together generate the ensemble of oppressions that characterize the system it is here too that we begin to understand the various interlocking aspects of capitalist domination which require a corevolutionary praxis in response as henri lefebvre pointed out given the scope and scale of the planetary ecological crisis it is now a matter of revolution or death 105 epicurus s justice of nature requiring genuine reciprocity is nowhere to be found within the logic of the capitalist system despite its pretense to quid pro quo or equal exchange which merely disguises the extremes of exploitation and expropriation that lie within it and that define its historical boundaries in the twenty first century this dialectic of exploitation and expropriation without end striving to intensify the rate of exploitation while treating the boundaries of life as mere barriers or frontiers to be transgressed by capital has led to the creative destruction of the earth the basis of life itself for the chain of human generations there is only one possible response the expropriation of the expropriators and the corevolutionary creation of a new epoch of sustainable human development ecological socialism 106 notes
jared bernstein as a result of the democratic party primary we re having a robust debate about taxing wealth the debate invokes tricky technical and legal issues but it s an overdue one there are good reasons the united states needs to start taxing wealth you may think we already tax wealth but that s mostly not the case as my colleagues at the center on budget and policy priorities chuck marr samantha jacoby and kathleen bryant point out in an important new paper for the very wealthy taxes are essentially voluntary how can that be when the rest of us have taxes withheld from our paychecks every few weeks and then often pay more when we file our income taxes every april because wealth accumulation isn t taxed unless you decide to sell the asset and even then it s taxed at a favorable rate compared with regular income the new paper provides the following true life example from the vaults of warren buffett who to his credit has long supported higher taxes on the wealthy the value of buffett s main asset berkshire hathaway stock rose over 17 percent in 2010 from approximately 34 8 billion to 42 billion these figures imply income of roughly 7 2 billion yet in his tax returns for 2010 buffet s adjusted gross income was 62 8 million or less than 1 percent of that amount in other words asset appreciation by far the main source of income for the billionaire class isn t taxed at all unless it is realized through a sale because of this at least outside of bear markets billionaires tax bills will almost always be a mere few percent of their gains in wealth my colleagues point out that amazon founder and chief executive jeff bezos tax bill on a decade of stock sales likely was about 1 5 billion or less than 1 5 percent of his increase in wealth due to the appreciation of his amazon stock bezos owns the washington post that extreme concentration of wealth is slowing growth corrupting politics and blocking opportunity for the many on the wrong side of the inequality divide according to federal reserve data 32 of total net worth is held by the top 1 average net worth 27 million per household compared with 2 held by the bottom half average net worth 32 000 because the wealthy have low propensities to spend their extra income relative to the middle class such concentration hurts growth through diminished parental investment substandard and segregated housing and education channels wealth inequality reduces social mobility and because most high end wealth goes untaxed it is a big missing revenue source as i stressed in recent congressional testimony the treasury is collecting far less revenue than they should be given where we are in this long economic expansion the reason is that the 2017 tax cuts severely damaged the link between economic growth and tax revenue a high end wealth tax is one way to help repair that damage and fund some of our priorities as opposed to loading everything on the deficit so fairness opportunity and our fiscal gap all point toward the need for some version of a wealth tax but what about the critics who say that such taxes didn t work in europe and they won t work here as economist gabriel zucman and emanuel saez recently argued the reason european wealth taxes failed is that they were poorly designed thus we can learn from their mistakes because these taxes were based on residence not citizenship it was easy to relocate to avoid them plus banks didn t share information facilitating evasion finally european wealth taxes hit the moderately wealthy not just the superwealthy which undermined their support in the u s case however we tax based on citizenship so unless you re willing to stop being an american thereby incurring a hefty exit tax under the proposed wealth taxes you don t escape under the obama era foreign account tax compliance act both foreign banks and u s taxpayers holding financial assets abroad must report these assets to the irs no question fatca needs increased attention and staffing but it has the potential to plug an important hole finally while most tax experts usually advocate for a broad base with few exemptions one attribute of taxing extreme wealth is that it has solid public support and not just from democrats of course billionaires hate it but its advocates view that as confirmation of its utility in other words we can and should tax wealth but as the european case reveals design is crucial there are two broad options build on what we have or try something new my colleagues new paper goes through a lot of holes in the tax code through which significant wealth escapes taxation among the most egregious loopholes is one that allows wealthy people to pass along an asset to an heir who is not required to pay any tax on that asset s appreciated value that is the wealthy person herself never paid tax on the asset s increased value and unless she sells it the heir doesn t incur a liability either even when the wealthy do sell assets they re taxed at a favorable rate 23 8 vs the top income tax rate of 37 that s another loophole that should be closed the estate tax also needs a lot more bite the 2017 tax cuts raised its exemption levels to ridiculous heights between 11 million and 22 million of wealthy estates go untaxed and those numbers are indexed to inflation my colleagues point out that fewer than 1 in 1 000 estates are expected to owe any estate tax candidates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders go much further proposing new forms of taxation on the wealth of the wealthiest americans and based on the rationales above their plans also deserve a hearing many objections have been raised some of which have merit by some estimates warren s recent additions to her tax plans lead to tax rates on wealth that top 100 percent my heart doesn t bleed for billionaires but that s hard to defend another new idea that s recently surfaced is to levy an annual tax on the value of appreciated assets of the very wealthy regardless of whether the asset has been sold or held it s a smart idea worth pursuing as it would end the voluntary nature of the system some of these may have sturdier legislative legs than others of course but i ll just celebrate that we re finally talking about injecting a huge long overdue dose of fairness into the tax code jared bernstein chief economist to former vice president joe biden is a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities he wrote this for the washington post

by andrew moran the debt crisis unfolding in the second largest economy s public and private sectors is being televised all over the world one area being closely monitored by global financial markets is corporate debt the tropical storm of corporate defaults and insolvencies will soon metastasize into a tsunami that could trigger a significant economic event that will impact not only beijing but also the entire global market to understand the ocean of red ink submerging china you must first look to the sky skydiving in china for nearly two years the people s bank of china pboc and the federal government have been accommodative to market needs the leadership has expanded the money supply cut interest rates altered banking and credit requirements and bailed out struggling state owned enterprises soes this has all been done for the sake of staving off the inevitable decay of the debt fueled ponzi scheme economy in another sign that lenders are tightening credit despite pushes by the communist authorities work on one of the nation s largest skyscrapers was suspended because the developer defaulted on a payment you can add this project to the long list of unfinished skyscrapers

real image of the paper tiger economy residing in an attic somewhere is a truly frightening canvas so far this year a dozen or so skyscrapers taller than 900 feet either have been postponed or have fallen behind schedule due to credit conditions yan yuejin an analyst at shanghai based e house china research and development institution told the business newspaper unfinished super tall skyscrapers which cost a huge amount of funds to build are a typical sign of economic recession they are financed by credit and will run into trouble when lenders begin to scale back will beijing fall to the skyscraper curse the skyscraper curse in 1999 economist andrew lawrence developed the skyscraper index a concept that draws a correlation between economic busts and the construction of the world s tallest buildings it suggests that investment in skyscrapers peak when growth has been exhausted and the economy is on the brink of a downturn in 2007 the skyscraper theory became a reliable tool for students of the austrian school of economics and for anticipating major economic crises economist mark thornton devised the skyscraper index model which borrows from irish french economist richard cantillon s 18th century teachings and examines several effects of the so called skyscraper curse the first is that a cut in interest rates boosts land prices and increases the size of companies to raise demand for office space the second is that artificially low rates offer investment to construction technologies that push developers to break height records thornton posits that these factors peak at the tail end of the expansion period ultimately thornton contends that man made distortions to rates below the natural rate put the economy s structure of production in an unsustainable manner so if developers want to erect record setting skyscrapers they will require a laundry list of new technologies processes and systems that need their own production distribution installation and maintenance all of this will further misdirect businesses consumers and investors in the end the parties involved in every stage become more leveraged and prone to defaults when the business cycle transitions from boom to bust the demand for skyscrapers diminishes this makes it difficult for the firms integral to the building of skyscrapers to survive they are now under threat as profit margins tighten we saw this fascinating pattern happen in the united states during the panic of 1907 the great depression the dot com bubble and the housing bubble this occurred in the united arab emirates several years ago and now it is unfolding in china it is a global and cyclical phenomenon excuse me while i kiss the sky some of the most iconic cities in the world have a skyline full of skyscrapers from new york city to beijing and dubai it seems counterintuitive to suggest that erecting these massive buildings could be a sign of an upcoming slowdown but when you scratch beneath the asphalt surface you notice patterns low rates more development a recession the next time a property developer lays the groundwork for a record setting building prepare your bank account and budget for the downturn this was originally published on liberty nation like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here

while we watch the homelessness crisis unfold in states like california and new york connecticut could be the first state to achieve a goal once thought insurmountable making homelessness rare brief and one time in 2005 an estimated 30 000 plus of our neighbors were experiencing homelessness today that number is just over 3 000 while homelessness is still a major problem for connecticut s poorest residents it s important to realize just how close we are to making sure everyone in our state has a home recent cuts to state bond funding for affordable housing development however have put this progress in jeopardy and risk leaving thousands more people out on the streets we need our state leaders to step back up and invest in an affordable sustainable solution to homelessness connecticut has decreased its overall homelessness numbers by 90 percent in the past 15 years and we ve done it through innovative solutions and robust state investment most importantly the state has invested nearly 1 5 billion in affordable housing over the past decade these investments have resulted in more than 22 000 new and rehabilitated affordable homes for our most vulnerable citizens and lower income workers struggling to make ends meet with those available housing units and subsidies we have been able to prevent more and more people from ever becoming homeless and kept people out of emergency rooms and prisons we re also able to move families out of shelters and into permanent housing more quickly that investment in affordable housing is under threat with gov ned lamont s last proposed budget proposing zero dollars in affordable housing bonding and no bond deal with the legislature in sight we re starting to lose what we ve gained without continuing to invest in preserving the affordable housing we ve built it is estimated that 5 400 units could reach the end of their affordability restrictions and be lost in the next five years many of those families may end up experiencing homelessness furthermore without preservation and development of new homes folks exiting the homeless service system will have nowhere to go resulting in overcrowded shelters and more people living on the street why can t this significant investment be funded using private dollars or leveraging the private housing market unfortunately private developers will rarely build below market rate housing on their own as they cannot finance the development while below market rate units are set at lower rents they still require the same overhead property management insurance and utility costs as a consequence they frequently operate at a net loss and are almost always impossible for the private market to underwrite without state dollars to subsidize that rental gap connecticut would have thousands of fewer housing units and thousands more families experiencing homelessness or housing instability not only is housing affordability crucial for ending homelessness it s also good for economic growth for every dollar we invest in affordable housing the return is 4 of private investment to connecticut these are tax dollars jobs and most importantly critical housing resources that we can t afford to lose if our state is going to grow bond funding for affordable housing is an important part of running a modern 21st century state in 2018 new york gov andrew cuomo launched a 20 billion five year plan to combat homelessness and build affordable housing in the same year massachusetts gov charlie baker authorized 1 8 billion in capital spending for preservation and construction of new affordable housing by zeroing out new investment connecticut risks falling behind our neighbors in housing affordability the state legislature realizes the need for more affordable options in connecticut in the 2019 legislative session the finance revenue and bonding committee spurned the governor s debt diet by including 255 million in new bond authorizations for affordable housing over the biennium the governor should follow the legislature s lead and continue this important investment for thousands of connecticut residents who are still without a home their livelihood depends on it kiley gosselin is the executive director of the partnership for strong communities a statewide nonprofit dedicated to ending homelessness and expanding housing opportunity in connecticut

mark jay is a phd candidate in the department of sociology at the university of california santa barbara he is the author with philip conklin of the forthcoming book a people s history of detroit duke university press 2020 he would like to thank andrew johnson david feldman and cedric johnson whose insights were vital to this article he drops the whip half from exhaustion half from disgust whereupon the beaten man has to pick it up and hand it to him franz kafka the conscription of troops from the mid 1960s to the late 2000s the number of people locked in u s prisons and jails and forced onto parole or probation increased from less than eight hundred thousand to more than seven million from the beginning this explosive growth known commonly as mass incarceration has been about containing stigmatizing and exploiting the poorest sectors of the working class 1 to this day the criminal justice system continues to target the most impoverished among us consider a recent report from the people s policy project on the composition of today s carceral population the report s author nathaniel lewis divides the u s population into five class quintiles based on people s household income during adolescence their current household income their education their current assets and whether they own a home or not lewis also breaks down the probability of ever being jailed the probability of being jailed after arrest the probability of being jailed more than a month and the probability of being jailed more than a year he concludes that for all four incarceration outcomes being lower class rather than middle or upper class makes a massive difference being black rather than white makes a modest difference that is statistically insignificant for all outcomes except one the probability of being in jail or prison for more than a year and even in that case whites in the lowest class group are more likely to be incarcerated than blacks in the second to lowest class group 2 understanding which groups have been the primary targets of mass incarceration is the first step in understanding what is at stake in the contemporary efforts to reform the criminal justice system indeed in the past decade mass incarceration has rightfully come under increasing attack politicians and organizations from prison abolitionists to the koch brothers have decried the system s various flaws its racial injustice inhumanity and costliness among others after the great recession of 2007 09 thirty three states implemented policies to reduce their prison populations as a result prison and jail admissions have decreased around 25 percent from their peak at the end of the opening decade of this century 3 although many political commentators have characterized this decline as a significant step there is reason for skepticism for one at this rate of decline it would take another eight decades or so for the prison population to return to where it was when ronald reagan became president 4 the focus on releasing nonviolent drug offenders is a major limiting factor in 2015 president barack obama claimed that over the past few decades we ve locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before for longer than ever before and this is the real reason our prison population is so high this claim which demonstrates that a watered down version of michelle alexander s new jim crow thesis has taken hold in some elite policy circles is misleading soon after obama made his claim fivethirtyeight calculated that even if every prison inmate whose most serious charge is a drug crime were released the prison population would only decline by 14 percent and the united states would still be the world s largest warden 5 this article focuses on another reason to be suspicious of contemporary prison reform private forces have attempted to co opt the reform movement and have implemented and profited from the forms of mass coercion proliferating throughout society mass coercion reflects the expanding institutional pressures that present poor and working class people with the following choice either allow yourself to be exploited by capital submit to degrading and low paying jobs pay onerous user fees present yourself for observation at an endless array of institutional checkpoints or face the alternative getting locked in a cage in short prison remains the ultimate so called stick for those who refuse to submit but mass coercion signifies all the ways that people are controlled and exploited by the criminal justice system outside the penitentiary what we are seeing with today s prison reform is not necessarily progress but rather the emergence of an insidious new form of social control one with support across the political spectrum in their classic punishment and social structure georg rusche and otto kirchheimer showed that when the modern prison first emerged decades ago it was initially supported by a diverse range of political actors as a morally and economically superior reform of the system of corporal punishment something similar is happening today an incredibly wide range of social forces including black lives matter activists families of former prisoners civil liberties advocates abolitionists libertarians social democrats corporate elites and others have endorsed carceral reform some of their reasons are admirable like ensuring that a loved one or comrade does not languish in a cage some of them are sinister like profiting from the invasive process of electronic monitoring though it is still nascent today s reform movement and the effects it is having on impoverished workers across the country need to be analyzed more closely 6 community cages as bernard harcourt has written contemporary rates of incarceration match rates of institutionalization for so called mentally ill people in the 1930s through the 50s in the 1960s and 70s largely as a result of shifts in federal funding and the political pressure waged by the antiasylum movement mental hospitals were emptied and patients were shifted to community centers when reagan took office he slashed funds to these centers rendering many former patients homeless by 1996 as police departments around the country implemented broken windows tactics zero tolerance policies in response to minor offenses formerly institutionalized people accounted for as many as 14 percent of new arrestees at present half of all people killed by police and 40 percent of all incarcerated people have been diagnosed with a mental illness or cognitive disability there is a significant risk harcourt concludes that any decarceration will simply produce new populations for other institutions whether homeless shelters inpatient treatment facilities or other locked down facilities this is certainly what happened last time 7 a recent report from the american friends service committee shows that this risk is starting to become a reality there are four pillars of the community corrections alternatives that local governments are increasingly turning to in lieu of imprisonment what the american friends service committee calls community cages day reporting centers intermediate sanctions facilities residential reentry centers halfway houses and electronic monitoring 8 in recent years private prison companies which hold 18 percent of federal inmates and 75 percent of immigrant detainees and thus have a huge stake in penal reform have responded to mounting moral outrage against private imprisonment by investing heavily in all these alternatives this is especially true of two companies geo group inc and corecivic inc these megacorporations manage more than half of the private prison contracts in the united states and in 2017 had a combined revenue of 4 billion and a combined debt of 3 4 billion mostly held by wall street banks giving them the capital to outcompete smaller service providers for government contracts 9 throughout the past decade these companies have made significant inroads in the market of alternatives to incarceration consider some of geo group s recent investments in 2009 they purchased just care a medical and mental health service provider in 2010 they announced a 685 million merger with cornell companies a provider of corrections treatment and educational services in 2011 they acquired behavioral interventions the world s largest producer of monitoring equipment for people awaiting trial or serving out probation or parole sentences and in 2017 they announced the 360 million acquisition of community education centers a rehabilitation services provider 10 as one geo executive claimed in a recent earnings call we believe that the emphasis on offender rehabilitation and community reentry programs as part of criminal justice reform will create growth opportunities for our company 11 the geo group has been particularly successful in co opting the push for carceral reform consider the example of immigrant detention in recent years activist groups have drawn attention to the brutality of immigrant detention and pushed for reform in 2011 forty one organizations including the american civil liberties union american friends service committee and national immigrant justice center signed a letter claiming that there are other means with proven track record of being much less costly yet highly effective to accomplish goals of immigrant detention 12 that same year the geo group acquired bi inc for 415 million bi is one of the largest electronic monitoring contractors in the united states and at the time of this acquisition the only provider of monitoring and supervision services for immigration and customs enforcement as part of the department of homeland security s alternative to detention program 13 amid mounting calls for reform alternative to detention funding increased from 3 million in 2002 to 112 million in 2013 14 as part of its own attempt to co opt the reform movement corrections corporation of america recently renamed itself corecivic the executive director of civic an organization committed to ending immigrant detention responded it is shocking that cca would steal our name in what can only be construed as an effort to create undue confusion for immigrants in detention and exploit the goodwill associated with our name 15 aside from changing its name corecivic has diversified its investments in a similar manner as the geo group to name just a few examples in 2013 corecivic acquired correctional alternatives which provides housing and rehabilitation services in 2015 they purchased avalon correctional services a community corrections company in 2017 they acquired the residential reentry service provider time to change inc and in recent years the company has been buying up halfway houses across the united states 16 geo group and corecivic also have strong lobbies spending millions to influence recent electoral campaigns 17 in 2017 the federal bureau of prisons defunded sixteen halfway houses across the united states unconvinced by the explanation provided by donald trump s administration that these facilities were supposedly underutilized prison legal news suggested that some critics believe the is realigning its residential reentry center portfolio to make room for halfway houses operated by private prison firms that made substantial donations to president trump s election campaign or inauguration fund 18 strange bedfellows in the dominant national discourse the critique of mass incarceration usually centers on moral outrage about the brutality and racist nature of the penal system and on the costly nature of imprisonment campaigns like the california endowment s dothemath campaign which suggests that it is cheaper to fund rehabilitation and counseling programs rather than prisons are becoming increasingly common 19 the new york times article why mass incarceration doesn t pay takes a similar approach claiming that a cost benefit analysis of mass incarceration reveals that rehabilitation programs would be more cost effective 20 the economist argues that for a fraction of the cost of locking up they could be fitted with gps enabled ankle bracelets that monitor where they are and whether they are taking drugs 21 for their part forbes has written that community based alternatives cost as little as 7 percent of imprisonment and that most inmates could be released early and watched round the clock with webcams drug and alcohol testing and electronic ankle bracelets via gps 22 as dan berger and kay whitlock have noted both bernie sanders and elizabeth warren depict the criminal justice system as a racist drain on public resources and propose to help undo the deleterious effects of mass incarceration by procedural policing tweaks new evidence based strategies the expansion of surveillance and control via multiple forms of e carceration fines and fees and a host of reforms such reforms expand the system rather than permanently shrink it 23 as carl takei has pointed out conservatives have increasingly become strange bedfellows of supposedly progressive reform advocates such as the national association for the advancement of colored people and the american civil liberties union which in recent years have shifted their criminal justice messaging to focus on cost savings efficiency and other ideas that appeal to conservatives 24 a danger in framing carceral reform this way is that it could open the door for private service providers to swoop in and offer cheaper solutions this is nothing new with an eye toward cutting costs and increasing opportunities for corporate profit political elites have privatized one public service after another in recent decades this is precisely what right on crime is after right on crime is a campaign of the conservative think tank the texas public policy foundation and it has the support of other think tanks like the heritage foundation and cato institute the campaign led by conservatives like the koch brothers newt gingrich and grover norquist is set up in part to help private companies dominate the prison alternatives market to be sure right wing support for carceral reform can be seen in part as a ploy to display their moral accolades hence charles koch s ludicrous claim that his support for criminal justice reform should be compared to the civil rights movement 25 but by following the money it becomes clear that conservative think tanks are paving the way for politicians to funnel public money into the hands of private prison corporations for example all of right on crime s recommendations for reform suggest services provided by private companies like geo group and corecivic many right on crime politicians have rejected federal medicaid funding for their jurisdiction forfeiting billions in federal funds that could support alternatives to prison by funding public housing substance abuse programs and mental health centers but right on crimers do support private alternatives one right on crime statement reads for those instances when prisons are necessary explore private prison options private prisons offer cost savings of 10 to 15 percent compared to state operated facilities by including an incentive in private corrections contracts for lowering recidivism and the flexibility to innovate private facilities could potentially not just save money but also compete to develop the most cost effective recidivism reduction programming 26 a basis for systemic profitability corporations profit from the shift to mass coercion in three main ways first private contractors who receive government contracts cut operation costs to the bone and claim the rest of the taxpayers money as profit private prison companies have slashed funds for inmate care reduced food costs and subjected prisoners to unhealthy and often disgusting meals relied on overcrowded unsafe and unsanitary facilities combated unions slashed wages and benefits and so on these companies have been on the receiving end of dozens of lawsuits for the cruel inhuman and degrading conditions to which they subject inmates 27 dire conditions in private prisons have also sparked a number of prison uprisings such as the 2016 rebellion that broke out in a mississippi facility run by corecivic which inmates described as primarily the result of conditions they felt had become increasingly dangerous and intolerable including medical neglect excessive use of segregation spoiled food a lack of interpreters and mistreatment of staff 28 as private companies have brought this callous business model with them into the business of rehabilitation there have been vociferous complaints about conditions and treatment in their facilities one corecivic subsidiary for instance was sued six hundred times in a five year period for the neglect and poor treatment of mentally ill people 29 none of this is to romanticize state run prisons or public programs for rehabilitation which are generally underfunded and harrowing in their own right rather it is to highlight the disastrous effects of giving for profit companies with a strong track record of human rights abuses the ability to profit not only from people s imprisonment but also from their rehabilitation and supervised release the second way that corporations profit from mass coercion is by charging user fees paying these fees is generally a condition of staying out of prison leading many to decry a return of modern day debtors prisons consider electronic monitoring a form of punitive control that has increased 70 percent in the past two decades and become a 6 billion industry electronic monitoring is widely marketed as an inexpensive alternative to incarceration but less noted is that it is not inexpensive for the people often charged for their own shackles these fees are often cripplingly high for example one private for profit gps monitoring company reportedly charges supervisees 300 per month plus a 179 50 setup fee for their court ordered gps monitoring supervisees who fail to pay the fees are sent back to jail this is all part of the user funded criminal justice system by 2014 forty three states allowed defendants to be charged for a public defender forty one states let inmates be charged room and board and forty four states permit people to be billed for their probation and parole supervision 30 robin d g kelley has coined the term revenue by primitive accumulation to describe the myriad ways in which cash strapped governments make up for budgetary shortfalls by using the criminal justice system to shift costs onto the poor to give just one example kelley notes that in the year prior to the 2014 uprisings in ferguson missouri ferguson s municipal court issued 33 000 arrest warrants to a population just over 21 000 generating about 2 6 million dollars in income for the municipality 31 nine thousand warrants stemmed from minor violations such as housing code violations and parking and traffic tickets 32 the policies in ferguson are common across poor communities in the united states people are charged fees for minor violations and when they cannot pay they are put on payment plans often with interest 12 percent on felonies in washington state and when they fall behind on payments they often go back to jail 33 the third way that capitalists profit is more indirect but still vitally important mass coercion compels poor people to accept low wage degrading and flexible jobs karl marx suggested that absent a united proletarian resistance the silent compulsion of economic relations would tend to force people to work on capital s terms and indeed in the contemporary united states where 46 percent of americans do not have enough money to cover a 400 emergency expense sheer poverty certainly does a lot to compel people to work jobs they do not want 34 but the criminal justice system has worked as a significant additional form of extraeconomic force as nikhil pal singh and joshua clover note throughout the era of mass incarceration racist state violence has been a material method through which wages for all workers can be driven down it is thus a basis for systematic profitability if state violence expressed most obviously by the police goes to great lengths to ensure that black lives matter less one necessary outcome is that black people can be and are paid less which means that other people can be pushed to take lower pay in turn with a ready made hierarchy of disposability in place for further disciplining labor 35 but this logic is not only contained to racist policing it has also been reproduced throughout society due to increasing work requirements associated with prison alternatives and government services more broadly as the economy has shifted toward what david harvey has termed flexible accumulation more flexible forms of control have emerged to discipline workers accordingly 36 nowhere is this clearer than in the day labor industry which has spread like wildfire in recent decades and has become a ubiquitous presence in poor predominantly urban communities across the country as gretchen purser has noted in her incisive ethnographic work day labor companies heavily recruit formerly incarcerated workers and give them one day labor contracts jobs without a tomorrow often these companies partner directly with parole officers as well as so called reentry and social service organizations just as the day labor agency offers parole officers a centralized site wherein they can if necessary monitor and manage their charges so too does it offer parolees an opportunity to acquire the documentation of gainful employment that is stipulated as a condition of parole and that thereby functions as a form of extra economic coercion in the workplace purser concludes that the seventy million or so u s workers who have some kind of criminal record are not merely excluded from the economy but rather relegated to its bottom most segments in what has recently been referred to as the gloves off economy where jobs are precarious working conditions are perilous violations of labor laws are pervasive and wages are paltry 37 the use of coercive mechanisms that track offenders movements and compel them to take whatever jobs are on offer must be seen in the context of a broader conservative driven initiative to expand the notion of workfare to all corners of society bill clinton implemented workfare on a national scale with the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act in 1996 which not only slashed welfare dramatically but also stipulated that in order for people to become eligible for their reduced cash assistance they had to be able to prove they were actively seeking a job at the time marian kramer of the national welfare rights union and formerly of the league of revolutionary black workers argued that mandatory work legislation has in effect restored slavery in this country regardless of race 38 trump recently lauded clinton s welfare bill and implemented plans to expand work requirements for a broader array of social programs including food stamps housing and medicaid as tracie mcmillan has reported the combined budgets of the public programs currently targeted for work requirements food assistance health care and housing total 704 billion 39 in this era of austerity these policies are generally supported by governments eager to save costs by removing poor people who become rendered ineligible due to new requirements but they also have the same tripartite effect identified above they force poor people into low wage positions undermining working people s capacity to struggle for better paying and more humanizing jobs and they allow private companies to make massive profits by cutting operational costs and charging user fees the private company maximus for instance made 2 5 billion in revenue in 2017 working in forty one states to churn people through the system deeming who is and who is not eligible for social benefits like health care 40 when the prison is everywhere in his classic 1975 work discipline and punish michel foucault claimed that mechanisms for social control were becoming more diffuse with the result that the widespread badly integrated confinement of the classical age was coming to an end and the specificity of the role of the prison and its role as link are losing something of their purpose 41 writing as he was at the beginning of the largest prison boom in world history foucault clearly missed the mark in many key respects but it is becoming more and more apparent that he was nonetheless onto something significant in 1992 gilles deleuze updated foucault s work in a short essay titled postscript on the societies of control which heralded the progressive and dispersed installation of a new system of domination one pervaded by ultrarapid forms of flee floating control 42 foucault and deleuze generally theorized power as a tautology systems of power aimed at reproducing and enhancing their own power but what we are seeing is not merely the diffusion of social control for its own sake by taking foucault and deleuze s insights and putting them into a marxist framework it becomes clear that elites are using mechanisms of mass coercion to control and exploit working people on the one hand the growing number of workers who have been rendered superfluous due to automation monopolization and globalization must be contained and kept away from areas where wealthier people live and do commerce so as cedric johnson has written aggressive policing and other forms of control have become central to urban real estate development and the tourism entertainment sector growth both of which serve as central economic drivers in the contemporary landscape 43 on the other hand capital accumulation is increasingly dependent on the value extracted from the process of control itself as william robinson has argued there is an increasing convergence around global capitalism s need for social control and repression and its economic need to perpetuate accumulation in the face of overaccumulation and stagnation 44 the system of mass coercion must be situated within this nexus consider the first step act signed into law by trump in 2018 this bill backed by an array of liberal and conservative groups including the geo group corecivic and right on crime was immediately praised in the corporate media due to the fact that it offered minor reductions in sentences for some federal prisoners though undocumented immigrants and so called high level offenders are excluded generally ignored outside of leftist circles is that the act authorized a 375 million expansion of post prison services for inmates transitioning back into society 45 moreover as james kilgore has noted this and other recent reform bills precipitate a much wider use of e carceration the deprivation of liberty by means of technologies such as ankle monitors 46 around two hundred thousand people are shackled with and asked to pay for these invasive devices and that number is growing each year the moratorium on deportations campaign has warned that increased reliance on gps monitoring does not signal progress rather it heralds the widening of the carceral dragnet ice only targets for atd those immigrants whose detention is not required by statute who present a low risk of flight and who pose no danger to the community thus those pushed into atd would not have otherwise been detained 47 indeed according to immigration and customs enforcement reports more than half of all immigrants under supervision have not been convicted of a crime 48 with this in mind the moratorium on deportations campaign notes that gps monitoring is linked to a much broader process of expanding informationalizing and generalizing the prison when the prison is everywhere it is also invisible as the new form of social reality 49 echoing this point kilgore writes that electronic monitors form the point of convergence between mass incarceration and the surveillance state the tracking data from gps monitors blends in with all the other databases that profile and punish the criminalized sectors of the population devices in the near future could record far more data and information than i could ever have dreamed of nine years ago when they first put the shackle around my ankle even now some devices can give you a robocall if you move out of your permitted zones of travel can send you a reminder of your appointment with your parole officer or keep track of all your digital communications and your online friends from facebook and other platforms the ankle bands are slowly disappearing to be replaced by a techno hybrid of the smartphone and the fitbit the result will likely be a powerful piece of personalized spyware that could one day morph into a chip implant 50 in china multibillion dollar surveillance companies have already begun collaborating with chinese police departments to implement facial recognition technology to detect criminals and dissidents in real time as they move through public spaces 51 detroit has implemented its own secret facial recognition program project green light which enables police to identify and track residents captured on hundreds of private and public high definition cameras installed at parks schools immigration centers gas stations churches abortion clinics hotels apartments fast food restaurants and addiction treatment centers police can identify people at any time using databases containing hundreds of thousands of photos including mug shots driver s licenses and images scraped from social media at a public meeting on july 11 2019 after this project green light finally came to light detroit s publicly elected police commissioner willie burton criticized the clandestine project and called for a public ballot initiative to vote on the surveillance system as a result burton was arrested on the spot 52 this is one ominous sign of the direction we may be heading but before we lose ourselves in orwellian fantasies it is worth stressing that at present there is a more straightforward practical logic at work governments are interested in mass coercion for the potential savings they offer politicians are interested because they help cut costs and lessen political pressure from prison rights groups capitalists are interested in social control initiatives that eliminate obstacles to wealth accumulation and correctional companies are interested purely in profit and as sociologist david feldman puts it in using people as raw materials in the production process 53 this helps us understand why rather than foucault s nightmare of a silently functioning panopticon what we are actually seeing is an underfunded and malfunctioning corporate disaster for the criminalized population the reality is much more mundane than a philip k dick novel people are forced into dirty overcrowded halfway houses where underpaid and overworked employees are woefully inept at facilitating people s entry back into society they wait around in day reporting centers or sit around in the lobbies of day labor companies hoping for a few hours of work or they struggle with the defunct electronic monitoring equipment that companies cheaply produce in order to increase profits according to one 2007 study from arizona 70 percent of alerts that electronic collars sent to supervisors notifying them that the offender was violating parole were false alerts 54 another report from tennessee found that more than 80 percent of these alerts were simply due to technological failures such as battery issues gps failure and ghost signals 55 accumulate accumulate this is moses and the prophets with multibillionaire trump sitting in the oval office marx s dictum applies more than ever to the workings of the criminal justice system profit is king but it is also worth remembering that mass incarceration began in part to crush radical working class groups in the 1960s and 70s this is the domestic origin of things like stop and frisk swat raids and supermax prisons and as activists organize to combat emerging forms of capitalist control we would be foolish not to expect elites to use all weapons at their disposal against us 56 notes

china s economic growth could drop below 6 next year for the first time since 1990 as the world s second largest economy continues to be affected by the trade war with the u s and cooling infrastructure investment ubs wealth management forecasts real gross domestic product gdp is set to increase by just 5 7 in 2020 according to hu yifan regional chief investment officer and chief china economist at ubs wealth management a unit of switzerland based banking group ubs ag that compares with an estimated 6 1 in 2019 and would mark the third straight annual slowdown china s gdp growth slipped to 6 6 in 2018 from 6 8 the previous year and was 6 2 year on year in the first nine months of 2019 the national bureau of statistics said in october hu isn t the only analyst forecasting sub 6 gdp growth in 2020 nomura holdings inc goldman sachs group inc and moody s investors service estimate expansion of 5 8 morgan stanley is a little more optimistic with a base case scenario of 6 although its economists say growth could slip to 5 9 if the trade war worsens and the property market slumps and could fall as low as 5 3 in a worst case scenario where trade talks with the u s break down and more tariffs are imposed by washington on chinese goods economic growth is being dragged down partly by slowing domestic demand fueled by a slump in investment and partly by the trade dispute with the u s which has led to a significant decline in exports to what was previously china s biggest overseas market beijing and washington announced in october that they were working toward phase one of an agreement to end their row although it has yet to be concluded sluggish housing market hu said the two sides are moving closer to a phase one deal but they are not likely to strike more ambitious phase two or phase three deals next year given their disagreements at recent talks that has dimmed the outlook for trade next year and hu said she is forecasting zero growth in imports and exports next year or even an outright decline however if phase two and phase three of a trade deal are struck in 2020 growth for the year could be as high as 6 she said u s president donald trump said on tuesday that the two sides were in the final throes of negotiations to complete the first phase which would see china increase purchases of american agricultural goods and commit to protecting u s intellectual property however hu said that market concerns are growing over whether the partial deal can be reached before dec 15 when the u s is set to implement previously announced tariffs of 15 on 160 billion worth of imports from china in addition to international factors on the domestic front cooling investment in the sluggish housing market is putting downward pressure on economic growth hu said she forecast a continued slow decline in real estate investment in 2020 as the government maintains controls over the property market to prevent speculation and restricts property developers ability to raise capital infrastructure investment has been a key plank in the government s counter cyclical adjustment policies to support economic growth the state council china s cabinet has urged local governments to speed up the issuance of special purpose bonds which are used to raise money specifically for public works including infrastructure projects the ministry of finance also announced this week the early allocation of 1 trillion yuan 142 billion of such bonds from next year s quota but the measure has not had a significant impact on infrastructure investment which rose just 4 2 in the first 10 months of 2019 hu told caixin that growth in infrastructure investment in 2020 may still be slightly lower than her estimated 2019 growth rate of 5 and if can match that pace that would already be very good china s central bank is also likely to further loosen monetary policy and lower banks reserve requirement ratios between 100 basis points to 200 basis points by the end of next year to support growth she said but even this may not be as effective as it has been in previous economic cycles as businesses especially small and medium sized enterprises have less need to borrow and raise capital due to concerns over sinking profits from weakening demand he said source caixin
washington cmc an international monetary fund imf working paper has confirmed that caribbean countries are highly exposed to external factors using data from 1980 2017 the paper the caribbean and its linkages with the world a gvar model approach says that a fall in oil prices and an increase in the us gross domestic product gdp as examples have a positive and large impact on most caribbean countries after controlling for financial variables exchange rate fluctuations and overall price changes the paper uses a global vector auto regressive gvar model tailored for the caribbean region which includes its major trading partners representing altogether around 60 per cent of the global economy we provide stylised facts of the main interrelations between the caribbean region and the rest of the world and then we quantify the impact of external shocks on caribbean countries through the application of two case studies a change in the international price of oil and an increase in the us gdp say the authors mauricio vargas and daniela hess the results from the model help to disentangle effects from various channels that interact at the same time such as flows of tourists trade of goods and changes in economic conditions in the largest economies of the globe they add headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters the report says that global spillovers are a central element in international economics and that caribbean countries are as acutely exposed to them as many others it says that production and trade in goods and services and financial flows depend not only on internal market supply and demand forces but also on competitiveness and world growth during the past decades the paper notes that many small and large countries have leaned towards trade openness and financial liberalisation stating that some evidence suggests that this might benefit their economies notwithstanding the paper says a strong degree of integration poses additional risks to small open economies that may suffer disproportionately from shifting economic conditions in the largest economies of the globe as they are less able to diversify away from the sectors in which they have comparative advantages that is the case for most caribbean countries which are highly internationally integrated especially through tourism flows a sector often hit hard by downturns in larger economies the paper says to quantify the strength of macroeconomic linkages between caribbean countries and the rest of the world the paper introduces a caribbean tailored gvar model the imf gvar model features 45 developing emerging market and advanced economies of which 15 are caribbean the analysis focuses on specific spillovers for caribbean countries such as the effect of an expansionary policy in the united states or an oil price drop the paper says one of the main advantages of implementing a gvar model to assess macroeconomic impacts of external shocks is that it allows to internalise second round effects that are usually considered as exogenous or static in less sophisticated models the imf working paper says measuring linkages between different regions of the globe is a challenge however it says the gvar methodology shows itself to be useful to condense large amounts of information in a way that permits researchers to isolate global shocks or country specific shocks and gauge their impact across the board given its size and large dependence of external markets the caribbean region is particularly sensitive to policy changes or shocks in large trading partners such as the us canada or the uk united kingdom the paper says while most of the caribbean countries can be classified as tourism dependent it says a few others are also affected by external conditions due to the significant size of their trade in goods the paper notes that trinidad and tobago recently terminated its refining operations and is currently shifting from oil to gas production which will likely change some of the impacts estimated in this paper according to the paper the gvar model suggests that an oil price shock might negatively affect important easter caribbean currency union eccu trading partners that are oil exporters such the uk canada and trinidad and tobago while an initial negative effect on gdp followed by a recovery in the medium term would be expected in the us overall and given their condition as oil importers our findings reveal that most eccu economies would expect a positive impact on their gdp the authors say adding that those results coincide with the outcome from the recent drop in oil prices in 2014 the paper also finds a strong impact from an expansionary policy in the us on most caribbean economies simulated by a positive shock on the domestic gdp of the us the paper says an expansionary policy would strongly affect tourism dependent economies while having mixed effects on the set of caribbean goods exporters the results are not surprising given the relevance of us tourist flows for the region and contribute to confirming results from country specific models while taking into account a richer set of interactions the paper says external shocks represent a large source of uncertainty and volatility to small states and structural policies might help to downgrade their impact it adds while the questions raised in the paper are not new to imf s staff reports and research papers the working paper says the gvar methodology represents an alternative way to tackle them in a more integrated fashion while including second round effects from the dynamics of trading partners the paper says that the observed large impact of external factors suggest that caribbean countries may benefit from preventive measures such as increasing competitiveness diversifying their economies and reducing their dependence on critical commodities and services namely oil based energy and tourism these policies might reduce exposure to external imbalances and at the same time promote economic growth the paper says it says the gvar methodology is capable of providing responses to a broad range of questions stating that the model represents a promising avenue for empirical analysis and could be expanded to include more countries or idiosyncratic variables for particular countries

as the use of cryptocurrencies becomes increasingly pervasive in africa the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz has not been sold on the new trend in fact it has out rightly banned the use and trade in cryptocurrencies in zimbabwe could this be construed as a sign the country is not yet ready to embrace use of cryptocurrencies zimbabwe is in overdrive as it strives to modernise its economy in line with vision 2030 in doing so it should embrace digital virtual technology to create an efficient financial services system and products that can be easily accessed at low cost by the majority of its citizens in line with the global thrust for financial inclusion digital technological innovations underlying cryptocurrencies such as blockchain should be embraced by our central bank as they have the potential to improve efficiency in local financial services cryptocurrencies also known as virtual currencies are a digital medium of exchange which is unlike our normal fiat currency that exists in the form of physical bank notes introduced through legal instruments or commodity money backed by gold or other precious stones most commonly used cryptocurrencies worldwide are bitcoin ethereum dash monero litecoin ripple and so on their global value presently exceeds us 500 billion localised virtual currencies are also traded in different countries cryptocurrencies unlike fiat money are not controlled by a single administrator like a central bank as they work on a decentralised digital platform or ecosystem blockchain blockchain digital technology is the driver of cryptocurrencies as the central nervous system is to humans blockchain uses cryptography to create mine and store units secure transactions transfer tokens and effect payments these digital processes change a crypto from being a mere digital token into a digitised asset with an economic value this means users can earn it store it trade it transfer it or sell it most developing countries central banks do not recognise cryptocurrencies as money medium of exchange or legal tender in europe and the usa central banks have generally cautioned but not banned the use or trade in cryptocurrencies although trading in cryptocurrencies in africa has not spread widely to people at the bottom of the pyramid their use is growing in tandem with ict technological advancements high mobile penetration growth in literacy and financial inclusion and consumer sophistication ban on cryptocurrencies african central banks link cryptocurrencies to price volatility fraud money laundering tax evasion exchange control circumventions terrorism financing and other criminal activities fuelling illicit financial transactions while some of these concerns are genuine others tend to be hyperbolic as traditional financial systems are also fraught with similar risks on may 11 2018 the rbz issued a notice warning the public against use of cryptocurrencies it also directed all banking institutions not to provide banking services to facilitate any person or entity in dealing with or setting up cryptocurrencies rbz announced in the same notice that bitfinance and styx24 leading local cryptocurrency exchanges had not been licensed it further noted that any person who buys or sells or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies does so at their own risk and will not have recourse to the central bank on may 15 2018 golix which was in the process of rolling out its initial coin offering ico that sought to raise us 32 million through a token sale was directed by rbz to cease all cryptocurrency exchange operations golix filed an urgent chamber application with the high court challenging the legality of the rbz ban on the basis that the central bank acted illegally irrationally unconstitutionally and outside the ambit of administrative law in closing its virtual currency exchange on may 24 2018 the high court issued a default judgement against rbz and ruled inter alia that the ban issued by the respondents through letter dated may 15 2018 against the applicant directing it to cease its operations shut down its cryptocurrencies exchange business and ordering the closure of its bank accounts with its bankers be and is hereby suspended the ban in trading in cryptocurrencies from mainstream financial systems does not seem to be practical and effective such prohibitions force consumers to use black market trading avenues or simply resorting to peer to peer p2p digital trading platforms south africa the south african reserve bank sarb has taken a very pragmatic approach while the sarb does not officially recognise cryptocurrencies as money but as cyber tokens it has preferred to adopt a cautious but pragmatic approach to ensure that trading in cryptocurrencies complies with relevant financial surveillance and exchange control regulations already a sizeable number of merchants in south africa have embraced cryptocurrencies and accept bitcoin for payments deputy governor of sarb francois groepe was quoted by cryptonews an online news site on may 25 2018 saying the central bank has set up a special unit to review the possibility of putting in place crypto specific policies and regulations way forward many people across africa are increasingly being attracted to cryptocurrencies not only as speculative investments but as alternative and cheaper payment and settlement methods conduits for capital investments and options for savings and storing value as most african fiat currencies are volatile against major currencies such as the us dollar instead of throwing tantrums at technological innovations the rbz should be pragmatic and set up specialised units dedicated to researching on cryptocurrencies including emerging blockchain and other digital technologies this will enable it to come up with practical policy and regulatory interventions that work for zimbabwe we need home grown innovative regulatory mechanisms that allow crypto ecosystems to interface and co exist with the mainstream financial ecosytems allen choruma can be contacted on e mail hoziadvisory2018 gmail com

newsletters crime violence and lawlessness continue to damage the nation withdrawing credence from holness commitment to ensure the safety and security of his people adding to the party s woes are the bushing scandal bad hiring decisions cronyism multimillion dollar claims by many for unjustified dismissals the o brien car scandal which deprived the police of timely delivery of badly needed vehicles a forced resignation of a minister petrojam and the arrests of the minister of education and the head of a tertiary institution the pnp should be in the driver s seat enjoying the luxury of a jlp administration terrified to go to the polls bolstering the pnp s position would be the economic underperformance of the jlp government when stacked up against its prosperity claims and its election and post election promises growth should have been trending towards the 5 in 4 instead of slipping below 1 in 3 exports were forecast to be 60 per cent higher but they faltered leading to a horrendous trade deficit debt stubbornly high our national debt has remained stubbornly high around us 15 2 billion the trending down of our debt as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp will be stymied this year because our economy has hardly grown and our dollar has devalued to explain our national debt is huge and a lot of it is in foreign currency when our dollar devalues our national debt in our money increases and we have to find more jamaican dollars to repay that debt this means that our economy must grow big time to cover that extra money if it doesn t our debt as a percentage of what we produce every year gdp might not decline the combination of high debt low growth and devaluation strangles us with the ammunition arising from such evident weaknesses and the policy miscues of the jlp administration the pnp should be licking its chops that is not the case as the pnp s weakness is the jlp s strength jamaica is a highly indebted country guided by garrison style arrangements with a strong attachment to the politics of personal affection it has a third of its people living on captured land and the ideology democratic socialism that dr peter phillips and his party embraces lacks robustness and a sufficient emphasis on wealth creation to generate the modernisation of institutions and produce the annual output advances that jamaica needs in the top 50 per capita income countries in the world there is not one socialist or communist country and if you looked at most african latin american and caribbean nations that had romanticised socialism after their independence performance did not ratify expectations why does the pnp believe it can take jamaica with a very low per capita income and bereft of an abundance of first rate entrepreneurs and innovators and achieve the growth and productivity numbers needed for sustained development under democratic socialism in post independence the pnp had numerous chances yet growth was uninspiring the party has not addressed this and every year it trots out essentially the same menu of policy recommendations which makes no provision for the size of the country s indebtedness and our decades of underinvestment furthermore the unnecessary leadership contest characterised by deep divisions was the most asinine thing to have happened when a general election is any month now pnp needs a new vision the pnp has to upload a new vision and define the hallmarks of a leader who can make tough choices such as paul kagame in rwanda tony blair in england the late lee kuan yew in singapore deng xiaoping in china and kenya s uhuru kenyatta the jlp enjoys an advantage over the pnp because of having its ear to the people and the comforting way it responds to issues regardless of the problem with health and how much the minister is to blame you can t get better than dr christopher tufton with his bedside manner for listening to the public or the quiet measured response from kamina johnson smith who is in a tight balancing act in the world as is as for ed bartlett there is not a problem his smile can t overcome or a tourism target it can t achieve the prime minister even when everything is falling apart brings an innocence an inviting stare a furrowed brow a well prepared presentation articulated with finesse that elicits sympathy empathy and support his artful engagement with and favourable treatment from many heads of state speak volumes to his strength in diplomacy while securing benefits for the country adding to the jlp s confidence is the phenomenal growth of bpos the improvements in infrastructure and the continued strong performance of the hospitality sector the employment gains are strong although education training and certification need to be better aligned to drive enhanced value added prospects in the economy with credit eased and interest rates lowered the jlp is hoping that business will be sufficiently incentivised however the downturn in the mining sector which badly affects export earnings is painful the government s continued unwillingness to make the tough choices necessary to deal with social dysfunction lawlessness crime and violence is equally painful mark ricketts is an economist author and lecturer email feedback to columns gleanerjm com and rckttsmrk yahoo com
does the u s federal reserve have an obligation to combat inequality historically the central bank itself has thought not but that may be changing as bloomberg reports neel kashkari president of the minneapolis fed branch is pushing a new project inside the fed to analyze and understand inequality much more seriously we had historically said distributional outcomes monetary policy has no role to play kashkari said in october that was kind of the standard view at the fed and i came in assuming that i now think that s wrong at the end of the day however the question is not really whether the fed should care about inequality it s can the fed do anything about it is inequality something the monetary policy toolkit is capable of addressing subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get

the answer is yes specifically kashkari is looking to develop a retinue of specialists on income and wealth distribution the central bank can regularly call on in deciding the course of monetary policy and that project overlaps with another critique kashkari s been making that despite how it may look the united states is not at full employment the closer the economy gets to full employment and the longer it stays there the more bargaining power everyday workers will have their wages will go up while ceo compensation and corporate payouts to shareholders will have to go down to compensate the portion of national income flowing to the working class and thus not flowing to the rich will increase the implicit critique within kashkari s project is that the fed has not taken full employment seriously enough or pushed aggressively enough to attain it the official job congress gave the federal reserve was to maintain both maximum employment and stable prices but the central bank also has enormous internal leeway in how it interprets those goals and if you look back at the last few decades the fed s done an excellent job of keeping inflation low and stable and a terrible job of maximizing full employment one solution here would be for the fed to apply a much more stringent definition of full employment on itself progressive democrats actually have a bill that would order the fed to define maximum employment as median wages rising in tandem with overall economic productivity something that hasn t happened since the 1970s it would also instruct the fed to pay more attention to unemployment levels with different demographic and racial groups rather than just national unemployment as a whole all of those are great ideas but it s also worth noting that these are all definitions the federal reserve is free to impose on itself if its officials felt like it practically speaking changing the fed s definition of maximum employment would change how it adjusts interest rates keeping them lower longer and being more willing to tolerate inflation in the name of creating more jobs and wage growth kashkari s also not the only one who is thinking in these terms while she didn t present it as part of an effort to combat inequality lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors recently gave a speech suggesting the fed deliberately aim for longer bouts of higher inflation to make up for previous periods of time like the last few years when inflation consistently ran below target meanwhile the fed has already backed off its previous interest rate hikes which suggests this kind of soul searching is going on throughout the institution the central bank if it s serious could also get more clever and go much further the fed s charter from congress for example allows it to buy state and local debt with a maturity of six months or less the fed could explicitly state that it will use that power to buy up any short term debt that state and local governments issue to plug holes in their budgets during recessions or to finance the provision of basic public goods and services and more but this sort of move would also require a good deal of institutional and political courage from fed officials the whole reason the fed is limited to buying six month debt maturities is to prevent it from buying longer term debt and effectively financing state and local government fiscal policy the traditional view that the fed shouldn t concern itself with distributional questions flows from the norm that the fed deals with monetary policy while congressional bodies deal with fiscal policy which is to say government spending how much and on whom and that point really gets to the limits of the fed s abilities the impetus for brainard s speech is that the fed cut interest rates to zero after the 2008 crisis and thus couldn t lower them any further even though the economy still clearly needed more stimulus the traditional assumption in economics has been that monetary policy could always adjust the economy back to full employment on its own but what we ve discovered in recent years is that fiscal austerity from congress plus monetary policy that s over eager to prevent inflation can so damage the economy that a reformed approach to monetary policy alone cannot fix the problem the point of keeping interest rates lower longer is to encourage more investment but investors do not hand out money simply because interest rates are cheap they hand it out because they see profitable opportunities in the economy and that enough demand is rising to meet the money that investors can provide if the demand is not there they won t invest no matter how low interest rates fall but creating that demand requires getting more money into everyday consumers pockets which is precisely the sort of thing that fiscal policy not monetary policy is supposed to concern itself with offering federal state and local governments an open ended commitment to finance their debt is about the closest the fed can get without actual legal amendments to its charter that expand its powers and offering that deal would be wildly controversial precisely because it would challenge the conceptual divide between monetary and fiscal policy not to mention governments would have to be ideologically and politically willing to take

two years ago the foxconn corp signed a controversial contract to build an lcd manufacturing facility in rural southeastern wisconsin in exchange for up to 3 6 billion in state subsidies president donald trump announced the deal at the white house exuberantly sharing a photo op with then gov scott walker and foxconn s ceo foxconn and its subsidizers touted studies alleging 39 billion to 78 billion would flow into the state s economy during the next 15 years but these studies focused only on the benefits and ignored the costs now more realistic calculations suggest that the deal could reduce wisconsin s long run economic growth to see how this could happen it s helpful to understand why the initial estimates were so unrealistic for one thing like so many estimates provided by economic development consultants the foxconn numbers used a benefits only analysis that is they failed to incorporate any cost of the subsidy treating the funding like manna from heaven but because every subsidy dollar must first be taxed out of the economy any valid analysis must include the corresponding cost building on research by timothy bartik we estimate that the 3 6 billion in taxes needed to fund the subsidies will likely decrease wisconsin s long run gdp by about 20 billion during the 15 year life of the handout and this estimate doesn t include the local utility infrastructure and federal subsidies that total another 1 4 billion proponents of such deals generally assume the project wouldn t move forward without the subsidy but as university of texas austin professor nate jensen put it assuming 100 of activity was due to incentives isn t credible it s like attributing 100 of sales of a product to a marketing campaign by that metric every campaign looks brilliant bartik s research finds that the typical subsidy only affects a company s location decision between 2 and 25 of the time basic economic analysis says that if a bet pays 100 with a 25 probability of winning then it s only worth 25 use that logic and multiply the most realistic estimate 39 2 billion in additional gdp over 15 years by 0 25 and the expected payoff from the subsidy is more like 9 8 billion the subsidies offered to foxconn were unusually large so perhaps they were more influential in foxconn s decision but given how businesses often choose the best location regardless of the subsidies offered as amazon did with hq2 last year there s reason to doubt that wisconsin s were decisive even doubling the upper estimate of influence to 50 provides an expected payoff of only 19 6 billion comparing that against the economic costs of taxation for the subsidy about 20 billion means the expected long run effect of the subsidy is negative trump and walker were on hand at foxconn s groundbreaking ceremony two summers ago wielding golden shovels and basking in the media attention since then however foxconn s plans have gone through substantial gymnastics and it will now build a much smaller facility accounting for the commensurately reduced subsidies and assuming again generously that the subsidy was 50 effective the change increases the estimated economic loss to about 1 2 billion subsidies invite additional difficult to quantify economic losses as well they cause companies to make worse investments including some that shouldn t be made they re anticompetitive which can increase production waste and they encourage firms to expend scarce resources seeking the privilege instead of creating value for consumers in short political favoritism is an economic disease that summons a host of additional economic political and social pathologies over time this disease has become an epidemic with more and more politicians embracing corporate handouts as a share of gdp city and state spending on subsidies has more than tripled since 1990 totaling more than 45 billion today those funds would do more for economic growth if they were repurposed to fund genuine public goods like education or infrastructure or to fund broad based tax cuts available to everyone but those sorts of sound public policies do not lend themselves to photo ops with golden shovels when politics and business combine it breeds favoritism and even corruption yet fiascos like foxconn are all too common politicians want to do something even when in cases like this one it s less than nothing
investing in companies that have the same long term values as you is a fool proof way to set you up for the future especially with top stocks like enbridge inc tsx enb nyse enb finding companies to invest in that have the same long term values as you is one of the best ways to ensure success when investing if you are someone who is investing for the long term and not really bothered by quarterly results all that much you don t want to be invested in a company that may sacrifice future growth to hit quarterly targets you want to find companies that are making the best decisions to impact shareholders long term decisions that will protect your capital as best as possible while creating the optimal opportunities to grow it two companies with strong management and values that are best aligned with long term shareholders are enbridge inc tsx enb nyse enb and peyto exploration and development corp tsx pey enbridge enbridge is a massive company operating on a global scale it operates in four main segments liquids pipelines gas distribution gas transmission and midstream and renewable power generation and transmission in north america the company makes up a major portion of our economy enbridge transports roughly 25 of north america s crude oil and 22 of its natural gas transporting nearly a quarter of north america s energy clearly makes enbridge a crucial part of the north american economy the company operates in businesses that are necessities but even still roughly 98 of its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is regulated giving it predictable and reliable cash flow on top of that 93 of its counterparty credit exposure is from investment grade clients which is reassuring and mitigates a ton of risk another reason why enbridge is the perfect long term hold is its strong financial stability it s been strengthening the balance sheet by making some non core asset divestments to free up capital since august 2018 it s freed up nearly 8 billion in capital this has helped it to strengthen its leverage ratios decreasing its debt to ebitda the last few years into its target range of 4 5 to 5 0 times the strong financials coupled with its defensive business model and predictable cash flows lead it to pay an attractive dividend that is raised often as it grows its distributable cash flow the dividend yields roughly 5 8 and its lengthy history of dividend increases have led enbridge to be included in the canadian dividend aristocrats list it s one of the largest companies in canada and one of the best operators so buying today for the long term will almost surely yield you great results peyto peyto is a natural gas producer that in my opinion is one of the best run companies in the canadian energy industry and one that has a returns focused investment strategy over the last 20 years peyto has averaged a roughly 16 return on capital employed and 29 return on equity these numbers are incredible and some of the highest in the industry it s achieved these massive returns in large part because it s one of the lowest cost producers in western canada in 2018 its cash costs per barrel of oil equivalent was just 5 51 since the business is run to maximize the return on investors capital peyto has been reducing its production in the last few years as natural gas prices have been depressed it believes this is a prudent choice not wanting to sell its assets at these relatively low prices this has led to the stock being sold off severely and even with a few dividend cuts to keep the dividend in line with the earnings it s generating it still yields a solid 8 5 today natural gas prices have to rebound eventually and peyto has positioned itself the best it can to ramp its production back up when this happens it s creating a ton of potential for investors and given how cheap it is today investors willing to be patient are in for some massive rewards down the line bottom line both companies continue to make prudent long term choices that are intended to benefit long term investors the most the companies operate to set investors up with huge growth down the line but also pay highly attractive dividends in the meantime

the rybovich superyacht marina lies on the west palm beach florida waterfront a short drive north from mar a lago superyachts floating mansions that can stretch more than 300 feet and cost over 100 million are serviced at the marina and their owners enjoy rybovich s luxury resort amenities its instagram account offers a glimpse into the rarefied world of the global 0 1 as one post puts it what s better than owning a yacht owning a yacht with a helicopter of course rybovich owner wayne huizenga jr son of the waste management and blockbuster video billionaire wayne huizenga sr has long planned to build luxury apartment towers on the site part of a development dubbed marina village those planned towers and the superyacht marina itself are now in an area designated as an opportunity zone under president donald trump s 2017 tax code overhaul qualifying them for a tax break program that is supposed to help the poor then florida gov rick scott bestowed the tax break on the marina after a direct appeal from huizenga jr according to a 2018 letter huizenga jr wrote that was obtained by propublica huizenga and his family have been major donors to scott even though the opportunity zone program is supposed to subsidize only new investment huizenga cited the already planned marina village in his appeal to scott noting the significant private sector investment that is poised to take place huizenga wrote this project has been planned for some time as part of the larger marina village initiative which incorporates the rybovich working waterfront marina the state of florida based on an analysis of unemployment and poverty rates had not originally intended to pick the census tract containing the superyacht marina for the program but those plans changed in response to huizenga s lobbying according to documents from the florida department of economic opportunity obtained by propublica a little more than a week after the huizenga letter scott announced his opportunity zone picks which included the rybovich marina area at the same time scott rejected other poorer tracts that the city of west palm beach had asked to be named opportunity zones two other scott donors both billionaires also benefit jorge pérez the related group chairman and ceo known as the condo king of south florida and stephen ross a prominent trump fundraiser real estate magnate and miami dolphins and equinox gym part owner ross related companies owns a quarter of related group which is rybovich s partner on the planned marina village development it s unclear how valuable the tax break could be and the public may never know because the trump law included no public reporting requirements but pérez recently boasted that the new subsidy would add jet fuel to the investment returns telling bloomberg this year it worked as a market rate rental now it works that much better as an opportunity zone huizenga and pérez weren t the only beneficiaries of scott s largesse in a separate case in tampa the florida documents show scott made a wealthy downtown area an opportunity zone at the request of a firm controlled by yet another billionaire donor tampa bay lightning owner jeff vinik this too does not involve a new investment since as early as 2014 vinik has been planning a massive redevelopment project in the area that will include luxury residences hotels and shops trump has hailed the opportunity zone program opportunity zones are doing unbelievably well and you ll see that and you ve already seen it he said in august and the biggest beneficiary there is african americans but in florida the tract selections highlight one significant vulnerability in the opportunity zone process the trump tax law gave governors the authority to distribute valuable tax breaks and they have wielded it to benefit the politically connected that s the real scary part of this program that you give such incredible power to politicians to designate zones said nathan jensen a professor at the university of texas at austin who studies economic development the fact that this process was not transparent in almost any state is shocking previous revelations about billionaires taking advantage of the opportunity zone program for already planned developments in wealthy areas have spurred congressional scrutiny sen ron wyden d ore introduced a bill to overhaul the program while sen bernie sanders i vt has called for it to be abolished a spokesman for scott who is now one of florida s u s senators declined to comment on the superyacht marina case but said in a statement then governor scott s focus was on supporting job creation in low income areas in the state based on federal requirements and what would offer the best return on taxpayer dollars that s what guided every decision he made in a statement rybovich president carlos vidueira denied the firm had sought the tax break for its own benefit the motivation to seek approval of an opportunity zone designation was to create incentives for redevelopment by third parties in the surrounding neighborhood the letter was not motivated by an attempt to create incentives for rybovich or the related group he pointed to the firm s support of a nonprofit effort to revitalize the area called purpose built communities which aims to create affordable housing and jobs vidueira added that rybovich has never planned the use of any opportunity zone tax deferment for its property he declined to comment on whether it might raise money from other investors taking advantage of the tax break or on related group s stated plans to use the tax break related group s general counsel betsy mccoy said the firm had no involvement in former governor scott s designation of florida s opportunity zones she added related group first learned of the tax break when the governor s press release went out a spokeswoman for ross related companies did not respond to questions the opportunity zone tax break was pitched as the prime anti poverty measure of trump s signature legislative achievement the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 an idea that drew bipartisan support notably from sen cory booker d n j the program is supposed to incentivize investors to direct their capital to needy areas in exchange they get a lucrative break on capital gains taxes after the new law passed there was a brief high stakes window at the start of 2018 when decisions were made first the treasury department drew up a list of eligible census tracts based on income and poverty data then each governor selected a quarter of the tracts in their state for opportunity zone status finally the treasury ok d those picks the process gave enormous autonomy to the governors especially because the treasury applied little scrutiny to the selections before approving them in the newly designated opportunity zones investors get a trio of subsidies if investors take capital gains generated for example by the sale of stock that has increased in value and put it into a deal in one of the zones they don t have to pay capital gains tax up front later their tax bills are trimmed and most important any appreciation on the new investment in the opportunity zone is tax free after a decade the designation was an immediate boon to owners of property within the selected areas values on development sites went up on the expectation that new investment could come in studies suggest when the florida department of economic opportunity created a statistical model incorporating unemployment rate poverty and population density to come up with a list of opportunity zone picks huizenga s superyacht tract was not included according to the florida agency s internal documents city leaders identified three other tracts in the north end of west palm beach as their top picks to be opportunity zones all three are poor the core tracts of the north end are racially and ethnically diverse with a population of approximately 57 000 people of which over 65 earn less than 15 000 per year according to a city memo they were also attractive areas for growth all are rebounding from significant blight and are well positioned for new investment the memo said the tract with the superyacht marina was wealthier and whiter than the tracts identified by city leaders based on median income it is hardly rich but the area is testament to how the overall economic data of a single census tract can mask pockets of extreme wealth on north flagler drive along the intracoastal waterway multimillion dollar mansions dot the waterfront obstructed from street view by walls and palm trees last year rybovich s huizenga bought a 5 million property from rosie o donnell there down the road from the superyacht marina sylvia moffett a former west palm beach city commissioner said in an interview there is little connection between the predominantly poor areas of the north end and the wealthy stretch of waterfront the houses along the intracoastal get torn down and rebuilt a lot mansions go up she said in an april 2018 letter addressed to scott huizenga made his pitch to the governor to add the superyacht tract and two others he cited the rybovich related marina village project within these census tracts the related group is planning to invest 120 million into the construction of a new rental residential building that is scheduled to break ground in the first quarter of 2019 huizenga wrote he also noted rybovich support for a community based initiative that will be bringing hundreds of jobs to the area rybovich officials got the city of west palm beach to amend its initial requests to the state to add the superyacht tract emails show the city added the new areas because of expressed interest by a major local employer a west palm beach official wrote to the state economic development agency huizenga s letter was included in the city s recommendations submitted to the state a florida department of economic opportunity document subsequently listed the superyacht tract under rybovich s name marked as added from request a week later on april 19 scott announced his selections for the opportunity zone tax break the superyacht tract among them in a press release about the west palm beach picks a florida official said the program will continue our progress in revitalizing low income and rural regions of the state two out of three of west palm beach s original poverty stricken priority areas did not make scott s cut a scott spokesman declined to comment on his specific decisions west palm beach did not respond to requests for comment a florida department of economic opportunity spokeswoman said in a statement that the agency accepted input from communities across the state including local government business leaders economic development organizations and investors governor scott ultimately made all decisions on which census tracts were nominated as opportunity zones the plans for the marina village project have changed several times and it has not started on schedule but last year the developers announced rents would be up to 3 000 a month for one bedroom units and 4 500 for three bedroom units plus penthouses for an undisclosed sum the project is physically oriented away from the poor parts of the census tract where schools are struggling and the crime rate is high the chairman and founder of related companies ross along with pérez and huizenga are all donors to scott collectively they and their families have given at least 1 million to scott and the florida gop in the last decade in 2013 scott gave wayne huizenga sr a great floridian award the state s rough equivalent of the presidential medal of freedom he died last year another politically connected developer successfully lobbied scott for an opportunity zone for yet another already planned project this time in tampa as far back as 2014 vinik the tampa bay lightning owner has had his eye on redeveloping a swath of the city s downtown surrounding his hockey team s arena in mid 2017 strategic property partners a joint venture between vinik and bill gates cascade investment announced a 3 billion redevelopment plan for the area the project water street tampa is slated to include luxury apartments hotels stores and restaurants catering to tampa s growing millennial population in early 2018 documents show that vinik s firm along with the city of tampa requested that the area for the investment be made an opportunity zone vinik has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to scott in recent years scott picked the tract that contains most of the development for the tax break the tract has a median family income almost twice as high as the tampa metro area placing it among the top 0 5 of opportunity zones nationwide in terms of income in a statement strategic property partners defended the area s designation saying downtown tampa has long been a candidate for development and the establishment of opportunity zones has helped increase and accelerate investment water street tampa is transforming a vacant area of land in downtown tampa into a new community within the city while the law gave the treasury the power to vet the selections of each governor the agency appears to have simply rubber stamped the picks said brett theodos a senior fellow at the urban institute who studies opportunity zones treasury appeared to elect for the lowest common denominator screening to just make sure tracts were technically eligible theodos said we have yet to hear that treasury ever denied a nominated zone because it didn t fit within the spirit of the objective of the program in response to that criticism a treasury spokesman said that the opportunity zone provision of the tax law gave governors the discretion to nominate areas for designation as opportunity zones the department had a limited role in the process justin elliott jeff ernsthausen and kyle edwards propublica

spare change even for a near usd2 trillion economy delusional quest for superpower status the mars madness or mars orbiter mission mom to give it its official title makes india one of four the us the eu and russia being the other three that have ventured to our closest cosmic neighbour and constitutes a conspicuously extravagant part of what economist activist jean dreze accurately describes as the indian elite s delusional quest for superpower status while hundreds of millions in the sub continent live impoverished degrading lives the indian government is investing the nation s income in sending a rocket to mars competition and nationalism drive such escapades not the quest for knowledge and understanding the space race between the us and the soviet union for example was not an affordable luxury undertaken for the sake of knowledge but intrinsically tied to the military industrial complex the guardian rightly states india s primary competitor in all things economic is that other mammoth nation china the chinese space programme is advanced in 2012 it put a chinese woman in space and last year launched its first un crewed lunar mission and therefore intensely intimidating to the indian nationalists psyche this stellar statement of indian male virility only men would instigate such a policy represents the insanity permeating the political pantomime not only inside india but worldwide while hundreds of millions in the sub continent live impoverished degrading lives the indian government is investing the nation s income in sending a rocket to mars the economist asks the rhetorical question how a country that cannot feed all of its people find the money for a mars mission as well as we should add shelling out usd32 billion on defence each year making india the world s biggest arms importer with the fourth largest air force yet india which has its own overseas aid programme worth gbp328 million a year is still receiving international aid amounting to around usd1 6 billion world bank 2012 figures a year much of this flows from the coffers of nations britain and the usa for example who cannot the politicians proclaim invest adequately in public services or pay public sector workers a living wage rocket science versus sanitation a third of the world s poor that s almost 1 billion people are in india and despite 20 years of so called development the world bank records that not only has this number not been reduced but the absolute number of poor people in some of india s poorest states actually increased during the last decade these marginalised men women and children from rural india are driven from their land by the commercialisation of the countryside to the slums of the cities in mumbai alone a city with a population of almost 21 million two thirds live in rambling slums the majority of the population over 50 per cent do not have the luxury of a toilet and are forced to defecate in public it is estimated by the world bank that as many as 68 per cent of people or 885 million in india are living on less than usd2 the official world bank poverty line a day and that over half of these are persisting on an income of under usd1 a day surviving on such a pittance is virtually impossible parents cannot feed their children or themselves every day or pay for health care or education families live in suffocating conditions a family of five six seven perhaps sleeping on the ground in one small room which functions as kitchen bedroom and living room the majority of the population over 50 per cent do not have the luxury of a toilet and are forced to defecate in public in a recent report on worldwide sanitation the world health organisation and the united nations children s fund unicef found that globally india continues to be the country with the highest number of people 597 million people practising open defecation perhaps some of the 16 000 scientists and engineers working on the space programme could be employed to design and install a nationwide sanitation system the polluted image of a divided nation the needs and rights of the marginalised masses who are primarily from the scheduled castes the adivasi indigenous and dalit previously referred to as the untouchables groups are consistently abused and ignored state health care for example particularly in rural india is virtually non existent the government spends a mere 1 2 per cent of gdp on public health which as the economist says is dismally low afghanistan for example spends 8 7 per cent the democratic republic of congo 5 6 per cent according to world bank 2012 figures in fact i could find no country in the world that spends less the truth is that the ruling elite care not for those living in abject destitution they are an embarrassment to the delhi mumbai set the billionaires india has 66 of the world s richest multi millionaires and comfortable middle class who are desperate for india to be recognised as a shiny democratic consumer state albeit a violent unjust nationalistic one it is the polluted image of a divided nation ruled by an uncompassionate materialistically driven hindu minority that would shame the vision of the father of the nation mahatma gandhi
the signals were loud and clear coming from the jamaica labour party s jlp 76th annual party conference exuding such confidence that jamaicans would say they were in their ackee chairman robert montague engaging and entertaining was followed later by his prime minister regaling the audience with performance delivered and plans and promises to be delivered their swagger in response to the intensity and maddening noise of the crowd when roll call was in session was unrestrained the audience boisterous to themes capturing the moment facilitated music with words stand up jamaica when you hear the bell one thing about annual party conferences whether the people s national party pnp or the jlp the passion and the electricity restate confidence and undergird heightened levels of delegate strength and party support but even so the andrew holness led jlp party elevated crowd excitement to decibel levels consistent with an understanding that this is the last annual conference before the general election the chairman cautioned we are not there yet in terms of calling the election but the articulated policy measures the groundwork the advanced preparation said something different such confidence coming from the jlp is puzzling especially as its rival only lost by one seat in the 2016 general election and once bragged that jamaica was pnp country moreover the jlp government being embroiled in so many scandals and missteps meant contesting a general election anytime soon should be a low priority headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters crime violence and lawlessness continue to damage the nation withdrawing credence from holness commitment to ensure the safety and security of his people adding to the party s woes are the bushing scandal bad hiring decisions cronyism multimillion dollar claims by many for unjustified dismissals the o brien car scandal which deprived the police of timely delivery of badly needed vehicles a forced resignation of a minister petrojam and the arrests of the minister of education and the head of a tertiary institution the pnp should be in the driver s seat enjoying the luxury of a jlp administration terrified to go to the polls bolstering the pnp s position would be the economic underperformance of the jlp government when stacked up against its prosperity claims and its election and post election promises growth should have been trending towards the 5 in 4 instead of slipping below 1 in 3 exports were forecast to be 60 per cent higher but they faltered leading to a horrendous trade deficit debt stubbornly high our national debt has remained stubbornly high around us 15 2 billion the trending down of our debt as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp will be stymied this year because our economy has hardly grown and our dollar has devalued to explain our national debt is huge and a lot of it is in foreign currency when our dollar devalues our national debt in our money increases and we have to find more jamaican dollars to repay that debt this means that our economy must grow big time to cover that extra money if it doesn t our debt as a percentage of what we produce every year gdp might not decline the combination of high debt low growth and devaluation strangles us with the ammunition arising from such evident weaknesses and the policy miscues of the jlp administration the pnp should be licking its chops that is not the case as the pnp s weakness is the jlp s strength jamaica is a highly indebted country guided by garrison style arrangements with a strong attachment to the politics of personal affection it has a third of its people living on captured land and the ideology democratic socialism that dr peter phillips and his party embraces lacks robustness and a sufficient emphasis on wealth creation to generate the modernisation of institutions and produce the annual output advances that jamaica needs in the top 50 per capita income countries in the world there is not one socialist or communist country and if you looked at most african latin american and caribbean nations that had romanticised socialism after their independence performance did not ratify expectations why does the pnp believe it can take jamaica with a very low per capita income and bereft of an abundance of first rate entrepreneurs and innovators and achieve the growth and productivity numbers needed for sustained development under democratic socialism in post independence the pnp had numerous chances yet growth was uninspiring the party has not addressed this and every year it trots out essentially the same menu of policy recommendations which makes no provision for the size of the country s indebtedness and our decades of underinvestment furthermore the unnecessary leadership contest characterised by deep divisions was the most asinine thing to have happened when a general election is any month now pnp needs a new vision the pnp has to upload a new vision and define the hallmarks of a leader who can make tough choices such as paul kagame in rwanda tony blair in england the late lee kuan yew in singapore deng xiaoping in china and kenya s uhuru kenyatta the jlp enjoys an advantage over the pnp because of having its ear to the people and the comforting way it responds to issues regardless of the problem with health and how much the minister is to blame you can t get better than dr christopher tufton with his bedside manner for listening to the public or the quiet measured response from kamina johnson smith who is in a tight balancing act in the world as is as for ed bartlett there is not a problem his smile can t overcome or a tourism target it can t achieve the prime minister even when everything is falling apart brings an innocence an inviting stare a furrowed brow a well prepared presentation articulated with finesse that elicits sympathy empathy and support his artful engagement with and favourable treatment from many heads of state speak volumes to his strength in diplomacy while securing benefits for the country adding to the jlp s confidence is the phenomenal growth of bpos the improvements in infrastructure and the continued strong performance of the hospitality sector the employment gains are strong although education training and certification need to be better aligned to drive enhanced value added prospects in the economy with credit eased and interest rates lowered the jlp is hoping that business will be sufficiently incentivised however the downturn in the mining sector which badly affects export earnings is painful the government s continued unwillingness to make the tough choices necessary to deal with social dysfunction lawlessness crime and violence is equally painful mark ricketts is an economist author and lecturer email feedback to columns gleanerjm com and rckttsmrk yahoo com
contributors michael farren and matthew mitchell tribune news service two years ago the foxconn corporation signed a controversial contract to build an lcd manufacturing facility in rural southeastern wisconsin in exchange for up to 3 6 billion in state subsidies president donald trump announced the deal at the white house exuberantly sharing a photo op with then gov scott walker and foxconn s ceo foxconn and its subsidizers touted studies alleging 39 billion to 78 billion would flow into the state s economy over the next 15 years but these studies focused only on the benefits and ignored the costs now more realistic calculations suggest that the deal could reduce wisconsin s long run economic growth to see how this could happen it s helpful to understand why the initial estimates were so unrealistic for one thing like so many estimates provided by economic development consultants the foxconn numbers used a benefits only analysis that is they failed to incorporate any cost of the subsidy treating the funding like manna from heaven but because every subsidy dollar must first be taxed out of the economy any valid analysis must include the corresponding cost building on research by timothy bartik we estimate that the 3 6 billion in taxes needed to fund the subsidies will likely decrease wisconsin s long run gdp by about 20 billion over the 15 year life of the handout and this estimate doesn t include the local utility infrastructure and federal subsidies that total another 1 4 billion more u s economy grows at modest 1 9 rate in third quarter more trump flip flops on tax cuts saying u s has strong economy more ap explains is the u s economy nearing a recession proponents of such deals generally assume the project wouldn t move forward without the subsidy but as university of texas austin professor nate jensen put it assuming 100 of activity was due to incentives isn t credible it s like attributing 100 of sales of a product to a marketing campaign by that metric every campaign looks brilliant bartik s research finds that the typical subsidy only affects a company s location decision between 2 and 25 of the time basic economic analysis says that if a bet pays 100 with a 25 probability of winning then it s only worth 25 use that logic and multiply the most realistic estimate 39 2 billion in additional gdp over 15 years by 0 25 and the expected payoff from the subsidy is more like 9 8 billion the subsidies offered to foxconn were unusually large so perhaps they were more influential in foxconn s decision but given how businesses often choose the best location regardless of the subsidies offered as amazon did with hq2 last year there s reason to doubt that wisconsin s were decisive even doubling the upper estimate of influence to 50 provides an expected payoff of only 19 6 billion comparing that against the economic costs of taxation for the subsidy about 20 billion means the expected long run effect of the subsidy is negative trump and walker were on hand at foxconn s groundbreaking ceremony two summers ago wielding golden shovels and basking in the media attention since then however foxconn s plans have gone through substantial gymnastics and it will now build a much smaller facility accounting for the commensurately reduced subsidies and assuming again generously that the subsidy was 50 effective the change increases the estimated economic loss to about 1 2 billion subsidies invite additional difficult to quantify economic losses as well they cause companies to make worse investments including some that shouldn t be made they re anticompetitive which can increase production waste and they encourage firms to expend scarce resources seeking the privilege instead of creating value for consumers in short political favoritism is an economic disease that summons a host of additional economic political and social pathologies over time this disease has become an epidemic with more and more politicians embracing corporate handouts as a share of gdp city and state spending on subsidies has more than tripled since 1990 totaling over 45 billion today those funds would do more for economic growth if they were repurposed to fund genuine public goods like education or infrastructure or to fund broad based tax cuts available to everyone but those sorts of sound public policies do not lend themselves to photo ops with golden shovels when politics and business combine it breeds favoritism and even corruption yet fiascos like foxconn are all too common politicians want to do something even when in cases like this one it s less than nothing michael farren is a research fellow and matthew mitchell is a senior research fellow with the mercatus center at george mason university they are the coauthors of the new study the economics of a targeted economic development subsidy with jeremy horpedahl and olivia gonzalez

written by valerie hughes and jessica horwitz the government of canada has invited members of the public to submit views on the potential admission of additional members to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership an international trade agreement otherwise known as the cptpp countries or customs territories that wish to join the cptpp must submit a written request to the existing member countries although no formal requests to join have been received to date south korea taiwan thailand and the united kingdom have announced their interest in acceding the canadian government anticipates that accession negotiations with one or more of these countries could begin as early as fall 2019 in anticipation of these negotiations the government has invited interested members of the canadian public and business community to provide written submissions to global affairs canada by august 25 2019 what is the cptpp the cptpp is a free trade agreement fta between canada japan australia mexico new zealand chile peru vietnam malaysia singapore and brunei originally negotiated as the tpp and renamed after the united states dropped out in 2017 the agreement came into force for canada japan australia mexico new zealand and singapore at the end of 2018 and for vietnam in january 2019 it will come into force for the remaining members once they have completed their domestic ratification procedures although canada already has other free trade arrangements with some of these countries mexico chile and peru the cptpp is canada s first free trade arrangement with australia japan malaysia vietnam new zealand singapore and brunei what type of trade is covered in the cptpp the cptpp is a broad ranging agreement that includes the full panoply of provisions often found in ftas as well as additional commitments and disciplines in new areas in addition to providing for tariff elimination across a number of sectors including notably agriculture fish and seafood forest products industrial goods and consumer products the cptpp includes chapters on textile and apparel goods services including financial services investment intellectual property protection anti dumping subsidies and safeguards competition policy electronic commerce customs and border procedures labour rights and obligations environmental governance sanitary measures for the protection of human health technical barriers such as standards and conformity assessment measures small and medium sized enterprises and state owned enterprises dispute settlement provisions including for investor state disputes are also included what impact could the admission of south korea taiwan thailand or the united kingdom to the cptpp have on canada the cptpp already covers about 13 percent of global gdp with its current members representing a collective market of 503 million people with the admission of all four identified candidate countries these numbers would climb to nearly 20 percent of gdp and 714 million people although canada has had an fta in place with south korea since 2015 the cptpp includes more extensive provisions in certain areas such as electronic commerce and includes disciplines on transparency state owned enterprises and corruption moreover the labour and environment chapters of the cptpp are fully enforceable under the agreement s dispute settlement mechanism which is not the case under the canada korea fta canada currently has an fta with the united kingdom through the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta with the european union but the uk would cease to be a party to this agreement after brexit canada does not currently have ftas with either thailand or taiwan both of which are important trading partners admission of these countries to the cptpp could therefore be a useful mechanism to fast track free trade negotiations with these partners what are the topics of interest in the consultation the government of canada has requested input on the following topics in particular goods of export or import interest that would benefit from expedited or phased in removal of tariffs and other barriers as well as import sensitivities rules of origin for specific products to determine the amount of processing required for a good to benefit from preferential treatment border and customs issues that have an impact on movement of goods into and out of markets potentially seeking cptpp membership preferred approach to trade remedies to be applied to trade between the market of interest and canada temporary entry of business people from canada into the market of interest and from the market of interest into canada and electronic commerce and restrictive measures currently faced by canadian suppliers in this area in the markets of interest why is it important to have your say the cptpp is a broad ranging free trade agreement with potentially significant impacts on canadian businesses many such impacts could be positive for example the agreement creates opportunities for canadian export and service businesses to enter new markets the agreement also streamlines and standardizes customs procedures in certain countries which should bring much needed efficiencies in trading relationships and offers protections for foreign investors to foster growth however free trade agreements can also create negative consequences such as exposing sensitive industries or sectors to foreign competition it is therefore important that the government of canada be aware of all potential implications of expanding the membership of the cptpp before it enters into negotiations who should consider providing comments businesses that import goods or services into canada or export goods or services abroad businesses facing competition from imports businesses facing barriers when shipping goods abroad such as high tariffs customs delays or onerous administrative procedures or regulatory requirements businesses that would like to enhance export opportunities to new markets and gain preferential access businesses that want to protect their foreign business ventures from discrimination abroad and anyone with views on canada s trade diversification policy bennett jones trade experts have extensive experience in negotiating interpreting and applying international trade agreements we are available to assist in developing submissions to global affairs canada on the potential benefits and drawbacks of adding countries to the cptpp or to provide general advice on

the recent fall in commodity prices has slowed bolivia s racing economic growth from a peak of 6 8 in 2013 to about 4 0 in 2019 this vulnerability to fluctuations in commodity prices is replicated in

decades diamonds being the leading mineral however the landlocked bolivia made impressive economic gains in recent years its gdp grew at an average annual rate of 4 9 from 2004 to 2014 one of the best economic performances in south america bolivia also cut extreme poverty from 35 to just 18 between 2006 and 2015 boasting a positive external balance reduced public debt and efficient taxation it has achieved significant progress in human and social development but the bolivian economy remains highly commodity dependent commodities accounted for 95 of its merchandise exports in 2017 with natural

earnings to improve the welfare of its citizens botswana s heavy dependence on the mineral sector has left it highly vulnerable to price shocks bolivia and botswana exemplify one of the perils facing many landlocked developing countries lldcs dependence on commodities said mussie delelegn chief of unctad s landlocked developing countries section across the world 32 countries are landlocked with a population of about 440 million these countries face special trade and development challenges arising from their lack of territorial access to the sea and geographical remoteness from international markets mr delelegn said exports and imports of lldcs are required to transit through at least one neighbouring state and often have to change the mode of transport frequently this substantially increases the cost of trade for lldcs and is a key factor in preventing their effective integration into the global trading system the geographical challenges of lldcs are often compounded by weak transit transport infrastructure inefficient customs operations and over dependence on exports of primary commodities in recognition of the complex challenges facing lldcs and their special development needs the international community adopted the vienna programme of action vpoa for these countries for the decade 2014 2024 the programme seeks to help the lldcs achieve sustainable and inclusive growth and eradicate poverty a comprehensive high level midterm review on the implementation of the programme is scheduled for december 5 and 6 in new york it will analyse the status of implementation of the programme the review meeting will be a forum to share best practices and lessons learned it will also identify remaining obstacles and actions needed to accelerate the implementation of the programme unctad will organise an event on impact investing and innovative resource mobilization to foster productive capacities and structural economic transformation in lldcs on 5 december it will co organise another event on how trade facilitation and transit systems can assist lldcs reduce trade costs by more than 15 and create win win opportunities with their transit partner countries on december 6 five years into the vpoa s implementation unctad s assessments show that progress has fallen far short of what is needed to meet the programme s goals in some areas lldcs have regressed average gdp growth fell sharply from 5 2 in 2014 to 3 1 in 2016 while growth recovered to 4 4 in 2018 it remains below the average of 6 achieved in the decade prior to the vpoa lldcs continue to be heavily commodity dependent and their average share of manufacturing in total value added has decreased the commodity driven path to inclusive and sustainable economic growth is not helping lldcs make progress towards achieving the vpoa and the sustainable development goals mr delelegn said according to unctad with the current pace of progress in implementing the vpoa lldcs are neither likely to achieve the targets of the vpoa by its 2024 deadline nor the global goals by 2030 a new generation of development policies and strategies are urgently needed mr delelegn said lldcs should focus on fostering productive capacities and structural economic transformation besides commodity dependence bolivia is also experiencing premature deindustrialization and limited structural transformation its competitiveness is constrained by high trade costs that limit the country s capacity to attract foreign direct investment especially for trade oriented firms to overcome these challenges bolivia needs to formulate policies and strategies that are anchored in fostering productive capacities and structural economic transformation according to unctad s analysis such efforts could include targeted policies and programmes to build public sector capabilities in policy formulation and implementation improve trade and transport facilitation and increase private investment the country also needs to develop a modern and dynamic manufacturing sector with higher value added goods and harness its rich biodiversity to produce niche products such as nutraceuticals nutritional and healthy foodstuffs the government in botswana has pursued the beneficiation of diamonds as part of its economic diversification strategy and charted a development path with reduced diamond resource income the strategy seeks to create downstream competencies in the areas of cutting and polishing the manufacture of jewellery diamond trading and ancillary businesses although botswana s economic diversification policies have been relatively successful the country still doesn t have a fully diversified economy unctad s analysis shows that botswana needs to ramp up efforts to diversify into non extractive sectors this would involve bolstering small and medium sized enterprises to enable the country to compete in the global economy unctad s e trade readiness assessments conducted in lldcs have shown non existent or weak legal frameworks for the regulation of online transactions apart from nepal none of the 22 assessed lldcs have adopted a dedicated e commerce strategy the lack of up to date legal frameworks for e commerce affects the ability of lldcs to engage with global business partners attract investors increase the domestic uptake of e commerce in lldcs like in many other developing countries policymakers lawmakers and entrepreneurs are often not fully aware of the complex legal issues regarding e commerce nor about latest global legal developments share this twitter facebook more whatsapp telegram linkedin tumblr pinterest like this like loading

by song kyung jin the global economy is in tatters as uncertainties increase growth in the global economy is expected to be around 3 percent which is the lowest since the 2008 09 financial crisis global trade growth is forecast to plunge to its lowest level of 1 1 percent this year countries with high trade dependency such as korea and germany have the jitters and are bearing more of the brunt of the worsening global economy according to the korea development institute s recent forecast if the tariff threats of the united states and china are translated into action it would take at least 0 34 percentage points off korea s gross domestic product gdp free trade at the forefront of globalization in the rules based world order since world war ii is diving into chaos the significance of free trade agreements obviously goes beyond economics mega trade agreements such as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep are half done and half undone in near coma india a rising power with at least regional hegemonic ambitions opted out of rcep saying that india s economic interests and priorities including agriculture were not addressed there also are hiccups on the security front the u s demand for korea to increase what it pays for the defense alliance fivefold to 5 billion to cover the 27 000 u s troops stationed in korea has triggered anger and worry among many koreans the u s korea japan security alliance is on the cusp of breaking down on disagreements over renewal of the general security of military information agreement gsomia similar confusion and disagreements are taking place between the u s and its european allies over contributions to the north atlantic treaty organization nato the u s led indo pacific strategy and the china led belt and road initiative are in fierce competition for strengthening and expanding alliances toward dominance and hegemony aberrations abound pervasion of mutual distrust mistrust and lack of cooperation and coordination abounds it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out what is driving the world into disarray a striking near absence of the role of global hegemon is lurking behind much of the ills the world is witnessing a hegemonic power is expected to provide global public goods including respect for basic human rights security and peace market efficiency and communication since world war ii the united states whose share of global gdp reached 40 percent at the height of its economic prowess in 1960 has assumed the role defining the rules based world order under which multilateral organizations such as the imf world bank and the world trade organization were created and promoted today the u s however seems more inattentive to that role thinking it is too much of a burden amid growing twin deficits and domestic inequality declining u s interest in global affairs that manifested in the midst and aftermath of the 2008 09 global financial crisis is further accelerating under president donald trump s leadership the u s pulling out of syria and trump s constant threat of pulling u s troops out of korea are clear signs of such inclination meanwhile china is showing its ambition to become a superpower challenging the u s as the sole superpower hence the two nations are in a hegemonic competition unlikely to subside anytime soon if not intensify i recall my first visit to the old summer palace in beijing burned down in 1900 with awe and chills where i could confirm the chinese ambition to return to the middle kingdom restoring the glory of 1820 when it accounted for 33 percent of world gdp with several vassal states can china immersed in the china dream to rejuvenate the nation take over the role of global hegemon from the u s provide global public goods and bring the world back to stability and normalcy china s ambitions are clear my humble view is that china can still wait for its time one fundamental prerequisite for hegemonic power regional or global is the ability to earn recognition and respect from other states if china is to become a hegemonic power it must find ways to reconcile the huge gap between the western system of democracy which focuses on processes and majority rule and the chinese focus on performance and outcome hong kong is where the two value systems have clashed how china handles the hong kong incident will be an obvious litmus test to prove its ability or inability to rise to a hegemonic power in the future it will also be a critical watershed for china whether or not to live up to its top priorities of social stability and economic growth of the strengths of a hegemonic power the most important is economic power even more so in the 21st century nuclear capacity does not make a country a great power without a corresponding or stronger economic capacity china today produces a huge share of global gdp 16 percent but it is only half of what it was at its economic height in 1820 insufficient to provide necessary global public goods to acquire recognition respect and even fear china is known to be more advanced in 5g and artificial intelligence ai propelled by president xi jinping s china dream and made in china 2025 initiative to the point that a u s defense innovation board report admitted that china is leading the building out of the sub 6 infrastructure the china led 5g system in the world this in no sense however means that u s technological supremacy will tarnish and vanish anytime soon the inclinations and capacities of the u s and china have led one too many pundits to offer a bleak prediction of one potential clash after another i suspect that such a possibility is low because the world is ever more deeply interdependent and so are the two giants knowing this and knowing that they have cooperated even on security matters the u s and china will try their best to avoid clashes and find a mutually acceptable solution the road to it will most likely be rocky and contentious because of the sense of self importance and superiority on the part of the two countries and this by no means will be an end to the u s china hegemonic competition for decades we must heed developments in allies and friends as a confrontation might ignite the involvement of the u s and china the korean peninsula that has been highly charged and conflict prone deserves particular attention with close monitoring at normal times and immediate early warning in case of emergency in this time of uncertainties and frenzy middle powers with moderate influence should cooperate to shape the u s china competition to attend to global interests taking full advantage of existing multilateral forums such as the g20 by engaging in the agenda setting process the late visionary lee kuna yew made a chilling remark that korea and japan will inevitably be sucked in by china korea therefore has all the reasons to take the lead in coordinating efforts with other middle powers like australia to maintain independence while keeping close economic ties with china and the u s intact when the global hegemon is missing the pressure for a new painful adjustment is on the rise middle powers under serious stress may make a pragmatic attempt to reorganize the alliance portfolio then the world is set for disarray confusion and conflicts in this case for a long time dr song kyung jin led the institute for global economics ige based in seoul and served as special adviser to the chairman of the presidential committee for the seoul g20 summit in the office of the president now she chairs international cooperation committee the innovative economy forum

4 15pm dec 2 2019 china s manufacturing activity has returned to expansionary territory after six months in the red lifting hopes that the global manufacturing recession has turned around the official purchasing managers index survey released on the weekend found the chinese manufacturing sector advanced to 50 2 in november from 49 3 in october and ahead of market consensus for a result of 49 5 anything below 50 is contractionary the separate caixin survey of chinese manufacturing also came in better than expected at 51 8 for november the increases in the pmi readings provide further evidence that the downside risks to the global economy are diminishing wrote commonwealth bank s foreign exchange strategist kim mundy over the weekend yi gang china s central bank governor declined to pursue a massive stimulatory response to slowing economic growth showing a preference for targeted easing he argued that large scale monetary easing is unlikely to help optimise structural reforms and the world s economic downturn will likely stay for a long time pmi s return to the expansionary zone strengthened the case for a short term growth stabilisation the better pmi readings were in line with the signs shown in the high frequency data such as strong coal consumption by power plants higher operating rate of blast furnaces and record high online sales said citi economist xiangrong yu no matter whether there will be a phase one deal or not the direct effect of the tariff war will likely peak off in coming quarters the policy push for domestic investment has stepped up further and the impact will likely show up in the data ahead citi kept its forecast for 6 1 per cent year on year gdp growth for the fourth quarter slightly up from 6 per cent in the third quarter the new orders component rose to 51 3 up 1 7 points the pmi for the services sector was also positive coming in at 54 4 from 52 8
beijing factory activity in china unexpectedly returned to growth in november for the first time in seven months as domestic demand picked up on beijing s accelerated stimulus measures to steady growth reuters reported but gains were slight and export demand remained sluggish more u s tariffs are looming within weeks and beijing and washington are still haggling over the first phase of a trade deal with china s economic growth cooling to near 30 year lows and industrial profits shrinking speculation is mounting that beijing needs to roll out stimulus more quickly and more aggressively even if it risks adding to a pile of debt the purchasing managers index pmi bounced back to 50 2 in november its highest since march china s national bureau of statistics nbs said on saturday above the 50 point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis the result compared with 49 3 in october a reuters poll showed analysts expected the november pmi to come in at 49 5 the official factory gauge pointed to an improvement in china s vast manufacturing sector last month total new orders bounced back to expansionary territory with the sub index rising to 51 3 the highest level seen since april that indicates domestic consumption firmed up after beijing repeatedly urged local governments to kick stimulus up a gear to meet economic goals before year end factory output also rose to 52 6 in november marking the strongest pace since march in the short term we may have already passed the low point where the economy hit the bottom zhang deli a macro analyst with lianxun securities wrote in a note beijing has front loaded 1 trillion yuan 142 billion of a 2020 local government special bonds quota to this year and has urged that they be issued and used as early as possible to boost infrastructure investment some analysts say that could be a sign that the government is worried about downward economic pressure zhang attributed to the better than expected november pmi to a government push on infrastructure investment less property market control and a de escalation in u s china trade tension in october when both sides said they had substantially reached a phase 1 agreement and the united states delayed a tariff increase scheduled to take place on october 15 but recent developments underscore rising uncertainties in the trade conflict which bodes ill for the outlook for external demand new export orders fell for an 18th straight month in november albeit at a slower pace with the sub index rising to 48 8 from 47 0 in october u s president donald trump said this week that the world s largest economies are close to reaching agreement on the first phase deal but trade experts and people close to the white house said it could slide into the new year given china is pressing for more extensive tariff rollbacks an additional 15 percent in us tariffs are scheduled to take effect on about 156 billion of chinese products on december 15 trump has also highlighted washington s support for protesters in hong kong potentially a huge sore point for china the pmi survey also indicated factories continued to cut jobs in november despite slightly improved business confidence while it signaled a further deterioration in profits for chinese manufacturers with output prices falling into a three month low beijing s drive to guide more bank lending towards small private firms appeared to be working their pmi index recorded the strongest gain in november compared to medium sized and large firms but their performance was still the poorest of the three at 49 4 growth in china s services sector also quickened in november while construction activity held up well but growth in the latter slowed compared to the previous month a separate statistics bureau survey showed

washington india s economic growth slowed further in the third quarter highlighting the depth of downturn afflicting a nation that was only recently reveling in its status as the world s fastest growing large economy gross domestic product gdp increased 4 5 per cent over the period compared with the same three months in 2018 down from the 5 per cent pace in the second quarter official data shows reports the international media it marks the sixth consecutive quarter of easing growth which has seen the rate of expansion tumble from a brisk 8 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018 to a six year low in the three months ending september amid deepening gloom over the country s prospects the deceleration underscores how the crisis in india s shadow banking sector which began with the collapse of major lender il fs last year has rippled through the wider economy as the easy credit that had facilitated a consumer spending boom in the two preceding years ended abruptly what is happening is slow contagion said aurodeep nandi india economist at nomura the pain in the shadow banking industry has spread to other financial entities and it has spread to the real economy including sectors like real estate and small and medium enterprises that in turn has impacted employment opportunities it s a domino effect during the quarter investment sluggish for nearly a decade grew a mere 1 per cent year on year down from 4 per cent in the previous quarter manufacturing output contracted 1 per cent private consumption increased by a higher than expected 5 per cent up from 3 1 per cent in the previous quarter but the biggest impetus to economic growth came from government spending which increased 15 1 per cent the figures which many independent economists have argued may overstate india s true pace of economic growth also point to the magnitude of the challenge now facing prime minister narendra modi s government as it struggles to revive investor and consumer confidence and prevent a further deterioration of economic conditions the reserve bank of india which is due to hold its next monetary policy committee meeting next week has already cut interest rates by 1 35 percentage points in five successive interest rate cuts since february meanwhile modi s government also cut corporate tax rates to their lowest levels in the country s post independence history slashing its basic tax rate from 30 per cent to 22 per cent in an attempt to woo international investors seeking alternatives to china new delhi announced in september that it was slashing corporate tax rates for investments in greenfield manufacturing plant to 15 per cent down from 25 per cent but analysts say the administration has little room for further fiscal stimulus given that it is already likely to overshoot its target of keeping the fiscal deficit to just 3 3 per cent of gross domestic product there are no easy routes out mr nandi said indian officials have argued that the july september period is likely to be the bottom of the downturn and that the economy is set to see a pick up in the current quarter ending december 30 but independent economists are doubtful that india is on the brink of a turnround saying the problems festering in the shadow banking sector are likely to continue to weigh on the country s growth while the government has taken positive steps to address the economic downturn it s not obvious that any of those will bear fruit in the current financial year said saurabh mukherjea chief executive of marcellus investment managers there is a real possibility that you might see even lower gdp growth ahead as the slow motion implosion of the non bank financial companies continues ritika mankar chief economist at mumbai based ambit capital said india s growth is likely to remain sluggish over the next year even if the third quarter marks the low point we are fairly convinced that gdp growth in india is likely to stay low and likely to stay rangebound over the next four to six quarters she said
washington house democrats return to washington on monday facing a difficult choice should they hand president trump a victory in the midst of a heated impeachment battle or walk away from one of the most progressive trade pacts ever negotiated by either party the trump administration agreed with canada and mexico on revisions to the north american free trade agreement one year ago but the deal still needs the approval of congress a handshake agreement with the administration in the coming days would give the democratic caucus a tangible accomplishment on an issue that has animated its base it could also give democrats a chance to lock in long sought policy changes to a trade pact they criticize as prioritizing corporations over workers laying the groundwork for future trade agreements those factors have coaxed democrats to the table at an improbable moment when washington is split by partisan fights and deeply divided over an impeachment inquiry after months of talks including through the thanksgiving break both sides say they re in the final phase of negotiations but democrats insist the administration must make more changes to the labor environmental and other provisions before speaker nancy pelosi of california will bring legislation implementing the new united states mexico canada agreement to a vote by any standard what we ve already negotiated is substantially better than nafta said representative richard e neal of massachusetts who is heading the democratic group negotiating with the administration labor enforcement in my judgment is the last hurdle

doing my regular stock screening i came across amkor technology nasdaq amkr a semiconductor packaging and test services company which trades at nearly insane 57 9x gaap p e and 42 6x forward gaap p e these figures do not match historical averages as in previous years the stock traded at much more reasonable levels except for 2016 when its basic eps approached a 5 year low i proceeded to analysts estimates to check if the stock has such lofty multiples because the street anticipates skyrocketing growth in the near term so analysts prognosis almost perfectly matches an elevated p e as wall street anticipates amkor s earnings to soar 104 in 2020 at the same time pundits are less optimistic regarding its top line growth assuming only low double digit growth next year so they likely expect the company will be able to expand margins optimize opex or interest for instance to stimulate the bottom line however despite bloated p e because of low ltm eps and high earnings growth prospects the stock is ridiculously cheap on the ev ebitda and price net cffo basis which upon cursory inspection looks partly justified considering its minuscule return on total capital of 3 7 after discovering this enigma i delved into its consolidated statements to examine ebitda and compute enterprise value to uncover if gaap earnings yield is distorted by accrued taxes or something so let s take a more in depth look at the firm and its fundamentals the top line put briefly amkor is an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test partner osat while the corporate headquarters is in tempe arizona amkor owns facilities in china japan korea malaysia the philippines portugal and taiwan it also generates the bulk of its pre tax income outside of the u s being responsible for packaging and testing the company has a crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain between wafer manufacturing and original equipment manufacturers communications automotive industrial computing and consumer are its key end markets amkor positions see page 3 of the presentation itself to be 1 osat for automotive integrated circuits the firm s solutions are used in chassis powertrain infotainment etc in this sense it is perfectly prepared to benefit from the automotive industry recuperation after current stasis caused by the trade war the growing market of consumer electronics smartphones and tablets have high amkor content high performance computing the internet of things iot and the 5g revolution are also supportive of sales and profits growth in the medium term it means that the expanding market will secure a resilient demand for amkor s semiconductor packaging solutions since the invention of the first semiconductor package 14 lead ceramic dual in line package dip with two rows of pins in 1965 the technology has evolved dramatically to keep pace with industry developments and remain competitive the company has to pour hefty funds into research development which reduced funds available to shareholders and suppress cash flow for instance in 9m 2019 the firm spent 3 6 of its revenue on r d around 34 of total operating expenses still regular reinvestments in r d are inevitable to bolster long term value creation and cement the future market share cyclicity is an inherent attribute of the semiconductor industry so the share price is volatile as it mirrors the ups and downs of revenue and eps revenue reached the highest level since 2013 on june 30 2018 when the top line equaled 4 390 million since then it has dwindled and dropped to 3 955 million at the moment compared to the previous three years amkor s profit looks lackluster mainly because the 2017 net income was propped up by the u s tax reform data by ycharts in late october 2019 the stock price soared bolstered by eps and revenue beat however it has retreated since then data by ycharts discovering the issue behind bloated p e as i have mentioned above amkr trades at startlingly high gaap p e of 57 9x however in its case ebitda is a much more reliable metric than eps as the company has considerable debt debt equity ratio of 69 and assessing its fair price using enterprise value instead of the market cap makes much more sense so let s take a profound look at its last twelve months earnings before interest tax depreciation amortization first and foremost the company has enormous depreciation which erases a substantial part of gross profit thus operating and profit margins are pronouncedly weak hence depreciation is the main culprit of low eps and lofty p e data by ycharts for instance in fy2018 d a amounted to 571 961 thousand more than 10 of net sales however as d a is a non cash expense we see a large spread between profit and net cffo data by ycharts the issue is that you cannot find d a as a separate line on the income statement as amkr s accountants include it in gross profit in this sense to compute ebitda you should proceed to the consolidated cash flow statement where non cash expenses are detailed see page 7 of form 10 q amkor s ebitda consists of the following items last twelve months depreciation amortization of 540 813 thousand ltm operating income of 190 166 thousand in sum ebitda amounted to 730 979 thousand sometimes analysts add back non cash share based compensation but i do not take it into account sticking to the traditional definition amkor s enterprise value at the same time consists of the market capitalization of 2 96 billion and net debt of 699 2 million including short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt of 103 million long term debt of 1 195 million and 598 8 million in cash cash equivalents and equals 3 659 million source amkor s form 10 q page 4 in sum ltm ev ebitda stands at 5x so while the first thing we see is bloated p e ev ebitda looks more than reasonable another metric that is also worth taking into account ev ebitda less capex which might serve as an alternative of ev levered fcf is also quite low and stands at only 10 7x to check if the low multiple is justified we should take a look at return on total capital but as i have already mentioned depreciation considerably lowers operating income and it seems reasonable to factor in cash based metrics instead of ebit in the nominator of the rotc equation so its cash based rotc net cffo divided by the average total capital or sum of total debt and shareholder equity amounted to 16 3 which i personally consider a solid result free cash flow amkor has a high spread between fcf and net income in the last twelve months the company had gaap net earnings of 50 million while cash surplus left after covering net capex amounted to 131 6 million specifying a 22 5x p fcfe which looks quite low for a semiconductor growth stock a brief peer comparison in my view amkor s closest peers are powertech technology listed on the taiwan stock exchange and the bourse de luxembourg and ase technology holding co asx both companies report results in the new taiwan dollar powertech technology trades at p net cffo of 4 14x while asx has the 5 5x multiple with a 5 6x multiple amkor is priced in line with peers while powertech is slightly underappreciated debt while debt equity stands at 69 with a healthy net debt ebitda ratio of 0 95x amkor is undoubtedly not on shaky ground the coverage of interest payments by cash flow is also not worthy of concern apart from that the firm has no substantial near term maturities see page 20 of the presentation final thoughts in sum upon more in depth inspection amkor does not look overvalued at all as adjusted for depreciation trading multiples are not as not bloated as gaap p e yet in my opinion amkor is not a buy at these levels as insiders have recently disposed of some shares after a vertiginous rally invigorated by eps and revenue beat in october this makes me a bit skeptical regarding the short term gains and raises concerns that the stock price might tumble what is more amkr does not pay a dividend despite being fcf positive making the shares not an attractive pick for income focused investors but for the garp oriented investors amkor might be apt as its peg stands at an attractive 0 6
first a review of last week s events eur usd it looks like the thanksgiving celebration in the us started not in thursday 28 november but as early as on monday 25 the last week of autumn was unusually calm and the volatility did not exceed 40 points until friday driving traders into hibernation positive data on gdp and production in the us were balanced by the growth of the consumer price index cpi in the eurozone and even the controversial law on support for democracy and human rights in hong kong signed by president trump on thursday coupled with a sharp reaction to it from beijing made little impression on the markets recall that our previous forecast said that in the current situation the pair will not be able to break through the support of 1 1000 and after one or two unsuccessful attempts it will turn around and go up that s exactly what happened even the breakthrough at the end of the week to the level of 1 0980 was unsuccessful and the pair soon returned to where it started the five day period to the zone of 1 1015 1 1020 gbp usd in anticipation of the parliamentary elections in the uk since the last decade of october the pair is moving in the side channel 1 2780 1 2980 thanksgiving in the united states only narrowed this channel to the interval 1 2825 1 2950 and the final chord of the week sounded at 1 2935 usd jpy the majority of experts 65 expect that the pair will reach the height of 109 50 within the week this forecast was justified by 100 and even china s threats against the united states because of support for protesters in hong kong did not prevent the growth of the dollar threats remain threats but the trade agreement must be signed as a result the pair rose to the level of 109 66 by friday evening and ended the trading session at the level of 109 44 cryptocurrencies this is the market that unlike forex never sleeps and first a few words about the news background statements and actions of financial mega regulators so representatives of the european central bank did not rule out the release of their own tokens even ecb board member benoit coeuré who previously called bitcoin an evil creation of the financial crisis of 2008 supported the idea of crypto euro south korea went as far as to recognize cryptocurrencies adopting a bill to regulate virtual assets but the central bank of russia has once again shown its negative attitude to alternative financial products agreeing with the proposal to ban all payments with bitcoin and other coins but of course the strongest impact on the market this fall was the news from china recall that the regulator of shanghai has recently decided to liquidate companies engaged in cryptocurrency trading and the regulator of beijing declared the illegality of exchange operations with cryptocurrencies the mega regulator the people s bank of china announced its position on friday november 22 ordering all companies to eliminate any improper practices of working with crypto assets representatives of such an influential force as the communist party of china also support a complete ban on digital currencies as a result investments in bitcoin in china decreased by more than 15 at the end of november in general the cryptocurrency market has shrunk by more than 20 billion over the past week which is almost 10 of its volume but despite this the week in general can be called successful for bitcoin having found a six month bottom at 6 585 on monday november 25 the benchmark cryptocurrency bounced back up resting on a strong level of 7 800 in the period from september 26 to october 22 it made a strong support for the btc usd pair and now there are a lot of chances to turn into an equally strong resistance quotes of top altcoins such as ripple xrp usd ethereum eth usd and litecoin ltc usd generally repeated the movements of the big brother however if compared to friday november 22 bitcoin grew by about 5 altcoins were only able to win back losses returning to their original positions as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of experts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd we would like to hope that with the onset of winter both bears and bulls will not finally go into hibernation moreover these days we are waiting for a number of quite important events this is the speech of the new head of the ecb christine lagarde and the publication of the us business activity data ism in the first half of the week eurozone gdp data on thursday and the us labor market including nfp on friday according to forecasts such an important indicator as the number of new jobs created outside agriculture non farm payrolls nfp can grow in the us by more than 40 from 128k to 183k which may still lead to a breakdown of support 1 1000 at the moment 65 of experts agree that the pair will be able to fall to the 1 0880 1 0925 zone supported by 95 of oscillators and trend indicators on d1 there is another support on the way of the pair to the south 1 0940 the opposite view is shared by only 35 of analysts and graphical analysis on h4 and d1 in their opinion the pair will go north starting from the support of 1 0980 1 1000 the targets are 1 1100 and 1 1175 gbp usd the results of the parliamentary elections and accordingly the future of brexit will be known only in a week and a half after december 12 for now investors are focused on the statements of politicians and for a small part on the macroeconomic indicators of the uk the eu and the us from above the pound is pressured by the decline in the yield of 10 year uk government bonds in relation to similar securities of its competitors from below due to the correlation of the british currency with black gold it is pushed up by an upward trend in the oil market and here it should be borne in mind that the opec summit next week may well extend the limit on carbon production which will lead to a shortage of oil and an increase in its cost especially in the iii and iv quarters of 2020 in general in everything that concerns the pound there is a complete uncertainty so far experts forecasts look similar 40 are for the growth of this currency 40 are for its fall and 20 just shrug so we can assume that the gbp usd pair will continue to move in a sideways channel until the parliamentary elections consolidating in the pivot point zone of 1 2900 usd jpy most investors considered the differences between the us and china concerning human rights in hong kong unimportant in their opinion a trade deal will sooner or later be concluded which will lead to a rise in the dollar including the rise against the yen the growth of the us stock market and the sp500 index according to 85 of experts will push the usd jpy pair up to the landmark level of 110 00 already now taking into account the slippage 110 25 however the pair can then turn to the south and return first to the intersection of the horizontal support and the lower border of the ascending channel around 109 00 and then go down and even lower the next support levels are 108 50 and 107 80 this scenario is fully supported by graphical analysis on h4 and 15 of oscillators on d1 according to which the pair is already in the overbought zone cryptocurrencies bitcoin is still within the downward channel which began on june 26 some experts call the rebound that occurred last week a dead cat jump believing that we will soon see another collapse of the btc usd pair now to the level of 5 000 however according to most analysts the pair will stay within the side corridor of 7 000 8 000 for some time about 40 of experts remain optimistic and hopeful that the upper limit of this corridor will be broken at the same time for example the famous financial analyst joseph young although confident in the long term growth of the cryptocurrency market does not exclude the fall of bitcoin to 3000 4000 martin mcdonagh co founder of investment firm kr1 has expressed a similar opinion now swinging like a pendulum the market tries to know where the bottom is once again he says i think we are in the early stages of a bull market and we will soon see rising highs on the way to new heights he predicts
people shop for vegetables at a market in sao paulo brazil reuters brazil s economy likely expanded by 0 4 in the third quarter according to a reuters survey of economists consolidating a steady if unspectacular pace of growth ahead of an anticipated upswing into the year end falling inflation and low interest rates in the july september period helped support consumer spending and industrial output recovered too but not enough to trigger a faster rate of growth on either a quarterly or annual basis economists say that should come in the fourth quarter when the effects of record low interest rates and the boost to investor and business sentiment from congress passing a landmark pension reform bill in october are likely to be felt more the median estimate from 19 economists for the july september quarter is for a 0 4 rate of expansion compared with the second three months of the year unchanged from q2 their estimates ranged from 0 2 to 1 0 growth the median estimate from 18 economists for year on year growth was 1 0 also the same as the year ago quarter with a range of between 0 8 and 2 5 we expect another gradual gdp expansion economists at citi wrote in a note to clients noting that domestic demand and investment should continue to support growth at this point we maintain our 0 7 and 1 8 growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 but see risks of upgrading our estimate for this year conditioned on the 3q gdp release they added the government last week raised its 2020 growth forecast to 2 3 from 2 2 and many private sector economists also see the economy accelerating into next year since the middle of this year the central bank has slashed its benchmark selic rate by 150 basis points to a new all time low of 5 00 and indicated clearly it will cut another 50 bps to 4 50 later in december coupled with inflation at just 2 54 well below the central bank s target for this year of 4 25 consumers are more willing to borrow and spend and are seeing real incomes grow but only gradually on the external side however brazil s trade surplus has been steadily deteriorating this year as exports to argentina have collapsed and continued uncertainty surrounding the us china trade wars has sapped global demand for brazilian goods brazil s july september trade surplus was just under 8 billion the smallest quarterly surplus since the first quarter of 2016 all else being equal this will trim gdp growth at the margins brazil s public finances improved in october treasury figures showed as a seasonally expected monthly surplus helped reduce the government s overall deficit this year and keep it on track to come in below target still the 8 7 billion reais 2 05 billion primary budget surplus in october was less than economists had expected and social security spending continued to rise highlighting the underlying strains on the public accounts the central government s primary budget surplus in october was less than the 10 7 billion reais surplus median forecast in a reuters poll and 11 0 smaller than the 9 5 billion reais surplus posted in the same month last year october tends to be a surplus month thanks to the inflow of oil related funds and corporate and income tax intakes the year to date primary deficit before interest payments are taken into account narrowed to 63 85 billion reais 14 8 less in real terms compared with the first ten months of last year treasury said in the 12 months to october the primary deficit stood at 113 1 billion reais or 1 1 of gross domestic product down from 1 3 of gdp a year ago the government s 2019 target is for a deficit of 139 billion reais but social security spending rose 8 0 on the same month a year ago to 14 6 billion reais that swelled the accumulated social security deficit so far this year to 179 9 billion reais some 3 wider than a year ago treasury figures showed brazilian equities are expected to shine amid a fog of political and economic uncertainty in latin america next year outperforming regional peers due to record low interest rates and a pending lineup of market friendly economic reforms the latest reuters quarterly poll shows brazil s benchmark bovespa stock index extending this year s rally to end 2020 at 130 000 points according to the median of 18 forecasts from traders brokers and economists that is unchanged from the august survey but higher than 125 000 predicted in may when a radical overhaul of brazil s costly social security system still hung in the balance reuters

washington india s economic growth slowed further in the third quarter highlighting the depth of downturn afflicting a nation that was only recently reveling in its status as the world s fastest growing large economy the gross domestic product gdp increased 4 5 per cent over the period compared with the same three months in 2018 down from the 5 per cent pace in the second quarter official data shows reports the international media it marks the sixth consecutive quarter of easing growth which has seen the rate of expansion tumble from a brisk 8 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018 to a six year low in the three months ending september amid deepening gloom over the country s prospects the deceleration underscores how the crisis in india s shadow banking sector which began with the collapse of major lender il fs last year has rippled through the wider economy as the easy credit that had facilitated a consumer spending boom in the two preceding years ended abruptly what is happening is slow contagion said aurodeep nandi india economist at nomura the pain in the shadow banking industry has spread to other financial entities and it has spread to the real economy including sectors like real estate and small and medium enterprises that in turn has impacted employment opportunities it s a domino effect during the quarter investment sluggish for nearly a decade grew a mere 1 per cent year on year down from 4 per cent in the previous quarter manufacturing output contracted 1 per cent private consumption increased by a higher than expected 5 per cent up from 3 1 per cent in the previous quarter but the biggest impetus to economic growth came from government spending which increased 15 1 per cent the figures which many independent economists have argued may overstate india s true pace of economic growth also point to the magnitude of the challenge now facing prime minister narendra modi s government as it struggles to revive investor and consumer confidence and prevent a further deterioration of economic conditions the reserve bank of india which is due to hold its next monetary policy committee meeting next week has already cut interest rates by 1 35 percentage points in five successive interest rate cuts since february meanwhile modi s government also cut corporate tax rates to their lowest levels in the country s post independence history slashing its basic tax rate from 30 per cent to 22 per cent in an attempt to woo international investors seeking alternatives to china new delhi announced in september that it was slashing corporate tax rates for investments in greenfield manufacturing plant to 15 per cent down from 25 per cent but analysts say the administration has little room for further fiscal stimulus given that it is already likely to overshoot its target of keeping the fiscal deficit to just 3 3 per cent of gross domestic product there are no easy routes out mr nandi said indian officials have argued that the july september period is likely to be the bottom of the downturn and that the economy is set to see a pick up in the current quarter ending december 30 but independent economists are doubtful that india is on the brink of a turnround saying the problems festering in the shadow banking sector are likely to continue to weigh on the country s growth while the government has taken positive steps to address the economic downturn it s not obvious that any of those will bear fruit in the current financial year said saurabh mukherjea chief executive of marcellus investment managers there is a real possibility that you might see even lower gdp growth ahead as the slow motion implosion of the non bank financial companies continues ritika mankar chief economist at mumbai based ambit capital said india s growth is likely to remain sluggish over the next year even if the third quarter marks the low point we are fairly convinced that gdp growth in india is likely to stay low and likely to stay range bound over the next four to six quarters she said

st paul in 2011 as part of the deal to end a state government shutdown minnesota lawmakers eliminated a little used matching grant that helped low and moderate income families save for college six years later the legislature enacted a new set of college savings incentives that are among the most generous in the nation and which overwhelmingly benefit the affluent at an annual cost to the state of about 10 million the incentives promote investing in a 529 plan a federally authorized investment vehicle that allows families to grow their college savings accounts tax free still unknown to most americans 529s largely benefit the wealthy because they re the ones with substantial money to save for college and because investment income is taxed differently from earned income for federal income tax purposes a 529 plan doesn t benefit a married couple making less than about 100 000 because they can invest for their kid s education tax free in a regular brokerage account the brookings institution a nonpartisan think tank called 529s a handout to the affluent and a strong contender for the prize of most absurd tax break of all state tax incentives like the ones minnesota passed in 2017 are similarly wasteful and regressive according to their 2017 report a tax break for dream hoarders although minnesota s 529 plan tax incentives can help lower income people who don t benefit from the federal tax provisions those families aren t taking advantage the way higher earners are according to tax data the minnesota department of revenue provided to the pioneer press in 2017 the first year the state s college savings incentives were in effect minnesota tax filers with adjusted gross incomes over 100 000 were 46 times as likely as those making under 50 000 to claim a state tax benefit for contributing to a 529 plan those same high earners were five times as likely to claim a 529 plan tax break compared with filers making 50 000 to 100 000 put another way 79 percent of all claims for a 529 plan tax break came from the 22 percent of minnesota tax filers who have adjusted gross incomes over 100 000 great success whether that s a problem or not depends on who you ask this has been a great success story said rep greg davids r preston who sponsored the 2017 bill and reviewed the tax data at the newspaper s request davids who works as a financial planner said college costs are too high and he wants to reward families for taking the initiative to save up i think we should help these folks he said my intention was to be very aggressive on this senate tax committee chairman roger chamberlain r lino lakes said that at 10 million a year less than one thousandth of the state s income tax revenue it s not a big deal that the 529 incentives mainly help high earners and he notes the government already does plenty for low income students minnesota ranks 11th in the nation in total need based aid it awards to college students in 2018 the state handed out 194 million in state grants intended for students struggling to pay for college although 7 million of that went to students from families making over 100 000 the federal pell grant in 2018 delivered minnesota students another 425 million chamberlain points to the so called doughnut hole of middle income families who can t write a check to pay for college but who qualify for little to no financial aid we re just trying to provide something for those folks in that gap he said missed the mark a survey by sallie mae and ipsos found that among high income people half of what they were saving for college was locked away in either a 529 or a similar vehicle that was designed specifically for college savings that was true of just 9 percent of the dollars low income people had saved for college the state s 2017 tax breaks aimed to change that said sen greg clausen dfl apple valley he tried for years to enact state income tax incentives for 529 contributions before carrying the successful 2017 legislation in the senate the goal was to put 529 types of investment options in reach for more income levels not just for the rich he said clausen acknowledges the law missed the mark i think it s something to look at definitely he said the statistics on it are rather interesting the minnesota department of revenue too was surprised by how the tax breaks have skewed toward high earners the department estimated the nonrefundable tax credit available to low and middle income filers but not those at the very bottom who pay no taxes would cost the state 7 5 million in 2017 18 they figured the tax subtraction available to all filers but especially advantageous for high earners was estimated to cost 2 5 million in fact the tax credit that year cost 5 4 million and the subtraction around 4 4 million rep laurie pryor dfl minnetonka vice chair of the higher education finance committee said the incentives aren t working as intended the idea is to help make college affordable and if we re not reaching that group that needs the help then it s something that we need to take a look at she said how it works here s how the 529 plan and tax incentives work 529 plans are authorized by the federal government but operated by states which offer varying fees and options for investing in stocks bonds and the like as long as the money is spent on college related costs the earnings are not taxed earnings not spent on higher education are taxed as income plus a 10 percent penalty congress in 2017 made k 12 private school tuition an eligible expenditure for the 529 plan s federal income tax breaks but minnesota still restricts its incentives to higher education spending minnesota is one of seven states that allow their residents to claim a state income tax incentive whether they contribute to the home state plan or a different 529 the incentives aren t restricted to family members any minnesota resident can claim a tax incentive for contributing to a 529 plan for another person s benefit at tax time filers choose between a tax credit or a tax subtraction the maximum benefit minnesota offers is a 500 nonrefundable tax credit to get the full amount a tax filer must contribute at least 1 000 to a 529 plan while reporting adjusted gross income of no more than 75 000 the tax credit s value shrinks for higher earners very low earners who don t pay income tax do not qualify because the credit is nonrefundable the average filer s 529 plan tax credit in 2017 was worth 271 in the alternative tax filers can claim a tax deduction or subtraction which reduces their taxable income there is no limit on a filer s income for the subtraction the state s highest earners can reduce their tax liability by 295 50 for making 3 000 in contributions to a 529 the average 2017 tax subtraction was worth roughly 162 according to a department of revenue estimate clausen said he had tried to make the tax credit refundable so that very low income families could benefit he d also support an income ceiling for the incentives saying he can t explain why the tax subtraction didn t include one in the first place eleven states offer subsidies to low income families who invest in a 529 plan according to the brookings report however as minnesota learned with its defunct matching grants few families take advantage the 529 plan grants the legislature eliminated in 2011 offered a 15 percent match on contributions for families with adjusted gross incomes under 50 000 and a 10 percent match for incomes up to 80 000 the matching grant was capped at 400 in 2006 minnesota budgeted 1 million for the matching grants it awarded just 245 000 advertisement bipartisan support despite their inherent inequities 529 plan incentives have proved politically resilient the federal income tax free provision was signed into law by president george w bush in 2001 the same year minnesota s 529 plan began operating when president barack obama proposed repealing the 529 plan law in 2015 he quickly retreated amid backlash from both republican and democratic leaders worried about angering the upper middle class states eagerly have encouraged their residents to contribute to 529 plans at the time the brookings report was published in 2017 there were 33 states offering their own income tax incentives besides highlighting the 529 s regressive nature the brookings report raised doubts about whether the plans actually meet the goal of getting families to save more for college because there is no requirement that the funds be newly invested a well off parent could simply transfer funds into a 529 plan from other vehicles such as regular brokerages or iras in order to take advantage of their state s tax breaks modest increase it s hard to tell what impact the 2017 incentives actually have had on college savings but there s been a modest increase in contributions to the state s 529 plan in 2016 the year before the tax incentives were written into law the state run 529 plan opened 4 407 new accounts the number of new accounts opened in 2017 was 5 643 and 7 199 a year later total dollars contributed to the state plan grew by 6 percent and 9 percent with the incentives in place after 3 percent increases the two previous years that doesn t capture the entire picture however as minnesotans who invest in other states plans can cash in on the state tax incentives on the other hand it s likely some families made their contributions with funds from other types of accounts they already had pegged for college a minnesota resident who pays attention to tax laws can get up to 500 from the state each year without actually setting additional money aside for college it s also possible some of the increased contributions could be related to congress making k 12 private school tuition eligible for 529 plan spending even though the state did not
there are passionate debates concerning the problems and solutions of housing unaffordability many people want to blame greedy developers speculators wealthy foreigners short term rentals the tech industry or the rich for rising urban housing prices these certainly do increase housing prices and displacement but only if moderate priced infill development is constrained it is therefore equally accurate to blame rising housing prices on public policies that discourage moderate priced infill development such as restrictions on compact and affordable housing types inclusivity requirements minimum parking requirements development impact fees complex project approval requirements and heritage preservation rules these policies favor expensive housing over cheaper infill housing preventing the market from delivering moderate priced housing that serves middle income households now and becomes the affordable housing stock of the future an efficient and equitable land market responds to changing demands if the number of people who want to live in an area increases by say 30 allowable densities should increase by that amount locking in lower densities excludes some potential residents particularly moderate income households that don t quality for subsidized housing but are outbid by wealthier households for scarce market housing by reforming these policies we can have it all neighborhoods with more low medium and high income households living together this is important because mixed income infill provides many economic social and environmental benefits this is a timely issue for example our city victoria british columbia is considering whether to approve the cook street plaza a mixed use development that will provide 113 housing units priced 10 below market rates due to provincial tax incentives a city councilor who claims to be an affordable housing advocate recently told me that even at the reduced price he considers these units expensive and therefore not worth his support cook street plaza this is i believe the wrong way to evaluate affordability impacts we should recognize indirect and long term effects and the important role that moderate priced housing plays in overall affordability what do i mean by moderate priced it is housing that is affordable to middle income households and therefore the types of houses that families often move up to from lower priced units for example if 500 1 500 per month rent or mortgage is considered affordable then 1 500 3 000 per month housing is moderate moderate priced housing increases affordability in three ways by providing more affordable housing for moderate income households many of whom pay more than is considered affordable or are forced to choose cheaper urban fringe housing that has high transportation costs through filtering as some households move from their existing lower priced housing in the new units which frees up the lower priced units they occupy as the new housing depreciates in value adding to future lower price housing supply increasing moderate priced housing supply tends to accelerate depreciation rates where moderate priced housing development lags population growth older homes will only depreciate about 1 annually so after a decade a 500 000 unit will sell for 450 000 but if the rate of development meets or exceeds population growth housing can depreciate at 3 annual so the same house will sell for a much more affordable 350 000 as a result a new development s affordability impacts should be evaluated based not only on its initial prices but also on its effects on the prices of other homes what daniel herriges describes as an ecological model of housing markets most lower and moderate income households occupy older homes older home prices are affected by overall housing supply building new moderate priced housing drives down prices now by freeing up lower priced units and even more over the long run as the new units depreciate and add to the stock of older lower priced housing the current shortage of lower priced housing results in part from development policies that discouraged construction of compact moderate priced housing such as basic townhouses and apartments during the last few decades there is good research on these effects as discussed in daniel herriges the connectedness of our housing ecosystem stuart rosenthal s study are private markets and filtering a viable source of low income housing estimates from a repeat income model published in the american economic review miriam zuk and karen chapple s study housing production filtering and displacement untangling the relationships and my planetizen column how filtering increases housing affordability a recent study by economist evan mast found that building market price apartments causes a kind of housing musical chairs as households move into new units they study indicates that every 100 new market rate units frees up on average 45 70 below median moderately affordable and 17 39 bottom quintile very affordable housing units since his study included higher priced apartments the affordability benefits are probably higher for moderate priced units this suggests that the cook street plaza s 113 moderate priced units will free up at least 50 80 existing homes for new households including 20 40 affordable units in addition to the direct benefits to the households that move into the building in this way the cook street plaza project is equivalent to building 20 40 affordable housing units unfortunately this effect is virtually invisible there is no media event when lower income households are able to move into the vacated older units although the research is solid it requires an act of faith to believe that increasing moderate priced housing supply will benefit low as well as moderate income families because of its location the cook street plaza condominiums are actually more affordable and beneficial than conventional analysis recognizes as discussed in my previous column selling smart growth because it is in a walkable urban neighborhood residents can reduce their transportation expenses reducing one car going from two to one or one to zero typically saves a about 5 000 annually if these savings are used to purchase a more valuable home a typical household will gain about 65 000 in additional equity compared with a cheaper suburban house with higher vehicle expenses recent research shows that residents of more walkable communities have lower housing foreclosure rates indicating better economic resilience because they avoid the large financial risks associated with automobile dependency for example when a car breaks down or crashes living in a more central location also improves health and traffic safety and reduces the traffic congestion road and parking infrastructure costs accident risk and pollution emissions that household imposes on other road users many policies involve trade offs between low and moderate priced housing development for example inclusivity regulations which require developers to subsidize a portion of housing units might provide a small number of low priced units but generally reduce development of a larger number of moderate priced units since those are the least profitable and therefore the first to be eliminated as discussed in my column what the market can bear defining limits to inclusive housing requirement in a typical example increasing inclusivity requirements from 10 to 30 adds 115 low priced units but reduces total housing production by 300 units mast s research indicates that this will prevent 108 210 moderate priced units from becoming available through filtering as households move into the new units including 40 117 low priced units there are similar trade offs between preserving old lower priced housing or allowing their replacement by larger moderate priced developments for example in our community the 34 unit beacon arms apartment is being replaced with a new 87 unit building the 53 additional units should free up between 23 37 units through filtering this suggests that overall affordability efficiency safety and disability access can increase if old rental homes and apartment buildings are replaced by larger moderate priced buildings that incorporate modern construction standards anti demolition policies that preserve older building stock may harm disadvantaged residents overall to encourage moderate price infill development communities need policies that encourage compact housing types often called the missing middle such as townhouses and low rise apartments since they tend to have the lowest land construction and future operating costs compared with a single family house a townhouse is generally 30 cheaper and a low rise apartment 50 cheaper to build and heat than a comparable size and quality single family house with even greater savings if parking is unbundled so residents are not forced to pay for costly parking spaces they don t need people often criticize developers for only building expensive housing but that is the unavoidable result of current development policies that limit compact infill many development regulations and fees are particularly burdensome to smaller and lower priced infill projects for example a 50 000 underground parking space only adds 5 to the cost of a million dollar apartment and many affluent households would choose it regardless even if it is optional but would add 20 to the cost of a 250 000 apartment making it unprofitable and unaffordable similarly 500 000 expenses for development impact studies and project approval requirements only adds 5 000 to the cost of a 100 unit project but 50 000 to a ten unit project the following policies can support moderate priced infill housing development increase allowable densities in residential neighborhoods this reduces infill development costs increasing moderate priced project feasibility this reduces infill development costs increasing moderate priced project feasibility allow an additional story for corner lots larger lots at least 1 000 square meters and on busier streets arterials or sub arterials these locations minimize negative impacts on neighbours these locations minimize negative impacts on neighbours exempt or significantly reduce inclusivity mandates development impact fees parking minimums and project approval requirements for moderate priced housing many communities provide such exemptions and reductions to special social housing projects but not moderate priced housing this is important because such costs are particularly burdensome to smaller and moderate priced developments many communities provide such exemptions and reductions to special social housing projects but not moderate priced housing this is important because such costs are particularly burdensome to smaller and moderate priced developments reduce or eliminate parking requirements and require or encourage unbundling parking rented separately from housing units so residents are not forced to pay for parking spaces they do not need so residents are not forced to pay for parking spaces they do not need mandate or reward energy efficient housing and support efficiency retrofits of existing homes building energy is a major financial cost and source of emissions so improving efficiency helps achieve affordability and environmental goals building energy is a major financial cost and source of emissions so improving efficiency helps achieve affordability and environmental goals improve affordable housing design municipal governments can support contests planning charrettes and workshops to encourage better design the affordable housing design advisor the missing middle website and portland s infill design project provide resources for improving lower priced housing design politically these policies can be considered to represent the radical center in most north american communities nimby not in my backyard is dominant using rhetoric borrowed from socialism increasing density just benefits rich developers environmentalism we must protect our trees and tribalism apartments attract undesirables this attitude prevents moderate priced infill in most residential neighborhoods relegating such housing to old industrial sites and busy roadways however these arguments are generally wrong moderate priced infill benefits low and middle income households reduces habitat displacement and may eventually be occupied by current neighborhood residents when they want to downsize from their single family homes and being challenged by a new generation of yimby yes in my backyard activists activists in my community now use the term ghimby good housing in my backyard recognizing that good design interesting building details privacy protection suitable landscaping policies to minimize vehicle traffic and parking conflicts etc can overcome many objections to infill no single policy can solve all housing problems but it is important to understand housing market dynamics in order to identify truly effective solutions those often involve supporting moderate priced housing that does not require subsidies but should not be burdened by unnecessary regulations fees or approval requirements what do we want more moderate priced infill housing when do we need it now

washington house democrats return to washington on monday facing a difficult choice should they hand president trump a victory in the midst of a heated impeachment battle or walk away from one of the most progressive trade pacts ever negotiated by either party the trump administration agreed with canada and mexico on revisions to the north american free trade agreement one year ago but the deal still needs the approval of congress a handshake agreement with the administration in the coming days would give the democratic caucus a tangible accomplishment on an issue that has animated its base it could also give democrats a chance to lock in long sought policy changes to a trade pact they criticize as prioritizing corporations over workers laying the groundwork for future trade agreements those factors have coaxed democrats to the table at an improbable moment when washington is split by partisan fights and deeply divided over an impeachment inquiry after months of talks including through the thanksgiving break both sides say they re in the final phase of negotiations but democrats insist the administration must make more changes to the labor environmental and other provisions before speaker nancy pelosi of california will bring legislation implementing the new united states mexico canada agreement to a vote by any standard what we ve already negotiated is substantially better than nafta said representative richard e neal of massachusetts who is heading the democratic group negotiating with the administration labor enforcement in my judgment is the last hurdle

for more than a month chile has been engulfed in protests and violence and the end is not in sight the unrest is typically attributed to income inequality caused by excessive free markets that diagnosis is wrong and will induce a response that will make matters worse the facts are inconsistent with the excessive free market narrative reported in the international press chile has been governed by left leaning presidents two of them socialists for 23 of the past 29 years less than 10 percent of chileans live in poverty today compared to almost 50 percent in the early 1990s chilean income inequality has been falling for the past 20 years and is now at a historical low there is a gap in chile but it is not between the haves and the have nots it is between the promises of governments over the past two decades the resulting expectations of chile s new middle class and the capacity of the chilean economy and government to actually deliver on them since the election of 1999 every presidential candidate left or right promised that chileans would reach the standard of living of a european country with its attendant welfare state within a perennially moving next decade the promise always verged on false advertising tripling per capita gdp to western european levels and building their social infrastructures would have been a herculean task even under ideal circumstances the circumstances of the chilean economy were however far from ideal total factor productivity tfp the amount of additional economic output that is not accounted for by additional labor and capital has fallen almost every year since 2005 and tfp today is at the same level as in 1999 chileans could believe the promises of politicians because they mistook a copper boom for a permanent acceleration in the growth of wages government spending and gdp chile is the world s leading exporter of copper accounting for one quarter of world output and copper prices climbed seven fold 1999 to 2011 since 2011 they have gradually fallen such that they are currently 40 percent below their 2011 peak chileans are now confronted by the gap between the promises of politicians and the dismal performance of their economy underneath that dismal performance is the overregulation of the private economy by a ponderous government chilean businesses must obtain endless permits one by one from a long list of uncoordinated government agencies a large project must navigate the maze for five to 10 years in order to get regulatory approval and then even after obtaining it may still be rejected by a discretionary political decision or a judicial ruling about a small procedural point california style urban growth restrictions raise the cost of housing and also drive up the ground rents that any retailer must factor into the prices charged to consumers the tax code is a nightmare in 2014 the government introduced a sweeping reform to tax a corporation s retained profits according to the marginal tax rates of each of its shareholders it proved completely unworkable but the solution was to replace it with a complicated system in which firms choose among two methods of taxation that accountants still struggle to understand at the same time chilean governments and politicians have ignored their core task public services eighty percent of chileans receive medical care from a public health system whose bureaucratic organization has not changed in three decades and delivers staggeringly long wait times when the first cohort of the government mandated private pension system essentially a compulsory 401k plan introduced for all new workers in 1980 began to retire in 2015 they found that their monthly pension benefits were about one third of their last salary the problem which has been known for decades is that rigid labor laws make hiring expensive such that at any one time roughly one third of the labor force works in low paid self employment or in off the books jobs in small informal firms that stay small to elude regulations and labor law these workers do not receive a paycheck from which contributions can be deducted and so every worker contributes to the pension system for only 20 years on average public education is of abysmal quality many chilean children fail to learn to read and write competently the government s response was a 2015 reform among whose features was the requirement that private schools that accepted per pupil public subsidies the chilean version of an education voucher had to purchase the real estate where they operated the cruel cynicism of this law cannot be understated school choice was essentially restricted to high income households the schools educating middle and low income children were forced to buy real estate made expensive by restrictions on urban growth or close their doors small wonder that people are protesting in the streets alas the misdiagnosis of what ails chile has caused most everyone international pundits and middle class chileans alike to push for more regulation weaker property rights higher taxes and increased government spending that will not enlarge economic surplus by incentivizing the private investment necessary for productivity and income growth necessary for redistribution those hoping for a better life for chile s fledging middle class will be disappointed

washington india s economic growth slowed further in the third quarter highlighting the depth of downturn afflicting a nation that was only recently reveling in its status as the world s fastest growing large economy gross domestic product gdp increased 4 5 per cent over the period compared with the same three months in 2018 down from the 5 per cent pace in the second quarter official data shows reports the international media it marks the sixth consecutive quarter of easing growth which has seen the rate of expansion tumble from a brisk 8 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018 to a six year low in the three months ending september amid deepening gloom over the country s prospects the deceleration underscores how the crisis in india s shadow banking sector which began with the collapse of major lender il fs last year has rippled through the wider economy as the easy credit that had facilitated a consumer spending boom in the two preceding years ended abruptly what is happening is slow contagion said aurodeep nandi india economist at nomura the pain in the shadow banking industry has spread to other financial entities and it has spread to the real economy including sectors like real estate and small and medium enterprises that in turn has impacted employment opportunities it s a domino effect during the quarter investment sluggish for nearly a decade grew a mere 1 per cent year on year down from 4 per cent in the previous quarter manufacturing output contracted 1 per cent private consumption increased by a higher than expected 5 per cent up from 3 1 per cent in the previous quarter but the biggest impetus to economic growth came from government spending which increased 15 1 per cent the figures which many independent economists have argued may overstate india s true pace of economic growth also point to the magnitude of the challenge now facing prime minister narendra modi s government as it struggles to revive investor and consumer confidence and prevent a further deterioration of economic conditions the reserve bank of india which is due to hold its next monetary policy committee meeting next week has already cut interest rates by 1 35 percentage points in five successive interest rate cuts since february meanwhile modi s government also cut corporate tax rates to their lowest levels in the country s post independence history slashing its basic tax rate from 30 per cent to 22 per cent in an attempt to woo international investors seeking alternatives to china new delhi announced in september that it was slashing corporate tax rates for investments in greenfield manufacturing plant to 15 per cent down from 25 per cent but analysts say the administration has little room for further fiscal stimulus given that it is already likely to overshoot its target of keeping the fiscal deficit to just 3 3 per cent of gross domestic product there are no easy routes out mr nandi said indian officials have argued that the july september period is likely to be the bottom of the downturn and that the economy is set to see a pick up in the current quarter ending december 30 but independent economists are doubtful that india is on the brink of a turnround saying the problems festering in the shadow banking sector are likely to continue to weigh on the country s growth while the government has taken positive steps to address the economic downturn it s not obvious that any of those will bear fruit in the current financial year said saurabh mukherjea chief executive of marcellus investment managers there is a real possibility that you might see even lower gdp growth ahead as the slow motion implosion of the non bank financial companies continues ritika mankar chief economist at mumbai based ambit capital said india s growth is likely to remain sluggish over the next year even if the third quarter marks the low point we are fairly convinced that gdp growth in india is likely to stay low and likely to stay rangebound over the next four to six quarters she said
the give and take between market participants and regulators over libor replacement is suddenly pointed the us regulators have nominated the secured overnight financing rate sofr to replace libor while at first sofr seemed to be a suggestion lately the regulators are more insistent despite concerns expressed by smaller banks in the united states that writing sofr indexed credit will be less profitable for banks than libor indexed credit resulting in lower loan supply discussed here the regulators plan to calculate backward looking three month sofr term indexes will work just fine for the banks if a risk adjustment is added to the sofr index sofr will reduce the interest rate risk of bank cash operations compared to libor at the cost of slightly greater credit risk and a decline in loan demand however the survival of the enormous eurodollar futures and libor based interest rate swaps markets depends fundamentally on the existence of a forward looking liquid three month term market backward looking three month indexes manufactured from overnight rates like sofr won t suffice to save these hedging instruments these derivatives success depends fundamentally on hedgers ability to tie up the cost of money in advance to do so they need a forward looking term rate like libor without a liquid source of term funds libor s derivatives won t be successfully replaced regulators increase the pressure to use sofr in derivatives trading the financial stability board fsb said on tuesday november 19th in a letter to the global derivatives industry representative body the international swaps and derivatives association isda that derivatives market participants should insert a pre cessation trigger into terms for derivatives contracts that still reference only libor today specifically the agency asked isda to â include a pre cessation trigger â as standard language in the definitions for new derivatives and in a single protocol without embedded optionality for outstanding derivative contracts â what what does â a pre cessation trigger â without embedded optionalityâ mean this awkward phrase means that derivatives market participants will have no discretion if the regulators decide that libor is â no longer safeâ to use market participants must switch to sofr no matter whether ice benchmark administration continues to provide daily libor values or not moreover â in case a determination of non representative is made by fca market participants should expect to see their cleared derivatives move from libor to the risk free rates identified by the national working groups for each libor currency â this in us dollar based markets would mean a change from libor to sofr is the die cast why do regulators push sofr are the regulators concerned that multiple fallback rates other than sofr will lead to systemic risk possibly that would be a mission consistent objective for fsb alternatively it might be that regulators want to prevent the division of the banking system into two parts using different indexes the large banks and the agencies funded primarily by treasury collateralized or implicitly government protected credit the others funded by unsecured debt the two ways libor replacement might be resolved there are two potential outcomes of the tiff over libor two ways the banks and their regulators could agree on libor replacement libor dies if regulators make a non representative determination all dollar denominated debt instruments and derivatives using libor will switch to sofr using an industry standard method that adjusts the sofr based index yield upward to reflect liborâ s uncollateralized status libor lives if the panel banks that produce libor decide it is in their interest to continue to produce daily estimates of libor a second outcome is possible despite fcaâ s release of the panel banks from the obligation to submit libor estimates and despite the regulatorsâ new plan to designate libor non representative regulators might then bow to the industryâ s request and find libor is representative users could choose either libor or sofr and later other indexes the most likely outcome is that libor ends the regulators will not find libor to be representative of costs unless the panel banks that estimate libor ask them to since the panel banks objected to libor in the first place libor seems doomed unless preserving eurodollar futures and libor based interest rate swaps matters enough to the panel banks that estimate libor to change their minds the switch to sofr is unappealing to interest rates swaps traders as well the complexity of the daily valuation of sofr based interest rate swaps boggles the mind sofr replacement will reduce interest rate swap market liquidity too what is different if sofr replaces libor there is an apparent consensus that two once and for all adjustments will best resolve the issues created by the change to sofr the first adjustment is the averaging or compounding of overnight rates to convert three months of consecutive overnight rates to a single three month term rate the second adjustment is to add an increment to treasury collateralized sofr for the greater risk associated with unsecured lending in arrears term rates three month index construction will average end of month overnight sofr with overnight rates from the previous three months describing the history of the overnight rate sofr is about the past instead of the marketâ s expectation of the future values of short term rates as captured by libor the cost of collateralized three month money will thus necessarily be unknown until after borrowing by market participants during each three month period for a much expanded description of the in arrears calculation of term rates from overnight rates read this this backward looking method sounds more problematic than it is it won t have a significant negative effect on financial institution interest rate risks in fact banks interest rate risk will be less once the adjustment for collateral effects is made the problems will be in derivatives markets why sofr based derivatives won t support hedgers the basis for the success of derivatives the important difference between in arrears and in advance rate determination is this in advance rates like libor are useful to hedgers with risky real operations hedgers try to take the risk out of the funding side of their operations at the beginning of the period since the real risks of the operating side cannot be eliminated in advance in other words hedgers want to gain from astute management of operating risks they understand avoiding financial risks they don t understand libor lets them do that backward looking indexes like sofr don t instead in arrears interest determination benefits parties that match daily accrued interest income to interest costs of overnight borrowing the use of a backward looking index assures that earnings from indexed loans cover the actual cost of money interest rate risk of indexed loans will be reduced for lenders once a risk adjustment is added if the source of bank funding is overnight money risk adjustment treasury collateralized overnight repurchase agreement rates inadequately capture variation in the cost of bank debt used to finance index based bank loans during periods where systemic risk is affecting rates more than usual at such times a flight to quality will cause collateralized yields to move relatively lower than uncollateralized yields this might push earnings on sofr index based loans below levels necessary for the banks to continue to profitably write index based credit to prevent losses due to changing risk premiums the fed or ice will likely estimate a backward looking risk adjustment for the index period at the time the sofr index is set that will assure healthy net interest margins for financial institutions the cost of looking backward will be surprises to borrowers resulting in greater credit risk to lenders and lower loan demand again the end of period adjustment for risk affects borrowers hedgers and lenders differently if the risk adjustment is calculated in advance the method permits hedgers to choose projects by comparing the known cost of risk embedded in the forward looking rate to their estimated real cost of risk in each cash market project they want to fund lenders on the other hand would prefer backward estimated risk adjustment since it assures their earnings on risky loans are adjusted by the same risk factor that the market has charged them for uncollateralized overnight funding over the previous period what are the unintended effects of sofr only effect on credit markets if most us dollar based loans are indexed by sofr the large banks have a leg up in the competition for customers with smaller banks basis risk the risk that the costs of funding a bank diverge from the earnings of bank assets would be borne primarily by smaller banks funded by uncollateralized liabilities thus the ultimate result of sofr only is that smaller banks will be at a disadvantage to their larger brethren losing the competition either gradually because the higher cost of managing basis risk for smaller banks makes them less competitive than the large banks or suddenly when a liquidity crisis forces the regulators to merge some smaller banks with larger banks effect on derivatives markets the trading volume of three month sofr futures will be a weak reflection of the current volume of eurodollar futures listed by cme group cme sofr futures like the regulator s term sofr rates are settled three months after the contract term ends june term sofr for example is not known until september so that the daily rates that determine the three month cost of money during the quarter beginning in september may be collected such backward looking costs of money are of no use to forward looking hedgers what estimate of risk trading issues are raised by sofr s risk adjustment at present no liquid market provides the risk adjustment factor at a three month tenor in other words the switch to sofr has not solved the problem resulting from illiquid libor markets a three month risk adjustment carries the same illiquidity baggage libor does there is no term market with sufficient liquidity to provide a transaction based risk estimate if libor doesn t the weird trading of in arrears futures this screenshot of the cme three month sofr futures trading screen on november 26th shows the weird effect of in arrears settlement on sofr futures trading the september contract is still listed in november because the daily values of the sofr index that are compounded to find its value won t be known until the business day before the december contract three month calculation period begins obviously there is little interest in trading a contract that is already two months in the past the september contract volume is zero in arrears contract pricing creates a zombie contract month the outcome futures trading of in arrears contracts leaves much to be desired the daily forecasts of rates that determine december eurodollar futures prices are reflected in the december eurodollar futures price but repo rates that determine values of three month sofr futures for the same period are being reflected in the march sofr futures in other words december eurodollar futures price yields over the same time period as do march sofr futures confusing a second gloomy fact is that the problem of libor s illiquidity has not been resolved by sofr the only way to get a liquid three month quote for the risk adjustment factor is from a liquid forward looking three month market sofr and other overnight rates like ameribor must look backward to estimate term risks they cannot successfully replace libor the end of libor will be catastrophic for the cme s eurodollar futures complex and for interest rate swaps dealers as well thus there is an outside chance the panel banks will continue supplying libor estimates for the ice libor administrator solely to keep eurodollar futures and libor based interest rate swaps alive and liquid absent this helping hand from the libor panel banks the only way cme can successfully save its three month money futures franchise at its current volume level is by creating its own liquid three month uncollateralized cash yield only a futures market like the cme can create an instantly liquid three month uncollateralized debt instrument how i provide a method here
originally published nov 24 2019 why don t we feel better during the week the three major stock indices reached peak levels and finished less than 1 from their top closing prices however last week s dow jones list of weekly price changes indicated that most prices declined for the first time in my memory with 68 of the prices falling during past peak periods stock prices generated enthusiasm something not prevalent today general attitudes toward the market are often better expressed by the performance of selected mutual fund portfolios than the precepts of some publishers the average performance of the 7 539 mutual funds in the lipper us diversified equity funds universe reflects real expenses flows and cash reserves through last thursday s close the average year to date gain was 23 05 almost three times the normal 8 36 average annual long term growth of capital for the past five years one would have to believe that we have entered a magical era where past experiences are not relevant for this to continue even the most optimistic long term pundits are not suggesting that future sales earnings and dividends can command stock prices to rise and produce future gains of 20 any significant increase from the low to mid single digit numbers currently being produced creates an unusual level of price risk i am sensing a bifurcation of market prices as popular stock indices benefit from the rising prices of an increasingly smaller number of stocks with few stocks gaining 20 or more many stocks are only generating gains that match their single digit earnings assuming they are growing at all despite a remarkably strong economy i am concerned that analysts are jumping to favorable conclusions without thinking about how our economic system works this week a long discussed potential merger between charles schwab schw and td ameritrade amtd was announced charles schwab is a holding in our private financial services fund and td ameritrade is the second largest discount broker after schwab pundits calculated what schwab s earnings would be if the merged companies saved only half of the acquired firm s expenses called a one and done deal but it does not take into consideration the competitive and market reaction to a potential deal furthermore you might see lower pricing in the profitable arena of wealth management services particularly through investment advisors lower net fees have contributed to the profit squeeze in the investment business what to do financial history is replete with tales of supposedly bright people fleeing a falling market and failing to come back in to benefit from a subsequent rising market to prevent falling into this apparent safety trap i among others have developed a practice of always keeping some money in so called risky assets there are two primary ways to maintain exposure to a risk portfolio shed most if not all low growth stocks funds in favor of reserve building some with enough market experience can do this well but not many as committing cash in a down or even a flat market takes internal fortitude cash becomes too comfortable making it is easy to postpone re entry while you wait for some event which may or may not happen a second approach also divides the portfolio into two sub portfolios the first sub portfolio contains securities of extreme faith or stocks that might crater by 50 or more in reaction to unfavorable news to make it worthwhile being a long term holder of such former wonders requires raiding reserves or selling other assets the second sub portfolio contains underperforming assets expected to perform better with a change in conditions which is not unreasonable to believe the following example illustrates the principle currently there are many investment categories that are underperforming the market gains of 20 or more many investors owning us domiciled earnings have benefited due to the strength of the us dollar largely due to relative political conditions while i do not know how long this will last i understand math and markets and know that extreme imbalances don t last forever thus in this example i am suggesting a significant portion of the second sub portfolio be devoted to non us centric holdings as foreign securities can be administratively difficult most of our non us holdings are in funds mostly but not all in sec registered funds or fund management company stocks the following is a list of country or regional fund investment categories with average returns below the lipper us diversified equity funds average in spite of

you are exposed to the risk of market forces contrarians are always worried when they see excess flows into any asset bonds have become too attractive for many investors particularly those advised by

1931 debt crisis and the rise of hitler tobias straumann oxford oxford university press 2019 find this book 1931 was an inflection point in history a year in which so much of such consequence happened that nearly a century later one still strains to make sense of it all on 19 september 1931 japan invaded manchuria an act of aggression that the league of nations opposed to no avail thereby demonstrating how little collective security meant that very same day thousands of miles away in london the british government decided to go off the gold standard after months of expending enormous sums to stem the flight from the pound the british concluded that the battle could not be won with this surrender any remaining hopes for an international economy pivoting on the classical verities of gold and free trade vanished economic nationalism became the order of the day one reason speculators found sterling so ripe for prey was that london had substantial sums invested in germany that it could not repatriate the funds were held up because germany had experienced its own financial crisis that summer and the german government had instituted a prohibition on capital withdrawals to staunch the outflow of funds indeed it was the german catastrophe in july 1931 that was perhaps the most consequential event of that horrible year as tobias straumann argues in his excellent new book 1931 debt crisis and the rise of hitler the disaster in germany not only ravaged the domestic economy but also sent shockwaves through the international financial system and paved the way for adolf hitler s ascent the standard description of the german crisis begins with the collapse of the austrian banking system in may 1931 the troubles in austria then infected germany and brought down its financial system in the middle of july however straumann makes clear that germany was headed toward a crossroads well before then the crisis was a function of finance and politics domestic and international the fundamental cause of the german crisis straumann writes was the inability of the parties to resolve the demands of international agreements with those of domestic political realities the international agreements were the reparation obligations from the first world war though international conferences had progressively reduced the reparations bill during the 1920s the latest iteration the young plan adopted in 1930 had not created a sustainable payment schedule the requisite payments were simply too great for germany to pay perhaps not during an economic boom but certainly in the midst of a downturn when relief spending was high and tax receipts low investors understood this basic reality and were therefore increasingly wary of holding money in germany throughout 1930 and 1931 germany faced continuing shortfalls in government financing as a result the german government led by chancellor heinrich brüning implemented successive and unpopular austerity measures as it tried to gain control over domestic finances partly to gather the funds to pay reparations and partly to demonstrate the impossibility of continuing to pay reparations but the efforts were in vain money kept leaving germany international efforts to rescue germany were half hearted or too late in late june president herbert hoover announced a one year moratorium on intergovernmental debts as a last ditch attempt to calm the situation but the clumsy rollout and the prolonged haggling over details with the french robbed the move of much of its potential efficacy in the middle of july the crisis peaked and german banks were on the brink of collapse seeing no other option the government declared a bank holiday and implemented capital controls helping to put an end to the domestic emergency but spreading havoc internationally the world of finance reacted in horror and raced to move funds invested around the globe to safety britain was the first target and in just two weeks it lost almost one fifth of its gold and foreign exchange reserves the united states soon thereafter experienced an enormous outflow of gold and tightening of financial conditions the world depression entered its most vicious phase it was now great between 1929 and 1932 real gdp in germany plummeted by a quarter and the unemployment rate surpassed 20 per cent in this mass deprivation hitler found opportunity the nazis did not want a solution to the depression or a rapprochement with the world their path to power was hitched to a trail of despair already in the autumn of 1930 the nazis had exploited discontent with the economic situation and reparation payments to catapult to become the second largest party in the reichstag the crisis and its aftermath further aided their cause the trajectory was not linear in november 1932 the nazis actually suffered a setback in the national elections at this point straumann concludes a nazi dictatorship was still not inevitable but neither was it accidental that hitler would become chancellor soon thereafter the depression provided fertile ground for the nazis to assume control though other factors including the belief among establishment conservatives that they could control hitler were important in leading president paul von hindenburg to offer the chancellorship to hitler in january 1933 for a book that has the rise of hitler in its subtitle it is somewhat surprising and disappointing that only a few pages are devoted to the events after july 1931 and the book would benefit from further discussion of the political impacts of the crisis the german crisis is instructive straumann writes not because it shows that politicians sometimes fail to act courageously that is to be expected most of us like to play it safe rather it teaches us a timeless lesson about the importance of getting international agreements right the nexus of reparations and war debts set up by post war policymakers was simply not flexible enough to respond to reality hemmed in by domestic political constraints and a perpetual tendency to believe an improvement in germany s economy was just around the corner the victorious powers were not bold enough to lead opinion toward a more tenable solution we cannot assume that in times of crisis authorities will be able to make the hard decisions the most important work does not happen during the crisis but before it setting in place arrangements that both minimise the likelihood of an emergency and minimise the fallout should one occur in this light all one can say is how distressing it is to witness the purposeful dismantling today of international agreements and institutions painstakingly built to this end near the end of the book straumann reminds us of arnold toynbee s characterisation of 1931 as the annus terribilis a time when men and women all over the world were seriously contemplating and frankly discussing the possibility that the western system of society might break down and cease to work straumann narrates the german story during this year with clarity and authority leading the reader through the twists and turns the few moments of optimism and the many days of anguish all toward a conclusion that we already know yet hope against hope that somehow in a flash of inspiration the countries were able to avoid they did not in the end after further economic deprivation war and genocide the western system survived but just barely and at unimaginable loss today toynbee s reflections hit uncomfortably close to home one wonders with

the international monetary fund imf has lowered its sub saharan africa growth projectiosn to 3 2 this year and 3 6 in 2020 from its april figures due to trade and growing domestic policy uncertainties by tatira zwinoira the international monetary fund imf has lowered its sub saharan africa growth projectiosn to 3 2 this year and 3 6 in 2020 from its april figures due to trade and growing domestic policy uncertainties these figures were from its april 2019 world economic outlook weo report where the bretton woods institution had projected sub saharan africa s economic growth to be 3 5 and 3 7 for 2019 and 2020 respectively the reasons behind the drop in figures were weather shocks and uncertainty in the commodities markets yet despite this finance minister mthuli ncube in the 2020 budget said key growth restoration drivers would be agriculture and mining where he is expecting a 5 and 4 7 growth respectively as such government needs to be reminded why it may have to relook at its plan of pulling zimbabwe out of recession and register its envisioned 3 recovery growth the imf projected that zimbabwe s economy would contract by 7 1 by yearend before rebounding by 2 7 next year ncube has used agriculture as a key growth driver as the sector plays a key role in zimbabwe contributing 11 to the total gross domestic product gdp and is the main source of livelihoods for around 67 of the country s population according to the agriculture survey 2019 whose results were released early this year 70 of zimbabwe s population is directly dependent on agriculture with supplies from this sector contributing the bulk of raw materials to manufacturing but due to the rising temperatures agriculture has become greatly hampered as the rise of warmer conditions has translated into lower yields in recent years for example the united nations environment programme unep emissions gap report 2019 released last tuesday says by the end of the century global temperatures are expected to be 3 2 degrees celsius warmer even if climate targets are met and if this revelation is taken alongside a book by the national research council titled climate stabilisation targets emissions concentrations and impacts over decades to millennia 2011 the world will face severe consequences from these temperatures on southern africa the book found that these warming temperatures would translate into 5 10 less rainfall per degree resulting in more dry spells in the region already there has been a large increase in the frequency of drought conditions compared to the 14 year average with the 2018 19 season being one of the worst in over a decade in zimbabwe drought has left 60 of the 14 million population food insecure as a result of warming temperatures both crop and livestock farming have seen capacity reduced by half another challenge facing agriculture is poor funding mainly as a result of most farm owners lacking title deeds and as such access to bank loans in zimbabwe all farming land is owned by the state which issues farmers with 99 year leases however banks have refused to recognise the instruments as security mainly because they are not tradable while government has promised to address the land ownership question it is still yet to do so despite implementing the land reform programme in 2000 with all these reasons agriculture can no longer be a cornerstone of this once vibrant agricultural producing economy ncube is expecting mining the sector to rebound by 4 7 next year however according to american think tank the center for strategic and international studies sub saharan african countries are being impacted by the global trade wars this is due to increased us tariffs on china which has precipitated drops in commodity prices these drops could significantly reduce returns from zimbabwe s minerals such as gold diamonds and platinum the findings were bolstered by african development bank experts who warned that the trade tensions could cause a 2 5 reduction in the gdp in resource intensive african countries the reason why commodity prices drop in periods of trade uncertainty is due to investors moving into financial markets which are largely seen as safer havens for their investment already the imf has predicted the oil dependent nations of angola and nigeria to see economic declines while the more mineral reliant south africa is also expected to see subdued growth as such if bigger and more commodity dependent nations are expected to take a beating to their economies what more of zimbabwe

free press mankato mn dec 1 mankato for mankato homeowners planning to sell their house the news is good home values are rising across the city for mankato homeowners more focused on their 2020 property tax bills it s not as positive growing city county and school district budgets combined with escalating home values will add up to rising property tax bills for owners of houses and to a lesser extent apartment buildings valuation increases while they happened citywide varied by neighborhood based on sales prices of comparable homes in different sectors of the city some of them were as low as 1 said michael stalberger who oversees the property valuation process in blue earth county citing the tourtellotte park area and neighborhoods below minnesota state university our highest neighborhood increase was 9 5 those larger valuation bumps occurred in the new subdivisions on mankato s northern most side behind the commercial area anchored by home depot and menards individual properties anywhere in the city could have seen double digit value increases if additions or other improvements were made a home with a current taxable value of 142 000 in mankato would on average see its value rise to 150 000 in 2020 the corresponding jump in taxes paid to the city will be 7 6 from 516 to 555 that same home would see county taxes rise 8 8 from 489 to 532 a 283 000 mankato home will on average increase in value to 300 00 that would mean based on preliminary property tax levies approved by the city council and county board in september a 6 8 bump in city taxes to 1 273 and an 8 2 rise in county taxes to 1 221 apartment buildings are also increasing in assessed value but on a smaller scale and will see their city tax bills edge up by about 1 5 and their county bill grow roughly 2 5 commercial industrial properties with their stable valuations will be writing out slightly smaller checks for property taxes next year down 1 7 to 1 9 for city taxes and down less than 1 for county taxes the shift in the tax burden toward homeowners would be more pronounced if mankato wasn t in its longstanding growth mode about 60 of the new dollars being collected by local governments in mankato will be paid by owners of newly constructed homes offices stores apartment buildings and industrial facilities the remaining 40 of new tax collections by the city county and school district will be coughed up the owners of homes and apartments via their rising market valuations the city of mankato the actual taxes paid by mankatoans next year will be a hair lower than those listed above and those stated on truth in taxation notifications sent to property owners in recent days that s because city leaders have decided to trim 124 000 from the preliminary levy of 20 45 million passed in september that slight reduction will ensure that the city s tax rate will hold at the level it s been at for the past nine years said city manager pat hentges a steady tax rate if properties never changed in value and new buildings were never constructed would leave the city with identical property tax revenue from one year to the next in other words mankato s policy means that its tax revenue grows only by the amount that the city s tax base grows via new construction and valuation increases in existing properties i don t know if there s any city in the state of minnesota that has consistently done that particularly in greater minnesota hentges said mankato s steady economic and population growth has allowed the city to maintain that philosophy while still pulling in moderately more money each year for 2020 the city will collect just under 800 000 in additional property taxes compared to this year a 3 4 rise most of that revenue combined with a slight increase in state aid will go toward cost of living adjustments and increased medical benefit costs for employees it s an increase in cost of supplies and an increase in personnel costs he said noting that police fire protection snow plowing park operations street repairs and other core municipal services rely on staffing typically 60 of your cost is personnel the council expressed concerns this year about the rising costs of health insurance for city staff hentges said it will be a long term goal to bring down that cost curve through negotiations with the various labor unions representing the bulk of city employees blue earth county mankato residents will see a slight increase in the county portion of their taxes next year thanks to a 6 blue earth county levy increase the county plans to have a 114 million budget and will run a 1 4 million deficit next year s levy will be set at about 39 million much of the levy will be absorbed by taxable market value growth which increased in blue earth county by an estimated 4 7 this year a lot of that growth came from increased property values however meaning the county s portion of property taxes will likely be slightly higher for homeowners agricultural land which has decreased in value in recent years is expected to increase by 6 9 on average while residential property will increase by an estimated 5 9 on average even apartments a fast growing housing segment in mankato are expected to increase in value by 1 4 that means a homeowner with a 195 000 house the county s average home value could expect to see the county portion of their taxes increase by about 59 under the county s current plans a farmer with property estimated at 530 000 the county average could expect to see an increase of 90 in county taxes commercial property is expected to decrease by 1 4 in average value according to stalberger the county s property and environmental resources director that could mean a savings of about 14 on the average commercial property worth 674 000 county officials say the increased levy will go toward increased staffing costs future construction projects and equipment needs and increasing demands on county departments they re all feeling that volume that comes with additional population county administrator bob meyer said included in the budget are five new staff members such as an it security position and a part time community health educator blue earth county is also planning for a 10 health insurance increase similar to the increase it had in july mankato area public schools tax collections by mankato area public schools will rise just 1 3 in 2020 to 28 3 million said tom sager director of business services for the district combined with state aid the district s primary revenue source the property tax revenue will bring the total general fund budget to 108 4 million next year we re looking at about a 4 increase in revenue from last year sager said about a quarter of that increase reflects achievement integration aid the state is providing to districts with a particularly diverse student population the rest of the increase stems from a growing number of students attending local public schools that is a key driver in any increase in school district levies he said both the state aid and the local levy are decided largely based on a formula set by the minnesota legislature based on enrollment with more students you might need more teachers with more students you might need more transportation with more students you might need more supplies sager said the state formula acknowledges that and allows the levy to increase most of the additional revenue is targeted at personnel costs cost of living increases new hires to handle enrollment growth higher costs for medical insurance and other benefits he said about 82 of the district s budget is consumed by personnel costs staff writer trey mewes contributed to this story ___ c 2019 the free press mankato minn visit the

tldr the total hidden costs of senator warren s medicare for all plan would total 33 1 trillion in its first 10 years these costs due to deadweight losses waste rationing and reduced innovation are roughly equivalent to a surcharge that would increase overall costs by at least 26 and more likely 64 in the worst case hidden costs would nearly double the cost of the plan reported by warren health plan advisors in the context of 210 trillion in unfunded liabilities the nation cannot afford a new entitlement larger by far than any other now on the books the new federal taxes required to finance the warren health plan could instead be used to dramatically reduce our unfunded liabilities by anywhere from 58 to 82 trillion series recap aggregate size of medicare for all s hidden losses persistent readers of this series now know that senator warren s misguided medicare for all plan will produce a myriad of hidden costs that single payer champions would prefer to ignore in its first decade these costs would include 8 7 trillion 3 5 14 3t in deadweight losses from new taxes part 1 6 1 trillion 4 6 7 7 in additional waste part 2 8 9 trillion 2 6 15 2 in costs resulting from rationing part 3 9 4 trillion 2 6 10 6 in social losses stemming from reduced innovation part 4 so those favoring senator warren s single payer health plan evidently are willing to put up with hidden costs amounting to 33 1 trillion 13 3 47 7 a year a picture is worth 1 000 words in this case remember that all of these costs are above and beyond the officially advertised cost of senator warren s so while she and her supporters may well believe they have found a way to bankroll the purported 52 trillion cost of her plan in its first ten years she obviously has offered no explanation for how the nation can afford to endure an additional 33 1 trillion there s a simple reason most of the costs listed are hidden costs fig 1 compiled by christopher j conover duke university using sources and methods described in text no one will ever see the hours never worked or the purchases never made as a consequence of the boatload of taxes needed to pay for her plan when people die early because a treatment was denied or a new drug never came to market most will not chalk that up to the warren health plan perhaps an enterprising outfit such as fraser institute will see fit to try and codify all the time lost waiting in line for care but just as much waste fraud and abuse passes by unnoticed by the average american the same is likely to be true of all the new wasteful spending this plan would add to the american health economy talk of trillions and trillions in dollars is beyond the comprehension of most americans but perhaps converting these figures into per capita estimates might make them easier to grasp on an annualized basis 33 1 trillion works out to roughly 9 500 3 800 to 13 800 per u s resident hidden losses relative to national health expenditures another way to make these absurdly large numbers more comprehensible to express them as a percentage of aggregate national health spending over the 10 year period they have been measured attentive readers will know that i am not claiming that americans will have to dig into their pockets to the tune of 9 500 apiece every year over the next decade some losses would be quite real for example deadweight losses reflect a genuine reduction in the size of the economy relative to what it would have been otherwise real people will find it more difficult to find work and or do without things they could have and would have been able to purchase absent the added taxes imposed to bankroll medicare for all in contrast while very real the waste fraud and abuse i have estimated would occur should not be construed as an add on to the 52 trillion in spending predicted by senator warren s advisors but instead would be a component of that spending and one illustrative measure of how inefficient that spending will be in light of the perverse incentives built into any free medical care system other elements in my hidden cost figure are intangible losses reflecting the monetary value of years of life lost because a technology was denied or a life saving drug never made it to market for sure there would be an earnings loss for working age individuals who become the inadvertent victims of single payer health care but much of the loss would be intangible with 150 000 per year representing what society would have been willing to pay to avert such avoidable deaths etc so with that caveat here is fig 1 expressed in percentage terms fig 2 compiled by christopher j conover duke university using sources and methods described in text the hidden costs i ve calculated essentially are equivalent in dollar terms to a 64 hidden tax on the advertised cost of senator warren s plan if we re really lucky the tax may be as low as 26 but it also may be as high as 92 thinking such enormous costs are worthwhile is literally beyond my own imagination so for purposes of discussion i will instead imagine a single payer proponent as smart as albert einstein who arrives to demolish each and every one of the top 4 reasons the elizabeth warren s single payer health plan is a singularly bad idea there still would remain one very large inconvenient truth that is the 5 reason to oppose this misguided idea our nation cannot afford it what will the warren health plan actually cost recall from fig 1 in part 1 that estimates of medicare for all are all over the map in terms of their predicted effect on national health spending the most optimistic estimates indicate that spending would be reduced by 26 while the estimates i view as more realistic show that spending might rise by as much as 13 6 even after taking into accounted the purported savings medicare for all is supposed to deliver e g lower administrative costs to simplify matters i invite you to consider two estimates lower bound the advisers claim that national health spending will be just under 52 trillion in health spending between 2020 and 2029 and that only 19 590 billion in new federal revenues will be required to finance the plan upper bound my own estimate is that nhe will be 56 1 trillion during this same decade necessitating new federal revenues of 27 702 billion readers will be happy to know they do not have to choose between the estimate of warren health plan advisors and my own because it will quickly become apparent we cannot afford medicare for all even if the lower bound estimate turns out to be 100 accurate current u s unfunded liabilities as of 2017 the u s faced a fiscal gap of 242 trillion the fiscal gap is the sum of the current federal debt held by the public i e excluding the portion owed to other federal agencies such as the social security administration plus the present value of all future tax revenues minus all future federal program costs calculated over an infinite horizon fig 3 compiled by cchristopher j conover duke university using sources listed this is a present value figure meaning it is the additional amount americans need to have banked today earning interest at the u s treasury bill rate in order to finance all our downstream promises above and beyond whatever downstream revenues might be available to pay for them this sounds complicated but the idea is simple think about your lifetime income from all sources think about your lifetime spending and add that to whatever debts you currently have if your spending plus debts exceed your income you have a fiscal gap and even though the gap between your income and expenses would vary from year by year you can simplify your thinking about it by just considering how much you d need saved right now to pay it off all future shortfalls knowing that any amount you have saved could earn interest in the years before it was spent in the case of the united states closing the fiscal gap would require either raising all federal taxes by 58 or cutting all federal spending by 38 imagine you d figured out that in the context of your lifestyle and income you either had to increase your lifetime income by 58 or cut your spending by 38 in order to balance the books how many would run out and buy a new house that would increase your annual spending by 60 the very idea is lunacy and it would be nice if there were bipartisan acknowledge of this hard reality admittedly health programs such as medicare medicaid and obamacare are not the sole reason we have such enormous unfunded liabilities however elsewhere i have shown that in 2012 health related federal spending accounted for 55 of the unfunded liabilities facing the nation at that time footnote 2 so they certainly are a major contributor to the problem we face the current debt 3 1 trillion and unfunded liabilities of state and local governments would add 38 trillion to this tab but for purposes of discussion i will focus solely on whether uncle sam can bankroll all the promises made by politicians on his behalf and unfunded liabilities of state and local governments would add to this tab but for purposes of discussion i will focus solely on whether uncle sam can bankroll all the promises made by politicians on his behalf the federal fiscal gap of 202 trillion amounts to 652 000 per u s resident only a minuscule fraction of americans would have that amount in savings ready to hand over when uncle sam passes the hat amounts to per u s resident only a minuscule fraction of americans would have that amount in savings ready to hand over when uncle sam passes the hat that is nearly 10 times this year s gdp do you know any financial advisors who would recommend that a family take on a mortage equal to 10 times their annual income we could seize all of the wealth in u s households 107 trillion and it barely cover half of this enormous obligation to close the 2015 fiscal gap would have required either raising all federal taxes by 58 5 that year or cutting all federal spending by 37 7 any takers now voters are hardly clamoring for either increased taxes or massive cuts in spending so we can all understand why today s politicians keep kicking this can down the road unfortunately however such cowardice has resulted in the fiscal gap more than doubling between 2004 and 2014 and there can be no dodging the inconvenient truth that this generation s failure to close the fiscal gap essentially ensures that we will simply pass this enormous debt onto future generations waiting even 20 years to start addressing the problem means that the required revenue increase will have grown to over 70 while the required spending cuts would exceed 43 waiting of course means that millions of today s voters never will have to pay the piper they will have enjoyed the 3 in medicare benefits for each 1 they paid into the system and essentially left the tab for future generations to pay are there any readers who can look their children or grandchildren in the eye and say that s fair is there anyone who thinks being party to this massive intergenerational theft is a good idea assuming my cost estimate is correct the additional federal spending required by the warren plan unless funded through higher taxes that hypothetically could have instead been used to reduce our existing massive unfunded liabilities would increase uncle sam s fiscal gap by a minimum of 82 trillion if you believe the warren plan advisors the figure is only 58 trillion are single payer proponents so eager to adopt medicare for all that they re willing to forego the chance to knock 58 trillion off the tab that s going to be handed to the next generation i wonder how millennials will feel about that once the money has been spent and they discover that boomers elected to bankroll a brand new entitlement rather than pay down the debt on the massive entitlements that already exist how grateful will said boomers feel about free health care once they ve discovered that as a consequence uncle sam no longer is in a position to fully fund social security for example bottom line let s review the bidding the sanders plan will impose hidden costs ranging from 1 3 trillion to as much as 4 7 trillion per year these are costs that will be unavoidably borne by all americans in various ways too often hidden from view unlike taxes there is no possible way to arrange for these costs only to be borne by the top 1 percent moreover even if americans collectively decided that the benefits of free care for all outweigh these enormous costs the sad reality is that americans cannot afford this expensive new entitlement until americans demonstrate their willingness to either be taxed enough to finance the enormous panoply of entitlements and government programs already on the books or their willingness to endure massive spending cuts so that costs match up with the willingness of americans to be taxed it is completely irresponsible to bury our head in the sands and wish away the unsustainable path that irresponsible policymakers have put us on stealing from future generations is deeply immoral which is why you will never see a single payer advocate explicitly endorse the notion but until and unless we get our fiscal house in order stealing from our children and grandchildren is exactly what will happen should senator warren s medicare for all plan be enacted into law from where i sit putting us on that path cannot possibly be on the right side of history isn t it time for an honest debate about this update 1 december 1 2019 i ve decided to add a link to this video from 2010 in which then house member later to become house speaker paul ryan explains why it is unconscionable to add a brand new health entitlement at a time when we could not even pay for the existing entitlements already on the books as well the smoke and mirrors surrounding obamacare are reminiscent of the same sort of fiscal shenanigans senator warren has used to mask the true costs of her plan and greatly understate the amount of new federal revenues required to bankroll it well worth a listen for those who may have forgotten this rare moment of honesty by a politician about our unsustainable fiscal path
the trade war between the u s and china is forcing many louisiana farmers to question whether they ll continue to grow soybeans next year as the federal aid package keeping them afloat by offsetting their losses isn t covering all their costs across the state farmers have collected more than 180 million since the federal government rolled out its program to make up for a steep slump in soybean sales after china the biggest buyer of american soy raised retaliatory tariffs for several u s agriculture products last year more than 75 of that aid went to louisiana soybean farmers who have suffered the most under the trade war according to u s department of agriculture figures obtained through a freedom of information act request
the boarded two story house on mettetal street is largely unremarkable for detroit with bushes that extend up to its roof a crumbling porch and loose bricks it s the standard image of blight in a city still rife with abandonment but on this densely populated stretch in grandmont rosedale a solidly middle class neighborhood of well kept a frames with tidy landscaped lawns the house is an anomaly an unwelcome drag on an otherwise vibrant neighborhood the lone blighted house on the 14000 block of mettetal photo violet ikonomova more peculiar than the house itself however is why it s idling in this blighted state the home s most recent owner was a city employee who purchased it from the detroit land bank authority at a deep discount a benefit that should have ensured its restoration the 2015 sale was supposed to mark a turning point for the house and block the employee a detroit firefighter had taken advantage of a 50 percent discount extended then only to city employees retirees and their family members with the idea that they d be responsible owners who could get land bank houses rehabbed occupied and back on the tax rolls but none of that happened at the house on mettetal instead it has sat vacant since at least 2015 its taxes unpaid its blight presenting a threat to neighbors at some point a tree fell on it causing a brick column in front to topple after two years in which the owner failed to make the necessary repairs the land bank took it back it now sits in its inventory along with about 30 000 other vacant structures while the house represents a worst possible outcome for the discount program a deadline detroit review of the 70 homes sold to city employees and their family members in its first year finds the program has in many cases fallen short of its goal to stabilize communities nearly 40 percent of those homes sold in 2015 are today either on the brink of foreclosure still blighted or have been sold to new owners some of them speculators and instead of luring city employees or their family members to detroit the program has primarily attracted people seeking an investment opportunity as the overwhelming majority of buyers appear to be renting out the properties our review found just 24 percent of houses still owned by their original buyer have a tax exemption that indicates owner occupancy 22 percent were as of last month facing foreclosure over unpaid 2016 taxes and an additional 7 percent of properties had not paid taxes for 2017 most of those facing foreclosure have made minimal payments to avoid it but the average tax bill on the properties remains 2 200 9 percent were sold or transferred to new owners within three years 7 percent remain blighted and or had to be taken back by the land bank because their owners failed to bring them up to code while another 3 percent still have not made necessary repairs to achieve compliance 17 percent are currently owned by people or entities based outside detroit in an interview a land bank spokeswoman defended the program and rejected the idea that it could be improved through more stringent requirements according to the land bank s own data discount buyers tend to fare slightly better than standard buyers and third party data suggests more than 90 percent of the houses sold in the first 12 months are currently occupied the goal is to get houses renovated and to get people living in them said alyssa strickland of course maybe there are some challenges for certain buyers but i don t think any program would ever be perfect and have a perfect outcome for every single participant the land bank is in early conversations to extend the discount to skilled trades workers and possibly other groups but residents and housing advocates charge the program is an unfair inadequate way to grow homeownership in a city of great need detroit was decimated by a foreclosure crisis that in the last decade flipped the historically majority owner city to majority renter thrusting tens of thousands of residents into a precarious rental landscape the primary beneficiaries of a program like this should be people who need housing said michele oberholtzer a counselor with the united community housing coalition in detroit the most frustrating thing about this is the same thing that is most frustrating about the land bank in general that in a city with so many homeless foreclosed upon and unstably housed people that simultaneously holds tens of thousands of homes in government ownership they can t find a way to make a fit at a large scale oberholtzer said why do we have to devise schemes that provide incentives to investors three doors down from the dilapidated house on mettetal gloria hunter a 61 year old renter recalls fixing up a long vacant house in boston edison some years ago her eyes widen when told the city worker who let the house on her block languish bought it for just 1 500 i m telling you if i got a house for that much there s no way i wouldn t have moved in it said hunter when i moved in my house and it was vacant for 13 years so you know what it looked like i moved in one room fixed that room up i moved in another room and i took it one room at a time and that s what they should have done down there asked whether she felt someone should receive a discounted house because they work for or are family to someone who works for the city she replied i m just as responsible give me a discount looking for a home or for profit nearly 500 land bank owned houses have been sold at a discount to city employees and their family members over the last 3 5 years photo violet ikonomova created by the land bank in 2015 at the request of mayor mike duggan the 50 percent discount was billed as a way to increase residency and limit abandonment while at the same time giving a leg up to city workers and pensioners who d taken cuts during and before bankruptcy the discount is applied after a buyer wins a house in the land bank auction which traditionally sells vacant houses in the city s more viable neighborhoods to the general public discount recipients must only adhere to the standard auction rules they face no additional requirements as of february the land bank had awarded more than 4 million in discounts for 470 houses purchased by current or former city employees their family members or city school teachers renovations are complete at 40 percent of those houses with work in progress on many others in the program s first year it appears the discount was utilized primarily by family members of city employees and not the workers themselves when the program was established there was little indication that participants would primarily use it to make money instead the emphasis was on owner occupancy buyers would fix up the houses and live in them helping stabilize neighborhoods whether they are renters looking to buy homeowners who want to restore and move into a bigger house or employees living in the suburbs who might like to return to the city we wanted to make it easier duggan said at the time a resolution passed unanimously by city council also stressed owner occupancy we must provide incentives to encourage the city s employees and retirees and their families to reside within the city it read city employees are dedicated public servants committed to the city s future and crucial partners in all revitalization efforts but the program does not require that buyers actually inhabit the property and it seems that very few do instead the overwhelming majority of the houses appear to be rentals based on property records and conversations with owners occupants and neighbors a small fraction have been sold in some cases to speculators or for considerable profit and that s not ideal for neighborhoods says peter hammer director of the damon j keith center for civil rights at wayne state university owner occupancy matters because occupancy prevents blight he says if the people who are buying don t live there there s a much better chance of it not being occupied full time if it s owner occupied there s also a nice alignment of incentives people have more incentive to invest take care of and maintain the home whereas renters have a very different incentive structure that profit appears to be the motive on many of these sales can also lead to negative outcomes he said many of the problems in the property market have been caused by speculation and letting these back onto the market in an unstable manner can further destabilize the market indeed property records suggest instability and an uncertain future for some of the houses one buyer transferred a house for which she received a 4 000 discount to someone for no money within two years that person then sold it for 30 000 a year later to a couple listed as living in new york who also own property in new jersey it s unclear what repairs were done to the home before the mark up as no rehab permits were ever taken out and exterior images show the property was in good shape around the time of sale a renter lives there now another participant received a 14 000 discount on a house in detroit s bagley neighborhood and three years later sold it for 45 000 to john whitby forsyth properties a georgia based speculator that owns dozens of houses in detroit the property appeared to also be in good condition and the buyer took out no permits for rehabilitation work a family is currently renting it ennis mcgee a building engineer at the city received 62 000 off a house in boston edison in 2015 and sold it two years later to possibility 7 llc another speculator for only a small return he too never took out a permit for rehabilitation work records show he also didn t pay taxes on the property a handful of additional properties transferred with no record of money exchanged it s unclear if the new owners have any connection to city government the land bank does not keep track of what happens to properties once the necessary improvements are made many buyers also had more than one home in detroit further indication of a possible rental deidric and natasha tupper city of detroit retirees listed as living in southfield each bought a home through the program and now rent them out natasha said they were grateful for the opportunity to make some extra money because you should see my husband s retirement check after two decades it is seriously laughable the land bank disputed that less than a quarter of the houses were owner occupied as the homestead exemptions suggest instead it believes about half of the houses to be occupied by the people who bought them based on its own more lax measure of owner occupancy the land bank considers a house likely owner occupied when the owner lists it as their mailing address but a closer look at 10 randomly selected properties that fit that criteria revealed the measure is flawed just three of the houses were owner occupied the other seven were rentals or vacant still strickland framed the unintended rental outcome as a positive if some city employees are using as a way to make extra income then you know i think that that s a benefit to city employees that they have a new way to make some additional money renting out homes said strickland the duggan administration echoed that sentiment going on to reframe the initial stated goal of the program the employee discount program was created to provide an incentive for more vacant land bank homes in our neighborhoods to be renovated and the program has succeeded in that goal said chief of staff alexis wiley this program has been a success and we continue to fully support it it s not known how many properties needed renovation the lion s share were plucked from a batch slated for the 2014 wayne county tax foreclosure auction suggesting they hadn t been vacant for long and less than a quarter of owners took out rehab permits the program requires at least one permit when renovations are necessary lax vetting process whether city employees and their family members tend to make good homeowners is unclear in northwest detroit on indiana street deputy district 5 manager karla williamson is among the more than 20 percent of 2015 discount recipients barely hanging onto their properties she hasn t paid her 2016 taxes in full but has been making monthly payments of about 100 as part of a payment plan to avoid losing the house further west at a house near rouge park martisa hairston the sister of kenyetta hairston bridges vice president of real estate and financial services at the detroit economic growth corporation owes more than 5 200 in taxes and has not made any payments to keep from losing the house in the fall foreclosure auction what s more she was able to buy with the land bank discount despite owing taxes on another detroit house that is now subject to foreclosure the auction rules are supposed to prevent that williamson and hairston did not respond to requests for comment part of the reason the discount program can attract sub par buyers is because it doesn t require they show proof they can afford not only taxes but often costly repairs on a property after a property is sold the land bank checks only to see if work is being done to bring it up to code within a target 6 9 months it has to be occupied for one year and if it s sold before three years the land bank takes a portion the requirements are far more lax than those of another dlba program to increase access to home ownership the buyback program typically geared toward renters whose landlords lost their homes due to unpaid taxes requires purchasers escrow a month s worth of taxes keep current on tax payments and water bills for a year and attend homeownership workshops they receive a deed only after the program requirements are met land bank board chair erica ward gerson has hailed that program as a great success of all the programs we run buyback is the one i m the proudest of gerson said last year in an interview with the free press to me the most remarkable thing is we ve only taken back three properties from people who signed agreements started putting money aside to date the buyback program has awarded 324 deeds and nine houses have been taken back strickland the agency s spokeswoman said the buyback program requirements help ensure positive outcomes there are additional requirements because the goal is that we want them to be successful rather than just saying give us 1 000 and here is the deed she said we want to make sure that they re armed with the tools to hold onto those properties and be successful owners once they complete the program but when asked whether the land bank has considered incorporating some of the buyback program s provisions to improve the success rate of the auction discount program strickland said no that it wouldn t be in the authority s best interest to add additional barriers too quick to seize armando clinton says it would be nice if the land bank actually did something with the blighted house next door photo violet ikonomova where the land bank does impose stringent requirements is on the timeline for repairs buyers must provide monthly updates on their progress and are expected to wrap up within 9 months though additional time is allowed if progress is being made some who lost homes for a lack of repairs complained they were blindsided by the rehab requirements and didn t have the money or time to complete the work maurice funchess the firefighter who owned the dilapidated house on mettetal says he spent thousands of dollars scraping painting and redoing floors in the first year he owned the house but a couple of burglaries set him back and he hadn t budgeted for the porch and brick work unsatisfied with his progress the land bank took back the house a year later it s not for poor folks you can t do it if you re poor said funchess who was earning 70 000 a year between his job as a firefighter and other gigs at the time you need some help some programs a little bit of money to go in like a grant or loan there s some that are out there but they re so hard to get things went even worse for jeffery marshall the son of a detroit water and sewerage department employee marshall sunk 10 000 into his property between 2015 and last year foregoing paying taxes in order to cover the repairs but like funchess he wasn t working quickly enough and things kept getting stolen this year with the house facing foreclosure he paid off his 2016 tax bill in hopes of holding onto it shortly after the land bank took it back marshall places some blame on the land bank for not fully communicating the requirements of the program or condition of the house there were some shockers at the closing like you have to do this this and this and the house had a lot more problems than what the listing said there were issues with the foundation and the plumbing was nowhere up to code the whole thing was really really stressful to the point where my friends who were helping me were just telling me to give the house back still he says even to this day i would fix the house up i just needed more time the land bank does today explain the program requirements on its website in some cases such repossessions wind up benefiting the land bank which due to an improving housing market is able to sell them for more to new buyers however those people ultimately stand the same chance of success as marshall in other cases they remain a burden to neighbors like the mother and son who live next to the house marshall lost roots from a large tree stretch all the way to their property where they ve broken the driveway compromised the home s foundation and burst a pipe the son armando clinton says the foundation fix alone cost 3 000 but the now land bank owned house isn t clinton s only concern across the street sits a burned out house he says was set ablaze by squatters its owner who lives elsewhere in the city had told him he would fix it up the charred house and clinton s foundation bill are powerful reminders of what can happen when homes sit too long of the house next door clinton says simply it would be nice if they actually did something with it
the ctrack transport and freight index continues to reflect the slowing nature of the south african economy according to the index all logistics sub sectors measured in south africa except road freight recorded declines between august and october 2019 compared to the same three months in 2018 concerns must be mounting in boardrooms across the country as the economy struggles with slowdowns in manufacturing mining and retail road freight still showing positive growth road freight the largest sector in south africa by volume and value increased 1 during the period from august to october 2019 versus the same time in 2018 short distance transport volumes of retail goods and fmcg are still expanding while the continuous shift to online shopping is helping parcel delivery volumes black friday and cyber monday will also prop up this category however the strongest road freight income growth has come from the small furniture transport sector which may have to do with emigration and families moving to more secure locations even while home sales remain subdued off the rails rail freight volumes declined 1 8 between august and october 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 which indicates that primary mining products are not being exported or used as much furthermore metal products have seen the largest decrease as a few medium sized firms have closed in the last 12 months the decline in metal products income in nominal terms was 6 and although not all of this was in the rail sector the knock on effect to mining would have hurt the rail freight industry air and sea freight volumes declined by 2 4 and 3 4 respectively between august and october 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 this reiterates the impact of a weak global economy and the trade war between china the world s largest manufacturer and the usa the world s largest consumer bulk commodity and container shipping are also in decline but by far the worst performing sub sector has been storage manufacturers and internal traders are keeping stocks low as they expect trading conditions to worsen both the absa pmi and the trade activity index from sacci show that role players are concerned about the strength of the economy added to this is the decline in the international storage of containers transhipped in south african ports transhipments declined a massive 19 3 between august and october 2019 versus the same period a year ago while big shifts are not uncommon in the storage sector it is concerning when all categories in this subsector are so negative the total decline of 14 3 in the amount of goods warehoused between august and october 2019 compared to the same period last year is a relative indicator of the poor confidence that firms have of short term economic performance thankfully interest rates are lower than before and are likely to drop further reducing the cost of storage moreover the shift to online shopping means that at least from that perspective albeit small the warehousing sector has a few positives to draw from however the biggest factor in the broader logistics sector is the lack of confidence that goods will be sold relatively quickly and that quick refilling of shelves will have to take place retail price increases have remained below overall consumer price adjustments for about four years in fact retail prices have not increased over 3 for more than three years consecutively this best reflects the fight that exists for the consumer s pocket pipeline volumes declined 7 between august and october 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 mainly due to the decline in fuel sales volumes overall there seems to be no respite for the logistics industry apart from the short boost to retail volumes thanks to black friday and cyber monday these two selling days may be strong enough to at least see a small improvement but otherwise the logistics sector will have to wait until next year ultimately though throughout the supply chain there are genuine concerns about low economic growth and price pressures table the ctrack transport and freight index numbers change percentage change between rail road pipeline sea air storage

of operating fleets can become a very difficult task says hein jordt md of ctrack sa the need to provide competitive rates while part of a fleet is not moving presents transport and freight companies with additional challenges optimising fleet usage and keeping costs low cannot be done without the support of the type of systems and solutions that ctrack provides ctrack believes that certain elements risk driving behaviour productivity optimisation and asset management should be prioritised and given the most focus which cannot be achieved without intelligent fleet management solutions the trends presented in this month s freight and transport index show that government must look even closer at the supply chain industry and support transport and freight companies with cost effective road regulation policies improved safety measures and economic policy that supports efficiency improvements in conjunction with well planned integration with our country s transport and economic infrastructure will allow us to be competitive in the global logistics market jordt concludes
a demonstrator reacts as she is detained by riot policemen during a protest against chile s government in santiago chile november 30 2019 reuters pablo sanhueza philip sanders i bloomberg as rioting broke out across chile in october president sebastian pinera watched his political agenda go up in smoke just 18 months after taking office on promises to expand the private pension system cut taxes for the rich and clamp down on crime pinera saw his legislative plans swept away by the biggest street protests and riots since the return of democracy in 1990 every single one of his flagship policies is now being ditched reversed or revised under a new finance minister the government s efforts are centered on placating protesters through spending increases upending election pledges to narrow the fiscal deficit pinera s biggest concession a plan to rewrite the constitution was negotiated by lawmakers from almost all the main parties the president who has resisted calls to resign only endorsed it two days later his manifesto and policies are gone done finished said javier sajuria a senior lecturer from chile at queen mary university in london he may just become an administrator for a political agenda set by the parties in congress with two and a half years of his mandate to go pinera s approval rating has slumped to 12 according to the latest poll from cadem some opposition lawmakers have even started an impeachment process though it is unlikely to succeed it s tough on a billionaire accustomed to success he was elected in late 2017 for a second non consecutive term because he was seen as efficient someone who could translate his business skills into faster economic growth for the country started well for the first year it all seemed to go well growth rallied to 5 3 in the second quarter of 2018 his first three months in office and investment soared but by 2019 things had started to go wrong the economy was losing steam expanding just 1 5 in the first quarter and pinera s pension and tax reforms were stalled in congress worse still a bill designed to make the labor market more flexible had been hijacked by the opposition who wanted to slash the working week to 40 hours and then seemingly out of nowhere the protests erupted and pinera s reform package became ancient history overnight the protesters want better pensions education and health care as well as a new constitution but they don t want the kind of small piece meal increases in spending pinera had proposed they want a proper welfare state after 30 years of being told they live in latin america s miracle economy they want to see the benefits the president is now fending off calls from the extreme right to clamp down on the protests and the extreme left demanding his resignation this is no longer pinera s government because his agenda has gone said robert funk a political science teacher at universidad de chile the government is reactive now constantly changing depending on the demands on the street coping badly from the very start of the anti government protests pinera has struggled to respond appropriately after calling out the army on the first night the president went on to declare war on protesters it was a mistake within days he was backtracking apologizing and calling the protesters demands legitimate i have been surprised by his constant incapacity to read the situation and to give answers funk said but ultimately the government has to come up with answers now others are taking over it was a common joke in the past that pinera s finance minister was pinera himself not any more less than two weeks after the explosion of social rage the president fired eight ministers including his long serving finance minister felipe larrain in came soft spoken mild mannered ignacio briones more than anyone it is briones who is setting the economic agenda he was the one who agreed with opposition lawmakers to raise the minimum pension by 50 within three years enough the protest movement is now in its sixth week and in many poorer areas of the country it has degenerated into a wave of looting and arson hotels have been ransacked public buildings burnt shops looted and traffic lights destroyed while the wealthy areas of santiago continue much as normal life in lower income areas is seriously disrupted as the economic cost rises the peso slumped to a record low both wednesday and thursday prompting the central bank to intervene offering as much as 10 billion on the spot market that is equivalent to a quarter of its total foreign currency reserves the peso gained 2 3 friday now pinera is trying to rally support for a new law and order agenda pushing bills to ban face masks in demonstrations make it easier to call out the army to defend infrastructure and increasing the number of police on the street some in the opposition are beginning to swing into line the time has come to say enough pinera said in a press conference wednesday it s time for us to join together in our commitment and determination to fight the violence staying power yet every time he has attempted to lay down the law in the past amnesty international human rights watch or another organization has come out saying that the police have systematically used excessive force some opposition lawmakers have filed a constitutional accusation against him for alleged human rights violations committed by security forces while the impeachment is unlikely to garner the two third of senators required the backlash against pinera has often forced him to change tone and promise to investigate cases of abuse he could have been the president who led the transition sajuria said but he doesn t have the credibility for that whatever happens pinera is likely to limp to the finish line of his term i don t think he will resign sajuria said it s not like his personality to do that we have a very presidential system and when that president is weak there is no easy way out of that power vacuum

in more respects than one mine was as beautiful a journey as it was heart wrenching i set out among other things with an express intention to get away from it all the unflinching patriot in me had just thrown in the towel and if only for a couple of weeks i resolved to shut my senses to edemon and all that mthulinomic gymnastics even as i boarded that plane there were no less than three inflation rates and simultaneously a furious denial on one hand and a hushed announcement on the other of the imminent arrival of an illegitimate cousin of the ever moribund bond note aka new zimbabwean dollar causing fresh waves of panic and pandemonium across the economy mathabelazitha the anvil by zii masiye in more respects than one mine was as beautiful a journey as it was heart wrenching i set out among other things with an express intention to get away from it all the unflinching patriot in me had just thrown in the towel and if only for a couple of weeks i resolved to shut my senses to edemon and all that mthulinomic gymnastics even as i boarded that plane there were no less than three inflation rates and simultaneously a furious denial on one hand and a hushed announcement on the other of the imminent arrival of an illegitimate cousin of the ever moribund bond note aka new zimbabwean dollar causing fresh waves of panic and pandemonium across the economy when i bragged of the apparent genius of mthuli ncube at banishing the publication of official inflation figures to control inflation perceptions i received a rather intriguing yet pretty apt analogy of the mthuli mentality drawing out his hand gloves as if to hold down my attention and resting his pointed chin momentarily on his bathroom mop the airport cleaner retorted look at it this way khiwa mthuli rides his bicycle to the bottle store across the village and buys himself a bottle of his favourite johnie walker whiskey and secures it ngerekeni onto the bicycle carrier shaking the bicycle in mock security test and engaging his prudent senses the minister reasons and weighs the potential disaster of the bottle breaking if he happens to hit a pothole slips and falls there and there a typical professor mn aha moment hits him no whiskey bottle will have to fall and break if he pre loads the entire contents into his belly now and here before embarking on the journey home after all that is the ultimate destination of the damn alcohol both mthuli and johnie walker would get home eureka like the lobby cleaner pointed out to me there is really no award for guessing the fate and great conclusion of the minister of his bicycle and that of his whiskey suffice to point out that in my kind of world and bar tenders barbours and lobby cleaners seem to understand this without any of my probing things are related in some logical sequence problems are solved by a simple systematic interrogation of the chain of factors that cause them by committing our energies to addressing those that we consider the underlying or structural causes that underpin the problem national hero oliver mtukudzi summed it aptly in that song where he preaches of the futility of continuously treating the symptoms a headache when you know the headache is merely reporting a deep seated chronic malfunction in your bowels if these little dots are so easily connected by everyday touts how does the simple science behind them so easily escape the wisdom of a whole government of celebrated professors it is a complete misunderstanding and wrong diagnosis of the problem when in response to the symptomatic challenge of medical practitioners being on strike you proceed to fire all of them just so you can derive some weird comfort in reporting that there is no doctor on strike in your country you can never make the dumbest of civil servants imagine they earn a decent wage by simply legislating against the use of the united states dollar as a benchmark they all know they don t earn figures but value my barber says in its warped logic this government has a propensity to cause the unwarranted death of its own citizens and then to host binge parties at their funeral wakes with the demented hope of fooling the citizens to embrace and celebrate their own endless funerals of the sensational renaming of roads across the country the barber reminds me of the pomp ceremony and celebratory village mood that necessarily comes with the arrival and christening of a child it is a momentous family milestone that marks the pinnacle of a long anxious and uncertain wait a victory over potential disaster amhlophe is the a jubilation and conquest of the community of nine months of maternal toil and potential fatal labour time christening and naming must be seen in the spirit of the celebration of a culmination of hard work and toil when out of the blue at the peak of social woes and economic wailing at the height of unprecedented road carnage when the national and local road network is in evident decline and we have done zilch to construct or reconstruct the barber thinks the naming of the patchworks of potholes and sinkholes after ourselves is akin to bringing a binge party to a funeral wake my great friend sifiso says this whole muppet show must remind us of statistics 101 when we were introduced to types of fallacies an example is where every accident is reported with a kilometre road marker government decides to remove the km road markers and boom accidents suddenly have nowhere to occur the problem of road accidents is solved by that immediate magic bullet stepping into a crammed tiny desert called israel and seeing the sprawling splendour of built environment of creative industry and booming commerce there s not a square metre of land that is undeveloped down in the valleys and up on all those rolling mountains the level of development productivity and self sufficiency in a virtual desert left me with a thousand unanswered questions how is it that a nation blessed with so much idle land so much natural resources so much education comes to rely on imports imported food imported beans maize imported toothpicks and cotton buds imported water and tissue paper and literally fails to farm and feed itself when such a tiny desert island as israel has been turned into absolute paradise the differences are jolting simply repulsive my friend sums up ours zimbabwe as a typical pseudo democracy of settled bandits therein is found zanu pf a small set of privileged landlords property ownwers on one hand and ourselves a massive group of tenants the citizens allowed rented occupancy and now and then to organise themselves into glorified tenants associations which they are happy to call political parties the shareholders have an appointed agent that masquerades as government which is there to routinely reign in troublesome tenants but fundamentally to insulate the owners from the headaches of dealing directly with errant tenants it is not uncommon that the tenants who regularly enjoy bthe opportunity to actually choose the estate agent fail to distinguish between the agent and the owner but whatever noise kuhukura the tenants are allowed the fundamental structure of ownership or shareholding shall remain with the owners and signatories of 263 never the tenants without clarity of the enduring demarcations such pseudo democracies have the knack to mutate into rashly celebrated governments of national unity fake and unsustainable paper power sharing arrangements that placate tenants for a while mini coups that routinely change the faces in charge but not the systems in charge and never deliver any palpable change replacement of estate agent or the tenants association executive always giving the false impression that greater benefit will one day accrue to the tenants relentless effort goes into futile interventions toothless commissions of enquiry peace and reconciliation galleries brokered deals to calm down irate owners fighting other owners and endless tail chasing efforts that have the appearance of democratic reform but absolutely do nothing to the structure of ownership or to ever address the real question of how to transition from owners and tanents to effective collective ownership of zimbabwe are we committed as a country to the dream of a true democracy or our collective ambition is simply to be happy tenants in our motherland forever lzii masiye writes elsewhere on social media as balancing rocks

washington elizabeth warren was supposed to be the thinking person s bernie sanders impeccably progressive but with realistic arithmetic connecting aspirations to resources then came her explanation of how she would finance medicare for all washington elizabeth warren was supposed to be the thinking person s bernie sanders impeccably progressive but with realistic arithmetic connecting aspirations to resources then came her explanation of how she would finance medicare for all before republicans wearied of pretending to care about fiscal rectitude they pretended that they could eliminate budget deficits by eliminating waste fraud and abuse a pledge that demonstrated their familiarity with fraud warren prices her medicare for all at 20 5 trillion in a decade which is 10 trillion to 14 trillion less than estimates from serious sources the rand corp the urban institute the mercatus center she makes audacious assumptions that would make republicans blush if they still could advertising for example 11 of her plan s cost will be covered by cutting payments to providers such as hospitals 35 below current private insurance rates and physicians 25 does her clairvoyance extend to how many of the former will then close and how many of the latter will retire she assumes that states and cities which cannot be compelled to do so will send to washington the 6 1 trillion they spend on health care she assumes that her administration can collect an additional 2 3 trillion by shrinking the tax gap i e reducing tax evasion a decades old aspiration in washington that would have been accomplished already if it were possible and so on and on warren cheerily says no one gets left behind some of the people currently working in health insurance will work in other parts of insurance in life insurance in auto insurance which supposedly will suddenly need the 370 000 people who today work in private health insurance she sees society as a tinkertoy for clever people like her to disassemble and reassemble shuffling around hundreds of thousands of people never has there been such a brittle prospective presidency warren is vain about the specificity of her plans for expanding the federal government s scope far beyond what either the new deal or great society envisioned yet the entire edifice of her transformation of society by government spending and fiats rests upon the rickety assumption that her proposed wealth tax is constitutional but because the constitution forbids direct federal taxes the 16th amendment was necessary to make the income tax possible warren s evident theory that the federal government can without an amendment impose a general tax on accumulated wealth implies that the term direct effectively prohibits nothing so the 16th amendment was unnecessary were her wealth tax to survive judicial review and were it to have its intended effect of steadily shrinking the supply of billionaires who then would fund progressivism s agenda the spending commitments would remain in place so where would government then go for revenues to where most of america s money is the middle class warren whose profile in courage is to foment hostility toward a small minority billionaires should try an experiment not at her rallies of the resentful but with an audience of representative americans ask how many in the audience own an apple product the overwhelming majority will raise their hands then ask how many resent the fact that steve jobs apple s innovator died a billionaire few hands will be raised few americans know but most intuit what economist william d nordhaus a nobel laureate argues in a 2004 paper innovators capture only about 2 2 of the surplus from innovation the surplus is basically the innovation s value to society minus the cost of producing it warren s dependence on a wealth tax announces progressivism s failure of nerve its unwillingness to require anyone other than a tiny crumb of society s upper crust to pay significantly for the cornucopia of benefits that she clearly thinks everyone wants but only if someone else pays for them the way warren has cooked the books regarding her health care financing testifies to donald trump s success in normalizing preposterousness candidate trump breezily promised to erase the national debt in eight years which would have required retiring 2 4 trillion a year a sum equal to 55 of the fiscal 2019 budget warren s politically socially and economically surreal bookkeeping is more egregious than his because she is intelligent enough to know better and because she used ingenuity which he does not possess to disguise her disingenuousness her cachet has been intellectual gravitas supposedly demonstrated by blueprints for refurbishing everything suddenly the thinking person s bernie sanders seems more like progressivism s trump exacerbating social hostilities and playing fast and loose with facts markets for which warren has minimal respect are information generating mechanisms and america s political market is working her medicare for all plan provides indispensable information not about governance but about her
when gavin newsom became california s governor he announced a bold goal of solving the state s 3 5 million home shortage by 2025 but there s one major problem cities across the state are only planning for about 2 8 million new housing units what s more many of the areas where those 2 8 million new homes are allowed to rise based on current city planning documents are rural where demand for housing is less and jobs remain a long car ride away according to a 2019 report from the ucla lewis center for regional policy studies but one nonprofit says closing that housing shortage gap and more as well as increasing the state s gdp and reducing car travel is within reach for the state if local policymakers rethink traditional zoning trends up for growth advocates that california adjust the types of developments it plans for and the locations to better match what it calls accessible growth in the most high demand transit rich areas image courtesy of up for growth specifically washington d c based housing thinktank up for growth encourages building more mid rise and higher density housing near transit which may mean increasing the density in and around some single family neighborhoods and places with the most jobs we re really shifting more from the low density single family format to more of a middle density said michael kingsella executive director at up for growth so whether that s mid rise podium four or five story mid rise buildings in downtown or transit center locations to the missing middle typologies like adu s duplexes triplexes and cottage clusters the pitch delivered during the annual silicon valley economic development alliance convention in santa cruz this month comes as housing remains one of the top issues for california leaders grappling with how to address rising rents that are pushing people out of their homes and into the streets or to cities far from their jobs or support networks while the problem is obvious fixing the issue is not so clear cut as the ucla report points out even if 3 5 million homes were currently allowed to rise across the state only a fraction of the number of city planned homes ever get built sometimes those homes are permitted to rise in areas where people aren t eager to live so developers aren t eager to build for instance sometimes developments shrink in size due to land use policies like parking requirements or community opposition to get 3 5 million homes rising in the state cities must plan for many more than that and they must be planned for areas where people want to live the ucla report states the limited new housing construction in california in the face of increasingly high rents and prices presents a challenge high demand communities do not plan for or permit housing and planned capacity in low demand areas remains unbuilt the report says that s up for growth s entire pitch plan for growth in targeted high demand areas which would mean upzoning those areas allowing more duplexes and triplexes to integrate with single family homes to push forward more high density projects near transit than the state does today but it s not quite that easy proposing such changes can be a tenuous position for politicians and community advocates who need buy in from local homeowners it would also be a significant change for california which has been producing less housing per capita than ever before according to up for growth data california has been created far fewer homes than in the past not keeping pace with household formation in the state source u s census bureau and hud image courtesy of up for growth even so san jose mayor sam liccardo said in july he supports banning single family developments near commercial corridors and transportation hubs let s face it most of the bay area is still suburban liccardo said in a panel with other city mayors at the time you got lots of family housing and you re not going to bulldoze it to go build apartments at least not if you don t want them to burn down city hall like up for growth liccardo doesn t advocate for upzoning everywhere but supports allowing the construction of medium density buildings such as duplexes triplexes or fourplexes in certain residential areas especially around transit and job centers while some cities and states including minneapolis minnesota and the state of oregon have already made moves to overhaul and effectively upzone single family areas to allow more duplexes and triplexes the idea is still controversial kingsella said that is really difficult to move those kinds of policies at the city council level because the constituents it s human nature are reticent to change he said what oregon did as the first in the nation as a legislature taking this issue on and doing it at a statewide level really provided necessary cover to get that solution to scale in communities across that state but even as up for growth advocates for cities to rethink their growth plans kingsella acknowledges there is no silver bullet to address the housing crisis caused by a mix of longtime land use and tax policies extraordinary job growth an unprecedented long economic upturn and rising building costs among other factors other efforts around the bay area to push forward development are also part of the solution including the major companies that have promised new grants loans and land as part of a commitment to help spur the development of thousands of new homes in the region kingsella said kaiser permanente for instance was one of the first major companies this year to announce a housing and homelessness commitment as the oakland based health care giant with locations across the bay area aimed to improve health outcomes for its patients from a systems perspective we know that people who are unstably housed or are unsheltered live 27 years fewer than people who are stably housed angela jenkins director of strategic initiatives at kaiser permanente said during the sveda panel we know that people who are unstably housed utilize the system at three to four times higher rates than those who are stably housed kaiser also partnered with bay area community services and launched an initiative that focused on finding affordable housing for 515 homeless seniors in oakland with a chronic health condition the organizations achieved that goal quickly if california s housing deficit were filled up for growth estimates housing prices would be more than 20 percent lower across the state image courtesy of up for growth if further analysis of the initiative proves the effort was effective in achieving various goals the company would likely consider expanding the program to other areas that kaiser serves jenkins said in an interview after the panel in the meantime bay area companies and public officials continue to work on various initiatives to address the housing shortage and newsom pushes to get 3 5 million homes built in a state where currently only 2 8 million are allowed to rise it s a market failure that limits economic mobility for low income households and carries with it environmental costs meaning that more cars are on the road kingsella said housing ultimately is at the intersection of community development and economic development and the broken housing ecosystem undermines the objectives of both of those areas of work contact janice

spread the love the international monetary fund imf has lowered its sub saharan africa growth projectiosn to 3 2 this year and 3 6 in 2020 from its april figures due to trade and growing domestic policy uncertainties by tatira zvinoira these figures were from its april 2019 world economic outlook weo report where the bretton woods institution had projected sub saharan africa s economic growth to be 3 5 and 3 7 for 2019 and 2020 respectively the reasons behind the drop in figures were weather shocks and uncertainty in the commodities markets yet despite this finance minister mthuli ncube in the 2020 budget said key growth restoration drivers would be agriculture and mining where he is expecting a 5 and 4 7 growth respectively as such government needs to be reminded why it may have to relook at its plan of pulling zimbabwe out of recession and register its envisioned 3 recovery growth the imf projected that zimbabwe s economy would contract by 7 1 by yearend before rebounding by 2 7 next year ncube has used agriculture as a key growth driver as the sector plays a key role in zimbabwe contributing 11 to the total gross domestic product gdp and is the main source of livelihoods for around 67 of the country s population according to the agriculture survey 2019 whose results were released early this year 70 of zimbabwe s population is directly dependent on agriculture with supplies from this sector contributing the bulk of raw materials to manufacturing but due to the rising temperatures agriculture has become greatly hampered as the rise of warmer conditions has translated into lower yields in recent years for example the united nations environment programme unep emissions gap report 2019 released last tuesday says by the end of the century global temperatures are expected to be 3 2 degrees celsius warmer even if climate targets are met and if this revelation is taken alongside a book by the national research council titled climate stabilisation targets emissions concentrations and impacts over decades to millennia 2011 the world will face severe consequences from these temperatures on southern africa the book found that these warming temperatures would translate into 5 10 less rainfall per degree resulting in more dry spells in the region already there has been a large increase in the frequency of drought conditions compared to the 14 year average with the 2018 19 season being one of the worst in over a decade in zimbabwe drought has left 60 of the 14 million population food insecure as a result of warming temperatures both crop and livestock farming have seen capacity reduced by half another challenge facing agriculture is poor funding mainly as a result of most farm owners lacking title deeds and as such access to bank loans in zimbabwe all farming land is owned by the state which issues farmers with 99 year leases however banks have refused to recognise the instruments as security mainly because they are not tradable while government has promised to address the land ownership question it is still yet to do so despite implementing the land reform programme in 2000 with all these reasons agriculture can no longer be a cornerstone of this once vibrant agricultural producing economy ncube is expecting mining the sector to rebound by 4 7 next year however according to american think tank the center for strategic and international studies sub saharan african countries are being impacted by the global trade wars this is due to increased us tariffs on china which has precipitated drops in commodity prices these drops could significantly reduce returns from zimbabwe s minerals such as gold diamonds and platinum the findings were bolstered by african development bank experts who warned that the trade tensions could cause a 2 5 reduction in the gdp in resource intensive african countries the reason why commodity prices drop in periods of trade uncertainty is due to investors moving into financial markets which are largely seen as safer havens for their investment already the imf has predicted the oil dependent nations of angola and nigeria to see economic declines while the more mineral reliant south africa is also expected to see subdued growth as such if bigger and more commodity dependent nations are expected to take a beating to their economies what more of zimbabwe the standard share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading

it s no secret that aviation has come in for a good deal of scrutiny and criticism over its environmental impacts the flight shaming phenomenon and proposals for a green new deal that would reduce and even replace air travel with other modes of transport have been in the news around the world not just in europe and the united states where they respectively originated less well known is that environmental sustainability has always been high on aviation s agenda today s new aircraft emit 50 less carbon monoxide and 90 less smoke and unburned hydrocarbons than those made 50 years ago while carbon emissions from the average journey are actually half what they were in 1990 moreover since 2008 the industry including airlines airports equipment manufacturers and air navigation services providers has had a goal to address its 2 share of human caused co 2 by capping net emissions from 2020 and cutting them in half by 2050 compared with 2005 levels in 2016 nations of the world working through the international civil aviation organisation icao the specialised body of the united nations devoted to civil aviation agreed to the vision of carbon neutral growth from 2020 the mechanism to achieve it is the carbon offset and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia at the recently completed 40th icao assembly member nations reconfirmed their commitment to corsia in addition icao will now start looking at a long term aspirational goal to cut emissions so governments and industry will be aligned these are momentous developments for the environment for everyone who flies and for the aviation industry demonstrating a commitment to sustainability is critical to earning aviation s licence to grow and without growth aviation cannot spread its many economic and social benefits this is particularly important in developing nations where access to air connectivity is crucial to 15 of the un s 17 sustainable development goals simply put flying is freedom and that freedom continues to spread this year travellers can choose from 22 375 unique city pairs connected by air that s more than double the number available in 1998 concurrently flying is becoming more affordable and accessible to more people the average return fare in 2019 before surcharges and tax is forecast to be 61 lower than in 1998 after adjusting for inflation young people in emerging economies have exposure to travel opportunities that their parents could only have dreamed of at the same age travellers can also fly with confidence because aviation is the safest form of long distance travel the world has known aviation makes globalisation possible and globalisation leads to economic development since 1990 globalisation has lifted one billion people out of poverty the more people who enjoy the freedom to fly the greater the benefits to all the people as with any human activity there is an environmental cost but flying is not the enemy carbon is in capping emissions it is forecast that corsia will mitigate about 2 5 billion tonnes of co 2 and generate more than 40 billion in climate finance between 2021 and 2035 and the industry is not sitting still aviation has also taken the lead in identifying testing and certifying sustainable alternative fuels which we believe can reduce aviation s carbon footprint by 80 we have proved they work now we need governments to build supportive policies to invigorate the sustainable fuels industry down the road new technologies such as electric aircraft will also play a role
