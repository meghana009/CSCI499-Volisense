us will increase pressure on hong kong in an attempt to cripple china s growing tech influence behind the huawei story we must not forget there is a wider financial war being waged by america against china and russia stories about china s banks being short of dollars are incorrect the shortage is of inward capital flows to support the us government s budget deficit by attracting those global portfolio flows instead china s belt and road initiative threatens us government finances so the financial war and associated disinformation can be expected to escalate hong kong is likely to be in the firing line due to its role in providing china with access to international finance hong kong in trouble last week the wall street journal published an article claiming china s banks are running out of dollars clearly this is untrue china s banks can acquire dollars any time they want either by selling other foreign currencies in the market or by selling renminbi to the people s bank they have their dollar position because they choose to have it and furthermore all commercial banks use derivatives which are effectively off balance sheet exposure furthermore with the us running a substantial trade deficit with china dollars are flooding in all the time following the wsj article various other commentators have come up with similar stories how convenient it seems for the us government to see these bearish stories about china just when they need to ramp up inward portfolio flows to finance the budget deficit there is anyway a general antipathy among american investors to the china story so we should not be surprised to see the china bears restating their case one leading china bear at least by reputation for his investment shrewdness is kyle bass of hayman capital management according to zero hedge he has written his first investment letter in three years saying of hong kong today newly emergent economic and political risks threaten hong kong s decades of stability these risks are so large they merit immediate attention on both fronts if only it were so simple it is time to put the alternative case hong kong is important because china uses hong kong and london to avoid being dependent on the us banking system for international finances and that s why the us s deep state want to nail hong kong lop sided analysis bass is correct in pointing out the hong kong property market appears highly geared and that property prices for office residential and retail sectors have rocketed since the 2003 trough to a large extent it has been the inevitable consequence of the currency board link to the us dollar which broadly transfers the fed s inflationary monetary policy to hong kong s more dynamic economy bass s description of the relationship between the banks the way they finance themselves and property collateral is reminiscent of the factors that led to the secondary banking crisis in the uk in late 1973 empirical evidence appears to be firmly on bass s side except that is for a significant difference between events such as the uk s secondary banking crisis and virtually every other property crisis hong kong is a truly international center and the banks role in property transactions is as currency facilitator rather than lender in 2017 hong kong was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment substantially property after the us and china fdi inflows rose by 104bn to total nearly 2 trillion largest investors were china followed by corporate money channeled through offshore centers so yes hong kong banks will be hurt by a property crisis but not as much as bass implies it is foreign and chinese banks that have much of the property as collateral it is not the hong kong banks that have fueled the property boom with domestic credit but foreign money bass fails to mention that a collapse in property prices and the banking system is unlikely to be confined to hong kong central banks have made significant progress in ensuring all banking systems are tied into the same credit cycle unwittingly they have simply guaranteed that the next credit crisis will hit everyone at the same time it won t be just hong kong but the eu japan britain and america everyone will be in difficulty to a greater or lesser extent interestingly the lehman crisis which occurred after hong kong property prices had already doubled from 2003 caused strong inflows to develop driving the hong kong dollar to the top of its peg the situation appears to be similar today with us outward investment at low levels but near record levels of foreign ownership of dollar assets despite hong kong s foreign direct investment standing at 2 trillion the prospect of capital repatriation to hong kong should not be ignored probably the most important claim in bass s letter is over the future of the currency peg operated by the hong kong monetary authority hkma he claims that the aggregate balance which is a line item in the hkma s balance sheet is the equivalent of the us fed s excess reserves and that once depleted the pressure on the currency board will become untenable and the peg will break the aggregate balance on the hkma s balance sheet has declined significantly over the last year from hk 180bn to hk 54 4bn currently the decision about changes in aggregate balances comes from the banks themselves and for this reason they are commonly taken to reflect capital flows into and out of the hong kong dollar this is different from aggregate balances reflecting actual pressures on the peg as suggested by bass the hkma maintains a us dollar coverage of 105 112 5 of base money currently about 110 and has further unallocated dollar reserves if necessary the peg is maintained by the hkma varying its base money not just by managing a base lending rate giving a spread over the fed s fund rate not just by influencing the commercial banks aggregate balances but by addressing the three other components that make up the monetary base these are certificates of indebtedness government notes and coins in circulation and exchange fund bills and notes efbns in practice it is the efbns in conjunction with the aggregate balances that are used to adjust the monetary base and keep the currency secured in the convertibility zone of 7 75 and 7 85 to the us dollar in maintaining the peg the hkma prioritizes maintaining it over managing the money supply there is little doubt this goes against the grain of mainstream western economists who believe inflation good deflation bad over the last year base money in hong kong contracted from hk 1 695bn to hk1 635bn does this worry the hkma not at all how the chinese will act in the circumstances of a new global credit crisis is yet to be seen but we should bear in mind that they are probably less keynesian in their approach to economics and finance than westerners admittedly they have freely used credit expansion to finance economic development but theirs is a mercantilist approach which differs significantly from ours we simply impoverish our factors of production through wealth transfer by monetary inflation we think this can be offset by fueling financial speculation and asset inflation china enhances her production and innovation by generating personal savings wealth is created by and linked more directly to production the objectives and effects of monetary and credit inflation between china s application of it and the way we do things in the west are dissimilar and it is a common mistake to ignore these differences the threat to china s ability to manage its affairs in a credit crisis is significantly less than the threat to western welfare dependent nations whose governments are highly indebted while china s is not china is sure to see the financial and monetary stability of hong kong as being vital to the mainland s interests apart from the bank of china s hong kong subsidiary being the second largest issuer of bank notes the peoples bank itself maintains reserve balances in hong kong dollars which in the circumstances kyle bass believes likely they can increase to support the hkma s management of the currency peg conclusions it is a mistake to think the hong kong property market is as much of a systemic danger as it first appears expectations of a devaluation of the peg appear to be wishful thinking by the bears far more important are the consequences of the cyber and financial war being pursued against china and russia its close ally by the american deep state under president trump it was accelerated by his trade tariff policies which are fundamentally an attack on china s economy china will be a hard nut to crack and the effect of america s trade protectionism has been to trigger a diminution in international trade which is now becoming apparent the negative effects on the american economy appear to be being underestimated the attempt to destroy huawei s 5g global ambitions is both the current and most visible part of an undeclared cyber and financial war trade protectionism was only a step along the way the financial war is now escalating with the global economy facing at least a significant recession almost certain to trigger an overdue credit crisis the chinese have long been on a financial war footing as shown by qiao liang s analysis of how america needs global portfolio flows and what they are prepared to do to attract them western thinking that the chinese and their russian allies are vulnerable to american hegemony has been disproved time and again financial analysts consistently fail to understand the chinese are not muppets china will not be provoked and by standing firm they are sure to protect hong kong and get on with diverting investment flows from a failing us economy into its belt and road initiative this will force a financial crisis on the americans of their own making at least that s how china has always seen it and they see no need for

officials said on sunday adviser to prime minister on finance hafeez shaikh told the state run television that he hopes the accord which must still be approved by the imf board in washington will be the last for pakistan which has had repeated bailouts for the past three decades pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lackluster growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position the imf said in a statement outlining the framework of a deal reached after months of negotiations the package will include an ambitious structural reform agenda to boost growth which the imf sees slowing to 2 9 percent this year from 5 2 percent last year it also envisages tax reforms to improve public finances and cut public debt as well as a comprehensive plan for cost recovery in the creaking energy sectors where mounting debt backlogs have acted as a growing drain on government resources the imf team has reached a staff level agreement on economic policies that could be supported by a 39 month extended fund arrangement eff for about us 6 billion the imf announced in a press release the international lender said it aims to support the federal government s structural reform agenda during the next three years this includes improving public finances and reducing public debt through tax policy and administrative reforms to strengthen revenue mobilization and ensure a more equal and transparent distribution of the tax burden it said the forthcoming budget for fy2019 20 is a first critical step in the authorities fiscal strategy the budget will aim for a primary deficit of 0 6 percent of gdp supported by tax policy revenue mobilization measures to eliminate exemptions curtail special treatments and improve tax administration this will be accompanied by prudent spending growth aimed at preserving essential development spending scaling up the benazir income support program and improve targeted subsidies with the goal of protecting the most vulnerable segments of society it added the imf said the state bank of pakistan will focus on reducing inflation and safeguarding financial stability the state bank of pakistan will focus on reducing inflation which disproportionately affects the poor and safeguarding financial stability a market determined exchange rate will help the functioning of the financial sector and contribute to a better resource allocation in the economy the authorities are committed to strengthening the state bank of pakistan s operational independence and mandate the imf press release said speaking on the state tv

and their hospitality the imf statement concluded speaking to the ptv the adviser said imf is an international institution whose primary job is to assist member countries who are in an economic difficulty adding that the government could not have bridged the financing gap of 12 billion on its own that he said was created by a weak economy besides the imf assistance pakistan will also receive additional funds worth nearly 2 3 billion from institutions like the world bank and the asian development bank the adviser revealed asked whether this would be pakistan s last imf programme he said it depends on how successfully we as a country implement this programme and approach it as a reform or structural change programme instead of a mere revenue earning programme islamabad and a visiting imf mission had kicked off technical level talks on april 29 to sort out details of the proposed bailout package over the next 10 days the two sides were scheduled to conclude a staff level agreement on friday but the talks were extended into the weekend with the finance ministry reporting good progress in the discussions the finance ministry had approached the imf in august 2018 for a bailout package whereas last month the then finance minister asad umar announced that the two sides had more or less reached an understanding on a package for bailing out the country s ailing economy prime minister imran khan s government came to power last year reluctant to seek what is now expected to be its 13th imf bailout since the late 1980s inheriting an economy with yawning budget and current account deficits his government initially sought billions of dollars in funding from friendly countries including china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates but with inflation climbing to over 8 percent the pakistani rupee losing a third of its value over the past year and foreign exchange reserves barely enough to cover more than two months of exports it was forced to turn to the fund

by amy s wouldn t it be horrible if the number of americans without a job was higher today than it was during the economic collapse of 2008 and 2009 well that is actually true as you will see below nearly 102 million americans do not have a job right now and at no point during the last recession did that number ever surpass the 100 million mark of course the u s population has grown a bit over the last decade but as you will see below the percentage of the population that is engaged in the labor force is only slightly above the depressingly low levels from the last economic collapse and recession sadly the truth is that the rosy employment statistics that you are getting from the mainstream media are manufactured using smoke and mirrors and by the time you are done watching this video you will understand what is really going on at this moment we are told that only 6 2 million americans are officially unemployed and that sounds really really good but that is only half the story what the mainstream media rarely mentions is the fact that the number of americans categorized as not in the labor force has absolutely exploded since the last economic crisis right now that number is sitting at 95 577 million when you add 6 2 million officially unemployed americans to 95 577 million americans that are categorized as not in the labor force you get a grand total of almost 102 million americans that do not have a job right now if that sounds terrible to you that is because it is terrible yes the u s population has been growing over the last decade and that is part of the reason why the number of americans not in the labor force has been growing but overall the truth is that the level of unemployment in this country is not that much different than it was during the last recession and economic collapse according to john williams if honest numbers were being used the unemployment rate would actually be 21 2 percent today next let s talk about inflation if inflation was still calculated the way that it was in 1990 the inflation rate would be 6 percent today instead of about 2 percent and if inflation was still calculated the way that it was in 1980 the inflation rate would be about 10 percent today if accurate inflation numbers were being used we would still be in a recession right now just like the last economic collapse we could potentially see millions of middle class americans quickly lose everything once economic conditions start getting really bad the economy is not going to get any better than it is right now as you look forward to the second half of 2019 i would make plans for rough sailing ahead as the old joke has it i ve predicted five of the last two financial crises but this time i m not the only person getting alarmed about the current volatility in financial markets plenty of serious congenitally bullish commentators are getting anxious too one thing everyone seems to agree on is that the current crisis if that s what it is looks a bit different we are in the proverbial uncharted waters it seems does history offer a guide in such circumstances a number of big lessons emerged from the great depression even if they have generally been studiously ignored by subsequent generations one of the biggest was that we should never leave the financial sector to its own devices poorly regulated banks helped trigger the 1929 stockmarket crash by lending to speculators the subsequent collapse of many badly run financial institutions intensified the subsequent crisis in the aftermath of the great depression john maynard keynes among others argued that the financial sector was so important that it needed to be closely monitored and regulated for a while it was but the winding back of the glass steagall act in the us opened the door for a new generation of financial actors to dream up innovations from which they and the institutions they represented directly benefited generally at the expense of the rest of us 10 lessons from people who lived through the depression over the four years beginning in the summer of 1929 financial markets labor markets and goods markets all virtually ceased to function throughout this the government policymaking apparatus seemed helpless since the end of the great depression macroeconomists have labored diligently in an effort to understand the circumstances that led to the wholesale collapse of the economy what lessons can we draw from our study of these events i argue that the federal reserve played a key role in nearly every policy failure during this period and so the major lessons learned from the great depression concern the function of the central bank and the financial system in my view there is now a broad consensus supporting three conclusions first the collapse of the finance system could have been stopped if the central bank had properly understood its function as the lender of last resort second deflation played an extremely important role deepening the depression and third the gold standard as a method for supporting a fixed exchange rate system was disastrous in the decades preceding the great depression the world s economies had been trending toward globalization countries reduced barriers to trade and capital flows as more nations became integrated into a rapidly expanding world economy it set the stage for modern economic growth by the early 1900s more people enjoyed political as well as economic freedom than at any other time in history we witnessed further expansion of this epoch in america s response to an economic collapse in 1920 a crisis with employment and production conditions worse than those at the start of the great depression president warren harding came into office and encouraged the federal reserve s necessary courageous deflation policy that strangled out inflation and restored confidence in the dollar as a currency though president harding s trade policies were far from ideal he cut government spending by nearly half lowered tax rates and reduced our debt by a third within two years unemployment dropped back below the pre depression level to 2 4 percent policymakers took a very different tact in response the financial crisis which hit on october 29 1929 the smoot hawley tariff passed by congress in the early 1930s triggered beggar thy neighbor trade policies in other countries raising taxes on tens of thousands of imported goods between 1929 and 1932 federal spending jumped by 49 percent additionally the fed failed to provide stability to our monetary system resulting in the collapse of the u s banking system the u s didn t fully recover from the depression until the mid 1940s more than a decade after it began this expansion of state intervention in both the u s and abroad set the stage for fascism and dictatorships that eroded hard fought political and economic liberties that brings us back to today to date the policies implemented to combat the 2008 crisis bear much more similarity to those of the 30s than 20s the federal government has incurred more than 7 trillion in deficits over the past decade and continues to accumulate debt at an unsustainable rate the fed has committed to bond purchases that will pump an additional two trillion dollars into the economy to finance this growing budget gap the combination of such irresponsible fiscal and monetary policies threatens to erode confidence in the dollar as a reserve currency as the value of the dollar erodes other countries respond with their own currency manipulation it isn t difficult to see shades of the great depression in the great recession and in today s volatile economy high unemployment staggering debt and stocks that well see the august 10th cover of the new york post who put it best still the hardship of the late 1920s and the 1930s has yet to be replicated on such a grand scale the 25 unemployment rate was a reality back then but corners were cut ends were met and the generation that lived through it still stands as a testament to getting past tough times some of the men and women of the great depression are still around today and perhaps it s time to turn to them for inspiration here s a list of 10 ideas that were formed during that era that may help us recover as well as remind us that hey it could be worse if you ve got it use it wanda bridgeforth was hit hardest on the home front as a child when her parents couldn t afford to keep her with them at one point she lived with 19 people in a six room house it was in these situations that she learned to conserve what she had and reuse what she found we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and they say well what are you going to use this for and i say i don t know but i m going to use it bridgeforth told npr today individuals and companies would be wise to heed this advice we can find resources in unlikely places whether in the the scrap heap or the ideas of the unpaid college intern review the facts while some figures put the number of people unemployed as even higher than the numbers during the great depression the widespread feeling of despair not to mention the sheer numbers of actual starvation poverty and unemployment was much higher during the 1920s and 30s than during the aughts 1929 to 1932 saw a 50 percent drop in national income and in 1933 almost 25 percent of the work force was unemployed there were food shortages to go along with thousands of people filing for bankruptcy today s numbers frankly speak more to recession than depression grow your own while small farmers suffered greatly during the great depression those who could generate their own food in small gardens were able to supplement their diet with fresh fruits and vegetables urban subsistence gardens on rooftops in vacant lots or backyards became particularly useful during this era there were over 20 000 of these gardens in gary indiana alone self reliance especially when it comes to feeding yourself is an invaluable tool recession or not cash not credit debt is a bit of a dirty word for people during the depression it s an idea that carries over into today save and share rubilee craig 5 years old in 1932 advised not a big fan of credit cards she also said that gold and silver gives you a reserve and sometime maybe the paper money won t be good while we don t suggest throwing away your paper money taking on more debt in times like these might be digging yourself deeper than you can pull yourself out if you have to move on some cities and states have higher unemployment rates than others same goes for certain businesses the great depression was a time for striking out a new path if the old one turned up short while some stories are less successful than others such as paul satko s journey up to alaska in a wooden ark the lesson remains don t be afraid to go where the opportunity is rather than waiting for it to come to you keep morale high surviving alone is no way to live people during the great depression despite little to no spending money and virtually no money for entertainment found cheap ways to find distraction and diversion there were radio programs such as president roosevelt s fireside chats and live concerts put on by people who had plenty of free time on their hands marie tubbs remembered fondly the concerts put on by her father a violinist in michigan how clearly i remember out of the depths of dark feelings springing from closed banks and no work the wonderful sensation that comes from something more than bread alone keeping morale high with music for example is an integral part of living during trying economic times know a deal when you see it whether it was making your own clothes growing your own food or repairing your own commodities people found ways to cut down on spending gladys cole talked aboutbuying fabric from the 5 and 10 cent store in order to sew her own clothes they recycled everything i tell you everything she said deals are everywhere from buying in bulk to websites like groupon that offer daily deals be sure to scope out the deals that you can take advantage of and do all you can to take advantage of them diversify and build businesses that worked well before the depression for example a e schmidt s billiard table manufacturing suffered once disposable income took a hit to compensate the schmidt family turned to making toilet seats and looked to increase billiard business by contacting a new client the u s commerce department to which they sold billiard tables for works camps when old revenue streams dry up don t despair attempts can be made to diversify your business by finding new clients new products or a new business altogether while staying within your means stick together despite stories of petty larceny and selfishness amongst neighbors there are countless tales of communities banding together during tough times robert hoffman remembered the kindness of the neighborhood grocer extending credit when a paycheck hadn t gone through tomorrow i could lose everything but somehow i m not afraid i really am not dusko condic grew up as one of eight children on the south side of chicago during the depression reports npr at one point his widowed mother couldn t afford to keep their house and all nine family members were put out on the street it was only the help of neighbors and friends that kept them alive the swagger and grit that grew out of those memories helps keep dusko confident in the future tomorrow i could lose everything but somehow i m not afraid i really am not he told npr this is perhaps the most important lesson of all if possible try not to worry things have been worse and they will get better

menafn gulf times the real effective exchange rate reer may sound arcane to non economists but it is one of the most important international financial indices the reer is a summary index that tracks the difference in the prices of goods produced by a country and its trading partners other things being equal an increase in a country s reer indicates a loss of trade competitiveness and rising current account imbalances are often associated with deviations in the reer from equilibrium values given the reer s importance for economic policy in the current trade discussions between the united states and china for example central banks and international financial institutions devote considerable resources to calculating and analysing it but their methods have become outdated as global value chains gvcs become increasingly widespread we therefore recently proposed a new reer calculation with zhi wang that addresses the current shortcomings standard calculations of the reer by most central banks and statistical agencies assume that countries export only final goods but gvcs spread the different stages of production among different countries they can do so thanks to technological improvements lower trade barriers and the closer integration of emerging markets into the global economy ignoring this reality can lead to substantial mismeasurement of the reer resulting in questionable policy inferences to see how the standard approach could be wrong consider a hypothetical value chain for the production of smartphones suppose japan manufactures the components and ships them to china where the phones are assembled and exported globally as finished products traditional reer models would assume that japan exports final goods to china and that the two countries are competitors a depreciation of the japanese yen therefore would help japan s competitiveness and hurt that of china in this case however a weaker yen would lower the price of japanese components which may lead to lower prices and increased demand for chinese phones leading to an improvement in china s competitiveness this example shows that the standard reer calculation is getting not only the magnitude wrong but also the direction of change our proposed framework addresses these problems it also provides reer measures for individual sectors within a country this makes it possible to assess the competitiveness of different parts of the economy and to determine which sectors are the main drivers of the overall reer taking gvcs into account alters our understanding of china s bilateral real exchange rate against the us dollar china has increased its global trade footprint massively following its accession to the world trade organisation in 2001 the us meanwhile has long blamed its rising current account deficit on the renminbi s allegedly undervalued exchange rate although china s gross exports to the us are sizeable china operates largely downstream in several gvcs this is exemplified in the production of smartphones and electronic goods as a result a large part of chinese exports represents value added embedded in parts and components from other countries besides china including a significant share coming from the us itself moreover us competitiveness relative to china depends more on prices in tradable sectors such as electronics than on those in non tradable parts of the economy like real estate but commonly used aggregate measures of the reer do not allow for these distinctions once these factors are taken into account our analysis shows that china s real exchange rate against the us dollar displays a pronounced and consistent appreciation trend by contrast the standard calculation shows a real depreciation of the renminbi in the period leading up to china s abandonment of its exchange rate peg in 2005 and then an exchange rate appreciation that is smaller than the traditionally measured one similarly for the eurozone our gvc exchange rate based measure implies that greece s loss of competitiveness or reer appreciation relative to germany was worse than the standard measure suggests and that greece s competitiveness in the period leading up to the eurozone crisis was thus worse this mismeasurement arose because the standard reer calculation was based on the extent to which germany s inflation rate differed from greece s but it underestimated the difference made by gvcs far from being a theoretical concept confined to economics textbooks the reer has significant real world relevance calculating it more accurately could reduce the risk of misguided economic policies and it may lead policymakers to reach some very different conclusions about which measures to pursue project syndicate nikhil patel is an economist at the bank for international settlements shang jin wei a former chief economist of the asian development bank is professor of chinese business and economy and professor of finance and economics at columbia university menafn1205201900670000id1098513024

constructive comments on trade negotiations by government officials late in the week rescued the stock market from a potential meltdown oxford economics said in a comment that said no deal with china was struck by the end of the week and a big hike in tariffs is on the books oxford said until a deal is secured the stage is set for heightened market turmoil bank of america merrill lynch said the last minute escalation of the us china trade war fits well into our no pain no deal framework ap once more to the brink according to bank of america s global economist ethan harris our long standing view on the trade war is that the trump administration wants deals and will compromise but only after it extracts the maximum concessions we have seen this pattern of big demands and moderate concessions play out repeatedly both the us and china want a deal but motivating the inevitable compromise requires some combination of market economic and political pain advertisement mr harris said recent economic and market news has emboldened both sides to trying and get a better deal china s equity market has improved dramatically and green shoots have appeared greatly improving their perceived negotiating position meanwhile us markets have fully recovered from the trade war sell off the data point to a soft landing and the fed has signalled that it will do what it takes to sustain a strong labor market and inflation pressure mr harris also said little wonder china is trying to back track and the trump administration is reacting strongly over the weekend ifm expands in us with 9

economist kaixin owyong our forecast is for a 5 unemployment rate in april with upside risk is based on our expectation for weak employment growth of 5k but a tick down in the participation rate she said job advertisements and our internal data suggest that employment was weak in april such that the unemployment rate could tick up to 5 1 if the unemployment rate prints at either 5 or 5 1 we believe this is consistent with the rba remaining on hold in june although it will retain its easing bias ms owyong also said if unemployment remains broadly steady we expect other labour market indicators wages nab survey job ads will determine the probability of a cut on that score we don t expect the wages data on wednesday to shift the policy dial our models suggest quarterly growth of

feldman our cfo northstar realty europe or nre is a new york stock exchange listed reit focused on prime european office properties following the recent sales activity we now own 15 properties in london paris and key german cities nre has made significant progress over the past 12 months completing over 1 billion of strategic asset sales crystallizing an approximate 17 irr for stockholders

14 irr in april we repaid the 81 million outstanding balance of cale street s preferred equity reducing our overall leverage to 36 we also continue to make progress with our expense savings initiatives that we anticipate being ahead of our stated targets before discussing nre s performance in detail i would like to make a few remarks regarding the macroeconomic environment and the european commercial real estate market the european economy continued to grow during the first quarter of 2019 albeit at a slower rate gross domestic product grew by 0 4 and 0 5 in the eurozone and european union respectively in april 2019 the international monetary fund revised its 2019 gdp forecast down to 1 3 for the eurozone and 1 6 for the eu citing weaker consumer and business confidence and softening investment most notably in italy although the european central bank appears willing to intervene to the extent required to sustain economic expansion in the region including through the safeguarding of favorable financing conditions consequently in april 2019 in response to weakening economic indicators the ecb stated its intention to maintain interest rates at 0 through 2019 and announced a new round of targeted long term loans to eurozone banks as of march eurozone inflation stood at 1 4 which is in line with the european commission s latest 2019 projection but below the medium term target of 2 unemployment continues to decline reaching 7 7 in march down from 8 5 the year earlier and the lowest level recorded in the eurozone since september 2008 u k economic growth remained subdued at 0 3 in the three months to february 2019 in line with the previous rolling period ongoing uncertainty regarding the outcome of brexit negotiations continued to weigh on sentiment and investment the imf revised its gdp forecast for the u k down by 0 3 to 1 2 for 2019 inflation has fallen from its peak of 3 1 in november 2017 to 1 9 in february 2019 easing the pressure on the bank of england to further increase interest rates at a potentially vulnerable time for the u k economy however the bank of england governor warned that future interest rate increases could be more frequent than current market expectations if there is inadequate resolution to the brexit impasse and economic growth and inflation continue to rise european commercial real estate investment volume stood at â 54 billion in the first quarter of 2019 22 below the same period in 2018 office remained the most sought after asset class representing approximately 38 of transaction volume prime property yields in some asset classes and markets softened slightly but remained at or close to historically low levels reflecting a significant premium to sovereign yields european office take up grew 7 year over year in the first quarter of 2019 highlighting the continued strength in the european occupier market sustained tenant demand coupled with a subdued new supply pipeline continued to apply downward pressure on historically low vacancy rates which decreased by 10 basis points to 6 in the first quarter the lowest level since 2002 and fueled rental growth which stood at 5 1 well above the 10 year average of 2 1 driven primarily by a limited supply of available stock german real estate investment reached â 14 billion in the first quarter 30 below the same period last year albeit the first quarter of 2018 recorded the second highest transaction volume for more than a decade office remained the most sought after asset class representing approximately 40 of total transaction volume vacancy across the top 6 german cities fell by a further 10 basis points to 3 6 during the first quarter fueling growth in prime rents which increased by 2 total u k investment volume stood at â 11 billion in the first quarter 16 below the same period last year central london office investment volume fell to â 1 5 billion a 35 decline compared to the same period last year driven primarily by continued uncertainty surrounding brexit take up in central london slowed in the beginning of 2019 however the amount of space under offer rose and was 24 above the 10 year average prime rents in both the city and west end increased by 2 quarter over quarter french investment volume was â 4 billion in the first quarter 4 below the same period last year with office representing over 50 of total transaction volume the paris occupational market remains robust with a vacancy rate of 1 6 turning the discussion back to nre i m pleased to report another positive quarter in which we continued to make significant progress to our stated operational initiatives as of march 31 2019 our 193 000 square meter portfolio comprised of 15 properties a mix of blue chip and other high quality tenants in key cities across europe the portfolio is 84 occupied and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6 2 years our portfolio our office portfolio comprised of 12 properties generated approximately 93 of our net operating income and was 97 occupied on a pro forma basis with the remaining average lease term of around 5 9 years our overall portfolio is valued at 1 2 billion based on the year end 2018 independent valuation by cushman wakefield during the first quarter we completed the sale of uhlandstrasse in frankfurt for 40 million 65 above our allocated purchase price including capex we also completed the sale of our two retail assets in germany werl and kirchheide together these three assets released approximately 23 million of net equity to nre after repayment of financing and transaction costs and crystallized an approximate 14 irr for stockholders over the last 12 months we have realized an aggregate of 17 irr through 10 strategic asset sales for a consideration of over 1 billion demonstrating our continued focus on generating value for stockholders through our deep knowledge of the markets we operate in focus on tenants and commitment to active asset management we also continue to make further progress to our stated cost saving initiatives being ahead of our stated targets keith will discuss this in further detail finally on april 23 nre entered into amendment number two of the amended and restated management agreement dated november 9 2017 with an affiliate of colony capital extending the triggering date from april 30 to june 30 2019 the strategic review

results keith feldman thank you mahbod good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter of 2019 earnings call during the first quarter 2019 nre reported net operating income or noi of 15 2 million looking at our same store sequential quarter over quarter operating performance on an fx adjusted basis and excluding the held for sale industrial asset in paris rental income increased by 100 000 or 0 9 reflecting indexation uplifts offset by partial vacancy in two assets one in paris and one in hamburg which is now fully leased same store quarter over quarter noi decreased by 200 000 or 1 5 due to the timing of certain nonrecoverable repairs and maintenance expenses incurred in the first quarter 2019 specifically in two assets the ic hotel in berlin and our office property in cologne same store year over year rental income decreased by 100 000 or 0 7 year over year rental income included indexation uplifts offset by the previously mentioned vacancies and the execution of certain value enhancing leases including a nine year lease extension with bnp at boulevard macdonald and a 10 year lease extension with baker tilly at valentinskamp same store year over year noi decreased by 260 000 or 1 8 driven by the previously mentioned nonrecoverable repairs and maintenance expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2019 for the first quarter of 2019 nre reported cash available for distribution or cad of 7 4 million or 0 15 per share a decline over last quarter predominantly due to the sale of trianon during the first quarter of 2019 we continued to make progress with our initiatives to reduce direct corporate expenses i m pleased to say that in addition to the 3 million of savings in other expenses and g a expenses in 2018 we remain on track to achieve an additional 2 million to 3 million of expense savings in 2019 which is ahead of the overall target of 5 million on a run rate basis after deducting mortgage debt and adjusting for cash and other balance sheet working capital items epra nav based on the year end 2018 independent valuation by cushman wakefield adjusted for currency movements was 20 48 per share as of march 31 2019 which was down from the prior quarter largely due to a decline in the euro as of march 31 2019 nre s overall leverage was 39 down from 53 a year earlier and our weighted average debt maturity was approximately 4 5 years in april we repaid the 81 million of seb preferred debt financing further reducing leverage to 36 as of april 24 we had 433 million of corporate liquidity including 70 million of availability under our credit facility and 363 million of unrestricted cash of which approximately 196 million was held in u s dollars on may 1 we declared a cash dividend of 0 15 per share of common stock this dividend is expected to be paid on may 17 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on may 13 overall we are pleased with the company s financial and operational performance in 2019 and look forward to updating you further in the quarters ahead operator please open up the call for questions question and answer session operator the first question comes from the line of bryan maher bryan maher question and it s kind of like a two part related question as it relates to the strategic review process and can give us any thoughts as to kind of how far along you are i mean it s been going on since november in your mind is it something that we re getting close to conclusion on it has one or two more quarters to go and the second part of that is you re sitting on over 360 million of cash which weighs on your ability to generate cad and thus the dividend is pushing up against earnings and how should we think about the dividend as we continue through this process if that cash is not redeployed mahbod nia it s mahbod here thank you for the question we re in the midst of a process that is very live and ongoing so i think it would be inappropriate for us to provide any comment on that at this stage so apologies that we won t be able to comment on that but the board firstly remains very focused and engaged and working with our advisers and as soon as that process has drawn to a conclusion we ll provide an update to the market with regard to the cash we are in a holding pattern while we wait for the conclusion of the strategic review so for now we are sitting on that cash you re absolutely right cash for the quarter was at 0 15 which is in line with the dividend we are utilizing that cash or holding that cash as efficiently as we possibly can for the time being and there s no intention really to at this stage adjust the dividend in any way until we have further until the process is concluded bryan maher okay and let s just to play devil s advocate here let s just say that nothing happens with the strategic review and you continue on due course so can you give us a little bit more color on what s going on in supply and demand metrics in your key markets and if there been any real changes to the bid ask spreads between assets which would slow your ability to redeploy the cash should you end up going that route mahbod nia yes again i m not going to really speculate on the direction of the outcome of the process but if you re asking whether we see opportunities generally across europe from an investment standpoint i think it probably won t surprise you that in the u k particularly we re starting to see some interesting opportunities arise given the uncertainty around brexit as it s certainly impacting sentiment if not yet the fundamentals and so some of the capital that would typically be directed towards the u k is being more patient and waiting for a resolution and that means that there are increasingly interesting opportunities that we re seeing here so of our three markets i would say that s the one that looks the most interesting today operator there are no there is one more question coming through there are no further questions coming through sorry we will hand over to mahbod nia now mahbod nia okay thank you well thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again in due course operator thank you for joining today s call you may now disconnect your handsets hosts please stay on the line

all it took was two lunchtime tweets last sunday sandwiched between posts complaining about the results of the kentucky derby and another gripe about angry democrats for investors around the world to rip up their playbooks for 2019 what has replaced those playbooks now that u s president donald trump has made good on his twitter threats to boost tariffs on 200 billion of imports from china well the new plans seem to still be works in progress written in pencil rather than ink exactly what has been priced into markets from the escalation of trade tensions and what still needs to be priced in is a riddle that investors the world over are urgently trying to solve and frustratingly attempts at answers tend to come in three parts depending on whether this latest escalation of tensions manages to trigger a trade agreement in the near term a longer period of back and forth brinkmanship or a full blown trade war the fx market is pricing trade tensions but not a trade war bank of america economists led by ethan harris wrote in a note importantly the markets could view brinkmanship as similar to a trade war in the short run by contrast we think the rates market is already pricing in something like the brinkmanship scenario which could continue for weeks a u s china agreement in the near term naturally would provide the best chance for traders to pick up the scraps of their old playbooks and tape them back together trump offered some hope of that scenario on friday afternoon by announcing on twitter of course that this week s talks with china were constructive and his relationship with chinese president xi jinping remains a very strong one but the two countries nonetheless remain deadlocked that tone had changed by saturday when trump took to twitter to say that the chinese may have felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent talks that it was better to drag their feet in hopes trump would lose the 2020 election and they d get a better deal from the democrats trump warned they would get far worse terms if a deal was negotiated in his second term the chance of a prolonged period of tensions has strategists conjuring up a wide variety of investment ideas credit suisse suggested a trade that benefits should the ishares msci emerging markets etf fall between 4 5 and 8 over the next month while ubs global wealth management decided to end its recommendation to overweight emerging market hard currency sovereign bonds the consensus appears to have gravitated toward the idea that prolonged or escalated tensions would cause this past week s trends to continue weakness in emerging market currencies and global equities gains in haven assets such as the japanese yen and u s treasuries and heightened volatility just about everywhere china s yuan thailand s baht and the philippine peso are the most at risk in a trade war according to a bloomberg intelligence model before the tweets heard round the world a central thesis in markets was that a trade deal and economic stimulus in china would boost riskier assets at the expense of havens causing treasury yields to rise in the second half of the year jim caron fixed income portfolio manager at morgan stanley investment management said in an interview now the thesis is that based on what we re seeing right now it seems as though china has backed out of a deal and why that s significant is that this isn t just something that can be fixed by a tweet he just can t untweet that caron said looking ahead he said i d argue that we have to believe that the surprises in the market are going to be more toward the downside than the upside he s not the only one bracing for more risk aversion investors need to be ready for the trade war to get worse before it gets better risking further weakness in stocks that were already vulnerable after strong gains to start the year shane oliver head of investment strategy and chief economist at amp capital wrote in a note miller tabak co equity strategist matt maley sounded a similar note of caution and said that a 10 drop in the s p 500 index from its recent high would not be out of the question so far the gauge has fallen less than 3 from its record high close at the end of april the stock market was already ripe for a pull back maley wrote to clients now that it s getting some negative news materially negative news it s even more ripe for a larger decline therefore we believe investors should not be trying to figure out whether the market will decline or not they should be trying to figure out how much it will fall meanwhile although u s china scenario analyses dominated the past week focus could quickly shift janelle woodward head of fixed income at bmo global asset management has an eye on the next potential target for tariffs european automakers the trump administration was expected to make a decision on the findings of a probe into the national security risks of european auto imports by may 18 we think there are a lot of options as far as extension or asking for a new investigation but this does seem something that hasn t gotten a lot of press given the situation with china she said and that s a situation that remains far from resolved with u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin confirming that there are right now no fresh talks on the calendar investors look set to remain at the mercy of left field pronouncements on trade by trump and others the uncertainty of policy outcomes complicates the calculus for portfolio managers said matt peron chief investment officer of city national bank which manages 39 billion in stocks and fixed income assets we know the scenarios but placing probabilities on outcomes becomes very difficult in addition there are retaliatory responses and offsets that make so called second order effects unpredictable

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news the trade stand off between the us and china just got interesting to everyone except the financial markets it is monday and the key bit of news is what hasn t happened china hasn t retaliated yet to the sharp rise in us tariffs imposed on friday which went on to us 200 bln of goods taking a 10 rate up to to 25 this imposition hasn t actually seemed to derail the talks themselves they have wrapped up now but both parties have agreed to meet this week in beijing equity bond and currency markets have all also reacted as though nothing significant has happened and things will be resolved soon china s necessary countermeasures haven t been imposed not yet at least the us itself has pushed out the timeline saying china must agree to what it wants within a month or face tariffs of all its exports to the us in the meantime the higher tariffs apply on the us 200 bln and of course it is the american importer who has to pay them and pass on the costs to the american consumer and that is a us 50 bln extra cost china exports about us ½ tln per year to the us or about 20 of all its exports the us exports about us 120 bln per year to china or about 10 of all its exports it seems the chinese don t see the current state of these negotiations as a breakdown just an expected bump and so far the financial markets seem to agree interestingly iron ore prices are back up near their recent highs and coking coal prices have also been rising recently these are not signs of fear in china even if you can discount the shanghai equity price rise as the result of instructed soe buying by the national team consumer inflation in the us has come in slightly less than expected but right on the fed s 2 target and slightly above on a core without food or petrol basis the april update to the us federal monthly budget shows expanding deficits for the twelve months to april this deficit is us 924 bln it is conceivable that this will rise to us 1 tln in the current fiscal year way earlier than expected and compared with 779 bln last year and 529 bln in the last year of the obama administration when it was apparently political evidence of fiscal mismanagement the trump administration looks like it will about double their deficit in just one term and in that period the deficit has gone from 2 7 of gdp to 4 8 of gdp and by the way that 50 bln in extra tariff income will hardly touch the sides of this deficit the trade spat is one reason the us deficit could get worse quickly their agriculture secretary said bigger longer subsidies for farmers are on the way to prop up the sector us grain stocks are surging as exports fall according to usda reports p32 other large production countries don t have that problem according to the usda in canada over the weekend they reported strong jobs growth with more than 106 000 new jobs gained and by far the most of them full time jobs their participation rate improved as well it was a result that was much better than expected in fact it is their best jobs gain in more than 40 years in europe german exports rose to over 118 bln in march catching analysts by surprise at the gain and cementing a strong gain for the quarter german imports rose even more strongly this is data that doesn t fit the narrative of global trade in trouble indonesia says it is wants to import more beef from argentina to reduce what it says is an unreasonable reliance on shipments from australia and new zealand in australia hsbc s economist paul bloxham has declared that the australian housing market is now at its bottom and prices and demand will start rising later this year and a new election promise has been launched by the coalition government promising to guarantee the deposits of first home buyers who have at least 5 but less than 20 to help them qualify to borrow to buy it would only be available for couples with an annual income of au 200 000 or less it is expected to cost the taxpayer au 500 mln it is also likely to sharply raise the risk of going under water quicker the s p500 ended last week with a 1 loss although they were unusually volatile both the european and shanghai markets also lost 1 on the week the ust 10yr yield is now at 2 47 and that is 6 bps lower in the week their 2 10 curve is now at 21 bps but their negative 1 5 curve is wider at 11 bps we will be keeping an eye on ust bond yields because it is being suggested that china may be able to retaliate effectively by decreasing its exposure to this market effectively pushing up us benchmark interest rates the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 73 and also down 8 bps over the week the china govt 10yr had an 11 bps fall in a week to 3 31 while the nz govt 10 yr is also down 7 bps this week now at 1 85 gold is at us 1 286 oz us oil prices are little changed today now just on us 61 50 bbl while the brent benchmark is at us 70 50 bbl in fact these are levels similar to those at the start of last week the kiwi dollar is little changed at 66 usc on the cross rates we unchanged at 94 2 auc against the euro we are similar at 58 8 euro cents that all makes the twi 5 little changed at 70 6 bitcoin burst into life over the weekend up almost us 1 200 and at one point reached us 7 578 it has since settled back and is now at us 7 103 which is 13 higher than where we left it on friday and a full 36 higher than at the start of the month market capitalisation also surged over us 100 bln this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here

us china trade war was the center of global focus last week markets were expecting a deal with chinese vice premier liu he visited washington instead trump announced to escalate to full blown level after china reneged on its commitments during the negotiations trump s decision was understandable even though it may not be agreed by most investors businesses and common people domestically and globally situation became worse as liu s visit ended with nothing but declaration that there were still substantial differences between the two sides trade war will likely drag on which should weigh on global market sentiments over the week yen ended as the strongest one on risk aversion naturally followed by swiss franc euro displayed a lot of resiliences and ended as the third strongest but it s strength might not sustain since it s know that eurozone economy in particular germany has been affected much by global trade tensions sterling ended as the weakest one on brexit impasse as politicians looked staying unwilling to find a compromise between themselves new zealand dollar was second worst performing after rbnz rate cut australian dollar was third even though rba refrained from lowering interest rates us china trade talks have not broken down but significant differences on issues of principle remain last week s us china negotiations ended with practically no progress but just confirmation that the tariff war will drag on new round of tariffs already took effect on friday and paperwork for tariffs on usd 325b in chinese goods has started for now no new round of talks is scheduled china s retaliations are awaited and could be announced any time soon chines vice premier liu he told reporters on friday that the negotiations have not broken down he also tried to talked down the situation and said mall setbacks are normal and inevitable during the negotiations of both countries looking forward we are still cautiously optimistic yet he added that right now both sides have reached mutual understanding in many things but frankly speaking there are also differences liu emphasized differences are significant issues of principle and we absolutely cannot make concessions on such issues of principle one of the issues is over the current tariffs liu told phoenix television in hong kong that if both sides wanted to reach an agreement then all tariffs must be eliminated also both sides have different opinions on the volume of additional purchase of us goods from china as noted by a commentary by state news agency xinhua any purchases should be in line with reality the biggest issue though is likely on the text regarding law changes regarding core issues like ip theft which china sees as intrusion of sovereignty liu said that every nation has its dignity so the text ought to be balanced trump continued to sound hard line on china with his tweets and said china was beaten so badly in recent negotiations and they may as well wait around for next election to see if they can get lucky and have a democratic win but trump also said the only problem is that they know i am going to win and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs trump typically didn t elaborate the logic link between china knowing he will win the second term yet they re waiting for next election that s no point in dragging on if a trump win is certain china stocks and yuan in free fall as trade tension heightened chinese markets clearly suffered most on trade war escalation shanghai sse composite gapped down and dived to as low as 2838 38 last week before paring some losses to close at 2939 21 while some sideway trading could be seen initially this week we d expect upside attempts to be limited by 3050 02 gap resistance to bring another decline break of 2838 38 should resume the fall from 3288 45 through 61 8 retracement of 2440 90 to 3288 45 at 2764 66 at this point we re seeing such fall as a corrective move thus selloff should finally slow down below 2764 66 fibonacci level yuan was so sold off sharply last week with usd cnh offshore yuan hitting as high as 6 8644 the development indicates that corrective pull back from 6 9800 has completed at 6 6699 already further rise is now expected through 6 9800 to resume whole rally from 6 2354 barring any government intervention usd cnh s next target is 61 8 projection of 6 2354 to 6 9800 from 6 6699 at 7 1301 nikkei was also dragged down heavily risking reversal staying in asia japanese nikkei also suffered steep selloff coming back from holidays a short term top should at least be formed at 22363 92 on bearish divergence condition in daily macd after hitting 61 8 retracement of 24448 07 to 18948 58 at 22347 26 while the rebound from 18948 58 was stronger than originally expected the structure still suggests that it s merely a correction immediate focus will be back on 20911 57 support this week firm break there will confirm completion of the corrective rebound and bring retest of 18948 58 low dax performed less badly but downside risk is high over the europe while euro was resilient german stocks and yield suffered 10 year bund yield dived to as low as 0 066 before closing at 0 041 development in dax was slightly better than nikkei s but the index looks vulnerable corrective rise could have completed 12435 67 after hitting 61 8 retracement of 13596 86 to 10279 20 at 12329 53 firm break of 11850 75 support will have 55 day ema and channel support taken out that should pave the way to retest 10279 20 low ahead dow should have reversed but needs confirmation from s p 500 and nasdaq back to the us dow dropped through 55 day decisively to as low as 25469 86 to close at 25942 37 the development suggests that rebound from 21712 53 has completed at 26696 96 already on bearish divergence condition in daily macd just head of 26951 81 such rise is seen as the second leg of consolidation from 26951 81 thus the third leg should have started next downside target is 38 2 retracement of 21712 53 to 26695 96 at 24792 28 break will target 23616 20 and below the biggest risk to this view is that s p 500 and nasdaq just breached 55 day emas briefly and rebounded to close the week above further strength in these two indices might help push dow back above 55 day ema and invalidate our bearish view 3 month and 10 year yield curve inversion coming back 10 year yield was rejected by falling 55 day ema and weakened against last week the break of 2 463 support should confirm completion of corrective recovery from 2 356 at 2 614 after hitting 55 day ema further decline should be seen back to retest 2 356 low and break will resume the fall from 3 248 note that 3 month as 6 month year yields are currently at 2 430 2 444 respectively further decline in 10 year yield will invert this part of the yield curve too which could be rather bearish for stocks and risk sentiments gbp jpy weekly outlook gbp jpy dropped sharply to as low as 142 22 last week and broke 143 72 key support decisively the development argues that whole rebound from 131 51 has completed at 148 87 already ahead of 149 48 key resistance though as a temporary low was formed just ahead of 38 2 retracement of 131 51 to 148 87 at 142 23 initial bias will be neutral this week for some consolidations first upside of recovery should be limited below 146 50 resistance to bring another decline on the downside break of 142 22 will resume the decline from 148 87 to 61 8 retracement at 138 14 next in the bigger picture current development suggests that gbp jpy was rejected by 149 98 key resistance and medium term fall from 156 59 is still in progress break of 131 51 will target 122 36 2016 low on the other hand decisive break of 149 98 should confirm that medium term fall from 156 59 2018 high has completed at 131 51 already further rally would be seen back to 156 59 resistance and above in the longer term picture the rise from 122 36 2016 low to 156 59 2018 high doesn t display a clear impulsive structure thus we re treating price actions from 122 36 as a corrective pattern in case of an extension strong resistance is likely to be seen at 50 retracement of 195 86 2015 high to 122 36 at 159 11 to limit upside on the downside break of 131 51 support will bring 122 26 low back into focus

determined ipo price reflects the judgement of the company and its bankers about investor appetite the early trades were expected by many to be in the 60â s far above the offering price of 45 the

rounds if you have been following beth kendig one of our best sources and my colleague at fatrader you had advance warning on this one the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar the calendar is a big one earnings season is winding down but there is plenty of fedspeak on the agenda i am especially interested in retail sales and industrial production â two important elements in recession dating housing starts and building permits are important indicators in an important sector michigan sentiment remains important to determine consumer spending potential others emphasize leading indicators and the philly fed but they are lower on my list and of course we can wonder whether it matters in the world of tweetstorms and news â hints â briefing com has a good u s economic calendar for the week here are the main u s releases next weekâ s theme despite the important economic calendar i expect a different focus for the week ahead economic data has had little market effect since the december january period even then the emphasis was on the fed not the economy since then we have traversed an earnings season with good results versus expectations with little market effect the market has focused on geopolitical issues particularly trade the big issues seem to be at a point of stalemate that leaves us to ponder does political and geopolitical stalemate imply the same for financial markets background the financial markets have returned to the â delicate balanceâ i wrote about last autumn it is popular to personify organizational behavior and describe this as â complacency â this lazy shortcut prevents us from seeing the wide range of investor attitudes a lack of change in price and modest volume can simply represent a roughly equal balance of underlying supply and demand there are plenty of skeptical investors david templeton horan shows the large flows from equity funds and etfs into bond and fixed income investments this is true for 2019 despite the lower performance of fixed income what happened to the â earnings recession â mike williams cites dr ed yardeniâ s note saying that it had been â averted â at the start of the q1 earnings season analysts had expected earnings growth to turn negative but with nearly 83 of s p 500 companies having reported revenues and earnings for the quarter earnings continue to beat forecasts and growth is trending net positive as they often have done in the past industry analysts were too aggressive in cutting their numbers going into the latest earnings season at the worst of it analysts had s p 500 earnings expectations down for q1 2019 by as much as 2 5 y y that was during the 4 12 week during the 5 2 week the blended figure including reported results and estimates for yet to be reported results was up 1 8 he continuesâ it s already working fear that is as money leaves those ugly very risky 15x to 16x earnings stocks and floods into the 41x to 43x times earnings 10 year bond note this is the same spot where the experts have told you to be dreadfully afraid of higher interest rates and inflationary pressures as the demons of qe come home to roost alas no interests did not skyrocket after all by the way that is why mr gundlach the current favourite child of financial media wants you to feel a bear is coming and the market is doomed he manages bonds after allâ and a lot of them and finallyâ the trade deal my own â predictionâ before the first us china meeting last autumn was a flexible deadline and an eventual agreement it was not going to be easy the reason is that the initial effects do not seem that harmful the real time lesson in economics takes time to play out even when we see the second order effects it may be difficult to link them to trade policy blocking foreign trade traditionally associated with democrats and unions has always played well to the public it has a focus on jobs the impact on reciprocal trade and consumers is much more difficult to see this is why trade is the issue with the largest deviation between the conclusions of professional economists and those of the average person this duality has played out even more badly than i expected the president claims that china is paying the taxes the â get toughâ policy plays well with his base the pundit in chief turning his expertise to political strategy points out that the recent economic data provide shelter for policies that may introduce an economic drag on this occasion he may be correct mainstream news shows focus on the gdp number and the unemployment rate the trump approval rating has moved higher especially on his handling of the economy i do not expect china to capitulate soon largely because they donâ t need to the result is a stalemate even though everyone is worse off it may not be resolved until the 2020 election or shortly before some assert that trump â needsâ a trade deal but why nyt business insider impeachment subpoenas and investigations our daily news is full of new accusations and denials â witch huntâ and â case closedâ represent one viewpoint the other sees scores of violations that are certainly prosecutable violations and might be impeachable offenses what does it mean nothing the executive branch is resisting the house in an assertion of power it may eventually be decided in the supreme court legislation related to investigations is easily blocked by the senate or a presidential veto the democratic leadership although not all of the members sees the futility of impeachment without a solid case and consensus support is there anything more we can expect to learn before the election iran and north korea presidential diplomacy has not advanced the case with north korea and has escalated tensions with iran there are more issues with palestine and israel these are disturbing situations for us as citizens â well worth learning about and expressing opinions to our friends the implication for financial markets is murky it is difficult to find immediate impacts and the issues may continue in current form for many years a stalemate implications for markets most sources continue the piecemeal approach to these stories highlighting the negative features as always i recommend

our trading models last week we discussed the news cycle effect on traders asking whether they traded news cycles or market cycles we cited some useful sources and discussed recent picks from our

documented list of worries as the worries shutdown fed policy trade are addressed or even resolved the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely best of the week if i had to recommend a single must read article for this week it would be the foundation of every proper investment plan by christine benz morningstar she takes the amorphous goal setting and wealth building concepts and translates them into a timeline with specific goals and priorities the advice is clear and specific but it defies summary you should read the entire post i want to pair that wonderful advice with that of trent hamm the simple dollar in a logical fashion similar to that of christine benz he clearly describes the steps in any financial decision â problem identification research and choice why is this important it facilitates action not dithering those who over analyze seeking optimum solutions may wind up doing nothing if you took the steps outlined in these two articles your investments would be much more likely to meet your goals stock ideas chuck carnevale continues his sector by sector quest for attractively valued stocks each post in this series provides both interesting ideas and a lesson in how to perform solid analysis he has reached utilities which seems to be the end of the line not surprisingly he finds â slim pickings â this is an extremely important post describing the intertwined effects of valuation and dividends read his article carefully and you will understand this key conclusion investing when overvaluation is manifest reduces your returns while investing when undervaluation is manifest can increase them therefore when growth potential is low there is little to no margin of error or safety if you even slightly overpay for a slow growth stock such as a utility you are very likely to earn unsatisfactory long term returns moreover you will earn these lower returns at elevated levels of risk higher risk and lower returns are the exact opposite of what prudent investors seek bhavneesh sharma has another interesting biotech idea crspr therapeutics crsp because of his experience in medicine clinical work and finance he can

cap personal finance abnormal returns always provides interesting ideas on a wide variety of topics i am a subscriber and i read it daily each wednesdayâ s edition includes a post focused on personal finance this week i especially appreciated michael batnickâ s the big risk using some themes from jeopardy champion james holzhauer a former resident of our town and a favorite of mrs oldprof he examines the short term risks of stocks compared to bonds he writes stocks are clearly a risky endeavor in the short term but over longer periods of time when you think about why youâ re investing what feels safe carries a hidden risk see the full post for analysis charts and some tips from holzhauer perhaps he should read another post tadas cited on wednesday adam m grossmanâ s after the windfall gil weinreichâ s series on seeking alpha sa for faâ s is ostensibly geared to financial advisors the analysis is much broader than that most diy investors will find it quite useful this week i especially enjoyed the post your money or your coffee you will too gil takes a common current question about your investment returns from saving money on coffee he cites some sources from each side of this debate â and there are two sides he then notes the key principle â the path to wealth and financial stability entails the active exchange of the transitory for the permanent â spoiler alert he concludes that investors have room for â the occasional indulgence â whew along the same lines ben carlson discusses financial superpowers watch out forâ cornerstone ondemand csod gary alexander has a nice post explaining why this possible value trap deserves its low price it is a very good very thorough job serving as an illustration for investors if you are not doing your own analysis this is what to look for troubled brokers you should always use the finra site to check out a broker or advisorâ s record in fact they are supposed to display the link on the site this new regulation increases the obligations on â problem firms â final thought first a few random but important thoughts the twitter effects seem to be wearing down this is both my own observation and other comments i have seen the longer these issues play out with the stalemate continuing the less attention algorithms and traders will give the typical causation blunder was seen in full force on friday talking heads covering the uber story debated whether the market was dragging down the ipo or vice versa no one even considered that they might be independent events when the day closed with markets higher and uber lower writers stuck to their original stories ignoring the evidence this always happens when two events occur at the same time happens when two events occur at the same time no one knows what the chinese leadership is thinking or what is motivating their actions no one knows what the president is thinking or what motivates his actions despite this many newly minted experts weave plausible stories based upon how you or i might think this is totally irrelevant it is just a way of filling otherwise dead air market moving tweets provide the seeds for malfeasance any trader who had advance knowledge of these events could make a fortune in a few days this week one day would have been enough market moving economic data is embargoed and released to everyone at the same time people know when to watch for it are we comfortable moving away from this standard it is easy to forget that there are losers on every trade made by anyone who might be front running the news please note that i am not suggesting this is going on and i certainly have no evidence i want to emphasize yet another public policy implication of the rise of social media if we do not makes tweeting policy more like normal economic releases we need several assurances a squeaky clean white house and staff consisting of people whose personal financial motives are secondary to the public interest complete financial transparency as we typically see with government employees aggressive sec monitoring of suspicious trades one of their normal functions and finally how to play the stalemate my own approach and one that i strongly recommend to investors is a focus on fundamental value with little attention to short term movements i elaborated on this in a webinar this week joined by experts in different fields all looking to the second half of 2019 check out the free replay for my synthesis charts viewer questions and the viewpoints of my colleagues if you are an investor you should be focused on your personal goals and how to get there politics and geopolitics are sideshows on that journey if you are having trouble identifying your goals and the path to reach them we can help send an email to main

limit the bipartisan policy center has a good update and links to prior analysis the debt limit â x dateâ at which point the federal government cannot meet all obligations in full and on time is now projected for october or early november international tensions the us show of force in response to iran and n korean missile tests lead the list the investment implications of these events are unclear

by vicente morin aguado havana times the helms burton act has now been fully implemented 23 years after it was signed president trump lifted the waiver on titles iii and iv which relate to property confiscated by the budding cuban revolution which were later subject to foreign investment politicians plaintiffs defendants and journalists are all speculating on the real scope of this legislation which is why we have asked several experts for a somewhat medical examination of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity libertad act we interviewed two economists paul michael meo and elias amor bravo in order to learn more about the possible repercussions of title iii of the helms burton act finally being implemented paul meo pm the direct impact of these new measures isn t very important the current situation in venezuela is a lot more important for cuba for example elias amor bravo eab the consequences will be felt in the long term for investments that have been operating on the island with assets that were once confiscated from their legitimate owners private schools and universities which are now public won t be subject to lawsuits as these kinds of institutions were exempt from foreign investment just like everything to do with the health or defense sectors were lawsuits need to be filed in us courts and i have a feeling that there won t be any immediate rulings in the meantime foreign companies will continue to operate in cuba pm foreign business owners who accepted high risks are now well established in the country i believe that they have prepared to deal with this situation ht even though the law targets cuba s totalitarian system it only works as it should in the us the judicial system linked to property is very complex in itself plus it doesn t respond to a party or government s political interests pm as a claimant i would tell my government thanks but no thanks because just filing a claim costs you us 6 500 then you have to pay lawyers and for recovering property deeds for example it will cost some 12 000 for a property worth 50 000 without taking its state of repair into consideration ht how far will the enthusiasm of these cuban americans take them after six decades pm immigration peaked many years ago later floods of migrants haven t been as successful in economic terms current surveys show that third generation cuban americans don t really want to return to cuba if the government were to change many years have passed which is why there won t be lots and lots of lawsuits ht nevertheless is there a starting premise for these claims eab we have the so called laws 890 and 891 which lists the names and social purposes of all the companies that were seized after october 13 1960 which you can read about here ht when rulings are made can we talk reliably about prices 60 years later the university of valencia professor recognizes that there isn t an easy answer given the parity between the usd and cuban peso in 1959 but he doesn t desist from giving us an answer eab we know about the usd in 1959 and its later evolution in us where there haven t been any traumatic economic events like there have been in cuba under these circumstances the average rate of inflation in the us between 1959 2019 has been 3 67 per year and the dollar has gone up 769 32 in this period which means that 1 usd in 1959 is the equivalent of 8 69 usd today that is to say a 500 usd monthly income in 1959 would be the equivalent of 4 345 usd in 2019 if we use the same math both of these figures would be relevant ht last but not least if some owners were to receive a favorable ruling money would be its name the cuban government has its law no 80 of 1996 to fall back on which declares the helms burton act and its dispositions to be void the europeans within the eu have their current blockade statute in force against the us law spanish lawyer jose maria vinals rubs salt in the wound the helms burton act will affect defendant investors in cuba who have property interests or bank accounts in the us which could be seized ht this is what the news has confirmed with carnival cruise lines now being sued while spanish hotel chain melia is waiting for the bad but not surprising news experts also see other non quantifiable effects which are still very real academic jaime sushlicki from the cuban center in florida summarizes some companies are going to get worried they will realize that they can t operate using these properties and will withdraw from cuba maybe others will enter some form of agreement with the former owners of these assets and anyone thinking about investing in cuba will now take a step back ht final diagnosis eab there s no doubt that the decision to do business in cuba which has been difficult and ridden with problems up until now because of a lot of redtape and government policies will now become a real nightmare pm the hardest thing though will be a new democratic government s efforts to clean deeds of military and state led industries or cooperatives and give these properties to the people good luck changing a fascist corporate system into modern social capitalism this is cuba s challenge in the future not the helms burton act interviewee s credentials paul michael meo 80 years old graduated from harvard in 1961 studied a masters at colorado university in 1969 and the technological institute of massachusetts 1971 he spent two decades working with the world bank as an economist supervisor and head of the latin american and southern asia departments research and programs elias amor bravo

news it s this week here now chief anchor george stephanopoulos stephanopoulos good morning welcome to this week and to all the moms watching today happy mother s day as we come on the air the battle between president trump and congressional democrats has broken out into all out war a brand new analysis in the washington post shows the white house is blocking 20 separate congressional investigations by filing lawsuits stopping aides from testifying refusing dozens of requests for documents stonewalling on a scale that democrats say amounts to a constitutional crisis video clip begins pelosi the president is almost self impeaching because he is every day demonstrating more obstruction of justice and disrespect for congress legitimate role video clip ends stephanopoulos the president defiant calling the congressional investigations pure politics that will put him back in the white house video clip begins donald trump u s president they want to do investigations instead of investments they want to do what they re doing which looks so foolish and maybe i read it wrong but i think it drives us right on to victory in 2020 video clip ends stephanopoulos and we begin this week with one of the democratic chairmen leading an investigation adam schiff of the house intelligence committee mr chairman thanks for joining us this morning you heard the president right there he says you all are going to elect him in 2020 adam schiff congressman d ca that s not going to happen and i don t think this country could survive another four years of a president like this who gets up every day trying to find new and inventive ways to divide us he doesn t seem to understand that a fundamental aspect of his job is to try to make us a more perfect union but that s not at all where he s coming from and he s going to be defeated he has to be defeated because i don t know how much more our democratic institutions can take of this kind of attack on the rule of law stephanopoulos he has made it pretty clear he s not going to cooperate with most of the congressional investigations going on right now and during the obama administration he declared executive privilege this week on attorney general barr s testimony and during the obama administration when the house gop held the attorney general in contempt eric holder in contempt for failing to turn over documents from the fast and furious program you called it partisan abuse here s what you said video clip begins schiff the justice department after providing 8 000 documents and extensive testimony is now being required to turn over privileged materials and like all administrations before it it has reluctantly used executive privilege to respectfully refuse to provide materials it cannot provide video clip ends stephanopoulos this department of justice is making exactly the same argument right now they re saying they ve turned over almost the entire mueller report unredacted the attorney general william barr has testified before the senate judiciary committee they re saying they re prevented by law from giving over this grand jury information so what s the difference here schiff there are categorical differences so first the obama administration made dozens of witnesses available to the congress provided numerous thousands of documents as you just heard to the republicans in congress and yes it made specific claims of privilege but here the trump administration has decided to say a blanket no no to any kind of oversight whatsoever no witnesses no documents no nothing claiming executive privilege over things that it knows there is no basis for there s no executive privilege over the hundreds of thousands of documents regarding events that took place before donald trump was president you can t have a privilege an executive privilege when you re not the executive so they know that vast categories are inapplicable to the privilege here so they re just stonewalling they want to draw this out as long as possible and we re going to fight it we are fighting it and we have to because if this president can show that congress cannot enforce its oversight responsibility something barack obama never tried to do and and he had respect for the separation of powers it will mean not only that we can t conduct this investigation but that no future president can be held accountable for corruption or malfeasance stephanopoulos but but that s the big question isn t it what can you do about it i know that you ve talked about under the congress power for inherent ph contempt that you can maybe fine officials you re not going to get a get a u s attorney to prosecute the attorney general after you hold him or any other official in contempt so what can you do how can you be effective schiff well we re going to have to enforce so much of this in court and we re seeing signs already and i think this is positive that the courts understand the urgency here and the first case to get to the court involving the accountants the house oversight committee the judge has said essentially we re going to expedite the schedule i m going to give you a quick judgment on it and look we are going to have to consider other remedies like inherent ph contempt where if the courts take too long we use our own judicial process within the congress and look i think if you fine someone 25 000 a day to their person until they comply it gets their attention stephanopoulos if you can collect schiff well if you can collect but it affects you know whether they re going to be facing ultimately hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages i don t know how many are going to want to take that risk for donald trump but we re are going have to use that device if necessary we re going to have to use the power of the purse if necessary we re going to have to enforce our ability to do oversight stephanopoulos more and more of your colleagues are saying in the face of the president s blanket no as you put it that it s time to open up impeachment proceedings and that would strengthen your hand in the courts now last year you wrote an op ed saying democrats don t take the bait on impeachment you said that if it were seen as a political party exercise it simply couldn t work and and that democrats shouldn t pursue it is it getting to the point where you re going to have to change your mind schiff well you know i was arguing a year and a half ago when i wrote that op ed that we ought to wait to see what mueller reports now we have the mueller report although we still haven t heard from the man himself and i think the first priority has to be get mueller before the congress and the american people stephanopoulos are you convinced that s going to happen schiff i am convinced it s going to happen that is inexorable the american people have every right to hear what the man who did the investigation has to say and we now know we certainly can t rely on the attorney general who misrepresented his conclusions so he is going to testify and yes it s certainly true that these additional acts of obstruction a president having obstructed the justice department investigation now obstructing congress does add weight to impeachment but you know part of our reluctance is we are already a bitterly divided country and an impeachment process will divide us further once we get started it s like pushing a boulder off the side of a cliff it gathers a certain momentum of its own until it hits rock bottom which is the senate and then we re like sisyphus trying to push that boulder back up the hill but he may get us there he certainly seems to be trying and maybe this is his perverse way of dividing us more and as you heard in the clip earlier he thinks that s to his political advantage but it s certainly not to the country s advantage stephanopoulos we also saw an effort this week by rudy giuliani the president s personal lawyer to get the ukrainians to investigate joe biden for his diplomacy in the ukraine while his son was serving on the board of the largest natural gas producer there and the president told politico on friday it would be appropriate for him to discuss a probe of biden with the attorney general is it appropriate schiff of course it s not appropriate and what is so shocking to me i served for many years on a democracy commission in the congress where we would partner with parliaments in emerging countries emerging democracies and we would always say when you win an election you don t seek to jail the losing side and here the president of the united states is saying it s perfectly ok for him and he has said this before to go to the attorney general and get them to open an investigation of his rivals and sadly this attorney general has turned out to be so political and partisan and so without frankly without integrity he just might do it and you know that does add to the sense of crisis that these democratic norms are being broken down every day the fact that we re not even done with this investigation of the last foreign interference in our election and giuliani apparently with the president s at least initially ph knowledge and blessing was going to get the help of another foreign government in a presidential election you know it it tells me that they not only think this there s nothing wrong with this if that s true there s something wrong with them stephanopoulos how about the underlying issue though there s no public evidence that the vice president former vice president took any inappropriate action to help his son but was it right for hunter biden to take a job like that in ukraine while his father was engaged in diplomacy there schiff i don t know the circumstances in which he took the job but i can say this vis à vis joe biden there s no evidence nor has there ever been any evidence that he was doing anything but trying to get the ukraine government to crack down on corruption now we re providing generous support to ukraine we re providing defensive weapons to ukraine we want ukraine to be successful in its conflict with russia but part of that is happening in a government that the people of ukraine are willing to fight for and protect and they ve had an endemic corruption problem that s what joe biden was trying to address so going after his son is just a method of going after someone the president believes is his most formidable opponent so yes let the president go after him but don t seek the help of a foreign government in your election and you know if this isn t criminal and bob mueller said he could prove all the ailments of a crime then maybe we need to change the ailments of that crime because we cannot make this the new norm that if you can t win an election on your own it s fine to seek help from a foreign power stephanopoulos chairman schiff thanks for joining us this morning schiff thanks george stephanopoulos let s get a republican response now from senator rand paul the former relations committee senator paul thanks for joining us just want to let me pick up where chairman schiff was sen rand paul r k y good morning stephanopoulos good morning where chairman schiff just left off right there that perhaps congress should consider making it illegal to engage foreign governments foreign assistance in campaigns you agree paul well i think the american people will be shocked and dismayed to know that joe biden s son was making 50 000 a month just a couple of months after he was dishonorably discharged from the military for drugs 50 000 a month i think most americans will be dismayed that the president s son was doing this while joe biden was actually lobbying to have this company you know go free of prosecution my understanding this was reported in the new york times joe biden was asking the prosecutor to lay off of the company that hunter biden was working for for 50 000 a month cross talk stephanopoulos that s that s not that s that s not paul kicked out of the military that s extraordinary stephanopoulos that s not what that s not what was reported in fact he was on an anti corruption drive paul well actually ph that s exactly what was reported yes that he got 50 000 a month right after he was kicked out of the military that s exactly true and nobody disputes that stephanopoulos that s very inaudible from what you just said about what the vice president was saying right there how about this idea that the president can could ask it s appropriate for him to ask the attorney general to investigate a former vice president paul i think since the very beginning this all has been politically motivated now both sides are doing it i think it goes back even to the clintons this is why we shouldn t have special prosecutors one of the things that adam schiff and the other partisans don t understand is that if you re accused of a crime by a grand jury and they don t indict you the prosecutor doesn t go all over town saying we thought he did this we thought he did this this is all the evidence that s why a grand jury is secret see the mueller investigation said that the president did not commit any underlying crime and so now they re all saying he obstructed justice about something that was not considered to be a crime so this is really i think degenerated into partisan politics and the best thing we could do at this point is say let s get on with the country s business are there some underlying constitutional issues yes the primary underlying constitutional issue here is whether or not the fisa court which is supposed to spy on foreigners which has a lower constitutional standard can you use the fisa court to spy on a presidential campaign can you use the fisa court to seek information about americans that truly is a travesty and truly is unconstitutional and that s the root of the problem we should be addressing stephanopoulos well as you know there s no requirement that there being an underlying crime for obstruction of justice to exist and you ve something like 800 former federal prosecutors who say they believe that the president would be prosecuted if indeed he weren t president right now so you re not concerned about that at all paul i think most americans would disagree with that i think most americans would disagree with that most americans would hate the idea that you re called in to talk to the fbi and when you re called in they say oh well you know what did you say on the phone to somebody two months ago and if you describe that inaccurately then the government s going to say oh we re going to put you in jail even though there was no crime committed you know people are horrified by the idea that you could put someone in jail for obstructing justice on something where you didn t commit the crime think about it from the perspective of the president he was falsely accused and he stephanopoulos isn t that exactly what happened to martha stewart paul well yes and it was wrong what they did to martha stewart was an abomination so when you re accused falsely of a crime and you try to defend yourself should you then be accused of another crime for trying to defend yourself against false accusations i think its absurd stephanopoulos how about this charge from democrats you just heard it from adam schiff saying that the president s blanket no is basically amounting to another kind of obstruction of justice is it appropriate to completely stonewall congress across the board not only in matters where they re investigating the president s personal finance but also on matters of policy like immigration and healthcare paul i think the clip you played of adam schiff showed it accurately he s a hypocrite you know he was against he was all for president obama using executive privilege and now he s against this president the bottom line is we spent 35 million investigating the president their conclusion was there was no underlying crime this whole kibitzing about oh well maybe he obstructed justice to try to hide an investigation about something he didn t do this is absurd and the american people know it people have gone to their corners on it but it s important to remember that this was politically motivated from the very beginning from a political document from the hillary clinton campaign and that should be investigated because we cannot allow the incumbent parties to weaponize the intelligence communities to spy on americans or on political candidates or potentially their donors so there is a real danger to this and it is a constitutional one but the democrats have it completely upside down stephanopoulos you know the clips go both ways back when president obama was asserting executive power you attacked him for acting like a king let s show that begin video clip paul someone who wants to bypass the constitution bypass congress that s someone who wants to act like a monarch the president acts like he s a king not only is it an abuse of power i think it s almost leads us to a constitutional crisis of sorts the president can t just do what he wants he s not a king he has to really get approval from congress end video clip stephanopoulos so why isn t that hypocritical paul right well and for your viewers you will also need to remind them that i opposed the president when he unconstitutionally obama tried to make daca or immigration law without congress i also opposed president trump when he tried to spend money that wasn t appropriated so i think i m entirely consistent in saying no president should be king that includes my president so i took a lot of heat from people in my party by saying well you can t spend money that wasn t appropriated by congress but i did stand up with 12 other republicans and say the same thing that i said for president trump under president obama and i think that is consistent with regard to executive privilege i never said one word about president obama on on on whether or not he should have to divulge all the material within the administration i said that he couldn t create immigration law without congress first creating the law i said the same to president trump you can t spend money without congress first appropriating it stephanopoulos before we go i want to ask about the president s imposing of new tariffs on china on friday it looks like that trade war with china is escalating last year you put out a tweet that said tariffs are taxes that punish american consumers and producers if tariffs punish farmers the answer is not welfare for farmers the answer is remove the tariffs are you worried with this escalation from president trump that he s going to end up putting in permanent tariffs that are going to hurt the american paul yes i know of a big company that told me that the tax cuts specifically helped them but that the tariffs are almost equal in punishing them the farmers in kentucky are concerned about the tariffs and i ve talked to the administration about this i ve said my concern is that the great benefits of the tax cut which have low unemployment and incredible economic growth could be raised by this tariff war as we ratchet it up with china i m very concerned however we re in the middle of this and the president is playing a a a negotiating battle with the chinese and i think he feels that at this point they can t really back out i think there are ways the chinese market could open up and that would be good but i still have advised the administration get this done because the longer we re involved in a tariff battle or a trade war the better chance there is that we could actually enter into a recession because of it stephanopoulos senator paul thanks for joining us this morning paul thank you stephanopoulos up next jon karl on the trail in south carolina with 2020 candidate cory booker we ll be right back commercial break begin video clip booker my daddy taught me that in life people are going to talk down about you but you ve got to stand up in life you re going to face racism and bigotry but you ve got to stand up but he told me that the greatest calling of all is not to just stand up for yourself but to remember it was folks that stood for you before you were born people that stood up and loved you people that stood up and cared for you and so your greatest calling in life is not to stand up for yourself but to stand up for other people end video clip stephanopoulos there s cory booker firing a commencement address at s c state university in orangeburg south carolina booker also opened a new campaign office there this weekend because that first southern primary key to his 2020 strategy but right now booker is well behind joe biden and other democrats in all the early states so when jon karl traveled there on saturday he began by asking booker how he plans to take down the front runners begin video clip booker i m a former track guy i get in the blocks there s a lot of athletes next to me i don t look at the lane to the right or the left i run my race and in many ways this was a race this is a race i feel very confident about not just here in south carolina but new hampshire iowa and and nevada as well because to me these are races where you re going to have to earn people s votes we know historically the front runners at this far out are often not the people that end up winning those early primaries karl but biden s somebody who obviously voted for the free trade agreements he s somebody who voted for the iraq war you know well his record on on criminal justice issues is that the record of a of a democratic standard bearer booker joe biden s going to have to defend his record and talk about what he stands for i plan on focusing on my record and i m very proud of that running into some of our country s toughest problems i didn t pick an easy way in american politics even coming out when i started working in the nonprofit sector i went to the toughest neighborhood i could find in newark new jersey and joined with that community it s a community i still live in today and i m very proud of my neighbors and my neighborhood and what we ve accomplished together doing things other people said couldn t be done karl so you re not going to take on your fellow democrats i mean i hear a reluctance to engage to criticize booker i can t campaign in a divisive way i always say you can t campaign wrong and think you re going to govern right i m governing to unite this country again to reignite senses of civic grace a more courageous empathy for one another so that we can deal with the persistent injustices in our nation karl and i ve heard you say the same thing about trump you say you don t want to fight fire with fire but there was a headline in politico quoting a local iowa democrat leader saying the democratic base is angry as hell cory booker s message of love falls flat democrats in this country are angry and they re angry at president trump is your kind of like nice guy approach really in tune with where the base of the party is right now booker well i think you mistake this in understanding that to be strong you don t have to be mean to be tough you don t have to be cruel we re here in south carolina on a historically black college historical black university where some of the greatest strength was shown through the civil rights activism where people didn t raise a fist we didn t beat bull connor by bringing bigger dogs and more powerful hoses you beat demagogues by by expanding the moral imagination of the country bringing people together to overcome them look i had a guy when i walked into a town hall put his arm around me and said i want you to punch trump in the face and i looked at him and i just smiled and said hey man that s a felony and us black guys we don t get away with that that often the reality is is trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his term he wants to pull our party down we will not succeed by showing the worst of who we are but the best of who we are karl so you just outlined a 14 point gun plan on guns that has been called the most ambitious effort to deal with the gun issue of any of the democratic candidates how are you going to get this done booker well the first way you get this done is stop having a debate on the corporate gun lobby s terms they ve been forming this debate and telling us what we can t do american history is a testimony to doing things people said was impossible my parents and the folks that i know personally who were fighting in the civil rights movement and gave up when congress couldn t pass civil rights legislation again and again it failed the longest filibuster strom thurmond s filibuster against civil rights movement people thought that was impossible but they changed the terms of the debate by expanding the moral imagination of this country now i know in the united states of america in my short time on this planet 50 years we ve had more people killed by gun violence than every single war combined from the revolutionary war through world war i world war ii vietnam all the wars combined more people killed the last 50 years by gun violence that has been normalized and what have we done massacre in the synagogue we do nothing massacre here in south carolina in a church we do nothing massacre in my mom s city of las vegas we do nothing karl but look at how obama after newtown he went to try to just get tougher background checks which is which is just a fraction of booker you sound like what i encountered when i first took over city hall as chief executive karl i know but are you saying that obama didn t try hard enough you re looking at a senate that is going to be every bit as as tough as the senate that barack obama faced booker well again when i became mayor of the city of newark one of the things i used to not not tolerate was people telling me hey we tried this before we couldn t get it done karl i m just asking how you re going to do it crosstalk booker what you re saying is that hey we have carnage in this country like it s a uniquely american problem and we can t solve it i don t accept that at all when connecticut did licensing their shootings dropped their murders dropped 40 suicides dropped 15 these are things that have been tried and done and that work karl let me ask you about healthcare you are a co sponsor of bernie sanders medicare for all but you also say that you don t want to eliminate private health insurance booker i think we need karl explain that because his plan eliminates private health insurance booker well i support what all americans i think support which is this idea in the wealthiest nation on the planet earth everyone should have access to health care i think the best way to get there is medicare for all and i m going to work towards that goal karl ok so that means ultimately you are fine with eliminating all private health insurance including what s been negotiated by unions booker no i never said that and you know this you know this karl bernie sanders bill does say that there will be no duplicative private health insurance it s right there it s right there you re a co sponsor booker and what i m what i m going to say to you as president of the united states karl yes booker the first thing i m going to do is to dramatically lower costs for americans and expand insurance and create a glide path towards an eventual goal karl you won t be pushing for medicare for all in the beginning and the elimination booker i want to be pushing on a pathway towards getting to everyone having coverage and part of that is going to be medicare for all who want it we could create a really good karl well that s medicare for all who want it is not medicare for all its medicare that s called the public option it s not for all booker again as i m telling you i have a clear goal in mind that i share with all americans healthcare as a right i think the best way to get there is medicare for all i m also a realist as a former mayor who got things done who knows that you can t hold progress hostage for some purity karl so i want to ask chris hughes who helped co found facebook has now come out to say that it should be broken up he says that it is unprecedented and un american to have this much power in one company where do you stand on breaking up facebook booker i don t care if it s facebook the pharma industry even the agricultural industry we ve had a problem in america with corporate consolidation that is having really ill effects and we should have if i m president of the united states i will have a justice department that uses antitrust legislation to do the proper investigations and to hold industries accountable for corporate consolidation karl so elizabeth warren s already out there saying break up facebook break up google booker but i i don t think that karl break up amazon booker right but i don t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here it s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks that sounds more like a donald trump thing to say i m going to break up you guys i m going to break no we need to create systems and processes that work karl you just compared elizabeth warren to donald trump that s booker i i i most certainly did not she is my friend karl well that s what she s saying she s the one that s saying that booker well again she has let her discuss and debate her positions i m telling you right now we do not need a president that is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you which companies we should break up we need a president that s going to enforce antitrust laws in this country and i will be that person karl and last question are we going to see rosario dawson out on the campaign trail with you booker you know right now i m looking as i m running around this country campaigning just to see rosario dawson i was with her a few days ago for her 40th birthday happy birthday honey and so let us work on our relationship and we ll deal with the world as we continue to build this incredible love affair karl all right senator booker thank you really enjoyed talking to you appreciate it booker thank you so much stephanopoulos booker keeping things in perspective right there thanks to jon karl for that the roundtable s up next we ll be right back commercial break stephanopoulos the roundtable s here and ready to go and all week long you can get the latest on politics with breaking news alerts on the abc news app we ll be right back commercial break begin audio clip rahm emanuel i look at what he s doing and i have a theory that he s trying to goad us to impeach him pelosi oh sure emanuel that s what yes that he pelosi you re absolutely right i say emanuel not just because he doesn t want you to have the information pelosi no well that s about power it s all about power but that s why i ve said when people keep after me on the impeachment he s not worth it he s not worth it because he wants us to go to that place so that we re not focusing on whatever else end audio clip stephanopoulos house speaker nancy pelosi on the podcast of chicago mayor rahm emanuel who joins our round table this morning also former new jersey governor abc contributor chris christie maggie haberman white house correspondent for the new york times and seung min kim white house reporter for the washington post and maggie we just rahm and the house speaker right there saying the president s trying to goad them into impeachment that s exactly what you reported in the new york times this week maggie haberman new york times white house correspondent right or at least trying to goad them into saying that s what they re doing i think that there is an effort by the people around the president to make democrats have to provide a stark choice yes this is what we are doing this is how we are going about it and they think the president s folks this will be politically damaging for democrats i think that the house speaker feels the same way she made that pretty clear in her podcast with you i don t think that it s going to end up going to that point but i do think you are going to see the white house essentially just draw a line in the sand we re not cooperating because this is what you re trying to do stephanopoulos and seung min that s exactly what you reported on this morning in the washington post detailing out 20 different investigations that the white house is stonewalling basically with what adam schiff said were across the board no s and that is propelling more democrats to say we might have to move to impeachment proceedings seung min kim white house reporter the washington post exactly i mean it s we ve focused a lot on matters involving the mueller investigation and other related issues for the last several days but the lack of cooperation by this administration on matters directly related to the white house to the president to his personal finances is pretty vast i mean they are investigating his immigration policies have not heard a lot at all investigating the federal response to puerto rico even jared kushner s trip to saudi arabia conversations between the president and vladimir putin in the helsinki summit last last summer but this is why you ve heard kind of a shift in or more of an uptick in rhetoric from democrats on why they might have to pursue why impeachment might be at the end of the road because you ve heard nancy pelosi jerry nadler keep saying things like the lack of cooperation is kind of the bigger issue for us right now not necessarily his conduct stephanopoulos and rahm it did seem this week that that pressure was building at the base of the house democrats saying you know nancy we might not have a choice rahm emanuel mayor of chicago well here s the thing you got a couple things one i would have in the house pull back recalibrate totally on mueller and his presentation two on all the obstructions or all the pieces in which the administration s fighting sequence them they re not all equal all 20 that were written today in the post which one is the best one to win the legal case the first one that sets the precedent for all the other 19 that follow third you know democrats have this gene it s in our dna of responsibility then all we hear is the presidential election which is the single most overarching thing for the base we have to between those two goal posts we have to kick perfectly and you have to keep moving without the investigation overwhelming the legislating and that is what it s doing right now christie yes listen the the problem is that they ve not shown the discipline to be able to pull that off he s right in emanuel they haven t hit the ph goal post yet christie no not yet but the but the problem is that they re they re they re jumping towards the bait they haven t bitten it yet but they re jumping out of the water like a fish towards the bait and and this encourages the president to do what he s doing now listen i think there are things that are divisible i think you know some of those investigations that were written about this morning the white house shouldn t stonewall some of those stephanopoulos healthcare immigration christie healthcare immigration on the substance because the president has substantive things to say on those issues go out and defend your position now you know on the tax returns and the other things i understand the position he s taking and and he emanuel but you would agree that he s decided an absolutist approach is and that s where the mistake will be that s where his fault will be christie well it may be depending upon the democrats reaction now if they take the reaction that you suggest then it will turn out to be a mistake for the president if they take the reaction he s anticipating and you can see because of all these different little fiefdoms within the house they all want to have their moment adam schiff on here this morning jerry nadler emanuel so unlike crosstalk stephanopoulos one of the things i wonder and i want to bring this to maggie is that i wonder though if the courts are going to provide the protection that the president is looking for not necessarily that they think they re going to win all these cases in fact they re on weak ground on several of them but hoping to delay through the election we are seeing more evidence from the courts that they re prepared to move more quickly haberman we are but i don t know how quickly that s going to be and we don t know what it s going to look like on appeal and we don t know how long that s going to last donald trump as long as i have covered him which is a fairly long time at this point has always used the courts as a way to mitigate all manner of disputes and he s essentially treating it the same way one of the interesting things about how he s going about this is he is trying to act both as president and private citizen so when it comes to his taxes he s acting as a private citizen when it comes to the investigations he s acting as a president but suggesting things like healthcare on issues of policy but they are suggesting there s an overreach by the house and one of the ways that donald trump navigates politics is he turns everything into an up down referendum on himself that s what he s doing right now he s trying to make it a stark choice he is not recognizing the institutional authority of the house on any level and he is going to look towards the courts to try to deal with that stephanopoulos and what if they strike him down emanuel strike the president down well that s we ll ph keep going here s what i would say as a guiding north star for the democrats little less on trump and a lot more on the american people focus on where they are in their healthcare that s how we won in 2018 where are they on affording college for their children where are they in making sure that they have the skills they need or the infrastructure of transportation system they can get from home to work et cetera a lot of this for a narcissist like the president he s just loving this less on him and more on the american people christie and by the way booker s booker was trying to say that in the interview i think one of the things that cory did well in that interview was he was trying to talk more about issues and less about the president but let s go back to to where this all really started and when the president looks back on this if he does get struck down you know he s carping about don mcgahn in a in a in a tweet yesterday the people he should really be talking to are john dowd and ty cobb who gave the screwiest advice i ve ever seen to a sitting executive by saying stephanopoulos to cooperate in part with the investigation christie let the white house council go in and give all the testimony he wants without restriction emanuel he needs his money back for that advice christie insane let me tell you something i said to you you remember on this show that they were a c level legal team at best on their best day and let me tell you something what s going on right now shows that i had great infliction stephanopoulos i want to move on but let me tell you before we move on and then let me play devil s advocate on that point let s say that they had decided to hold the line and in the face of holding the line mueller does in fact subpoena the president does in fact subpoena these white house aids and that and that makes the president we all know the president blow up and fire robert mueller he d be much worse shape right now christie listen i just don t donald trump s self preservation gene would never have permitted him to fire bob mueller never have permitted him to do it george i mean there s not much that i m confident on stephanopoulos he tried christie no no he didn t try he did what donald trump does emanuel he blew up christie which is to blow off steam and if someone wants to go and do it well then go ahead and do it why that s not what i meant emanuel two things two things haberman that s inaudible the argument from a lot of people around him he did touch the hot stove with comey and i think he saw that there was an add ph lesson from that christie that s a big lesson he learned from that haberman yes and it and it taught him to inaudible cross talk emanuel number one get mueller in front of congress number two the legal team should have known what mcgahn was saying from day one whether and not find out until after the report christie no one interviewed don mcgahn before he got interviewed by bob mueller imagine the malpractice there donald trump needs a malpractice suit against john dowd cross talk emanuel i m not even a lawyer and i know you re not supposed to do that stephanopoulos i m going to move onto the trade war right now we saw the president prove ph tariffs on china on friday and seung min you wrote about this this week as well again calculated it appears ph political strategy by the president perhaps hoping in the end this will force a deal but if not he seems pretty happy to take this to the voters kim exactly and i think it s his approach to trade has been really interesting and the reaction from republicans has been interesting as well because i mean talking to a lot of republican senators they are not happy clearly with the president s trade policy his protectionist stances but they have made a little bit of a distinction between how he s approaching these trade talks with china versus for example the proposed auto tariffs or the steel and aluminum tariffs which they all hate and are warning the president off of and i think the president and some republican senators even from those farm states do see a little bit of a political advantage to showing that he s tough on china and he s getting and he s and he s cracking down on their on the policies of the past but i m talking to a lot of ag state ag state republican senators and they say the farmers are still with you now but there is a point where they may lose their patients stephanopoulos president s got chuck schumer with him on china emanuel ok christie here s a ph rave emanuel inaudible but here here s what i would say and i would go after the president for there are four wars you got china trade war you got iran you got venezuela you got north korea now you decided you want a secretary of defense you should have been planning you should have had a secretary of defense before you decided to have military confrontations and every one of them not china yet but all you need right now is one mistake over one of the islands near china one naval ship that goes a little too far i think it s really talk about forget all the obstruction of justice forget all that what a malpractice of politics to literally have a confrontation going now between north korea you just took the coal ship iran you sent another aircraft carrier and a whole squadron there you have venezuela in a standoff and now is when you want the secretary of defense you should have had this a year ago stephanopoulos the president does seem reluctant to getting pushed into a confrontation in venezuela does seem reluctant clearly with north korea less so with iran christie this is his personality i mean listen he emanuel yes but we need a foreign policy not a personality christie i understand that but i m trying to explain this to you rahm so hang in there ok emanuel yes well i m impatient inaudible christie i understand this is his personality he is not a confrontational person despite what you see on twitter despite all those other things that you see he is not a confrontational person in that type of way so these situations are difficult for him and i think the other thing that you see going on here on china is no one should be surprised at this if there s one thing he has been philosophically consistent on for 30 years stephanopoulos thirty years absolutely christie has been trade and using tariffs and that we re getting ripped off first it was the japanese now it s the chinese and he s been completely consistent on that so no republican sitting in congress should be saying i can t believe this is happening it s who they voted for emanuel but chris here s the differences he may not want a confrontation but bolton and pompeo and the secretary of state they clearly want a very heads on stephanopoulos that s iran and north korea i do want to stick on china for just a second put this to maggie because i think this is going to put the president s principles to the test what do they call it on wall street now the trump put ph that he s not going to allow the stock market to fall too far so far it appears that the finance community believes that he is going to get a deal that he s not going to keep on pushing these tariffs hard to know haberman could end up like the farmers at what point do they end up moving away from him we don t know how far he s going to push this and i think one of the difficulties in assessing his policies on any issue on trade on foreign policy is he has this series of competing impulses he had this competing impulse that wanted to go for the tax bill and it helped a lot of people in parts of the country that are now getting hit by these tariffs so i don t think he has a long term strategy for this i don t think he has a long term strategy for most of these ends i think he is doing what he has to do to get through small increments of time and i m not sure where this ends christie let s keep using the market analogy and here s the hedge on the trump put the infrastructure bill there s no doubt in my mind that the reason he s pushing for that now is because he s concerned that because of the tariff policy there might be some slowdown on it so what he wants to do is pump 2 trillion into the economy through infrastructure which will help the hedge against any damage to tariff stephanopoulos is he going to get republicans in congress to go along with that is one of the big questions kim not for 2 trillion no no way emanuel i don t think he can figure out republicans for a 2 bill on the infrastructure it was a trillion now it s 2 trillion he still hasn t found the money for the first trillion this is a joke everybody knows it s a joke he in a meeting by himself he went from a trillion to 2 trillion and nancy and chuck to their credit said very simply show us the money stephanopoulos show us how to pay for it haberman right christie well listen and i think what you re going to see is the president try to push republicans in the direction of he doesn t he knows he s not going to get 2 trillion so it s kind of typical president trump material we ll start with 2 trillion and he ll declare victory at 1 trillion and he has the democrats saying that they re for it thank about that if he gets a bipartisan win on infrastructure gets a trillion dollars pumped into the economy pre election emanuel he ll be he ll be a dictator ph crosstalk child of kaine s ph stephanopoulos big if but that would be a big victory for him one thing maggie the president does seem to have also decided that joe biden is the candidate that s most like him running for president this time around which makes him his prime enemy haberman yes and i was a little perplexed by that statement candidly because there is no way in which joe biden is like the president other than being stephanopoulos except being the frontrunner that was laughter haberman that means leading the early polls and that is literally it it has aggravated a number of the president s political advisors that he is elevating joe biden in this way and essentially turning him into the general election candidate now joe biden has a primary that could be very difficult for him to get through and a lot of the president s advisors are saying just hang back stop zeroing in only on stephanopoulos but in the short term rahm it does appear to have been a boom to joe biden to have the president going after him i mean i think people expected him to come into the race perhaps as a frontrunner but he s gone far beyond what a lot of people thought he d go beyond in these early stages emanuel the lesson so far is joe biden to all everybody that analyzes talks about politics democrats are more pragmatic than those who are actually on the base quote unquote screaming as i always say in politics sound is not always fury it is not always fury and my point joe biden s move here s the overarching ideological goal for democrats winning everything else is just shades of gray that s what they care about and what biden shows right now there s a pragmatic center pragmatic that says we want to win and if biden s the ticket we re going right there and to everybody that says oh this is what the base wants show me the votes show me what you got stephanopoulos so inaudible other democrats struggling to even get heard at this point christie well that s true but i still think i m one of those advisors who thinks it s a mistake for the president to do this i could pick of the 22 i could pick probably 21 others i d rather run against if i were donald trump to joe biden and i and i just think that emanuel nineteen to count christie i just think that it s a mistake i think it s a mistake for him to be doing what he s doing now listen there s a lot of things that i thought he did mistakenly in 2016 he wound up winning and don t remind me of that when we get off the air but laughter but the point is that i think joe biden s the one guy and i ve said this all along who can go into michigan and wisconsin and ohio and pennsylvania and appeal to white working class voters the president doesn t need that type of opponent he needs an opponent who will repel those white working class voters and keep his emanuel coalition christie coalition together absolutely stephanopoulos it is creating a dilemma for the other democrats particularly those democrats who got almost 10 of them in the house and the senate just struggling to get some kind of attention hoping that their policy proposals would get some traction kim exactly and i think i mean when you re in a field that vast you need to find a way to create your own lane and you know obviously the interview with senator booker was fascinating where he s been trying to be the candidate of hope and love and all this fuzziness where and it doesn t seem to be gaining traction right now it does make you wonder whether he does tack towards a more confrontational approach if he realizes isn t working but they re all trying to find their own lane and it s just not inaudible haberman the debates start in a month i think we re going to have a much clearer sense of what s happening in the democratic primary when the debates begin stephanopoulos and so yeah they they are going to start to winnow down the field emanuel the two things is six weeks ago eight weeks ago bernie sanders set the pace biden s now setting the pace biggest deal if you re on the panel of the debate in a month from now and you re not with joe biden nobody s going to see or hear you stephanopoulos well see that s that was what i wanted to pick up on emanuel nobody will see and hear you stephanopoulos and you re ph right there you know we know the first debates you re going to have 10 10 candidates over over two nights 10 candidates each night it s possible that even though we think they re going to be the big events that they may not turn out to be the events that the people expect because it just gets all muddied up over two nights christie well if you look back on 16 and that race and and the 10 candidates who were there on the first stage in august in cleveland nine candidates didn t matter donald trump that night was the only candidate who mattered and i was standing on the stage and feeling it the way lots of other people were is joe biden going to be able to dominate in that same way i don t think so and i think the reason these are going to be important is because someone else will emerge i don t know who but someone else will biden does not have the type of personality that will dominate the way that that trump did stephanopoulos yes but but does he have to dominate the debate if it s over two nights if no one else breaks out emanuel i here s the thing he s going to focus on trump trump is going to focus on him and he s going to be the center of energy yes somebody will emerge and that s the process and first of all everybody i have to take this advice myself we re these are like every 25 feet on a literally a 26 mile crosstalk emanuel we don t need to get ph our medication early ok christie four years ago it was president jeb bush right crosstalk haberman but that s i do think the governor s right is i think that why the energy was all on donald trump was he was willing to do things that no other candidate was willing to do during those debates and everybody else got up on stage knowing he could train the insult gun at them at any moment and joe biden s not going to do that so i just think you re crazy ph crosstalk emanuel but here s one thing ph that biden will do biden will talk about trump haberman yes emanuel and everybody will try to make biden bait them and he is going to inaudible look there s a long way to go haberman look emanuel and it s great for ph the vice president is stephanopoulos there s a long way to go for the campaign but we re out of time so that s laughter crosstalk stephanopoulos we ll be right back christie is that what you re telling me commercial break stephanopoulos that s all for us today thanks for sharing part of your sunday with us check out world news tonight and i ll see you tomorrow on gma end

you choose and on exactly what you want the second less efficient way is to spend your money on someone else such as when you are buying a gift you re somewhat careful about the cost and less careful about the content the third even less efficient way is to spend someone else s money on yourself as when you have a company expense account you won t be as careful spending company money as you are

spending falls into that least efficient category economist steve hanke writes in addition to cost overruns the financing of infrastructure requires the imposition of taxes and taxes impose costs beyond the amount of revenue raised the excess burdens of taxation include deadweight distortions and enforcement and compliance costs in short it costs more than a dollar to finance a dollar in government spending the best estimates indicate that on average it costs between 1 50 to 1 60 to raise a dollar in tax revenue taking proper account of cost overruns and the costs of collecting taxes

after obama s presidential election vice president elect joe biden said every economist as i ve said from conservative to liberal acknowledges that direct government spending on a direct program now is the best way to infuse economic growth and create jobs this is not even remotely true in 2009 the libertarian cato institute took out full page ads to criticize obama s stimulus plan the ad was signed by more than 240 economists including several nobel prize winners with 130 more eventually endorsing the ad it said notwithstanding reports that all economists are now keynesians and that we all support a big increase in the burden of government we the undersigned do not believe that more government spending is a way to improve economic performance more government spending by hoover and roosevelt did not pull the united states economy out of the great depression in the 1930s more government spending did not solve japan s lost decade in the 1990s as such it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the u s today to improve the economy policymakers should focus on reforms that remove impediments to work saving investment and production

the suspense would be gripping if it weren t so debilitating the 11th round of negotiations between the united states and china on a bilateral trade deal ended on friday in washington d c with an agreement still uncertain mosads president donald trump tweeted that the two sides had candid and constructive conversations and that negotiations will continue into the future liu he a chinese vice premier and the country s lead negotiator confirmed that beijing would keep talking but trump s negotiating team led by u s trade representative robert lighthizer had earlier told their chinese counterparts that beijing had three or four weeks to reach a deal or face 25 percent tariffs on the 325 billion worth of chinese exports that still enter the united states untaxed washington s ultimatum came less than a week after trump announced that his administration would respond bellicosely to a reported move by chinese president xi jinping to delete commitments made in a negotiating draft to change specific chinese laws that pertain to unfair trading practices such as industrial subsidies access restrictions and forced technology transfers despite the promise of further talks the lack of immediate concessions from beijing saw the white house follow through on a threat made last sunday to raise existing tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent beijing has already vowed to retaliate with unspecified countermeasures which are likely to include higher tariffs on american goods escalating the u s china trade war will bring much pain for little gain the most obvious impact will be that of higher tariffs on the american economy the effect of current u s tariffs on chinese products shows that higher import costs will be passed onto american consumers will increase consumer inflation will reduce business investment and will hit the profits of american manufacturers with suppliers or customers in china heightened uncertainty about the trade deal also saw a nervous week for international markets foreign traders unloaded 640 million worth of chinese shares daily major stock markets in asia and europe weakened and the msci ac world index lost 2 1 trillion in value expect further losses as markets price in the greater risk of no u s china trade deal being reached a no deal situation seems increasingly possible the trump administration believes the higher tariffs will hurt china more than the united states forcing beijing to make concessions before the four week deadline but nationalism is a pillar of communist party rule in china and president xi has strong political and perhaps personal reasons to not back down in the face of american pressure plus both leaders feel buoyed by upticks in their domestic economies yet the potential costs of friday s tariff hike pale in comparison to those of 25 percent tariffs on all bilateral trade economists warn such an all out trade war would shave 2 6 percent off us gdp and cost 3 million jobs plunging the economy into recession right before the 2020 presidential election while this scenario could also reduce chinese growth by 1 5 percent analysts predict that it would cause a 0 5 percent decrease in worldwide production that risks triggering a global recession an all out trade war would also have longer term repercussions for global supply chains trump believes that punishing chinese imports will cause business to pour back into the united states but all the indications are that multinationals are moving production and jobs from china to next cheapest manufacturing bases such as mexico and vietnam but such moves bring extra costs for producers consumers and innovators that could drag on global growth for years ultimately the white house s current strategy needs improvement the trump administration is right to seek robust enforcement mechanisms for any trade agreement with china but the instability inherent in this week s to and fro exposes the inferiority of bilateral negotiations to multilateral institutions the present economic confrontation will probably slow the chinese economy slightly and perhaps somewhat impede the rise of china s geopolitical power but beijing is far less likely to improve its adherence to international economic standards under american duress than under pressure from the u s led international institutions on which its success has been built moreover washington s bilateral brinkmanship with beijing is damaging its capacity for global leadership by weakening beijing s motivation to play by u s backed rules eroding the authority of rules based authorities such as the world trade organization wto and alienating allies who depend upon free trade to remain the world s predominant technological military and financial power as its share of the global economy declines the united states will need to increasingly leverage not only its alliances but also the benefits of trade investment and talent from all around world mossecondads for the sake of stability the trump administration should reach a deal that delivers agreed upon promises from china to reduce the bilateral trade deficit increase market access and strengthen prohibitions on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer but it should then act on its widely shared concerns about china s economic practices by leading a diplomatic coalition that pursues extensive wto reform and expands the trans pacific partnership cheerleading for unilateral sanctions against beijing might help american politicians and pundits from both sides of the aisle score political points for seeming tough on china but economic pain and global insecurity are the only sure things if the trade war continues it s time for this nail biter to end neil thomas is a research associate at macropolo the in house think tank of the paulson institute in chicago he is neilthomas123 on twitter

consecutive record revenue quarter consecutive record revenue quarter net income of 7 3 million or 0 18 per diluted share adjusted net income 1 grew 7 to 5 9 million or 0 15 per diluted share grew 7

518 million up 3 year over year and 1 quarter over quarter capital expenditures of 5 2 million were primarily in connection with previously announced high return investments to increase production capacity at its aluminum facility and automate key operations at several glass and aluminum facilities in may 2019 completed the previously announced purchase of a minority ownership interest in vidrio andino a colombia based subsidiary of saint gobain with annualized sales of approximately 100 million reiterates full year 2019 growth outlook for total revenue and adjusted ebitda1 josé manuel daes chief executive officer of tecnoglass commented our strong momentum continued into 2019 producing record first quarter levels of revenues adjusted ebitda and backlog u s revenues grew 46 year over year and represented 86 of first quarter revenues which underscores the multi year effort to expand our customer reach and geographic presence in this attractive market we continued to experience favorable commercial construction trends and market share gains along with rapid penetration into the u s single family residential market strong u s performance more than offset softer results in our latin american regions where construction activity remains muted our installation business grew significantly in the first quarter in part due to approximately 5 to 7 million of revenues pulled forward from the second quarter the lower year over year gross margin related to the mix of business in the period was more than offset by operating expenses growing by only 5 4 year over year reflecting tight cost controls and strong operating leverage as we look to the balance of 2019 we are on path for another year of record performance and look forward to deliver on our reaffirmed full year outlook christian daes chief operating officer of tecnoglass stated we continued experiencing solid bidding activity throughout the quarter resulting in a record backlog level of 518 million we are pleased to see project wins in diverse geographies in line with our u s diversification strategy that also includes our schüco partnership which continues to yield positive results our joint venture agreement with saint gobain closed in early may providing us with expanded access to float glass supply and attractive synergy opportunities over time additionally we expect to complete the expansion of our aluminum extrusion facilities in the third quarter 2019 which will allow us to serve incremental demand our initiatives to automate certain processes and optimize production lines at our facilities should be operational by the end of 2019 with all these operational enhancements underway we are poised to further augment our structural advantages while we continue to gain market share and deliver industry leading margins first quarter 2019 results total revenues for the first quarter of 2019 improved 23 0 to 107 2 million compared to 87 2 million in the prior year quarter excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency total revenues increased 24 4 compared to the prior year quarter u s revenues increased 46 1 to 92 1 million compared to 63 0 million in the prior year quarter driven by stronger residential invoicing healthy commercial construction activity market share gains and slight pricing improvement in addition a portion of the increase was tied to the installation of products in certain projects pulled forward into the first quarter of 2019 colombia revenue a majority of which is represented by long term contracts priced in colombian pesos but indexed to the u s dollar was 13 0 million compared to 21 8 million in the prior year quarter primarily attributable to slower construction activity gross profit increased 19 2 to 31 9 million representing a 29 8 gross margin compared to 26 7 million representing a 30 7 gross margin in the prior year quarter the 90 basis point difference in gross margin mainly reflected a higher mix of service revenue in connection with projects invoiced ahead of schedule partly offset by lower labor and energy costs per unit and lower depreciation and amortization operating expenses were 17 7 million compared to 16 8 million in the prior year quarter as a percent of total revenues operating expenses were 16 5 compared to 19 2 in the prior year quarter primarily due to higher sales and

economists and business journalists love economic indicators cpi balance of payments gdp and dozens more but what about the less mainstream ones the big mac index the truckometer the lipstick indicator the cardboard box index subscribe to two cents worth for free on apple podcasts spotify stitcher radiopublic or wherever you listen to your podcasts in november 1878 an english economist named william stanley jevons published a paper in the scientific journal nature entitled commercial crises and sun spots in it jevons argued there was a correlation between business cycles and the sunspots that appear from time to time on the sun s surface his logic was that sunspots impact weather which in turn affects crop production which then causes changes in the overall economy by looking at the sun governments and businesses could get a steer on whether to prepare for a boom or a bust jevons theory turned out to be a load of old bollocks and the word sunspot has come to mean an economic variable that has no direct impact on economic fundamentals but jevons experience hasn t deterred other economists from coming up with unofficial economic indicators they use to gauge what s happening in the economy and what might happen in the future and as computers get increasingly clever at finding and analysing data we are likely to see more of these quirky economic correlations one of the best known is the big mac index introduced by the economist magazine in 1986 as a light hearted or digestible way to measure the purchasing power parity ppp between nations using the price of a mcdonald s big mac as the benchmark comparing the price of a big mac in different countries allows economists to work out whether currencies are under or over valued photo rnz nikki mandow the index isn t without its flaws says kiwibank chief economist jarrod kerr despite what we think big macs aren t always exactly the same size or quality in each country he says and there are different variables which mean currency exchange isn t the only factor transport costs are a big one they might be a lot lower in one country compared with another then there d be a bunch of different taxes paid and there could be subsidies for certain parts of a big mac in some countries still kerr likes the index it s a fun index and it was set up as a fun index there have been some studies that show it can actually give a reasonable signal on exchange rates over a long period of time and as an economist that s great for example the latest big mac index released in january this year shows the kiwi dollar undervalued by about 23 percent against the us dollar so you d look at it and say maybe the nzd needs to appreciate against the usd over time kerr says looking at indicators both official and unofficial are a key part of the job as economists we try to predict the future and no one told me when i started that this would be so hard but it is what we do is look for indicators data to give us insights as to what s going to happen there are two types of economic indicator leading and lagging lagging indicators generally change after the economy does the unemployment rate is a good example if the economy starts going pear shaped companies lay off workers and unemployment rises but economists tend to like the other type more leading indicators these generally change before the economy does so can help predict the future about four years ago anz bank chief economist sharon zollner came up with a new zealand specific index the truckometer based on traffic movements at 20 30 sites around new zealand photo rnz nikki mandow there are two monthly truckometer indices the heavy traffic index measures truck movements and tends to correlate with gdp so for example if there are a lot of truck movement in the last three months of the year that s a good signal for gdp in the last three months of the year but zollner gets more excited by the light traffic index which measures cars and vans this turned out to be a leading indicator she says i wasn t expecting to find car traffic predicts the economy six months ahead that did my head in zollner says a six month lead is pretty much unheard of for an economic indicator one reason economists like leading indicators is they aren t just using them to write clever sounding reports and get their brand out there in the media they re using them to help their team of traders make money by knowing what to buy and sell and when imagine one team of bank economists competing against the other banks teams and economic indicators are like go faster running shoes or a new design of tennis racket the weakness we saw in the light traffic index was one of the reasons i was a bit ahead of the market in picking that the economy was slowing and the reserve bank would probably be cutting interest rates rather than holding them steady zollner says so when i made that call back in december a fair few eyebrows went up now the market has moved to that view rbnz cut rates this week the truckometer is a mainstream kosher index though it has its limitations it didn t see the global financial crisis coming for example other indicators are slightly more interesting take the lipstick index a measure coined by leonard lauder chairman of the board of cosmetics company estee lauder to describe increased sales of cosmetics during the early 2000s recession the argument was that when times are tough women can t afford a new bag or shoes but can get a bit of happiness from a cheapish lipstick then there s the cardboard box leading indicator which suggests a sharp decline in the usage of cardboard means a recession is on the horizon while increases indicate expansion that s because most large consumables come in a big box so more cardboard means more manufacturing and therefore more sales and more people getting a job to whit a booming economy at the gruesome end of the scale is the unclaimed bodies index a us indicator it shows a correlation between tough economic times and bodies piling up in morgues because family members can t afford to collect them in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis in detroit america s poorest city the number of unclaimed bodies tripled from a decade earlier dominick stephens chief economist at westpac bank likes indicators that s what we spend our time on elbow deep in economic indicators photo rnz nikki mandow but he questions the validity of some of the more niche bizarre ones buttered popcorn men s underwear baked beans there are two real problems with these alternative or pet indicators one of them is called overfitting if you go through enough of this data you will find things that correlate with economic growth think the sunspot index the second real problem with these types of indicators like the idea that lipstick sales go up when a recession occurs is called the lucas critique stephens says that basically says relationships in the economy can change so for example lipstick might be popular this year but it might go out of fashion in future years he is right lipstick sales fell in the 2008 financial crisis stephens has a personal example of the lucas critique after talking to a taxi driver in january 2008 just before the crisis and hearing that times were tough for taxis stephens says he thought he might be able to correlate taxi driver sentiment with where the economy was going that stayed in my mind and i always made a point of asking taxi drivers how their business was then a couple of years ago i asked a taxi driver how things were and he said terrible no rides and this keyed my mind but actually that had nothing to do with economic fundamentals it was just uber eating them alive it wasn t an indicator the economy was going to turn down it was the fact the structure of the economy had changed
paul wiseman the associated press washington president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports ___ are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best animated explainer on trade disputes
islamabad some serious questions within the government are raised about the quality of bail out package being negotiated between pakistan and the international monetary fund imf as a senior sbp official disclosed to the news that a top finance ministry official was missing from the last three days of these talks the state bank official source who was present in the pak imf meetings was surprised that why the key finance ministry official who has been part of the negotiating team before was missing when the talks were in the final stage the sbp source said the finance ministry official opted out of these talks when he was told not to argue with the imf the finance ministry official the source said was fighting hard with the imf to get the bail out package with such conditions which are favorable to pakistan but he was stopped from arguing islamabad s case effectively the source said the quality of pak imf talks was really pathetic as islamabad almost agreed to everything that the imf wished according to the source it was a complete submission and a total sell out instead of a bail out package according to another source pakistan has agreed to some really tough conditions of the imf and now the deal awaits the green light from the fund s headquarters in washington however an official on condition of anonymity said that pakistan was not in a position to have its say adding that economic condition of the country does not allow islamabad to bargain much he said that the team negotiating on behalf of pakistan comprises patriotic pakistanis and they will prefer get the best deal in favour of pakistan he said that the pakistani negotiators are expert in their field and they know how to do things in a better way according to media reports pakistan and the imf are negotiating agreement on fresh bailout package of 6 5 billion in the wake of tough conditions of the fund on account of taxation upfront hike in discount rate and withdrawal of subsidies on power sector they were scheduled to conclude parleys on fresh bailout package till may 10 but both sides after hectic consultation convinced the imf to extend its stay to next two days for making more efforts to striking a staff level agreement media reports say the imf is asking islamabad to move ahead with additional tax measures of rs700 to rs730 billion in upcoming budget through a combination of both withdrawal of different tax exemptions and raising tax rates it has also been reported that pakistan has accepted the imf s demands of flexible exchange rate regime withdrawal of subsidies containing borrowings from the central bank and reinitiating the privatisation programme it is said the imf has also reopened the issue of upfront increase in discount rate by at least 2 despite that the real interest rates were already positive by 3 75 the other key area was the exchange rate as the imf model showed at least 20 further devaluation of rupee against the us dollar
spread the love ben bernanke the former chairman of the united states federal reserve is revered for being one of the great minds that made bold decisions which subsequently ended the global financial crisis of 2007 8 at the centre of his philosophy to end the raging economic crisis that had seen the folding of systemically important banks and insurance firms was the need to inject the economy through a stimulus package by ngonidzaishe makaha and adrian mapiye the stimulus package that bernanke advocated for was designed to spur the frozen credit markets and get the financial system and the whole economy working amid his efforts to turn the us economy around there was a lot of bickering among the washington elites and sceptics who could not tolerate the moral hazard that is often caused by government bailouts and other stimulus activities on thursday 18 september 2008 bernanke presided over a meeting with congressional leaders and other top policy makers where he sought to push his agenda for a usd70 billion stimulus package to save the financial system to counter the bickering and win the minds of sceptics bernanke told the meeting if we don t do this we won t have an economy on monday how that statement managed to convince everyone to support the stimulus agenda might not be known but what is clear even to this day is that the stimulus packages bernanke and others advocated for saved not only the united states economy but the global economy at large zimbabwe s economy has not performed very well for a long time due to a host of issues and there is no official classification to describe the current economic trends some say zimbabwe is in a recession others opine it s a depression whilst others are adamant there is growth which is only anaemic reality on the ground clearly signals trouble and to counter the sick economy there has been a consistent and deliberate attempt to adopt austerity as a panacea austerity is a measure aimed at reducing government spending and increasing taxes to avoid debt traps often than not austerity leads to slow economic growth to an extent that it becomes disastrous if the full objective of recovery is not realised greece for example has failed to emerge from its austerity initiatives stronger the greek context contrast starkly with zimbabwe s greece was largely pursuing the austerity route to manage its sovereign debt widening bond yield spreads and avoid potential a bankruptcy in fact the austerity was a precondition to various bailout packages that were proposed by the european union and other multilateral financial institutions including the international monetary fund zimbabwe is pursuing austerity out of its own volition and perhaps the need to lower the fiscal deficit however the problem lies in the fact that there is no back up to the austerity greece had the eurozone countries to look to whenever they felt like triggering a bailout package yet zimbabwe has no one there is need for zimbabwe to probe her macroeconomic objectives do we need austerity or a growth stimulant to spur the economy so far it seems the main aim is to balance the budget through austerity but to what end a vicious cycle where austerity has led to lower consumer spending and high taxes is not sustainable it can only drain the sick economy further reducing the budget deficit is not a bad idea but what zimbabwe urgently requires is an economic stimulant the bernanke scenario is what might put zimbabwe s economy in a position for prosperity further aiding economic objectives like balanced budgets and containing fiscal deficits through increased consumer spending and corporate taxes the problem though is that policy makers in zimbabwe do not have the bazooka that bernanke triggered the stimulant will not come from the same treasury that is helplessly trying to contain its budget to achieve a balance between income and expenditure it is imperative then for such stimulus to come in the form of economic injections like investment and savings which can be private sector led there is need to attract sustainable foreign direct investment and promote savings at corporate and state level bernanke and his colleagues triggered the multi billion dollar stimulus package to save the united states economy and zimbabwe needs to trigger investment and savings to resurrect her economy austerity works in debt management but is not much effective in driving ailing economies its time for zimbabwe s bernanke to stand up or we might not have an economy on monday ngonidzaishe makaha and adrian mapiye write blogs which cover financial analysis equities financial inclusion development finance analytics and cybersecurity they write in their personal capacities share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading

china united states fewer chinese students in the us may not be a bad thing tweet in 2017 18 chinese students made up 33 2 of all international students studying in the united states 363 000 students that year enrolment of chinese students increased by 3 6 however in the previous year the increase was 6 8 there are several reasons that have contributed to fewer students from china enrolling in the united states i will focus on five including geopolitical rivalry between the us and china geopolitical differences and mutual distrust have been a cornerstone of us and chinese relations for decades the trade war with china is an example of us fears of china s attempt to become the world s global leader in trade and geopolitical restructuring the chinese maintain that the imposition of tariffs by the us is another example of western countries principally the us taking advantage of china and trying to control chinese economic growth and prosperity xi jinping china s powerful leader is determined to make china a major economic technological and educational powerhouse mirroring its place in the world in the 15th and 16th centuries president xi frequently refers to the chinese dream of the great revival of the chinese nation the current trade war between the us and china is likely to be according to the asian development bank the biggest current risk for china and asia s regional economic development jack ma of the chinese multinational conglomerate alibaba predicts that the impact of the american imposed tariffs and the trade war between the two countries will last for decades yi xiaozhun deputy director general of the world trade organization wrote uncertainty and tension are the two words i would use to describe the current situation there are signs that the geopolitical rivalry between china and the us has spilled over into scholarly exchanges and collaboration between us and chinese institutions of higher learning last year the chinese ministry of education cancelled 25 partnerships with american colleges in april 2019 an article in the new york times reported that united states officials have denied or restricted visas to 30 international relations experts from china beijing in return has restricted visas for several american scholars in addition hundreds of chinese students studying in the us have reported delays and cancellations in renewing their student visas china has a track record of using chinese student mobility as pawns in their geopolitical and economic disputes with other countries in 2017 the number of chinese students studying in taiwan was halved because of tense relations between the two countries similarly disputes with canada and australia threaten future enrolment of chinese students in those two countries there is no reason to doubt beijing s ability to do the same with chinese nationals studying in the us in the future united states cybersecurity concerns federal bureau of investigation fbi director christopher wray at a senate select committee on intelligence hearing last year reported the bureau s concern about chinese researchers and scholars working for american companies who he claimed may be cooperating with chinese military and security agencies and stealing academic research technology and economic innovations wray cautioned college and university administrators not to be naïve about the chinese students and scholars studying on their campuses he singled out the 100 confucius institutes operating on american college campuses as propaganda instruments of the chinese government he also noted as worrisome the trend of communist party branches springing up on american campuses he advised college and university officials to report any instances of economic espionage to the fbi two weeks ago he warned of the the national intelligence council maintains that china s thousand talents program which has brought more than 7 000 scientists and researchers back to china over the past decade has the potential to transfer sensitive technologies from the us to china since 2018 nearly 300 chinese scholars have had their visas to study in the us either cancelled or delayed many have reported harassment by fbi agents in june 2018 the trump administration announced a new policy limiting visas to one year for chinese graduate students studying in the us in robotics aviation and high tech manufacturing programmes according to daniel j samet a foreign affairs researcher chinese intellectual property theft costs the us economy between us 225 billion and us 600 billion each year a 2018 hoover institution s report chinese influence and american interests promoting constructive vigilance warned of a rising threat from china s penetration and influence seeking activities in the us the rift between the us and china over academic freedom and security issues as well as the tightening and retaliatory immigration policies between the two countries is one by product of cybersecurity concerns impacting student and scholar exchange disadvantage of a degree from the us an article published by inside higher education on 11 april reported that employers in china are more likely to call back job applicants who have graduated from chinese institutions of higher education rather than from institutions in the us princeton university doctoral candidate mingyu chen conducted a survey of more than 27 000 fictitious job applications for entry level positions in chinese companies and reported that graduates of american universities even brand name prestigious ones were 18 less likely

number one receiver of chinese students has been damaged maybe not forever but certainly for now marguerite j dennis is an internationally recognised expert in international student recruitment enrolment and retention she has more than 25 years of experience consulting with colleges and universities in the united states and around the world the total number of international students studying

chinese students made up 33 2 of all international students studying in the united states 363 000 students that year enrolment of chinese students increased by 3 6 however in the previous year the increase was 6 8 there are several reasons that have contributed to fewer students from china enrolling in the united states i will focus on five including geopolitical differences and mutual distrust have been a cornerstone of us and chinese relations for decades the trade war with china is an example of us fears of china s attempt to become the world s global leader in trade and geopolitical restructuring the chinese maintain that the imposition of tariffs by the us is another example of western countries principally the us taking advantage of china and trying to control chinese economic growth and prosperity xi jinping china s powerful leader is determined to make china a major economic technological and educational powerhouse mirroring its place in the world in the 15th and 16th centuries president xi frequently refers to the chinese dream of the great revival of the chinese nation the current trade war between the us and china is likely to be according to the asian development bank the biggest current risk for china and asia s regional economic development jack ma of the chinese multinational conglomerate alibaba predicts that the impact of the american imposed tariffs and the trade war between the two countries will last for decades yi xiaozhun deputy director general of the world trade organization wrote uncertainty and tension are the two words i would use to describe the current situation there are signs that the geopolitical rivalry between china and the us has spilled over into scholarly exchanges and collaboration between us and chinese institutions of higher learning last year the chinese ministry of education cancelled 25 partnerships with american colleges in april 2019 an article inreported that united states officials have denied or restricted visas to 30 international relations experts from china university world news reported chinese claims that many more were affected beijing in return has restricted visas for several american scholars in addition hundreds of chinese students studying in the us have reported delays and cancellations in renewing their student visas china has a track record of using chinese student mobility as pawns in their geopolitical and economic disputes with other countries in 2017 the number of chinese students studying in taiwan was halved because of tense relations between the two countries similarly disputes with canada and australia threaten future enrolment of chinese students in those two countries there is no reason to doubt beijing s ability to do the same with chinese nationals studying in the us in the future federal bureau of investigation fbi director christopher wray at a senate select committee on intelligence hearing last year reported the bureau s concern about chinese researchers and scholars working for american companies who he claimed may be cooperating with chinese military and security agencies and stealing academic research technology and economic innovations wray cautioned college and university administrators not to be naïve about the chinese students and scholars studying on their campuses he singled out the 100 confucius institutes operating on american college campuses as propaganda instruments of the chinese government he also noted as worrisome the trend of communist party branches springing up on american campuses he advised college and university officials to report any instances of economic espionage to the fbi two weeks ago he warned of the generational threats posed by china including its attempts to steal innovation via graduate students and researchers and the increasing trend of cybercrime blended with espionage the national intelligence council maintains that china s thousand talents program which has brought more than 7 000 scientists and researchers back to china over the past decade has the potential to transfer sensitive technologies from the us to china since 2018 nearly 300 chinese scholars have had their visas to study in the us either cancelled or delayed many have reported harassment by fbi agents in june 2018 the trump administration announced a new policy limiting visas to one year for chinese graduate students studying in the us in robotics aviation and high tech manufacturing programmes according to daniel j samet a foreign affairs researcher chinese intellectual

friedman famously said there are four ways to spend money from the most efficient to the least the most efficient way is to spend your own money on yourself that way the money is spent exactly the way you choose and on exactly what you want the second less efficient way is to spend your money on someone else such as when you are buying a gift you re somewhat careful about the cost and less careful about the content the third even less efficient way is to spend someone else s money on yourself as when you have a company expense account you won t be as careful spending company money as you are with your own but you can t go crazy without running the risk of being fired finally the least efficient most unproductive way is to spend someone else s money on someone else we apologize but this

spending falls into that least efficient category economist steve hanke writes in addition to cost overruns the financing of infrastructure requires the imposition of taxes and taxes impose costs beyond the amount of revenue raised the excess burdens of taxation include deadweight distortions and enforcement and compliance costs in short it costs more than a dollar to finance a dollar in government spending the best estimates indicate that on average it costs between 1 50 to 1 60 to raise a dollar in tax revenue taking proper account of cost overruns and the costs of collecting taxes

after obama s presidential election vice president elect joe biden said every economist as i ve said from conservative to liberal acknowledges that direct government spending on a direct program now is the best way to infuse economic growth and create jobs this is not even remotely true in 2009 the libertarian cato institute took out full page ads to criticize obama s stimulus plan the ad was signed by more than 240 economists including several nobel prize winners with 130 more eventually endorsing the ad it said notwithstanding reports that all economists are now keynesians and that we all support a big increase in the burden of government we the undersigned do not believe that more government spending is a way to improve economic performance more government spending by hoover and roosevelt did not pull the united states economy out of the great depression in the 1930s more government spending did not solve japan s lost decade in the 1990s as such it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the u s today to improve the economy policymakers should focus on reforms that remove impediments to work saving investment and production

asian stock markets futures for nikkei s p 500 slip in early trading major currencies calm for the moment by wayne cole sydney may 13 reuters stock futures turned red in asia early on monday as a standoff in sino u s trade talks blunted risk appetite underpinning safe harbors including the japanese yen and sovereign bonds nikkei futures were trading 0 9 percent lower while e mini futures for the s p 500 lost 0 75 percent treasury futures firmed 4 ticks partly as a safe haven but also on speculation a trade war would cloud global growth and thus keep major central banks accommodative the united states and china appeared at a deadlock over trade negotiations on sunday as washington demanded promises of concrete changes to chinese law and beijing said it would not swallow any bitter fruit that harmed its interests the trade war between the world s top two economies escalated on friday with the united states hiking tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods after president donald trump said beijing broke the deal by reneging on earlier commitments talks are on going but our base case is for limited progress and chinese retaliation we see a significant risk for all chinese imports to be subject to tariffs over the next month or so said michael hanson head of global macro strategy at td securities the market reaction will ultimately depend on whether china and the u s continue to negotiate whether the remaining 325 billion of u s imports from china also get tariffed how china retaliates and what happens to the 232 auto tariffs under that scenario the renminbi was likely to fall between 5 6 against the u s dollar in the coming three months said hanson as a shock absorber to the economic impact of heavier tariffs the other major currencies were relatively calm with the safe haven yen still supported but not aggressively so the dollar was holding at 109 73 yen just above a 14 week trough of 109 46 the euro was also steady at 1 1235 while the dollar was a fraction softer against a basket of currencies at 97 289 in commodity markets spot gold edged up a touch to 1 287 50 per ounce oil prices were softer in line with the general mood of risk aversion u s crude was last down 24 cents at 61 42 a barrel while brent crude futures lost 19 cents to 70 43 reporting by wayne cole editing by daniel wallis
president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports ___ are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on

by peter koenig may 11 2019 information clearing house after the new coup attempt or propaganda coup venezuela lives in a state of foreign imposed insecurity the failed coup was executed on 30 april by juan guaidó the self proclaimed and washington trained and endorsed interim president and the opposition leader leopoldo lópez who was hurriedly freed from house arrest by guaidó with a couple of dozens of armed to the teeth defecting military who apparently didn t quite know what they were up to because when all was over after a few hours most of them asked to be re integrated into their military units and as far as i know they were readmitted these are washington s puppets and coup makers when one sees that the so called coup was defeated in a mere few hours without any venezuelan military interference one wonders whether this was really planned as a coup or merely as a public relations coup for the media to recharge their narrative of maduro dictatorship of a suffering people of famine of lack of medication and medical supply all due to the maduro government s mismanagement of venezuela s natural riches the lie slander we have been used to for the last several years for sure the venezuelan people are suffering according to a cepr report sanctions have killed some 40 000 venezuelans and this not because of president maduro s squandering of venezuelan resources but because of a brutal merciless outside interference principally from the united states and to a lesser degree from washington s european vassals if you listen to the ceaseless drumbeat for war against venezuela and her democratically elected president nicolas maduro by pompeo bolton pence and trump you can only wonder and shake your head what pathological and schizophrenic world we are living in and are we all sick to the bone that we tolerate it that nobody of and in power other than russia and china say halt to this deadly fiasco this article by eric zuesse including leaked documents from pentagon s southern command southcom will give the non believers plenty of reasons to change their minds western humanity has reached an abject state of mental disease we allow the slaughter of tens of millions of people by the united states and its nato allies in us provoked wars and conflicts around the world indiscriminate killing for resources and monetary dominion but we follow the same killer nation in accusing a quiet peace loving fully democratic country like venezuela to be utterly trampled on and punished with the most horrific monetary and economic sanctions all illegal by any standards of law and our western leaders know it all tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get our free daily newsletter these western heads of state and their chosen minions do not have the guts or political courage to say stop they could if they had any conscience left these so called leaders sic of vassal states they have it all in their sovereign power they could together decide that enough is enough separate themselves from the washington horrors and form a real european union a union to say no to the tyrant a union that is capable of calling its own sovereign shots decide its own destiny a destiny of alliance with peaceful countries like venezuela cuba russia china iran and more basically all those that have decided not to bend to the dictate of washington why don t they have they been bought or received death threats if they dare to deviate all is possible even likely because it is unfathomable that the leaders the political heads of all those 28 eu countries are hell bent to believe the lies being propagated day in and day out drip by miserable drip it is not possible back to venezuela the western public at large must never be too long without devastating smear news about a regime the empire wants to change it is clear that the nefarious pair in venezuela guaidó lópez followed strict washington instructions guaidó would never dare doing anything without prior approval and directives from his masters in washington despite threats after pompous threats and false accusations and failed coup attempts president maduro holds on to a solid backing of six million voters who supported him more than two thirds of those who went to the ballots on 20 may 2018 he also has the solid support of the military who have a revolutionary integrity and conscience unknown to the west and not least he has the support of venezuela s solid allies russia and china nevertheless the united states will not let go why do they risk everything even a devastating war well there are several reasons first you may think it s the oil stupid and second the turbo capitalist neoliberal turning to neofascist us will not tolerate a socialist state in what they still consider their backyard well all of this is true venezuela has indeed the world s largest hydrocarbon reserves and it is conveniently close to the us s texas refineries however the key reason for washington forcing regime change is that venezuela has stopped selling her hydrocarbon in us dollars and may therefore become a risk for the us dollar hegemony around the globe that is a punishable violation for the empire at least two heads of state were assassinated because they dared abandoning the unwritten and unlawful but nevertheless us imposed rule to sell their oil and gas in us dollars saddam hussein of iraq and muammar gaddafi both had started trading their oil in other than us dollar currencies and were strong advocates for others to do likewise some three years ago venezuela started selling her oil and gas in other currencies than the us dollar a cardinal sin global dollar hegemony meaning the full control of economies throughout the globe a control that is rapidly fading can only be maintained by a world flooded by dollars and with a monetary system that is entirely controlled by the fed and its associated american banks by an international transfer system swift that channels every dollar to be moved between countries whether it is the us or any other country through a us bank in either new york or london that still being the case the us dollar remains the key reserve currency in the world though rapidly fading and second through the obligatory trading of a commodities like hydrocarbon energy only in us dollars the latter also allows the empire to print as many dollars as it needs to keep the world economy under control and punish those that do not want to bend to washington s rule with sanctions and confiscation of assets abroad because all transactions are controlled by the us banking system first the dollar as a reserve currency is fading rapidly as ever fewer countries entrust their reserves to a largely recognized fake fiat and debt based currency the us dollar they convert their dollar reserve holdings gradually into other assets i e gold or the chinese yuan which has become high in demand over the last few years logically because china is already known as the undisputable strongest economy in the world hence the chinese currency has a special reserve standing however the mainstream media do not report on this second with a growing number of countries that do no longer respect the washington imposed us dollar rule for hydrocarbon trading the demand for dollars decreases rapidly a direct confrontation to the united states dollar hegemony over the world russia and china have years ago stopped trading in us dollars not only hydrocarbons but everything india and iran have started doing the same other countries will follow and venezuela one of the vanguards with the world s largest oil reserves should therefore not be allowed to become a model for other nations the trump administration and its wall street masters will do what it takes to stop venezuela from abandoning the dollar hence regime change and taking over the vast oil assets is of the order with war if necessary all options are on the table all under the blatantly fakest pretexts of humanitarian intervention and bringing back democracy when the world knows that anywhere the us intervenes democracy is abolished in fact what the us has managed and wantonly so is kill any democracy that ever existed under these circumstances venezuela s transgression in shedding the dollar for oil trading and for trading in general amounts to a serious threat to the dollar hegemony and must be suffocated that s what these coup attempts are all about if they succeed the dollar currency collapse could be postponed for a bit and taking possession of the oil reserves would be the icing on the cake what s left after the dollar dominance over the world is gone once the key tool economic sanctions for manipulating nations into doing the bidding of the emperor is no longer effective a broken us economy one that already today depends heavily on the war and weapons industry in fact for over 50 of us gdp when all associated manufacturing and services are counted what s left is the overwhelming firepower of that belligerent warmongering and war dependent nation with which the us and nato could pull the rest of the world into oblivion that s what s at stake with any nation that wants to kick the petro dollar also iran of course but both iran and venezuela have strong protection from russia and china two countries that freed themselves from the fangs of the dollar system years ago and they are offering a bright future with viable eastern monetary alternatives mostly based on the chinese yuan and other currencies linked to

how tariffs on china work and what they aim to achieve washington president trump has heightened tensions with china by boosting tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent and his administration is threatening to again raise tariffs u s trade representative robert lighthizer said friday that mr trump ordered us to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from china which are valued at 300 billion as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president mr trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s trending news the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies mr trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july mr trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them it s official we re freaked the american apparel footwear association said in a statement friday as an industry we cannot survive a 25 percent tariff on top of the tariffs that we already pay rick helfenbein who heads the trade group said in the statement prices at retail will rise sales will drop and jobs will be lost from an administration that promised jobs jobs jobs this is a cinderella tale that has gone awry it offers no glass slipper and no way out for years to come tariffs by reducing competitive pressure give u s producers leeway to raise prices that can good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that mr trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best heightened trade tensions between the u s and china including higher tariffs will weaken consumer and business confidence in the context of an already slowing global economy elena duggar an assistant director at moody s investors service said in a statement construction transportation telecommunications machinery manufacturing and computers and electronics companies will feel the greatest impact from the tariff hike according to moody s on saturday mr trump tweeted about tariffs such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple he wrote

opinion columnist zimbabwe imported goods worth 6 85 billion in 2018 a 38 increase from 2017 that import figure can go up by 30 if smuggled merchandise and under declared imports at the country s border posts are factored in the country s trade deficit since 2010 averages 3 2 billion yearly and this worrying trend may continue if the government does not implement an import substitution policy subsidizing the country s imports does not only help the country save billions in foreign currency but it creates resilience in the economy through local employment creation sustainable and increased tax revenues promotes initiation and growth of local industries and reinvestment of profits in the local economy by importing virtually everything from south africa china singapore india and zambia zimbabwe is killing its home industries and exporting jobs to its import partners the country now has a low industrial base where the government is heavily taxing a few compliant producers so as to meet its tax budgets from a continental perspective 50 of zimbabwe s total imports by value in 2018 were purchased from fellow african countries which are south africa zambia mozambique and mauritius asian trade partners supplied 38 7 of zimbabwe s total imports while 11 3 worth of goods originated from european nations australia north and latin america a closer look at the import bill shows that petroleum oils machinery electrical equipment motor cars vehicles and vehicle parts make up 55 of the import bill however the real concern is on billions spent on goods that are or can be produced locally and products that used to be produced in zimbabwe zimbabwe imports agricultural products maize wheat soya and soya bean oil processed cereal tea and potatoes worth 350 million fertilizers and agriculture chemicals worth 295 million plastics and plastic related products worth 263 million pharmaceuticals worth 250 million industrial and home chemicals worth 200 million iron and steel products worth more than 160 million animal vegetable fats oils waxes worth 150 million tissue paper facial paper newsprint and paper products worth 100 million skin care fake hair and beauty products worth 40 million flavored water worth 25 million and buses worth 20 million the list goes on to include refrigerators margarine glass bottles sugar animal food fruit juice liquid pumps batteries alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages fish eggs beef milk bricks granite tops cement asphalt mixtures seeds toothpicks vegetables and fruits the import bill for the above goods is valued at more than 2 billion and includes entirely everything used for household and industrial consumption leaving the local industry in a very precarious state zimbabwe is over reliant on south africa china and singapore with 80 of the country s consumables originating from those 3 trade partners this means that bulk of the products sold in the local market have a small component of imported inflation which makes it difficult for the government to control the retail price of most goods in the local market the situation has been made worse by the tumbling exchange rate between the local rtgs currency and the us dollar which is the currency of choice for most imports without a strong industrial base that can meet domestic demand and export surplus output the zimbabwean economy is very vulnerable to global shocks caused by fluctuations in commodity prices this undesirable situation calls for a long term vision from the government on industrial growth instead of a narrow and short term pursuit of high revenues that emanate from growth in excise duty more than 40 of the country s imports can be produced in the local market provided the import substitution policy pursued by government favors initiation and growth of local industries import substitution refers to government strategies that emphasize replacement of agricultural and industrial imports to encourage local production for local consumption the major constraints to optimal production in the local industry include shortages of foreign currency lack of capital to import new machinery and technology to replace obsolete equipment high taxation levels stiff competition from cheap imports and the high cost of production in the market which is compounded by hyperinflation the cost of doing business takes into account the cost of labour fuel license permit renewals and utilities such as electricity water and internet connection the cost of production in zimbabwe is one of the worst in the sadc region as a result imports can be landed in zimbabwe at cheaper prices than most locally produced goods this explains why flavored water tissue paper beverages fruits milk and other fast moving consumer goods from south africa can be sold at competitive prices on the local market despite the transport component importers pay industry manufacturing capacity utilizationafter realizing the negative impact of importing locally available products zimbabwe passed statutory instrument 64 of 2016 the policy was a silver bullet for the local industry as capacity utilization rose by more than 13 within 6 months from july to december 2016 capacity utilization in the industry has been falling of late due to foreign currency shortages and renewed growth in merchandise imports into the country si 64 was later revoked by the passing of statutory instrument 122 in 2017 and lifting of import restrictions in october 2018 the latest government actions were mainly driven by pressure from south africa to lift import restrictions for their merchandise exports and by the need to ease pressure on foreign currency demand on the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz it has become imperative for the country to implement import substitution strategies that identify producers of all imported goods that make up billions in imports every year the policies should also look at resuscitating closed industries that mainly produced iron and steel products chemicals and industrial raw materials production incentives which are not monitory subsidies should be given to local producers depending on production capacity and employment levels tax breaks on raw material customs duty and excise duties on fuel can have positive impact on the cost of production locally this will simply offset the country s import bill on locally available products thereby helping manage the widening trade deficit in a sustainable manner this can only make sense if government understands that short term growth in excise duty revenues comes at a cost to the local producers and local employment victor bhoroma is business and economic analyst he is a marketer by profession and holds an mba from the university of zimbabwe uz for feedback mail

consequences chinese cosco freighter fletcher6 cogwriter the wall street journal reported that there seems to be bipartisan acceptance in the usa for donald trump s stance against china on trade may 12 2019 washington president trump has enjoyed rare bipartisan cheering for his brass knuckle trade fight with china but that support will now be tested as u s businesses and consumers shoulder higher tariffs on chinese imports the yearlong conflict has barely dented the u s economy so far but new 25 tariffs imposed friday along with the administration s steps to expand levies to virtually everything from china are raising concerns even among some republicans the tariffs that are currently in place have had a very detrimental impact on agriculture and the economy is in the tank already so we don t need more bad news piling on said senate majority whip john thune r s d the conservative national taxpayers union on friday estimated the trump administration s major tariff programs have reversed about 25 of the tax relief expected from the 2017 tax law between the years 2019 and 2023 the u s china trade dispute appeared on the verge of settlement until about a week ago when beijing balked at u s demands that it detail laws it would change to implement the deal seeing that as impinging on its sovereignty the impasse triggered mr trump s decision to impose 25 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods up from 10 two days of trade talks in washington ended friday with no resolution in the senate democrats from trade dependent states said the higher tariffs were needlessly escalating the conflict being tough on china is one thing but a reckless trade war that negatively impacts american producers is not the way to go said sen tom carper d del retaliation from our trading partners has made exports from delaware 14 8 million more expensive for foreign buyers for now however that is a minority sentiment as democrats and republicans alike have largely opted to give mr trump wide leeway on china even as they criticize his tariffs on other countries that have led to retaliation against u s exports us president trump told china that it should accept his deal proposals now as it will be worse for china if it waits president donald trump warned china saturday that it should strike a trade deal with the united states now otherwise an agreement would be far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term washington and beijing are locked in a trade battle that has seen mounting tariffs sparking fears the dispute will damage the global economy two days of talks ended friday with no deal china s top negotiator said the two sides would meet again in beijing at an unspecified date but warned that china would make no concessions on important principles accusations and higher tariffs trump had accused beijing of reneging on its commitments in trade talks and ordered new punitive duties which took effect friday on 200 billion worth of chinese imports raising them to 25 percent from 10 percent he then cranked up the heat further ordering a tariff hike on almost all remaining imports 300 billion worth according to us trade representative robert lighthizer from the world s second biggest economy those tariffs would not take effect for months after a period of public comment trump also said saturday that firms could easily avoid additional costs by producing goods in the united states such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple he tweeted echoing a similar message he sent friday and even retweeted 05 11 19 now while it is true that some us firms may be able to better compete against chinese imports if a 25 tariff is implemented on more goods but there are some other issues at play the first being that there is uncertainty as to whether those tariffs will be put in place the second being that firms that import from china may well decide to shift to purchasing from other countries in asia that do not face these tariffs while the usa should gain some manufacturing jobs with increased tariffs it would be unwise to overly calculate the number the usa will likely face some inflation because of the tariffs now here is a report about china s view 12 may 2019 beijing has remained optimistic about resolving the trade war while washington has doubled down on tariffs china s chief negotiator warned however that there were some lines the country wouldn t cross chinese analysts warned that the us was perhaps not prepared for what their country was willing to withstand an editorial in the nationalist global times tabloid added that now washington had almost no leverage left the us has misunderstood the interests of both sides and seriously underestimated china s endurance the newspaper wrote china s confidence and core concerns will by no means be weakened by tariff hikes china has been making statements that it will retaliate and will not cross certain lines but china may have made several of its own miscalculations karl denniger has some negative comments about china and how it may be damaged by this trade dispute with the usa china tries to do what they always do cheat there s a basic principle of negotiation that unless you are willing to risk the other guy turning over the table and walking off once you have a bargain on a specific area of negotiation you don t take it back without it being a function of some other compromise to do so is to mark your negotiation as bad faith or worse mendacious can you get a deal under these conditions i tend to doubt it nothing is impossible but it s highly unlikely we should have never let things go this far the problem was apparent at least as far back as 2000 but nobody wanted to take it on from either side of the aisle but the siren song of corporations offshoring and getting lower costs even though they were screwing americans blind with job cuts and lower wages was just too much for congres and past presidents to resist so here we are as far as who has more to lose that one s easy they do china is a nation that has so ridiculously overheated its markets and economy with printed money that if demand contracts and thus so does gdp the results will be catastrophic perhaps even leading to the destruction of their government a military option whether through threat or otherwise is exceedingly dangerous for them as well there s no free lunch available to them in that regard either the us will not enjoy a trade embargo with china but we ll survive it and on the other side of the adjustment we ll benefit mightily from it china on the other hand likely will not survive at all with their present form of government they simply don t have the margin to absorb that kind of disruption given their centrally planned view of how things were going to turn out and which now are not their best case scenario is an economic banking system collapse their worst case is a civil collapse china may be miscalculating the amount of damage from a trade dispute with the usa china is not prophesied to be the economic leader in the 21st century china is subject to having civil unrest and other problems problems that this trade dispute could lead to that could be more than the governmental authorities will be able to prevent companies in the usa that import from china will find other suppliers for some materials that will hurt china of course china could hurt the usa by stopping the export of rare earth metals this is one area where the usa could be miscalculating and there are others yet what donald trump is doing is consistent with what was at his official presidential candidacy website donald j trump s vision negotiate fair trade deals that create american jobs increase american wages and reduce america s trade deficit donald j trump s 7 point plan to rebuild the american economy by fighting for free trade 1 withdraw from the trans pacific partnership which has not yet been ratified 2 appoint tough and smart trade negotiators to fight on behalf of american workers 3 direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers and also direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses 4 tell nafta partners that we intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers if they don t agree to a renegotiation we will submit notice that the u s intends to withdraw from the deal eliminate mexico s one side backdoor tariff through the vat and end sweatshops in mexico that undercut u s workers 5 instruct the treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator 6 instruct the u s trade representative to bring trade cases against china both in this country and at the wto china s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the wto 7 use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes if china does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of american trade secrets including the application of tariffs consistent with section 201 and 301 of the trade act of 1974 and section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 accessed 12 21 16 one major miscalculation of donald trump s trade policies has been and will be pushing china to work more closely with europe on trade matters already china is willing to work with europe related to the world trade organization as the usa is upset with it because of miscalculations with trade statements and policies from the usa europe is ending up with more leverage this is consistent with biblical prophecies that show europe will dominate trade 2 babylon 3 for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury revelation 18 2 3 both the usa and china are making miscalculations in this trade dispute and will face costs that they did not really expect some items of possibly related interest may include categories prophecy

published sunday 12 may 2019 print disqus underfunded future pension fund underfunding is a local problem make the children pay the strategic investment conference and possible recessions one difficulty in analyzing our economic future is the sheer number of potential crises when so much could go wrong and really right when the exponential technologies i foresee get here it s hard to isolate let alone navigate the real dangers we are tempted to ignore them all ignoring them is usually the right response too we can muddle through almost anything but muddling through isn t the same as smooth sailing it s difficult unpleasant and often keeps you from looking for better opportunities then there are times when you can t even muddle through instead you find yourself emotionally at a dead stop or even going backwards when surviving the storm is your focus taking those blood in the streets buying opportunities is hard which leads to this week s letter almost every day i read scores of finance and economic newsletters websites articles and books a few articles on pensions hit my inbox this week and pursuing them led me to today s topic but dear gods i can remember writing a decade ago that public pension funds were 2 trillion underfunded and getting worse more than one person told me that couldn t be right they were correct it was actually much worse see i m an optimist two years ago i wrote that disappearing pensions are the crisis we can t muddle through nothing since then has changed my mind in fact failure at all levels to even begin solving the problem is making it worse the latest estimates as we will see suggest that it has gotten 2 trillion or more worse in just a few years note we are talking here about a specific kind of pension defined benefit plans usually those sponsored by state and local governments labor unions and a dwindling number of private businesses many sponsors haven t set aside the assets needed to pay the benefits they ve promised to current and future retirees they can delay the inevitable for a long time but not forever and forever is just around the corner as we will see below the numbers are large enough to make this a problem for everyone even those without affected pensions the problem is solvable but the solutions will be problems in themselves underfunded future let s begin with the enormity of the pension funding gap as with the federal budget deficit the large numbers are hard for our minds to process they are also inherently uncertain let me explain a defined benefit pension plan for say a city s police department knows it owes a certain number of retirees certain monthly benefits for life their lifespans are fairly predictable when the pool is large enough i think new biotechnologies will change this soon but that s another topic from that it s simple math to calculate how much money the plan should have right now in order to pay those benefits when they are due but then the assumptions start the plan must presume a future rate of return on the invested portfolio an inflation rate and in some cases future health care costs medical benefits are part of many plans so when we say a plan is fully funded it may not be so if the assumptions are wrong the amount a plan is underfunded could be much larger than the sponsor and auditors say in theory it could be smaller too but i have never seen that happen the accounting rules that govern all this allow some would say encourage the sponsoring cities counties and states to understate their liabilities this lets them avoid hard decisions like raising taxes cutting benefits or reducing other needed services here s a wharton school note to place this huge number in context sanitation workers firefighters teachers and other state and local government employees have performed their duties in the public sector for decades with the understanding that their often lackluster salaries were propped up by excellent benefits including an ironclad pension but moody s investors service recently estimated that public pensions are underfunded by 4 4 trillion that amount which is equivalent to the economy of germany accounts for one fifth of national debt it s a significant concern for public employees who were banking on a fully funded retirement to get them through their golden years the true number could be much higher whatever it is filling it will be painful for somebody pensioners will receive lower than expected benefits taxpayers will get higher than expected tax bills or citizens will see government services cut or maybe all the above then again if you make more realistic assumptions on future returns the unfunded liability becomes 6 trillion according to the american legislative exchange council total state and local annual revenues are only 3 1 trillion total property taxes are roughly 590 billion here s more grim news from the heritage foundation overall the american legislative exchange council estimates that pension plans have only about a third of the funds on hand 33 7 percent that they need to pay promised benefits some states have significantly lower funding levels which means they are at risk of running out of funds in the near future once a state or local pension plan runs out of money taxpayers have to fund the pension benefits of retirees as well as the contributions of current employees connecticut kentucky and illinois have the lowest funding ratios at 20 percent 21 percent and 23 percent respectively already illinois spends as much on pensions as it does on welfare and public protection that is police and firefighters combined and nearly half of its education appropriations go toward teacher pensions if the state s pension plans reach insolvency pensions could become its single biggest cost these unfunded liability estimates are high because plan assumptions are too optimistic almost all public pension funds assume investment returns somewhere around 7 and some as high as 8 a more conservative and realistic approach would force the state and local governments to fund those pension plans at a much higher level by either raising taxes or reducing services what local politician will volunteer to do that better to find a consultant to tell you what you want to hear there are plenty of them that will for a reasonable fee billed to the taxpayers the following graphic shows how your state is ranked on a per capita funding basis you can see the absolute numbers in the following table source valuewalk a further complication is that the taxpayers who might have to cover these amounts are mobile they can move to other states with lower tax burdens leaving behind those who for whatever reason can t leave their states and to make it even more interesting the beneficiaries often no longer live in the states that pay them retired public employees from the northeast might live in florida now for instance they can t even vote for the people who govern their incomes the broader point as with the federal debt some portion of this unfunded pension debt is going to get liquidated in some manner any way we do it will hurt either the pensioners or taxpayers pension fund underfunding is a local problem thirty years ago frisco texas had fewer than 20 000 residents today its population is well over 180 000 corporations from all over america are moving there tax revenues are booming frisco is the happy exception that simply grew faster than its pension liabilities not so dallas whose police and fire pension system was advertised as solvent just a few years ago now it is so deep in the hole that the mayor says plugging the gap would take almost a doubling of city taxes i bought my dallas apartment after that news was announced but such an increase would have still made my taxes cost more than my mortgage can you say taxpayer revolt it wasn t the main reason but it did factor in to my move texas monthly recently noted for those of us in texas with our gloriously high credit ratings and fervent allegiance to low taxes restrained spending and conservative oversight of a robust rainy day fund the news that certain big cities around the country were in a heap of trouble might have elicited nothing more than a collective if somewhat condescending shrug except for one thing texas s four biggest cities were all high on the list dallas which came in second is on the hook for 7 6 billion about five times the amount of its total operating revenues houston was fourth with a 10 billion shortfall equal to four times its operating revenues austin at number nine has 2 7 billion in liabilities and san antonio ranked number twelve is 2 3 billion short that seems like very bad news for just about any texan particularly since the vast majority of texans now live in urban areas how can a state known for fiscal responsibility have so many cities with empty pockets will frisco residents want to pay for the dallas pension funding problems is the woodlands going to want to pay for houston s problems is indiana ready to pay for illinois of course not how much of a crisis will we need in order to recognize we are all in this together probably a lot bigger than you imagine make the children pay while arguments progress at the national level state and local leaders must simultaneously pay their pension benefits provide public services and keep taxes to a level that doesn t sweep them out of office or drive top taxpayers away not to mention keep the markets happy enough to sell future bond offerings until such time as the fed steps in as buyer of last resort a tall order given those choices the usual answer seems to be cut services and hope no one notices it is happening nationwide but california is in the vanguard thanks to its massive pension debt this is from a recent brookings institution note pension and health benefit costs are bending education finances in california to their will the sheer magnitude of the rising costs is staggering large numbers of school board officials who participated in our survey indicate that the rising costs are meaningfully affecting educational services for example many report making cost saving changes to district budgets that include deferred maintenance larger class sizes and fewer enrichment opportunities for students in response to rising pension and health benefit costs so in effect today s students are paying to keep benefits flowing to retired teachers and administrators meanwhile the berkeley city council is taking criticism for prioritizing pension payments ahead of public works projects voters approved bond issues supposedly dedicated to infrastructure but the city is apparently not doing the work nor is it just california in a recent study bank of america analysts found an inverse relationship between infrastructure investment and pension fund contributions each additional 1 billion in plan contributions subtracts about 2 5 billion from state and local government investment we have multiple parties fighting over pieces of the same pie all hoping that uncle sam will step in and save them uncle sam may well do it too but it won t remove the pain it will just redistribute the burden perhaps more widely but the aggregate amount won t change in my view this leads to some kind of japan like deflationary recession if we re lucky it will be mild and long it won t be fun but the alternatives would be worse the strategic investment conference and possible recessions newt gingrich asked me last week about the timing of the next recession i knew he was thinking about the election in 2020 but the data i trust the most steve blumenthal tracks it here only goes out about nine months while global recession is a possibility in the next nine months the us seems to be okay but scott minerd at guggenheim has raised his odds of a recession in 2020 timing will certainly be a topic of discussion at next week s strategic investment conference along with many other topics there will be several panels dealing with the ever increasing us and global government debt longtime readers know i am not happy with where we are or how we got here but the path we choose from here will make a big difference i think we will see japanification and massive quantitative easing throughout the developed world as i ve written the past few weeks that will bring financial repression and reduced growth of course there are those who want to go ahead and take the pain it would be severe but not of biblical proportions but i just don t see politicians and voters choosing such pain the newly fashionable modern monetary theory mmt isn t the answer though even ray dalio is now toying with it i ll be responding to him in a future letter down that path is weimar like inflation and then hyperinflation i don t think that is likely but i find it alarming that more and more people are giving mmt proponents political and philosophical cover speaking of choices donald trump has a very difficult and risky one he is the first president since nixon opened china to seriously push back on their theft of intellectual property the openness of their markets and their mercantilism i am not a fan of tariffs but something does need to be done if the higher tariff he just launched don t disappear quickly we will see a much higher recession probability i see high probability they will try to shortstop it but wargaming the multiple scenarios is simply impossible this is high stakes poker with the global economy as the pot well that and the future of both countries high stakes indeed it helps that the new tariffs won t go on goods currently in transit that amounts to a few weeks time out during which they might reach agreement before anything actually gets taxed if you want to better understand what we are dealing with in china let me suggest three books the first two are michael pillsbury s the hundred year marathon and george magnus s red flags why xi s china is in jeopardy different perspectives at the conference we will focus a lot on china with both bullish and bearish speakers then for a fun read which i finished a few days ago on the plane get david ignatius s blockbuster spy thriller science fiction novel the quantum spy it will give you insights into china s theft of intellectual property cyber warfare and who is controlling it as well as introduce you to the potential of quantum computers this book is well researched has great characters and plot and deserves the accolades it gets i can go on but seeing how few science fiction books i ve recommended over the years compared to how many i ve read pay attention to this one and with that i will hit the send button if you won t be at the sic you really should get your virtual pass which is the next best thing you can watch it live watch or listen to it later or read the transcripts have a great week i will admit sic week is the highlight of my year i am really pumped about this one so many friends so much learning and a lot of fun too how much better can it get your

spread the love strengthening the independence of the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz and improving its governance and controls will help improve the confidence required for zimbabwe to reintroduce a local currency to ease the prevailing liquidity crisis the international monetary fund imf hassaid zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009 in favour of a basket of multi currencies dominated by the united states dollar to halt hyperinflation which had rendered the local unit worthless but rising demand for the greenback which outstrips export receipts has pressured government to consider bringing back a local unit last month finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube told bloomberg tv that a fully fledged currency will be in place within 12 months imf resident representative for zimbabwe patrick amir imam told business times that it does not matter which currency regime is in place as long as the pre requisites for currency stability are met adding the decision on whether to introduce a national currency rests with zimbabwe having said all this strengthening the independence of the rbz and improving its governance and controls will further help to gain confidence in the new currency imam said adding that the financial autonomy of the central bank has been challenged in recent years as it extended significant credit to the government through statutory advances thus improving the governance and financial autonomy are prerequisites for a more independent central bank to conduct monetary policy and will help further the stability of the new currency the central bank was accused by economists of failing to rein in government s expenditure through issuance of treasury bills tbs tbs issuances increased to us 7 6bn by end of august 2018 from us 2 1bn in 2016 treasury bills to gdp ratio jumped to 36 5 percent by end of august 2018 from 4 4 percent according to treasury these tbs were issued through private placement unlike the auction system which is more market oriented and improves the process of price discovery and better pricing treasury reported last year that government s overdraft at the central bank was us 2 3bn against the stipulated limit of us 762 6m in the eight months to august government borrowing from the central bank is capped at 20 percent of its revenue in the previous year before his reappointment last week central bank chief john mangudya was under pressure from political actors who were lobbying against the reappointment blaming him for rising prices triggered by the shortage of foreign currency imam said there is a common understanding among all stakeholders that zimbabwe needs a stable currency to prosper adding that there are pros and cons of having a dollarised system in place or a local currency the history of zimbabwe has shown that a dollarised system can succeed as it did after the hyperinflation period when the right conditions were in place or that it can fail as it did in the past two years when the pre requisites are lacking imam said similarly zimbabwe s history also illustrates that having one s own currency can work as it did after independence or fail as it did in 2008 09 depending on whether the macroeconomic conditions for stability are in place source business times share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best follow paul wiseman on twitter at
pakistan and the imf have reached a new agreement securing a 6 billion bailout for the cash strapped country officials said sunday following months of painstaking negotiations between the two sides the agreement marks pakistan s 22nd bailout with the fund as the country struggles to stave off a looming balance of payments crisis while its economy teeters due to low growth soaring inflation and mounting debt the programme aims to support the authorities strategy for stronger and more balanced growth by reducing domestic and external imbalances improving the business environment strengthening institutions increasing transparency and protecting social spending said ramirez rigo head of the imf delegation in a statement released late sunday according to pakistan s finance advisor abdul hafeez sheikh the country is set to receive 6 billion from the imf in addition to 2 to 3 billion from the world bank and asian development bank over the next three years we have a 12 billion gap in our annual payments and we don t have the capacity to pay them sheik said in a televised address as he announced the new agreement with the fund analysts have warned that any fresh imf deal would likely come with myriad restrictions that could hobble prime minister imran khan s grand promises to build an islamic welfare state as the country is forced to tighten its purse strings battered economy the deal with the imf comes weeks after sheikh a former world bank official who was pakistan s finance minister from 2010 2013 was appointed as adviser on finance after finance minister asad umar resigned amid a wide ranging cabin reshuffle the abrupt resignation of umar one of khan s most powerful ministers was particularly shocking due to his perceived role in overseeing the vital negotiations with the imf over the long delayed bailout the announcement comes as discontent is already growing over measures khan s government has taken to fend off the crisis including devaluing the rupee by some 30 percent since january 2018 sending inflation to five year highs a government report published friday also noted that pakistan s growth rate is set to hit an eight year low with the country s gdp rate likely to sink to 3 3 percent against a projected target of 6 2 percent pakistan has had 21 bailouts since it joined the imf in 1950 its most recent loan was issued in 2013 worth 6 6 billion the united arab emirates pakistan s largest trading partner in the middle east and a major investment source recently offered 3 billion to support the battered economy islamabad also secured 6 billion in funding from saudi arabia and struck a 12 month deal for a cash lifeline during khan s visit to the kingdom in october however the influx of gulf cash failed to reverse the economic headwinds battering pakistan as high fuel prices low tax yields and rising inflation have kept the country off balance the crisis also comes as pakistan is facing possible sanctions from the financial action task force an anti money laundering monitor based in paris for failing to rein in terror financing the organisation will soon decide whether to add pakistan to a blacklist that would trigger automatic sanctions further weakening pakistan s already faltering economy to add to its woes the united states has also warned that it will be watching closely to ensure pakistan does not use imf money to repay debts to china which has poured billions into the country for infrastructure projects under its belt and road initiative us president donald trump has already proven to show little sympathy for pakistan after last year cutting 300 million in military aid that had been flowing over logistical assistance to us forces in afghanistan afp

weekly outlook brexit lack of progress us china trade tensions play havoc with fx exchange rates us retail sales uk employment data china ip retail sales coming up this week this week was a fine example of why it s hard to make money in fx nowadays looking at the graph of how currencies moved over the week it follows a clear risk off pattern jpy and chf gained while the commodity currencies fell then late thursday the mood improved and the laggards gained while the gainers lagged there were few ways to make money trading on one s view on individual currencies above g10 currencies vs usd the driving force behind the moves was a risk off trade motivated by the fall in stock markets globally which was due to the trump administration s sudden warning that the trade talks with china are on the verge of collapsing and the us would hike tariffs on chinese imports there is one small catch though the tariffs won t apply to goods that are currently in transit that means there s a breathing space of two to four weeks in which the two sides can reach an agreement perhaps that s why stocks in asia recovered on friday despite no progress yet and why the risk off trade reversed somewhat we ll see if trump s move was just a way to ratchet up the pressure or if the talks really are headed for collapse it may be that both sides miscalculated the other s position and the talks are indeed headed for disaster as a result if so that could be a disaster for the global economy too china can not only raise tariffs on us goods it can take a number of non tariff measures that would severely disrupt global supply chains remember back in 2010 when the country surreptitiously banned exporting rare earth metals to japan in retaliation for japan arresting a fishing boat captain whose trawler collided with two japanese patrol vessels it can also allow the cny to depreciate further which would probably cause other em currencies to decline in sympathy coming at a time when the global manufacturing business is already barely expanding the moves have the potential to throw the global business cycle back into recession above global manufacturing pmis advertisement above citi economic indicators the risk off mood could also get a boost from the heightened tensions between the us and both north korea and iran plus the disillusionment of what may have been pm may s last gasp on brexit see below a weak aud and nzd are the natural counterparts to a strong jpy in a risk off environment usually though aud would be affected more than nzd this time however nzd fell for reasons particular to that currency namely that the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz cut interest rates although the bank also stated that the cut provides a more balanced outlook for interest rates the market doesn t think so it attributes a 46 chance to another cut this year vs zero for a hike the reserve bank of australia rba also hinted at a possible change in rates although it was vague about which direction that might be it just said that the board will be paying close attention to developments in the labour market at its upcoming meetings that suggests a cut if you think the labor market is going to weaken or a hike if you think it s likely to strengthen in any case even though they changed the last paragraph of the statement for the first time since march 2018 the aud was little changed the market sees an 84 chance of a rate cut this year little changed from 89 before the rba meeting above rba rbnz it s notable that usd was down in this risk off environment it seems to me that this is because the market assumes a us china trade war is bad for the us too after all no matter what trump claims the tariffs are paid for by us consumers not china although chinese firms may hold down their selling prices in order to keep their goods competitive furthermore china is imposing retaliatory tariffs of its own although of course there are more chinese exports to the us to be taxed than there are us exports to china gbp was down only slightly during much of the week but fell more sharply on thursday an agreement between the conservatives and labour on brexit has started to look a lot less likely while the early departure of pm may has started to look a lot more likely if or when it seems she goes her replacement will probably be someone who is only interested in getting the uk out of the eu asap and doesn t much care how that raises the odds of crashing out without an agreement which would be terrible for sterling terrible but entirely possible and increasingly probable in my view the coming week us retail sales uk employment data china ip retail sales there are few highlights on the schedule for the coming week no major central bank meetings or speeches and few crucial indicators for the us the most important indicator will the retail sales figure on wednesday last month was a blow out figure this month analysts are expecting it to revert to trend the figure has been extremely volatile of late though and so i wonder just how likely that is still another rise coming right after such a big jump would tend to confirm that the us consumer is alive well out shopping as always that would be positive for the dollar above us retail sales other important us indicators coming out during the week include industrial production and the empire state manufacturing index on wednesday housing starts and building permits as well as the philadelphia fed survey on thursday and the university of michigan consumer sentiment survey on friday in europe the first estimate of q1 german gdp will be released on wednesday but that will be followed a few hours later by the second estimate of eu wide gdp for the same period so it s likely to have only limited impact above german vs eu gdp the zew survey comes out on tuesday but to me this is only of importance as an indicator of market sentiment not of economic activity since it s a poll of analysts and not people who really do something for gbp the market will be watching the employment data on tuesday it s expected to show yet another healthy rise in the number of people working albeit not as large an increase as in the last three months at the same time the pace of growth in wages is expected to slow by one notch the combination of somewhat slower job growth and somewhat slower wage growth could be taken as slightly negative for the economy and the pound although probably the difference isn t enough to have much impact on the currency in any case brexit and pm may s political future are likely to be more important factors for the pound above uk employment china will release its usual mid month trio of indicators on wednesday namely retail sales industrial production and fixed asset investment no big change is expected in retail sales and fia industrial production which surged in the previous month is expected to fall back to trend the surge in march may have been due to companies trying to produce products for the us before the tariffs come into force as it coincided with a surge in exports 14 2 yoy it may also have been caused by the surprisingly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in q1 which resulted in a steady gdp growth rate of 6 4 yoy regardless of why the surge occurred the market doesn t expect it to last and sees production falling back even so the expected rate of 6 5 would be quite healthy seeing as the six month before last surge averaged 5 7 the news would probably confirm in people s minds that the stimulus in china is working it would therefore tend to be positive for countries that export a lot to china such as aud and nzd above twis above change last 24hrs
gbp usd update 3 the pound to us dollar exchange rates failed to maintain the 1 3 level as monday s session progressed with sterling sliding lower to trade at 1 295 ahead of tuesday s european session the slide in the british came as the usd regained some its safe haven appeal following comments by trump that trade talks with china are going to be very successful partially allaying investor concerns while usually a relatively safe port in a storm the ramifications of a full blown trade war saw the greenback soften along with risk sensitive peers as investors gauged the potential negative impact on the us economy meanwhile a continued lack of progress on the brexit front left the british with very little appeal contributing to the decline brexit and trade will remain in focus for the session ahead while we ll also see some key data releases for the uk the latest round of ons labour market statistics are expected to reflect a continuation of tight conditions with the unemployment rate forecast to remain at the multi decade low of 3 9 and average earnings 3m y expected to print healthy 3 4 growth sterling will also be in focus today with labor market numbers scheduled for release unlike eurozone data the risk is to the downside manufacturing service and construction sectors all reported weaker job growth and if weekly average earnings growth slows as well gbp usd could drop below 1 29 gbp usd update 2 confined to the range which dominated the latter half of last week s session the pound to us dollar exchange rates rose on monday with sterling last seen trading at 1 30341 up 0 24 while remaining within the 1 3 1 304 local range global risk sentiment remained the key theme into monday s session with the chinese government officially announcing their plans to retaliate in kind to us tariffs by hiking import duties on 60b worth of us goods with the increased tariffs set to come into effect on juse 1st while the dollar often benefits during periods of risk aversion the direct impact a reciprocated trade war could have on the us economy with for example moody s analytics stating a full blown trade war could tip the us economy into a recession in 2020 saw the greenback on the back foot against several key peers advertisement a terrible conservative performance at european elections 23 may looks fully priced in it s interesting though to see labour s position subtly shifting on brexit it now seems to be formally embracing a confirmatory vote second referendum wrote ing economists adding another strong uk jobs data report could give gbp a brief

jobs market and health wage growth with the unemployment rate forecast to remain at 3 9 and earnings to have grown 3 4 3m y neverhteless with brexit uncertainty in the picture domestic data has taken something of a backseat we are in this limbo period we seem to be in this data paralysis wrote currency analyst george vessey of western union business solutions adding customers who previously would have been sitting on the sidelines they are now saying for at least the next six months the pound is going to be stuck where it is for the greenback relative to the british it s a busy week on the data front with tuesday s import prices and wednesday s retail sales figures expected to hold the highest market moving potential with the releases expected to come under scrutiny as investors attempt to glean the fed s path for interest rates while the pound was highly unappealing throughout last week and plunged against most major rival currencies the british pound to us dollar exchange rates edged higher before markets closed for the week as investors also sold the us dollar due to a combination of trade jitters and weak us data the us dollar outlook is weakening for now investors are anticipating more us data after opening the week at the level of 1 3170 gbp usd briefly touched on a one month high of 1 3176 before spending most of the week tumbling gbp usd briefly touched a weekly low of 1 2973 towards the end of the week but on friday the pair rebounded just slightly due to broad weakness in the us dollar on friday afternoon gbp usd trended a little higher at around 1 3030 pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate avoids further losses amid us dollar weakness despite a lack of support for the pound last week the currency was able to avoid ending the week near its lowest levels the biggest cause of pound to us dollar exchange rate movement throughout the week was largely market concerns that brexit uncertainty was here to stay for a good few months longer as hopes for a cross party brexit deal faded with brexit hopes unwinding and the pound slumping the us dollar capitalised on this weakness for most of the week too investors found safe haven currencies like the us dollar more appealing as trade tensions between the us and china flared up again us president donald trump expressed frustration at china for pulling back on concessions and the us began to implement higher trade tariffs in what some analysts called a resumption of the trade war the us dollar s benefit from this news was limited as well as investors became concerned that if the us economy is impacted by trade tensions it could pressure the federal reserve to cut us interest rates at some point on top of this at the end of the week the latest us inflation data disappointed investors and left the us dollar even less appealing as us inflation fell short of forecasts fed interest rate cut bets rose and investors sold the us dollar this helped the pound to recover a little ground before markets closed for the week pound gbp exchange rate forecast uk political developments to drive movement with markets no longer anticipating cross party brexit negotiations to succeed investors are looking ahead to upcoming political events for the next influences on the outlooks for brexit and britain s economy no notable brexit developments are expected over the next week or so leaving investors to focus on whether or not cross party brexit talks collapse and how the conservative party looks to handle the upcoming eu elections with the conservative party predicted to shed support in the eu elections and uk prime minister theresa may under increasing pressure to step down the pound may be in for further losses tuesday will see the publication of britain s latest job market data but amid the market focus on brexit and uk politics this is unlikely to have much of an impact on the pound s movement us dollar usd exchange rate forecast weak us data could worsen fed interest rate cut bets rising us china trade tensions were already causing concerns about the damage that trade tensions could cause the us economy and analysts have warned that they could pressure the federal reserve to cut us interest rates fed interest rate cut speculation flared up more when us inflation fell short of forecasts on friday so if next week s us data continues to fall short it could lead to further us dollar weakness compared to next week s uk economic calendar the us calendar is relatively packed us import and export prices data will be published on tuesday with us retail sales and production stats from april due on wednesday us building permits and housing starts will follow on thursday with michigan university s us consumer sentiment survey rounding the week off on friday while there will be plenty of us data for investors to react to the pound to us dollar exchange rate could also be influenced by any surprise developments in us china trade negotiations throughout the week
the new zealand dollar was weaker early monday after the us moved to impose additional tariffs on china and said there are more to come as last week s talks failed to reach a deal the kiwi was trading at 65 80 us cents at 8am monday versus 65 97 us cents late friday in new york the trade weighted index was at 72 03 versus 72 18 late friday on friday the us administration increased tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese goods raising the rate from 10 percent to 25 percent it is now threatening to impose 25 percent on an additional us 300 billion of chinese goods on sunday however white house chief economic adviser larry kudlow in an interview with fox said both sides will suffer in a trade war adding that president donald trump and president xi jinping of china are likely to meet in japan next month to continue negotiations trump was less conciliatory tweeting that any deal would be far worse for china in his second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs he said according to anz bank fx rates strategist sandeep parekh china has vowed to retaliate but the details of its action remain scant chinese vice premier liu has also reiterated that china is looking to agree a deal but insists it will be a cooperative agreement between the two nations the potential fallout from the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations weighs on the kiwi given that china is the country s leading trading partner parekh said the market will be keeping a close eye on any further tweets from us president trump about more tariffs the market will also be watching for the yuan level the people s bank of china sets today said mike shirley a dealer at kiwibank according to shirley the yuan is weaker in the spot market which implies it will be set at a lower level today a weaker yuan would partially offset the impact of the tariffs the kiwi was trading at 4 4907 chinese yuan versus 4 5010 late friday it was at 94 23 australian dollars versus 94 12 and at 50 69 british pence from 50 74 it was trading at 58 62 euro cents from 58 68 and at 72 29 japanese yen from 72 18 businessdesk comments from our readers no comments yet add your comment your name your email not displayed to the public comment comments to sharechat go through an approval process comments which are defamatory abusive or in some way deemed inappropriate will not be approved it is allowable to use some form of non de plume for your name however we recommend real email addresses are used comments from free email addresses such as gmail yahoo hotmail etc may not be approved anti spam verification type the text you see in the image into the field below you are asked to do this in order to verify that this enquiry is not being performed by an automated process related news hgh meets challenger bank milestone nz 210m equity raise april 8th morning report being ai limited trade with caution statement fletcher building executive team announcement manawa energy appoints gm market operations gm people april 5th morning report paysauce quarterly market update march 2024 april 3rd morning report bank of china new zealand limited director change ccc appointment of ceo aiden keegan
markets have been resilient so far to confirmation that the us would increase tariffs on around 200b worth of chinese imports to 25 after initially falling us and chinese equities and us treasury yields ended higher on the day on friday currency movements including the nzd have been contained after plenty of speculation during friday at 4 01pm nzt the us confirmed that it was raising tariffs on around 200b of chinese tariffs from 10 to 25 china responded that it would be forced to retaliate although it didn t specify how china has already applied tariffs to nearly all us imports in response to trump s previous tariffs but it could use non trade countermeasures including making business more difficult for us firms operating in china and potentially allowing the cny to depreciate the us will start the process on monday to apply tariffs on the remaining 300b of chinese imports after finishing talks on friday chinese vice premier liu said that in order to reach an agreement the us must remove all extra tariffs the us had reportedly argued for the tariffs to be removed in stages as part of an enforcement mechanism set realistic targets for chinese purchases of us goods and ensure the text of the deal is balanced the chinese had reportedly reneged on a prior agreement to implement aspects of the deal into chinese law markets have taken the confirmation of trade tariffs in their stride so far the csi300 index of chinese equities fell over 3 intraday after the news was announced before ending the session up 3 6 likewise the s p500 fell as much as 1 6 in the us session before recovered sharply over the final few hours of trading to finish up 0 4 on the day that still left the s p500 down 2 2 on the week and us treasury yields mirrored those movements in equities with the 10 year treasury yield closing 2bps higher at 2 47 despite a marginally softer than expected us cpi release the relatively sanguine market response so far probably reflects market hopes that a deal can still be reached between the two sides the 25 tariff rate won t apply to goods already in transit from china to the us creating a two to four week window for negotiators to come to an agreement before the economic impact hits trump tweeted on friday that the talks had been candid and constructive and maintains that he has a good relationship with chinese president xi over the weekend white house economic advisor larry kudlow said that treasury secretary mnuchin and trade representative lighthizer had been invited back to beijing to continue talks importantly kudlow mentioned that there was a strong possibility that trump and xi could meet at the g20 summit in japan at the end of june the two leaders agreed to a ceasefire when they met at the g20 late last year trump has released a barrage of trade related tweets over the weekend ranging from his approval for tariffs love collecting big tariffs saying it s in chinese interests to agree to a deal before his second term and floating the possibility of buying agricultural goods directly from farmers and sending this as aid to poorer countries currency movements were also relatively contained on friday with the usd slightly weaker on the day there was little market reaction to the slightly softer than expected us core cpi release 0 14 vs 0 2 expected weakness in apparel prices for the second month running and used car prices weighed on the core index while rental inflation remained strong there was nothing in the data likely to move the needle for the fed the canadian dollar outperformed 0 5 after a very strong employment report which showed a 106k increase in jobs 12k expected a fall in the unemployment rate and higher than expected wage growth the japanese yen gave back some of its recent gains amidst the sharp recovery in equity markets late in the session and ended the day down 0 2 at near 110 the gbp also underperformed 0 1 amidst growing angst against theresa may with the conservatives languishing in the polls for the european parliamentary elections behind nigel farage s brexit party the nzd was similarly little changed on friday it traded a relatively tight given the volatility in other markets 0 6587 0 6612 range after the nz market close and ended the week around 0 66 during the local session on friday rbnz deputy governor bascand gave an interview in which he indicated the bank retained an easing bias and would be watching the budget in late may among other indicators to see whether more stimulus was required bascand framed the rate cut as more of a fine tuning exercise in order to boost growth to 3 and therefore lift inflation the modest amount needed to get to target there was little reaction to the bascand speech in both the fx and rates markets there was a mild 0 5bp 1bp decline in the nz swap curve on friday although those moves should reverse today after its decision to keep rates on hold last week the rba released its quarterly statement of monetary policy somp on friday the rba removed any reference to there being no strong case to adjust the cash rate in the near term confirming that rba meetings going forward are live the rba cut its forecasts for growth and inflation this year but there were only modest adjustments for the following two years the aud ended friday close to 0 70 up 0 2 on the day but still within vicinity of its recent lows the key for the rba at present is the labour market any weakness will almost certainly see a rate cut the labour market report is released on thursday and our nab colleagues look for lower than consensus job growth 5k vs 15k expected and an unchanged unemployment rate at 5 the wage price index released on wednesday will also garner attention the week ahead is likely to be

after president donald trump raised tariffs on 200 billion of imported chinese goods trade experts worried that china which has the world s second largest economy will unleash a pandora s box of punitive tactics against american companies the chinese ministry of commerce said thursday that while it hopes the united states can meet china halfway make joint efforts and resolve the issue through cooperation and consultation it would take countermeasures but some economists remained unfazed by the escalating tensions pointing out that while the united states imports more than 500 billion worth of goods from china the value of american exports is only around 130 billion this imbalance means that china is out of ammunition in tit for tat tariff responses it s true that the base on which they can put on additional tariffs is much more narrow than the u s said ludovic subran global head of macroeconomic research at allianz and chief economist at euler hermes but subran and other international trade experts warn not to count china out too quickly the first thing to observe here is that china is not a country of laws it s an authoritarian dictatorship said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics who warned that american businesses could be hurt by trump s antagonism so from that opening point china is potentially able to play much much dirtier than the united states he will essentially force the chinese government to retaliate in other ways and those other ways can be much more costly to american firms he said that belief is premised on a fundamentally erroneous assumption about how the modern economy works and a lack of concern with how engaged american businesses are involved already in china american manufacturers like automakers have made considerable investments into manufacturing facilities in china and the financial and professional services sectors have a large and profitable presence there these and other multinationals operating in china are vulnerable to a wide array of actions the government could take against them for example chinese officials could slow the customs process for u s products entering the country launch investigations into or spring inspections onto factories hotels or other businesses all activities for which a veneer of plausible deniability would make proving a punitive motive difficult the chinese government could restrict access to its market by stopping american business investment or if the situation worsened mandate that they divest entirely said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics for manufacturers in particular this prospect could be a big hit to the bottom line that would be very disruptive it would be more costly and it would be a mess zandi said the biggest fear is the inability for companies that make profits to repatriate their dividends as easily as they want to financial companies along with legal consulting and other professional service providers could also find themselves facing more hurdles sabran said they could start to show their teeth a little bit and make it more difficult to do business he said they could basically put additional regulatory constraints on these businesses he said such as requiring china based executives to be fluent chinese speakers requiring data centers to be located in china or perhaps most onerous placing capital controls on repatriating profits the biggest fear is the inability for companies that make profits to repatriate their dividends as easily as they want to subran said china s control over a state run media could also be weaponized turning china s millennial middle class against american consumer brands economic patriotism is very high subran said a campaign against highly visible products like gm cars starbucks coffee apple iphones or even boeing jets could damage these companies profitability in china other retaliatory measures at china s disposal could expand the current confrontation beyond trade and into currency markets the other qualitative thing they could do devalue the currency that would be even more extreme to offset the impact of the tariffs on their products zandi said adding that evidence suggests china has been keeping the yuan from falling in value recently a reversal could roil currency markets china could also sell off or stop buying u s government debt a dire prospect given that the united states already faces rising costs to service its growing debt experts think this is less likely in that the tactic would be a double edged sword it would hurt the u s economy but would also seriously depreciate the value of the huge cache of treasuries already held by china but the more unpredictable the dispute becomes the greater the risks to all parties involved the odds that there s a misstep here are rising even if he does take it back he s doing damage zandi said of trump business relationships are about trust and he s blowing this apart

the optimism of a reboot by gov ned lamont is waning for the new democratic governor in the midst of a divisive dispute over electronic tolls a row over who can decide how much the state borrows his resistance to raising taxes on millionaires and his cabinet picks lamont is the fifth most unpopular governor in the nation and the least popular first term governor according to a morning consult poll released last week which gave the greenwich telecommunications magnate a 33 percent approval rating and a 38 percent disapproval rating twenty nine percent of respondents didn t know enough to form an opinion about lamont who ran unsuccessfully twice before for statewide office that s the kind of wrath usually reserved for well established incumbents such as lamont s predecessor and fellow democrat dannel p malloy who left office in january with an approval in the 20s but in contrast to the former two term governor who bristled at his popularity metrics those who know lamont best say that he s not impervious to the criticism and wants to be liked they attribute lamont s rough start to a confluence of daunting fiscal realities and the struggle to find middle ground between the progressive flank of his party and the millionaire executive class that has been fleeing connecticut for more tax friendly states such as florida lamont s free flowing collaborative approach some say isn t always suited to the no holds barred nature of governing either lamont said in an interview friday that he s not discouraged by his poll numbers and is tackling complex issues such as transportation funding head on he favors tolls over a republican alternative known as prioritize progress that relies exclusively on borrowing money by reallocating money from other construction projects such as schools hey everybody here around is anti what are you for are you for more bonding lamont said lamont has faced criticism from both the right and the left during his first four months in office during which he s grappled with a projected two year 3 7 billion budget deficit massive unfunded state employee pension liabilities and a transportation quagmire gov ned lamont s deptartment of economic and community development commissioner david lehman speaks with reporters there was also intense scrutiny during the confirmation of lamont s economic development commissioner david lehman a former goldman sachs executive who testified before congress about the u s financial meltdown lehman was ultimately approved and joined a lamont cabinet that includes ryan drajewicz a former chris dodd aide and one time executive at the world s largest hedge fund bridgewater associates in westport the pick of drajewicz also raised eyebrows among progressives it s one thing to be intellectually prepared to do unpopular things but then deal with the day to day unpleasantness of the public criticism said former state attorney general george jepsen who played an instrumental role in lamont s candidacy last year lamont s critics say he did serious harm to his credibility and political brand when a month into office he abandoned his campaign pledge to only toll out of state trucks a plan that the governor would not stand up to court challenges from the trucking industry and won t raise the money needed to modernize connecticut s crumbling and gridlocked transportation infrastructure you can t tell people one thing on the campaign trail and turn around and do something else and not have a negative reaction said liz kurantowicz a former chief of staff for the connecticut gop and political consultant from fairfield clearly voters are not responding well tom swan who managed lamont s 2006 u s senate campaign and is executive director of the connecticut citizen action group said there s a frustration among progressives even when he s doing good things like the minimum wage and paid leave his folks are trying to water those down in a way that would alienate key supporters swan said for example swan said a bill raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2023 which passed the house thursday morning after a 14 hour debate does not increase the tipped wage paid to restaurant wait staff and bartenders so if you re a restaurant worker you re going to not be happy with him on the minimum wage swan said you can go through a bunch of these bills where he s sort of trying to play both sides democrats in the legislature recently rebuffed many elements of a sales tax expansion proposed by lamont on legal real estate and accounting services they also introduced a 2 percent surcharge tax on investment income for joint filers with incomes over 1 million which lamont opposes even the finance and revenue committee not known as a bastion of progressive policies said to him we can t accept your tax package we need more progressive revenue in here swan said swan said it s too early to write off lamont however people want to give ned a chance he said i don t know if anybody can be prepared for the challenges of being a governor connecticut s top tax rate for capital gains would rise to 8 99 percent under the the proposal of legislative democrats making it the sixth highest in the nation i understand symbolically where people are going but it s really the wrong policy if you want to get this state growing again lamont said scott mclean a political science professor at quinnipiac university said lamont s deference to the wealthy has come at a price he took off the table the whole idea of a millionaire s surtax and made it really appear that he wants to balance the budget by more taxes on the middle class and on connecticut drivers mclean said mclean said lamont has a penchant for floating trial balloons that aren t always helpful like in late january when his administration briefly entertained a 2 percent sales tax on groceries which angered residents i think he was floating these ideas to see how the public reacted without having a serious proposal mclean said i think that came across as indecisive if there s an upside to lamont s rocky start mclean said it s that he s confronted the most thorny issues first even though lamont is a nice guy it is a very machiavellian thing to do all the hard things in the beginning he said lamont suffered a setback earlier this month when the legislature s finance revenue and bonding committee voted 46 4 to seize control of the state s borrowing authority from lamont who had proposed a debt diet that would reduce annual bonding from 2 billion to 1 3 billion i don t think he realizes the legislature is as strong as it is and wants to be even stronger said rep livvy floren r greenwich a close friend of lamont and 10 term legislator floren said it not easy governing and putting together an administration i think he was kind of feeling his way trying to make it a different structure in the executive branch floren said will it work i don t know his heart s in the right place roy occhiogrosso a democratic strategist and former top adviser to malloy said job approval ratings are not an indicator of effectiveness and that one would have to have magical powers to be popular as connecticut s governor it means he s doing his job occhiogrosso said it s tough medicine it s what the state needs ask them what the alternative is one of lamont s republican counterparts new hampshire s chris sununu tried to seize on connecticut s troubles in an appearance on cnbc s squawk box wednesday morning the same day the morning consult poll was released sununu has a 64 percent approval rating the third highest in the nation i d fix connecticut in about 20 minutes sununu said when asked what he would do if he had to change places with lamont they don t put themselves in a position to be successful an opponent of highway tolls holds a sign at a rally for the anti toll movement at the state capitol earlier this year no singular issue has defined lamont s first four months in office more than tolls in february lamont caught the state by surprise with a video message proposing tolls on all vehicles on interstates 95 91 84 and route 15 the following day the governor dispatched drajewicz to answer questions from the media about lamont s flip flop lamont said a number of lawmakers have expressed concerns about a backlash because of the unpopularity of tolls our job is to lead he said former state democratic chairwoman nancy dinardo said lamont understood what he was getting himself into when he ran for governor last year and that lamont s love for connecticut is undeniable considering the economic state of connecticut people certainly will be angry unless you can turn it around quickly dinardo said i think ned understood what the state was like and i think he felt that he could make a difference lamont senior adviser colleen flanagan johnson who previously worked in the malloy administration said it shouldn t be a knock on lamont that he s inclusive it s nice to have someone that knows what they know and knows what they don t know she said i think you see that he doesn t rule with an iron first and why is that bad thing

washington president donald trump s combative approach to trade has been one of the constants among his often shifting political views and he s showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies the president went after china on day 1 of his presidential bid promising to bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places trump s views on trade helped forge his path to victory in states such as pennsylvania michigan wisconsin and ohio where he linked the loss of manufacturing jobs to the north america free trade agreement and other trade deals he warned the worst was yet to come with president barack obama s proposed trans pacific partnership his trashing of existing and proposed trade agreements grabbed the headlines but he also made clear his view that globalization had been bad for america and that he would use tariffs to protect national security and domestic producers he cited the nation s founding fathers abraham lincoln and ronald reagan as leaders whose footsteps he was following when it came to trade and tariffs our original constitution did not even have an income tax trump told voters in monessen pa four months before the 2016 presidential election instead it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production taking on china no 7 on his list of trade promises in that speech taking on china for its theft of american trade secrets this is so easy i love saying this i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with existing trade laws trump said those laws include section 232 of the trade expansion act which trump cited to enact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from china canada mexico and elsewhere they also include section 301 of the trade act which trump used last year to apply 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion of goods that 10 percent was increased to 25 percent on friday trump is laying the groundwork to extend the 25 percent tariff to all of china s exports to the u s such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple trump tweeted on saturday of course america s trading partners haven t let trump s tariffs stand without taking similar action themselves farmers boat makers and whiskey and wine producers are just some of the u s industries caught in the middle farming is a very small margin small profit business we rely on lots of volume and lots of sales to generate a profit said brent bible a soybean and corn farmer in lafayette ind who has seen prices for both commodities drop in the past year we are operating at a loss now trump s philosophy on some issues has evolved over the years he once described himself regarding the abortion issue as very pro choice now his administration promotes him as the most pro life president in american history complaint about japan on trade not so much in trump the art of the deal trump complained of the japanese that what s unfortunate is that for decades now they have become wealthier in large measure by screwing the united states with a self serving trade policy that our political leaders have never been able to fully understand or counteract fast forward nearly three decades and trump declared in his 2015 announcement for the presidency that other nations were prospering at america s expense when was the last time anybody saw us beating let s say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time trump said trump s approach on trade is a dramatic departure for the republican party but gop lawmakers have declined to take action that would block his tariffs they credit his tactics for getting improvements to a trade deal with canada and mexico to replace nafta and for getting china to the negotiating table president trump is the first president to take china head on said texas rep kevin brady the top republican on the house ways and means committee he said everyone knows i m not a fan of tariffs but i think everyone knows as well that china has been cheating for far too long trump has received some encouragement from democratic leaders senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y tweeted to trump don t back down strength is the only way to win with china current and former officials in the administration believe that voters will give the president credit for standing up to china and not blame him for any pain that may result from the tariffs war overall ap votecast found americans critical in their assessments of trump on trade but that s not the case with his supporters according to the survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide 45 approved of trump on trade while 53 disapproved among voters who approved of trump s job overall fully 88 approved of his handling of trade who pays while trump casts his tariffs as being paid for by china they actually are paid by the american companies that bring a product into the u s this can help some u s producers though because it makes their goods more competitive pricewise still the burden of trump s tariffs on imports from china and other countries falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses that buy imports said a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university republican leaning business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce have warned that the tariffs threaten to derail the economy raise unemployment but with economic growth at 3 2 percent last quarter and the unemployment rate at 3 6 percent trump isn t changing strategy now tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch trump tweeted on friday
the spending and budget plans of scott morrison and bill shorten could be undermined by a slowing economy with growing fears cash strapped households will retreat further into their shells fresh forecasts from the reserve bank of australia point to treasury being forced to tell whoever wins saturday s election that the economy is struggling casting doubt on labor s spending proposals and the coalition s plan to build budget surpluses so it can afford 158 billion in tax cuts for middle and high income earners economists already believe the rba s downward forecasts which incorporate an assumption of two interest rate cuts over the next 12 months point to doubts over the budget handed down by treasurer josh frydenberg less than six weeks ago new forecasts from the reserve bank and commentary from governor philip lowe point to problems ahead for the winner of saturday s election credit aap the biggest difference is around wages growth with the rba slashing its previous forecasts to well below treasury projections

immediately afterwards japan will host the g20 summit from 28 29 june australia faces three major problems in its uphill battle for influence at these meetings the first is that australia will not

during the 2013 saint petersburg g20 election disruptions meant sending then foreign minister bob carr and in australia s own 2014 brisbane summit then prime minister tony abbott hosted but appeared unprepared prime minister scott morrison was similarly unprepared for the 2018 buenos aires g20 having just replaced malcolm turnbull before the meeting australia cannot afford to take chances with

this month s federal election the image of german chancellor angela merkel barely concealing her boredom with meeting her fifth australian leader in five years during the last g20 summit spoke volumes

popular with us buyers are now also producing more austere reds favoured by a segment of a rapidly expanding market of chinese drinkers since 2008 australia s wine exports to the us have fallen 37 per cent exports to china have risen 959 per cent around the globe longtime allies are planning for a world in which the us is no longer the economic centre for all the frustrations of doing business with

maintaining the country s long standing national security alliance with the us while also looking to nurture the relationship with china neither party s leaders have adopted the bellicose anti china language of us president donald trump nor the use of tariffs to try to force the chinese to yield to australian demands the trump administration recently raised tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese imports to 25 per cent from 10 per cent and threatened to expand the tariffs to encompass all chinese imports australia s cultural affinity with the us remains strong australian and us troops fought together in world war ii and more recently in afghanistan and iraq the countries intelligence agencies share some of their deepest secrets but in terms of cold hard australian dollars the nation s

national security matters but also knows that its economic future and present are tied to china australia and china have had a trade agreement since 2015 china s huge population and rapid growth will inevitably pull more countries into its economic orbit but that strong pull also reflects recent steps by the us to undermine institutions that americans themselves helped create to guide the global economic system the trump administration for example has levied steel and aluminum tariffs on close allies ostensibly on national security grounds walked away from the trans pacific partnership aimed at creating a trade bloc that could counter chinese influence and taken steps to undermine the world trade organisation which many smaller countries view as essential to getting a fair shake in global commerce the incumbent government led by prime minister scott morrison has sought to maintain close ties with both the us and china it has passed a law to try to reduce foreign influence in australian politics and is pledging increases in spending for defence and cybersecurity inevitably in the period ahead we will be navigating a higher degree of us china strategic competition morrison said in a

will inevitably affect the nature of our interactions penny wong a senator expected to be foreign minister if labor prevails said in a recent appearance but those realities include the fact that china will remain important to australia s prosperity the absence of a full throated debate reflects a widespread acceptance that the economic relationship with china is too important to mess up the silence during the campaign is almost eerie said richard mcgregor a senior fellow at the lowy institute a think tank in sydney neither party sees any overwhelmingly partisan advantage in taking the issue on and both parties know that they could make life harder for themselves with china later because of things said in the heat of the battle a look at the structure of the australian economy shows why the most economically consequential exports are commodities including iron ore coal and natural gas which have helped provide raw materials for china s economic surge over the past three decades but these natural resource industries are only part of the picture there are about 165 000 chinese born students in australian universities a crucial revenue source the australians who don t have the political

cervasio said she visited china seven times last year and has taken lessons in the language there is more synergy among asian markets and australia she said especially around personal care products in effect the combination of population and geography made an australian shift into the chinese economic orbit inevitable once china began opening its economy in the 1980s what has changed in the past couple of years is that the risk of a bifurcating world trade system has created new urgency in trying to keep options on both sides there s no need for australian business or the australian

source xinhua 2019 05 13 02 03 11 editor yamei video player close beijing may 12 xinhua facing u s tariff hike threats china has adhered to its bottom line defended national dignity and people s interests experts with domestic think tanks said sunday at a symposium on china u s trade relations imposing new tariffs goes against the will of the people and the trend of the times china has the resolution courage and confidence to rise to all sorts of challenges they said the united states on friday increased additional tariffs on 200 billion u s dollars worth of chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent at the 11th round of economic and trade consultations that ended in washington the same day the chinese delegation made clear its consistent and resolute stance problems can not be solved by increasing tariffs and cooperation is the only right choice for the two sides but it has to be based on principles china will never make concessions on major issues of principle raising tariffs more detrimental to u s economy increasing tariffs will impact enterprises of both countries but harm american businesses more said gao lingyun a researcher with the institute of world economics and politics under the chinese academy of social sciences cass the additional tariffs can not change u s demand for chinese goods and will be eventually passed on to american consumers and retailers by u s importers gao said if the united states insists on going its way to raise tariffs on all chinese imports its domestic prices would be dramatically pushed up resulting in inflation gao said a wide range of u s industry associations have expressed strong opposition to imposing additional tariffs on chinese imports raising tariffs to 25 percent could cost nearly one million american jobs and increase volatility of financial market said the tariffs hurt the heartland campaign of the chinese goods already under higher tariffs more than 70 percent are intermediates and investment goods such a higher proportion means that the tariffs will be eventually be passed on to american businesses consumers and farmers said chen wenling chief economist with the china center for international economic exchanges chen said the trade war provoked by the united states is ineffective the united states wanted to fix the problem of trade deficit but its trade deficits to china european union and other economies rose rather than fell in addition the corresponding industry chain restructuring did not benefit the u s either auto makers tesla and ford are moving to the chinese market instead some u s enterprises may find it difficult to survive if quitting the chinese market as a very large share of their profits come from china said liang ming a researcher with a research institute of the ministry of commerce based on an estimate of the effect of having additional tariffs on 200 billion u s dollars worth of chinese goods liang said the united states still needs to import a majority of the goods from china but most of the chinese products involved are less dependent on the u s market and can be exported to other markets liang noted experts said that the spill over effect of trade wars can reach the whole world posing severe challenges to the global order rules trade systems supply chains and even bringing negative impact on the peaceful development of the world what china emphasizes such as avoiding raising tariffs and a balance in the appeals of both sides is not only the requests of china but also the rational choice for any country when facing unreasonable trade demand said dong yan a researcher with the cass s institute of world economics and politics analysts agreed at sunday s symposium that cooperation benefits china and the unites states while conflicts hurt both cooperation is always the right path to resolve the china u s trade dispute no yielding on principles fight and talk alternately experts said that the u s accusation of china s backtracking for the unsuccessful talks is untenable and irresponsible as the two are still in the process of negotiation as a matter of fact the u s side is to blame for the negotiating setback as it has been exerting pressure on china and upping the ante the u s requests involve china s core interests and major concerns they touch the bottom line and china will not compromise said wei jianguo executive deputy director of the china center for international economic exchanges he noted that a successful agreement must ensure both sides are satisfied for the most part and have both sides to make compromises if an agreement satisfies only one side with the concerns of the other side not respected or not taken care of it can hardly sustain during the implementation and may even be revoked he said after more than a year both sides have conducted 11 rounds of economic and trade consultations which experts said fully displays that the consultation is a continuing battle taking it easy is necessary while preparations must be fully made psychologically and at working level it s normal for major countries to have frictions china must adapt to it said wang wen executive dean of the chongyang institute for financial studies renmin university of china chen wenling said chinese negotiators have stuck to their principles and stance during the consultation it will be normal for both sides to fight and talk alternately china must not be vague in resolutely safeguarding its core national interests and major concerns and upholding national dignity chen said experts noted that china s position on upholding the overall interests of the china u s relations and consolidating bilateral economic and trade cooperation remains unchanged the two countries should meet each other halfway in line with the principles of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit and resolve their core differences through dialog rather than confrontation dong yan said that the sino u s economic and trade friction is a long term problem complicated and arduous before everything china and the united states should continue to build mutual trust step up coordination in bilateral and multilateral areas and expand common interests we believe that in the face of huge cooperative interests the u s side is also very clear that a trade war will not solve the economic and trade differences between the two countries said liang ming although the tariff escalation is regrettable liang said he believed both sides had hope for the future of their economic and trade relations a win win cooperation between china and the united states is in line with the aspirations of the two peoples and the world at large liang said facing challenge with confidence above 8 000 meters it is the stratosphere where the air gets thin for mountain climbers this requires extra efforts to overcome which is similar to the phase that china s economy has to overcome in order to achieve high quality development wang wen citing mountain climbing as a metaphor said the current stage requires china to stay patient and make hard work persistently according to a set route with both solid strength and huge potential as well as a strong capability to cope with risks and strikes china has the confidence resolution and ability to face all kinds of risks and challenges said zheng shuiquan deputy secretary of the party committee of renmin university of china no matter how the situation goes in the future we need to manage our own affairs well said zhang yansheng chief research fellow with the china center for international economic exchanges since last year a series of measures have been taken by the central government to consolidate the growth momentum of the chinese economy wang jinbin deputy dean of school of economics renmin university of china said that stabilizing expectation and confidence is very essential starting this year transition towards new growth engines from the traditional ones has accelerated with new industries and businesses constantly emerging said yan jinming executive director of the national academy of development and strategy of the renmin university of china he said that the chinese economy has strong resilience and flexibility a huge market and promising prospect the key is to manage our own affairs now so as to constantly increase the potential for economic development said yan a win win cooperation is an unstoppable trend of development trade development needs to be aligned with major national strategies by deepening belt and road economic cooperation china will see its high quality development path getting broader and broader said chen
by gertrude chavez dreyfuss new york reuters foreign investors have had to pay up to hedge u s dollar denominated assets over the last year but this has yet to stop them from plowing money into the u s corporate bond market the world s largest robust returns for u s corporate debt assets and expectations of solid u s economic growth for the remainder of the year have outweighed concerns about costly dollar hedges for many foreign buyers a surprise shift in the federal reserve s monetary policy stance earlier this year from a tightening bias to a neutral one helped unleash foreign demand for u s corporate bonds which have recovered strongly from last year s losses the u s investment grade sector showed total returns of 5 6 so far this year after a 2 2 loss in 2018 while the u s high yield market had an 8 3 return after last year s loss of 2 3 according to the bank of america corporate bond indexes graphic u s investment grade and high yield indexes the much more benign outlook for interest rates has contributed to very sizable returns on fixed income including corporate bonds in the first part of the year said hans mikkelsen head of high grade credit strategy at bank of america merrill lynch nyse in new york the insatiable appetite for u s corporate bonds from foreign investors shows no signs of abating u s capital flows data from the u s department of treasury which has a two month lag showed net foreign purchases of u s corporate bonds to the tune of 11 3 billion in the first two months of the year after selling about 15 billion in november and december of 2018 another gauge from epfr global showed u s investment grade funds had more inflows than outflows from foreign investors in the january to april period in contrast there were more foreign outflows than inflows from june to december last year graphic foreign inflows into u s corporate bonds png u s treasury yields have come down since the fed flagged a change in monetary policy reducing the extra premium investors are willing to pay to hold these bonds instead of safer u s treasuries u s corporate bonds are worth less when interest rates rise when new issues come to market with higher coupon rates than older securities those older ones become less attractive foreigner investors undeterred despite the change in fed outlook dollar hedges have remained high although they re off last year s peaks stemming from higher dollar borrowing costs in the money markets that however has not deterred foreign investors from buying u s corporate paper the u s has been the shining star in the global economy and this is where you re seeing very strong growth and very strong fiscal support over the last year said robert brauns portfolio manager for multi strategy fixed income at bnp paribas pa asset management in new york i think that has enticed investors to put some more money to work in the u s he added at the same time foreign investors rather than face expensive hedging costs have opted not to hedge their currency risks at all and this has worked to their advantage because the dollar has strengthened the investor does not only get the yield from the fixed income paper but the currency gain as well european investors buying fixed income debt are still faced with fairly high dollar hedging costs at around 3 1 using euro three month forwards slightly lower from the roughly 3 4 in late november 2018 reuters calculations showed analysts said the net return for a european investor buying u s high yield debt still comes to 3 1 less the currency hedging cost in comparison european high yield has a return of around 3 5 if you have the view that the u s economy is strong and you believe the u s dollar is going to do well you re not going to hedge the currency risk bnp s brauns said japanese buyers of u s debt on the other hand have seen lower hedging costs this year currently at 2 85 from a peak of 3 25 in november 2018 using 12 month forwards the bnp official pointed out graphic lucrative no more bank of america s mikkelsen believes hedging costs are on the way down because of the fed s neutral monetary policy stance six months ago when you bought u s corporate bonds you would be expected to roll into much more expensive currency hedges in 2019 our market did not look good said mikkelsen and now foreign investors could rationally expect cheaper foreign hedges because the market is pricing a rate ease that s a shift of a hundred basis points between expecting the fed to hike three times and now an ease he added japanese investors have thus begun buying foreign corporate bonds again this year most of it in u s fixed income debt including treasuries japanese insurers in particular are looking for higher returns abroad by diversifying into riskier corporate bonds in the financial year that began last month everyone is cognizant of hedging costs but investors have almost no choice said wen lu interest rates and volatility strategist at td securities in new york the demand for yield across all asset classes is something of a necessity for a lot of investors

kevin freking associated press washington president donald trump s combative approach to trade has been one of the main constants among his often shifting political views and he s showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies the president went after china on day 1 of his presidential bid promising to bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places trump s views on trade helped forge his path to victory in states such as pennsylvania michigan wisconsin and ohio where he linked the loss of manufacturing jobs to the north america free trade agreement and other trade deals he warned the worst was yet to come with president barack obama s proposed trans pacific partnership his trashing of existing and proposed trade agreements grabbed the headlines but he also made clear his view that globalization had been bad for america and that he would use tariffs to protect national security and domestic producers he cited the nation s founding fathers abraham lincoln and ronald reagan as leaders whose footsteps he was following when it came to trade and tariffs our original constitution did not even have an income tax trump told voters in monessen pennsylvania some four months before the 2016 presidential election instead it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production no 7 on his list of trade promises in that speech taking on china for its theft of american trade secrets this is so easy i love saying this i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with existing trade laws trump said those laws include section 232 of the trade expansion act which trump cited to enact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from china canada mexico and elsewhere they also include section 301 of the trade act which trump used last year to apply 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion of goods that 10 percent was increased to 25 percent on friday trump is laying the groundwork to extend the 25 percent tariff to all of china s exports to the u s such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple trump tweeted on saturday of

indiana who has seen prices for both commodities drop in the past year we are operating at a loss now trump s philosophy on some issues has evolved over the years he once described himself regarding the abortion issue as very pro choice now his administration promotes him as the most pro life president in american history on trade not so much in trump the art of the deal trump complained of the japanese that what s unfortunate is that for decades now they have become wealthier in large measure by screwing the united states with a self serving trade policy that our political leaders have never been able to fully understand or counteract fast forward nearly three decades and trump declared in his 2015 announcement for the presidency that other nations were prospering at america s expense when was the last time anybody saw us beating let s say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time trump said trump s approach on trade is a dramatic departure for the

by ccn com u s president donald trump announced a trade war with china friday hiking tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese exports from 10 to 25 on the same day the bitcoin price extended its uptrend after jumping above 6 000 the two events did not share anything except a date but according to ed van der walt they probably had an interesting connection the bloomberg reporter theorized that investors were using bitcoin as trade war play stating that president trump s decision to increase tariffs on chinese imported goods could create geographic price arbitrage walt envisioned whether or not smugglers the ones who would attempt to export chinese products into the us illegally were the ones who were purchasing bitcoin tariffs create geographic price arbitrages which encourages smuggling which drives money off grid which fuels bitcoin said walt as he connected the dots beyond the smuggling theory walter s question cum analysis followed decade long criticism of bitcoin as a tool to drive underground economies jp morgan ceo jamie dimon once said the cryptocurrency was a fraud and was only attractive to criminals in a similar tone russia president vladimir putin said bitcoin creates opportunities to launder funds evade taxes and finance terrorism jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon says bitcoin is a fraud that will eventually blow up cnbc cnbc september 12 2017 but to think it was the smugglers who were pumping bitcoin since its bottom formation in december 2018 sounded far fetched especially when there were other important fundamental factors at play such as the one propelled by fidelity investments the boston based asset management firm recently announced that it would offer bitcoin trading services to its institutional clients the cryptocurrency s rate jumped above 6 000 a pscychological level right after the announcement the macroeconomic funda at the same time one cannot deny that investors were getting prepared to face the macroeconomic shortcomings or even disasters caused by the us china trade war the international monetary fund imf warned last year that a clash between the two super economies could leave the world more impoverished and dangerous and president trump s latest decision embarks global finance to face its demon julian evans pritchard a senior economist at london based capital economics said china could retaliate by doubling tariffs on us goods they have a 25 tariff on agricultural commodity imports from the us they could double that potentially he told cnbc i think it s a balancing act for them they want to retaliate for political reasons but actually in economic terms probably their best option would be to do nothing an economic fallout between the two countries will have a direct impact on us consumers believes jacob parker the vice president of us china business council said the us industry and farmers in particular will face the maximum heat it will decrease the competitiveness of american companies reduce the efficiency of their global supply chains and reverberate through the us economy pure and simple this is a tax on the american consumer parker told cnbc bitcoin price will rise weak fundamentals in both the us and china could prompt regional investors to offload their portfolio risks to bitcoin in the us only which amounts to the maximum number of bitcoin traders the cryptocurrency demand could surge as the federal reserve prepares the soft landing pad for the economy it would mean reducing interest rates and making borrowing cheaper a move many analysts believe will further prompt investors to hedge in bitcoin usually when yield curves invert a recession follows see with timeframe max so a recession is likely very near and yes i think fed ecb boj will go for eternal qe negative interest rates which is a mayor bitcoin buying argument imo btc qe hedge planb 100trillionusd may 1 2019 what walt suggested was bitcoin s potential or ongoing demand among smugglers but as discussed above the cryptocurrency could be more than just an underground monetary system the bitcoin price is trading above 7 100 at the time of this writing after hitting an 8 month high near 7 500
and in an important pointer to what may happen at next year s presidential election jobs are growing at a faster rate in the rural and exurban swaths of america that backed us president donald trump in 2016 while it may turn out to be yet another complacent miscalculation few believe inflation is a serious risk according to a brookings institution study released last week they re growing at nearly twice the pace they were during the last two years of the obama administration and faster than in counties that voted democrat not since woodstock the beatles abbey road album and the first moon landings has an american labour market looked so healthy and many forecasters believe the jobless rate will continue to fall in coming months low inflation risk advertisement yet unlike 50 years ago it s all happening without any apparent impact on inflation long regarded as the flip side of an overheated jobs market let unemployment get too low and a shortage of workers leads to unsustainable wage demands and runaway inflation the last stage is high interest rates and recession we don t really understand how far you can push a labour market justin wolfers university of michigan economist this time around those dynamics aren t yet at play if at all inflation in the us in december 1969 the last time america had a jobless rate of 3 6 per cent was 5 5 per cent on friday the us labor department reported a 2 per cent rise in the consumer price index in the 12 months through april while it may turn out to be yet another complacent miscalculation few believe inflation is a serious risk the us federal reserve s official prediction is that inflation will remain just below or above 2 per cent which is why it won t be hiking interest rates until next year meanwhile bloomberg businessweek s april cover asked in bold typeface hovering above an image of a deflated dinosaur balloon is inflation dead justin wolfers says that inflation is simply irrelevant to most political business and union leaders in australia now t j kirkpatrick advertisement all of these factors suggest that now is the time for economists to show a big dose of humility says justin wolfers professor at the university of michigan and one of the most prominent australian economists working in america today we don t really understand how far you can push a labour market he tells the australian financial review for the best part of a generation us labour economists believed the so called natural jobless rate sometimes termed the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or nairu was around 5 5 per cent and while it may have snuck as high as 6 5 per cent in the boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis it has been on a downward slide ever since wolfers says that one of the biggest changes over the past five decades has been the evolution of macroeconomic policy thinking about the role of inflation expectations after the hyper inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s until then fed chairman paul volcker used sky high interest rates to slow price growth central bankers have obsessed with anchoring the expectations of workers and businesses around low inflation targets the us aims for 2 per cent the reserve bank of australia shoots for 2 3 per cent on average but as wolfers points out inflation expectations really haven t moved in 20 years now advertisement people of our generation running unions or setting prices have not confronted inflation in our economic lives justin wolfers it s more of a sociological story there are generations of australians who have grown up with inflation never being an interesting macroeconomic facet of economic life he says paul volcker squeezed inflation out of the us with crushingly high interest rates reuters if you ve ever thought about it you didn t have expectations about it rising or falling it s not just that they re anchored they re irrelevant in fact wolfers says anything other than stable inflation is virtually unknown to those becoming political and business leaders today the volcker disinflation was 10 years before the keating recession we had to have advertisement people of our generation running unions or setting prices have not confronted inflation in our economic lives says wolfers aged 46 our parents had to really think hard about the first year of their mortgage because after that they knew wages were going up people stopped caring about inflation because it doesn t exist so maybe an economy can run further than we thought wages slow to pick up today s us labour market bears that out unemployment is at 3 6 per cent a good 2 percentage points below where people once thought it would trigger wage growth that would require some kind of intervention either through monetary fiscal or regulatory policy advertisement yet despite the low jobless rate private sector worker pay increases have been surprisingly slow to accelerate as the normal for unemployment has been falling there has also been a steady slide in the natural rate of interest us wages growth edged above 3 per cent last year for the first time in almost 10 years in april it reached 3 2 per cent compared to the past the economy seems to be able to operate with a considerably lower unemployment rate without inflation being triggered says paul sheard senior fellow at harvard kennedy school had the 2008 financial crisis not happened that trend may have become evident sooner it took quite a while to come to light because actual unemployment rates shot up in the recession and came down only slowly sheard says advertisement five years ago the fed s open market committee which sets the fed interest rate thought the natural rate of unemployment was 5 4 per cent now its natural rate is 4 4 per cent sheard says that it is actually currently 3 4 per cent a full percentage point lower than the fed s official estimate as the normal for unemployment has been falling there has also been a steady slide in the natural rate of interest former s p global chief economist paul sheard economists are still slugging it out as to why this has happened former treasury secretary larry summers blames it on secular stagnation an idea resurrected from the 1930s that blames an abundance of savings relative to investment others point to america s digital sharing or gig economy or the tendency towards consumption in the us that is increasingly information intensive and capital light according to sheard something pretty fundamental seems to be going on in the very makeup and behaviour of the economy he says advertisement new industrial revolution sheard agrees with wolfers that a quarter century of inflation targeting has anchored expectations but i strongly suspect the information revolution and the emerging fourth industrial revolution is playing a role too he says in the old days when the labour market tightened workers gained bargaining power and firms eager to secure increasingly scarce labour started to bid up wages now when the labour market gets tight workers have less bargaining power because they are competing not just with other workers but with labour displacing technologies like machine learning and ai and firms to maintain their competitive positions are more likely to look kindly on investing in labour saving technologies advertisement larry summers thinks the answer could be secular stagnation bloomberg australia is no exception when it comes to being subject to these forces and opportunities concludes sheard back in the us many employers are complaining about how hard it is to find workers with the right skills minimum wages are rising in many states partly thanks to last year s company tax cuts but also because legislators have forced them up even so you have to squint to say wages growth has picked up says wolfers in the real world nothing stays static for very long but for now the theory still holds there may be more slack in the us labour market than many thought possible for australia where the unemployment rate has been stuck around 5 per cent for months the wait for higher wages could be even longer regardless of who wins the election
china held back from immediate retaliation for higher u s tariffs unlike in past rounds taking time to weigh its options amid uncertainty over how the chinese economy would weather a full bore trade conflict a failure to break an impasse in talks in washington on friday opened a new phase in the trade fight after more than five months of back and forth negotiations this time some economists and analysts said beijing is taking stock of potential economic damage from higher tariffs the u s raised punitive tariffs to 25 from 10 for 200 billion in goods leaving china on friday and thereafter president trump also ordered staff to begin the paperwork to impose levies on the more than 300 billion worth of everything else china sells to the u s while beijing has met previous volleys of tariffs from the u s by raising duties on american goods and the government has promised to retaliate it held its fire though china has more limited tariff options since it imports fewer products from the u s than the other way around the chinese leadership is also constrained by an economy that is in a shaky recovery from a sharp slowdown the tariff escalation is worrisome for chinese officials who are watching potential ripple effects from weakening of the currency to crimping future foreign investment raising existing tariffs or imposing new ones could hit products china s economy needs like semiconductors pork oil and passenger jets a wider scale trade conflict could also force beijing to further ease credit and boost government spending to shore up growth doubling down on the stimulus used last year at a time some analysts say it should be ratcheting back such measures china doesn t want to fan the flames mark wu an international trade professor at harvard university says it wants to be seen as the reasonable party and open to compromise china s lead negotiator vice premier liu he told chinese reporters before leaving washington that the domestic economy is in better shape than last year with sufficient policy tools and business confidence to withstand pressure and maintain smooth healthy development in the aftermath of friday s impasse mr liu stressed that negotiations haven t broken down a message amplified by state media rather according to video clips posted online by state media mr liu said negotiations encountered unavoidable complications and the two sides have agreed to meet in beijing in the future negotiations between the u s and china seemed to be heading toward an agreement earlier this month when according to mr trump and u s officials beijing backtracked on commitments made in earlier rounds those included listing specific laws in the agreement that china would change covering intellectual property protection subsidies and forced technology transfers according to people in the u s and china following the talks mr liu in remarks reported by the hong kong news site phoenix new media limited didn t specify what caused the negotiations to founder he disagreed that the chinese side backtracked saying in any negotiation changes are natural before a final agreement is reached how beijing moves ahead in coming weeks is likely to depend on its reading of the economy and on the u s s willingness to negotiate the economists and analysts said the most important thing is to not appear weak and cave into the u s says arthur krober founding partner at research firm gavekal dragonomics a likely scenario for beijing he says is to look like you re staying the course offer some discreet support if necessary hope they can get this thing resolved in next month the higher u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods will slow china s economy by 0 2 to 0 3 percentage points this year according to barclays research fresh 25 levies on the remaining 325 billion in chinese goods could further drag down growth by up to 0 5 percentage points in the next 12 months after tariffs go into effect it said the moment trump announces a date for tariffs on all chinese goods that s the moment the yuan will drop says bo zhuang an economist at research firm ts lombard he estimates authorities would allow the currency to swing to as weak as 7 6 yuan to the u s dollar a level that would roughly offset the impact of 25 tariffs on all chinese imports in the next few weeks china watchers think the leadership will hold back from drastic moves such as reducing banks required reserves to give them more money to lend though the two sides haven t set a date to resume talks president xi jinping and mr trump are both scheduled to attend a group of 20 meeting in japan at the end of june giving negotiators a target to work toward for now beijing has only hinted at more stimulus the central bank on monday announced a small cut to the amount of reserves certain banks have to keep with it a show of policy support just after the u s threatened tariffs on friday central bank deputy director zou wei said in a media briefing that financial support for the property sector would be stable this year previously beijing had been expected to ease up on stimulus after the economy grew at a stronger than expected 6 4 in the first quarter now beijing cannot afford to roll back stimulus said lombard s mr zhuang they ll have to continue to boost to make less concessions in the trade deal source dow jones

tune of 11 3 billion in the first two months of the year after selling about 15 billion in november and december of 2018 another gauge from epfr global showed u s investment grade funds had more inflows than outflows from foreign investors in the january to april period in contrast there were more foreign outflows than inflows from june to december last year graphic foreign inflows into u s corporate bonds png u s treasury yields have come down since the fed flagged a change in monetary policy reducing the extra premium investors are willing to pay to hold these bonds instead of safer u s treasuries u s corporate bonds are worth less when interest rates rise when new issues come to market with higher coupon rates than older securities those older ones become less attractive foreigner investors undeterred despite the change in fed outlook dollar hedges have remained high although they re off last year s peaks stemming from higher dollar borrowing costs in the money markets that however has not deterred foreign investors from buying u s corporate paper the u s has been the shining star in the global economy and this is where you re seeing very strong growth and very strong fiscal support over the last year said robert brauns portfolio manager for multi strategy fixed income at bnp paribas asset management in new york i think that has enticed investors to put some more money to work in the u s he added at the same time foreign investors rather than face expensive hedging costs have opted not to hedge their currency risks at all and this has worked to their advantage because the dollar has strengthened the investor does not only get the yield from the fixed income paper but the currency gain as well european investors buying fixed income debt are still faced with fairly high dollar hedging costs at around 3 1 using euro three month forwards slightly lower from the roughly 3 4 in late november 2018 reuters calculations showed analysts said the net return for a european investor buying u s high yield debt still comes to 3 1 less the currency hedging cost in comparison european high yield has a return of around 3 5 if you have the view that the u s economy is strong and you believe the u s dollar is going to do well you re not going to hedge the currency risk bnp s brauns said japanese buyers of u s debt on the other hand have seen lower hedging costs this year currently at 2 85 from a peak of 3 25 in november 2018 using 12 month forwards the bnp official pointed out graphic lucrative no more bank of america s mikkelsen believes hedging costs are on the way down because of the fed s neutral monetary policy stance six months ago when you bought u s corporate bonds you would be expected to roll into much more expensive currency hedges in 2019 our market did not look good said mikkelsen and now foreign investors could rationally expect cheaper foreign hedges because the market is pricing a rate ease that s a shift of a hundred basis points between expecting the fed to hike three times and now an ease he added japanese investors have thus begun buying foreign corporate bonds again this year most of it in u s fixed income debt including treasuries japanese insurers in particular are looking for higher returns abroad by diversifying into riskier corporate bonds in the financial year that began last month everyone is cognizant of hedging costs but investors have almost no choice said wen lu interest rates and volatility strategist at td securities in new york the demand for yield across all asset classes is something of a

american college graduates are suffering financially under the weight of 1 5 trillion of student loan debt the bulk of that debt stems from worrisome federal student loan practices and ballooning state tuition costs approximately 75 percent of college students attend a state university or college with tuition rates set by legislatures or state institutions over 85 percent of student loans are generated under the federal student loan program in the past three decades tuition at state colleges has increased by 313 percent oddly some seem to blame capitalism for the student loan predicament ray dalio billionaire investor cited massive student debt loads in a recent article that made the case for reforming capitalism presidential candidate john hickenlooper penned an op ed for the wall street journal boldly proclaiming he is running for president to save capitalism the very first point in his argument is that public high school education doesn t provide adequate training for the modern economy anecdotally we have heard the federal student loan predicament conflated with capitalism the hardship is real the pain of student debt is real sadly there are many adults burdened by thousands of dollars in loan debt khalilah beecham watkins a first generation college student and young mom is one of many who feels as if they re a prisoner to student loan debt khalilah has been working to pay down her 80 000 debt while helping her husband tackle his own loan obligations in an interview last year she said i feel like i m drowning as is well reported many young adults feel like khalilah in the united states the average student loan debt is more than 37 000 as unsettling as that figure is some graduates face even higher debt loads about five percent of degree earners have student loan debt totaling 100 000 or more stories like khalilah s need to be told so that students don t flippantly take on crushing debt without recognizing the gravity of such a decision this significant debt load is exacerbated by the fact that many graduates are finding it difficult to find well paying jobs which has spiraled into incredibly high rates of loan delinquency more than one out of every 10 loan recipients is unable to keep up with payments the brookings institute estimates that nearly 40 percent of borrowers will default by 2023 these are sobering statistics and it s important that borrowers be fully aware of the risks and benefits associated with debt of all kinds including student loans the benefits of investing in a college degree despite the burden that comes with debt there are undeniable long term benefits to earning a degree in our skills based economy it is no surprise that a person with a bachelor s degree will earn significantly more than a person with only a high school diploma it has been estimated that a bachelor s degree increases a person s average lifetime earnings by 2 8 million while the buck ultimately stops with each of us and our own decisions the student loan quagmire is chiefly the product of federal policy and the more degrees someone holds the more their earning potential increases studies indicate that earning a graduate degree could triple a person s expected income but in the near term the financial stress of loan delinquency deferred consumption and lower net worth is real while the buck ultimately stops with each of us when it comes to our own financial decisions the student loan quagmire is chiefly the product of federal policy federal laws prohibiting sound commercial lending practices and states setting tuition rates high enough to guarantee they re able to absorb all the federal money they can are complicit in this widespread problem bad diagnoses lead to bad prescriptions rather than addressing the underlying problems of federal financial aid and rising public college tuition politicians like senators elizabeth warren or bernie sanders are offering politically expedient ideas sen warren proposes debt cancellation of up to 50 000 to more than 42 million people sen warren s plan would eliminate debt for 75 of borrowers with student loans and federal funding to ensure students attend state college for free but nothing in life is free warren s sleight of hand doesn t make existing debt or future tuition magically disappear rather those costs are passed on to taxpayers and since college graduates earn roughly twice as much as high school graduates and can expect to be in higher tax brackets guess who would be paying the taxes for sen warren s plan why federal loans are not like commercial loans to understand the federal student loan mess it is necessary to understand some details about the loans that are at the center of the issue the federal government provides a few types of loans but the largest share of student debt comes from subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans in other contexts this would be called predatory lending in the case of a subsidized loan the department of education pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for six months thereafter a student can qualify for this type of loan whether or not they are creditworthy or have the ability to repay the loan in typical commercial lending a bank would not offer a loan to an individual who didn t hold a reasonable promise of being able and willing to repay it this harkens back to 2008 when the us housing market collapsed because of irresponsible lending practices and the belief that everyone no matter their financial situation should own a home it should be no surprise then that some economists predict a similar implosion of the student loan market in other contexts this would be called predatory lending the state s role in tuition inflation the second contributor to these financial aid troubles is ballooning state college tuition rates state legislatures and state institutions set public college rates so these state officials should be held accountable to provide lower cost alternatives one lower cost alternative to traditional on campus programs would be to offer a basic skills based college curriculum online at cost i e based on the marginal cost of providing downloadable lecture videos and similar programming while the total cost to a student of an online degree currently tends to be less than a traditional degree the tuition is often the same by offering video of select classes schools could unlock the value of their existing educational resources and expand access to more students however state schools are largely immune from market discipline which encourages cost cutting and leveraging economies of scale instead of reducing operating costs and tuition prices state schools soak up the flow of federal loan dollars instead of a loan isas allow investors to take equity in a student s future earnings for a period of time on the finance side state universities could offer their own alternative to federal student loans take for instance the market oriented model of purdue university and offer income sharing agreements isas income sharing agreements allow consumers to pay off a debt by sharing a portion of the student s income with the lender for a set number of years instead of a loan isas allow investors to take equity in a student s future earnings for a period of time the problem with the financial aid predicament is that market discipline has been eliminated from state college education and federal financial aid public colleges aren t going to be privatized and run like for profit businesses any time soon however by applying market based innovations and lessons from the private sector to state colleges it may be possible to expand access to state college offer alternative financing arrangements like income sharing agreements and reduce the cost of college through technology and economies of scale
washington president donald trump s combative approach to trade has been one of the constants among his often shifting political views and he s showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies the president went after china on day 1 of his presidential bid promising to bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places trump s views on trade helped forge his path to victory in states such as pennsylvania michigan wisconsin and ohio where he linked the loss of manufacturing jobs to the north america free trade agreement and other trade deals he warned the worst was yet to come with president barack obama s proposed trans pacific partnership his trashing of existing and proposed trade agreements grabbed the headlines but he also made clear his view that globalization had been bad for america and that he would use tariffs to protect national security and domestic producers he cited the nation s founding fathers abraham lincoln and ronald reagan as leaders whose footsteps he was following when it came to trade and tariffs our original constitution did not even have an income tax trump told voters in monessen pa four months before the 2016 presidential election instead it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production taking on china no 7 on his list of trade promises in that speech taking on china for its theft of american trade secrets this is so easy i love saying this i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with existing trade laws trump said those laws include section 232 of the trade expansion act which trump cited to enact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from china canada mexico and elsewhere they also include section 301 of the trade act which trump used last year to apply 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion of goods that 10 percent was increased to 25 percent on friday trump is laying the groundwork to extend the 25 percent tariff to all of china s exports to the u s such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple trump tweeted on saturday of course america s trading partners haven t let trump s tariffs stand without taking similar action themselves farmers boat makers and whiskey and wine producers are just some of the u s industries caught in the middle farming is a very small margin small profit business we rely on lots of volume and lots of sales to generate a profit said brent bible a soybean and corn farmer in lafayette ind who has seen prices for both commodities drop in the past year we are operating at a loss now trump s philosophy on some issues has evolved over the years he once described himself regarding the abortion issue as very pro choice now his administration promotes him as the most pro life president in american history complaint about japan on trade not so much in trump the art of the deal trump complained of the japanese that what s unfortunate is that for decades now they have become wealthier in large measure by screwing the united states with a self serving trade policy that our political leaders have never been able to fully understand or counteract fast forward nearly three decades and trump declared in his 2015 announcement for the presidency that other nations were prospering at america s expense when was the last time anybody saw us beating let s say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time trump said trump s approach on trade is a dramatic departure for the republican party but gop lawmakers have declined to take action that would block his tariffs they credit his tactics for getting improvements to a trade deal with canada and mexico to replace nafta and for getting china to the negotiating table president trump is the first president to take china head on said texas rep kevin brady the top republican on the house ways and means committee he said everyone knows i m not a fan of tariffs but i think everyone knows as well that china has been cheating for far too long trump has received some encouragement from democratic leaders senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y tweeted to trump don t back down strength is the only way to win with china current and former officials in the administration believe that voters will give the president credit for standing up to china and not blame him for any pain that may result from the tariffs war overall ap votecast found americans critical in their assessments of trump on trade but that s not the case with his supporters according to the survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide 45 approved of trump on trade while 53 disapproved among voters who approved of trump s job overall fully 88 approved of his handling of trade who pays while trump casts his tariffs as being paid for by china they actually are paid by the american companies that bring a product into the u s this can help some u s producers though because it makes their goods more competitive pricewise still the burden of trump s tariffs on imports from china and other countries falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses that buy imports said a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university republican leaning business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce have warned that the tariffs threaten to derail the economy raise unemployment but with economic growth at 3 2 percent last quarter and the unemployment rate at 3 6 percent trump isn t changing strategy now tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch trump tweeted on friday
the trade war between the u s and china continues to loom large over the world economy the two negotiating teams are on a break this week after talks ended friday in washington without a deal yet still alive president donald trump last week boosted duties on more chinese sales to the u s and is paving the way to extending them to all america s imports from its rival unless beijing makes concessions and strikes a pact within a month meantime china is planning how to retaliate and has told washington that it must remove all extra tariffs set targets for chinese purchases of goods in line with real demand and ensure that the text of the deal is balanced to ensure the dignity of both nations if the new tariffs stick u s consumers may absorb the costs said tom orlik chief economist at bloomberg economics and china s central bank among others will likely cut interest rates tariff impact on the chinese economy with the outlook for global growth now darkening again investors will look to a series of data from around the world on wednesday for insight into its recent health here s our weekly rundown of key economic events asia the trade war aside there s plenty of key indicators set for release around the region too this week on wednesday investment output retail sales and unemployment numbers from china will give the latest reading on whether the recent stabilization in its economy is holding industrial output and retail sales likely eased according to bloomberg economics india s inflation report due monday is set to show a modest acceleration in prices and after australia s central bank flagged jobs as the determining factor in its interest rate outlook thursday s employment report takes on extra significance indonesia s central bank also meets thursday to set monetary policy with economists at this stage expecting no change the u s and canada the main event outside the trade war are april retail sales data due wednesday that are expected to be more subdued than march economists surveyed by bloomberg news see sales rising 0 2 after 1 6 in march housing starts and several factory reports will give a further sense of second quarter economic momentum the data will likely reflect a tepid pace of activity in the current quarter as producers struggle to work off a multi quarter inventory overhang said carl riccadonna chief u s economist at bloomberg economics federal reserve officials richard clarida and eric rosengren both speak monday on the central bank s review of its strategy the bank of canada releases its review of the financial system on thursday and governor stephen poloz will speak about it europe middle east and africa gross domestic product for germany and bordering countries in eastern europe will be published on wednesday this flurry of data will fill in details that weren t available when the surprisingly strong euro zone growth number was revealed at the end of april it may shed light on whether europe s biggest economy is starting to trough after a sharp slowdown that challenged policy makers assumptions on the strength of overall expansion and forced them to reactivate the european central bank s stimulus stance in the u k the first jobs report since the bank of england threatened faster rate hikes will show how tight the labor market and wages are in an economy facing alleged capacity constraints and a state of constant suspense on how and when it may be severed from its major trading partner those data will be published on tuesday in turkey a series of data releases will provide an update on the economy after a decision to cancel and repeat march s election for mayor of istanbul battered the currency and forced the central bank into a back door interest rate increase industrial production data on tuesday could give an indication of how long the nation s recession may last latin america faced with a sputtering economy and uncertainty about the approval of a government reform plan brazil s central bank will on tuesday explain its decision to keep borrowing costs at an all time low of 6 5 as it releases the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting mexico s central bank is also expected to remain on the sidelines on thursday leaving its benchmark rate on hold at a decade high of 8 25 high inflation in april supports the decision to keep monetary conditions tight countering calls for lower interest rates following weak economic growth said felipe hernandez of bloomberg economics in argentina data due on wednesday are likely to show inflation slowing to about 4 in april from the previous month following president mauricio macri s decision to freeze prices and postpone subsidy cuts
president nana akufo addo seems to have acquired a fan club across africa for his pronouncements he inherited an economy in the doldrums that appears to have taken a turn for the better following an imf programme as well as a rise in the price of commodities such as cocoa and oil he is accused by his critics at home of having a bloated government which he says he needs to get things done nana akufo addo it would appear was always destined to become the head of state of his country he comes from a prominent ghanaian royal and political family his father edward akufo addo being the president of ghana in the 1970s nevertheless it took him three attempts before he was able to win the presidential elections according to people close to him this has made him humble and more in tune with common sentiments and people s hopes and expectations new african sat down with him while he was on a visit to london you have been very vocal about the necessity for africa to take its destiny in its own hands and not depend on outsiders but your finance minister ken ofori atta made a point of thanking the imf when he spoke at the african banker awards as winner of the african finance minister award is there a contradiction of attitudes here i m not sure if you are suggesting there s a contradiction between the finance minister s position and mine but if so it s not intended the imf came to ghana as it has done elsewhere at a time when the ghanaian economy was going through very challenging times when many of our macroeconomic indices were going wrong they came in on a rescue mission it was an emergency stop gap three year stabilisation programme the programme is due to come to an end at the end of this year in fact it actually came to an end in april technically but has continued because of the way the budget process was intertwined with it i believe the finance minister thanked them because yes they came they provided nearly a billion dollars of relief for our economy and they tried as much as possible to hold the country to some important fundamentals the 9 3 deficit that we inherited was cut down to 5 9 in the first year of our government and we re looking to bring it down further to 4 5 this year we want to pass a law setting a 5 ceiling for the deficit so that every government is held to managing the finances in such a way that we don t get more than a 5 deficit in any one year at the end of the day what all of us are saying in ghana is that we don t want to go back into another imf plan we want to be able to manage our own economy in such a way that there will be no need to have recourse to the imf again that is the basic learning fiscal discipline making sure that your economy is in balance and in equilibrium and yes we don t need the imf to be able to do those things these are fiscally economically responsible initiatives that we can take on ourselves the big question concerns chinese debt the western press in particular says it is less transparent and that such debt is being offered to create an economic world order in the image of china would you say these are fair comments looking at the ghanaian situation we had no particular reason to fear the chinese entanglement yes it s true today that china is our biggest trade partner and the balance of accounts is more in their favour because they have more things to sell to us then we have to them but with the assistance that we are getting from china the 2bn swap agreement that i went to sign with the chinese leader for instance essentially involves a barter arrangement they are providing us with money to enable us to deal with some very fundamental issues of our infrastructure such as roads we are going to use the period of repayments to develop an integrated bauxite industry in ghana which would allow us to export back to china finished aluminium products as our payback for it to me this is a good arrangement it is about the exploitation of ghana s natural resources but the exploitation is not in the manner which we ve seen before we are insisting that the full value chain of our bauxite development takes place within ghana and they have accepted this way of us doing it for me this is a progressive step it is something that far from posing a threat is in fact an assistance to the evolution we are looking for which is as much as possible to add value to our raw materials and add value to it sur place in ghana in africa government still has an overbearing influence on business and on the economy would you say that now in ghana people can just go about their business because they know there is going to be a calm transition of power and it will be business as usual that is my hope the institutions that drive our economy are dependent on governments to the extent that government policy is important you are looking for responsible policies appropriate policies which will have that catalytic impact you want as much as possible to have decisions about investments employment expansion being taking by private sector operatives but within the context of policies defined at the centre i think that if we continue down that path i don t see so much as a decoupling between government and the economy but an enabling phenomenon on the part of government for the growth of the economy you ve been in government for two years of your four year term it is a short period of time to get things done as many of the projects are long term there are different arguments about the best democratic model for africa including limited terms what is your view winston churchill said that democracy was the least worst form of government and that happens also to be my view that it has many shortfalls but at the same time authoritarian rule in ghana has been tried and it failed that is why there has been this consensus in ghana that willy nilly the democratic path is the most effective one for us and by and large it has been proved true when we look at statistics comparing military rule in ghana and the era of democratic government there is no doubt that the indices are better in terms of life expectancy greater growth of the economy wider employment all of these have been more positive in the democratic era than they had been in the authoritarian period and this is why ghanaians are very clear in their minds that this is what they want i am hesitant to provide models or prescriptions for other countries of the continent because everybody has their own peculiar history and specificities that they have to deal with but for ghana there is no doubt in my mind that it has been beneficial let us look at the global economic environment we ve seen high volatility in emerging markets as well as a trade war between the us and china we don t yet know the ramifications in terms of collateral damage so how do you view the current global economic environment some of the certainties that were there a few years ago are now not there and the situation is therefore not clear for instance it is by no means clear what the outcome of the us china trade war is going to be especially regarding its impact on small countries but obviously it will have an impact and you can be sure that the impact will be negative when the elephants fight it s the grass that suffers so i have no doubt in my mind that we are in an era of very disturbing global developments but for me what it reinforces is that through it all we have to keep a focus in ghana to make sure that those fundamental things that we want to do developing a base for our industry enhancing our agricultural productivity putting in the policies that will allow the ghanaian people to have the education that is required for the 21st century remain our focus no matter what the difficulties we have to focus on these because they are the fundamental roots instruments that will enable us to pursue the rapid development of our country and of our economy so yes the global environment is shaky but the lesson that i draw from that is the need to be consistent and firm in the things that we are doing at home is there no real way of mitigating against these risks except for fiscal prudence as you say yes managing the economy intelligently and responsibly becomes your hedge if you like in terms of the youth bulge unless you are globally competitive then your large young population can become a burden what are your thoughts on this in general we have to intensify the skills acquisition the training not just the formal education but the technical and artistic training as well in addition to enhancing a full it spectrum capability i think that everything that we can do to give this young population the necessary skills the information and the training on how to operate competitively in this 21st century global economy becomes the most effective way to activate this so called demographic dividend in ghana 60 of the population is under the age of 25 but the race against time is to give this population the requisite skills to operate with in the 21st century do you think we need to be a bit more deliberate in terms of population control that debate is going on in ghana i wouldn t want to pronounce on it now because i want to see the balance of forces and you can understand yes there is clearly a need one has seen the connection between population control the policies on demographic expansion and economic growth over a period of time the latest example is china and it s a compelling argument that is made there but then there are also those who say that we in africa on this vast continent are not nearly enough i want to see how the debate that is going on evolves a little bit more how are your education reforms coming along you have got two curriculum streams running concurrently is it working first of all this is the first year of the policy it came about just as necessity is the mother of invention when the free senior high school policy kicked in last year the 2017 18 academic year 90 000 more people became available for secondary school education than the year before this year that number has doubled it s now 180 000 plus and unfortunately the expansion of the schools infrastructure has not kept pace with this expansion of secondary school students so what do you do you have a choice either to scale back on the commitment or to find an intelligent solution and the solution we found was this double track we ve seen it employed in other parts of the world for example in california in fact it has been helpful because what we noticed is that it s going to permit us to have smaller classes teachers that will have more time with pupils the contact hours will also expand and there will be even more holidays we are recruiting many more teachers and administratively so far it has gone very smoothly we ve had two streams the green stream are the ones that have gone to school now and the gold stream will be going to school in november so far it s gone very very smoothly there have been no problems about it it may even be a model that we extend to make education compulsory until at least the end of secondary school it is a system that allows you to handle large populations of school children right from primary to secondary you come from the home of panafricanism the base of the african independence movement how do you view pan africanism today we don t seem to see that strong united voices behind continental issues like we did 20 years ago or even 10 years ago with mbeki obasanjo and wade it is because this has also been a time of some important challenges in the african economy and people have tended to look inwards for solutions but i think that the reforms that have been led by the rwandan leader paul kagame are going to make the continental organisation more effective in the way in which it handles both internal programmes and external relations and at the same time too i see the regional economic communities ecowas the eac the southern african community growing in strength and coherence and therefore the integration there that we need to co operate and work together will take this new initiative the continental free trade area into a new space this is a strong indication that the pan african thinking has now returned when we went to kigali to sign the free trade agreement the talk was that 30 countries had expressed commitments to signing up but the atmosphere was such that 44 i think in the end signed up and i think that now virtually the entire continent has done so what remains to be done is ratification and right now seven countries have ratified the agreement ghana and kenya were the first to do so and we need 22 to establish the common market if we are able within the next year to get the 22 to ratify then the framework is then established for this common market i think objections to the pan african ideas are going to face immense hurdles i don t think you will be able to ask this question again in say a couple of years time i sense a positive consensus amongst the african leaders to drive the african agenda even when you go to the forum on china africa cooperation focac for example yes because at focac there was an awareness that we need to think together work together because this individualist approach to dealing with outside relations is not effective it s not efficient lastly what have been the highlights and the lowlights in the two years so far as far as highlights the key has been the unveiling of the free senior high school policy and the fact that we ve been able to do it and find the money within the government revenues to be able to sustain it the lowlight to some extent is the difficulty of getting this government machinery to respond in the way which you would like for the things that you want to do that s been for me the challenge but all of it is a learning process and we ll see how that plays out na
the technical teams of the government and the international monetary fund imf have reached an agreement on a bailout package for pakistan adviser to prime minister on finance revenue and economic affairs dr abdul hafeez shaikh announced on sunday after months of discussions and negotiations a staff level agreement has been reached between pakistan and the imf he said while speaking on state run ptv news dr shaikh revealed that pakistan would receive 6 billion worth of assistance under the imf programme over a period of three years in brief the pakistan imf accord pakistan to receive 6 billion over three years islamabad to also receive 2 3bn from world bank adb etc finance adviser hints at raising prices in some areas to recover costs decisive policies and reforms necessary for growth imf imf says market determined exchange rate to help the financial sector he said the staff level agreement which must still be approved by the imf board of directors in washington would show that effective reforms were underway in pakistan examine why pakistan will go to the imf again and again and again the pakistani authorities and the imf team have reached a staff level agreement on economic policies that could be supported by a 39 month extended fund arrangement eff for about us 6 billion an imf press release quoted imf mission chief for pakistan ernesto ramirez rigo as saying dr shaikh said imf is an international institution whose primary job is to assist member countries who are in an economic difficulty he said the government could not have bridged the financing gap of 12 billion on its own that he said was created by a weak economy besides the imf assistance pakistan will also receive additional funds worth nearly 2 3 billion from institutions like the world bank and asian development bank the adviser revealed asked to share the conditions that pakistan has agreed to as part of the agreement dr shaikh said there were many things desired by the fund that the government already saw as being in the country s interest they include aligning expenditure with resources improve the functioning of loss making state owned enterprises curtail the subsidies available to the wealthy classes and tax the rich segments these structural changes are in our interest if we want to take our people in the direction of prosperity and improve their quality of life the adviser said he said because the government wants to send a signal of financial discipline and resolve fiscal challenges the programme would entail raising prices in some areas in order to recover the costs however the government is focused on not putting too much burden on the common man dr shaikh said explaining his point he said that if power tariff is increased under the imf programme it will not affect consumers utilising less than 300 units and this includes 75pc of electricity consumers for the same reason the government is allocating an additional rs50 billion for an electricity subsidy in the upcoming budget under the programme the government is also allocating an additional rs80 billion for social safety programmes like ehsaas and the benazir income support programme in order to minimise the burden on the common man the adviser said asked whether this would be pakistan s last imf programme dr shaikh said it depends on how successfully we as a country implement this programme and approach it as a reform or structural change programme instead of a mere revenue earning programme decisive reforms necessary imf the facility aims to support pakistani authorities strategy for stronger and more inclusive growth by reducing domestic and external imbalances removing impediments to growth increasing transparency and strengthening social spending the imf statement said it said financing support from pakistan s international partners will be critical to support the authorities adjustment efforts and ensure that the medium term programme objectives can be achieved rigo in his statement added pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lacklustre growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position the authorities recognise the need to address these challenges as well as to tackle the large informality in the economy the low spending in human capital and poverty in this regard the government has already initiated a difficult but necessary adjustment to stabilise the economy including thorough support from the state bank of pakistan these efforts need to be strengthened decisive policies and reforms together with significant external financing are necessary to reduce vulnerabilities faster increase confidence and put the economy back on a sustainable growth path with stronger private sector activity and job creation the imf mission chief emphasised that in addition to the eff a comprehensive plan for cost recovery in the energy sectors and state owned enterprises will help eliminate or
