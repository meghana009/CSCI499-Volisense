it was the year central banks jumped back into the fray cutting interest to deal with a slowdown driven by a trade war and subsequent decline in manufacturing some like the federal reserve had at least made some headway on rate hikes before 2019 creating room to loosen amid the weakest growth since the financial crisis but others like the european central bank found themselves in a more difficult position and had to cut benchmarks further below zero stoking resentment about subzero rates 2020 looks like it might be a quieter year for monetary policy fiscal may take up some of the lifting work and growth prospects are looking a little brighter the economic numbers are mostly mixed rather than positive though on balance the monetary policy bias still leans to the dovish side while the big guns are set to hold fire others especially in the emerging markets are projected to cut again what bloomberg s economists say a moment of calm in the global economy is obscuring a serious challenge for the world s central banks low rates for most and negative for some means policy space is severely depleted we don t think the next downturn is coming in 2020 when it does come central banks won t have all the answers tom orlik here is bloomberg economics quarterly review of 23 of the top central banks which together set policy for almost 90 of the global economy u s federal reserve current federal funds rate upper bound 1 75 forecast for end of 2020 1 75 fed chairman jerome powell has left no doubt that interest rates are on prolonged hold saying dec 11 the current stance likely will remain appropriate unless the fed s favorable outlook for the economy sees a material reassessment he spoke after policy makers kept interest rates steady in a 1 5 to 1 75 target range following three consecutive cuts and published forecasts showing 13 of 17 officials projecting no change in rates through 2020 that would keep them on the sidelines during a presidential election year that said the u s central bank isn t entirely fading into the background strain in money markets has pushed it to buy treasury bills to restore ample reserves in the banking system some investors argue it will need to broaden the scope of those purchases to short dated coupon bearing securities powell said they were not ready to take such a step but would do so if necessary what bloomberg s economists say the fed is comfortably on hold for the foreseeable future as policy makers are less concerned by the risks which justified their insurance cuts in the latter half of 2019 trade tensions below target inflation and sluggish global growth the threshold is high for policy adjustments in the near term particularly for rate hikes and the impetus to stand pat will increase as the u s election draws nearer carl riccadonna european central bank current deposit rate 0 5 forecast for end of 2020 0 5 the ecb has pledged to step up stimulus again if needed yet officials have publicly signaled that they favor a pause after mario dragh pushed through a contentious package in september to aid the slowing euro zone economy policy makers are increasingly pointing to the detrimental side effects of the institution s negative deposit rate such as squeezed bank profitability and risks to financial stability and christine lagarde draghi s successor at the helm of the institution has promised to assess them as part of the first strategic review since 2003 economists and investors expect rates to stay on hold and qe to continue through the whole of 2020 and beyond but the central bank may yet be tested again if the economy falters under trade uncertainties or the bloc s manufacturing meltdown spreads to the services sector what bloomberg s economists say mario draghi used the end of his tenure to shape the governing council s response to the persistent slowdown in the euro area economy president christine lagarde s first press conference confirmed policy makers are unlikely to change course over the next year they will focus instead on their strategic review we expect the new round of bond buying to go on for two years maeva cousin david powell bank of japan current policy rate balance 0 1 forecast for end of 2020 0 1 the outlook for the bank of japan in 2020 is looking a little brighter after the launch of a government spending package to support growth and some signs of improvement in the global economy that s likely to keep the bank on hold for now with its key rate already in negative territory and assets on its balance sheet worth more than the nation s economy the hurdle to move again is high despite guidance the bank says is tilted toward easing still governor haruhiko kuroda will carefully monitor developments in the u s china trade talks and the economic hit from a sales tax increase in the autumn some economists are starting to doubt if the impact of the tax hike really will be smaller than on previous occasions as is hoped by policy makers but it may still take a damaging jump in the yen to move the needle at the boj what bloomberg s economists say the bank of japan heads into 2020 with significant less weight on its shoulders that s not to say the inflation and growth picture has improved but with a fiscal stimulus package in the pipeline and jgb yields comfortably within the target range there s much less urgency we expect the boj to keep its current policy framework unchanged through 2020 barring an unexpected shock yuki masujima bank of england current bank rate 0 75 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 the bank of england will finally get a new governor in 2020 bringing to an end an often chaotic search for a successor to mark carney boris johnson s decisive win in december s election both cleared the way for his government to take the nation out of the european union on jan 31 and also name the u k s top regulator andrew bailey as the canadian s successor bailey who starts on march 16 will have to cope with a global slowdown and a persistent dearth of investment most worryingly another brexit deadline is already looming with the u k needing to secure a trade deal with the eu by the end of next year unless johnson asks for an extension for now concern about the outlook means two of the boe s nine policy makers want to cut interest rates all eyes will be on whether johnson s win as well as brexit developments change the picture what bloomberg s economists say weak growth momentum and below target inflation means the bank of england is likely to maintain its dovish bias in early 2020 but if our forecast plays out and the combination of looser fiscal policy and reduced brexit uncertainty lift growth next year we expect the central bank s tone to change we have penciled in a rate increase in 4q2020 dan hanson bank of canada current overnight lending rate 1 75 forecast for end of 2020 1 75 governor stephen poloz ends 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1 75 and is expected to hold that title until his seven year term comes to an end in june the bank of canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend inflation has been near its 2 target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fueling a further increase in debt one main downside from the central bank s outlier status has been a stronger currency that is hurting exporters but pressure on the bank of canada to match rate cuts by the federal reserve and others is easing there are signs the world economic outlook is stabilizing and markets are paring back bets that global monetary loosening has much left to go that makes the bank of canada s diverging policy path less of a risky bet for poloz s eventual successor people s bank of china current 1 year best lending rate 4 35 current 7 day omo reverse repo rate 2 50 forecast for end of 2020 4 35 2 35 analysts predicting the start of large scale monetary easing by the people s bank of china in 2019 were persistently disappointed and governor yi gang has indicated he intends follow the modest targeted path for stimulus in 2020 that said if weakness in the world s second largest economy worsens then economists expect the central bank to continue to release cash into the system via cuts to the reserve ratio as has been a preferred method to shore up output this year the cautious approach to easing is determined by china s current battle with a form of stagflation consumer price gains driven beyond the pboc s target of 3 by food coupled with factory prices in decline economists currently forecast economic growth to slow below 6 percent next year a development that communist party leaders seem comfortable with a recent revision to 2018 gdp data means that the long standing goal to double the size of the economy this decade is more easily in reach that lifts some of the burden on the pboc to artificially boost the expansion what bloomberg s economists say the people s bank of china is pushing down lending rates steadily and incrementally the drop in the one year lpr in november underlines its effort to prop up growth and counter disinflationary pressures a similar fall in the five year lpr the benchmark for new mortgage loans was a surprise and suggests that a cooling housing sector is giving the authorities more room for monetary stimulus chang shu reserve bank of india current repo rate 5 15 forecast for end of 2020 4 7 india s central bank is likely to resume easing interest rates perhaps in the middle of 2020 and once headline inflation comes off the boil costly onions have pushed inflation closer to the upper end of the reserve bank of india s 2 6 target band limiting policy makers ability to support an economy expanding at its weakest pace in more than six years a much higher than expected spike in inflation was the reason for the rbi s surprise pause on rate cuts in december after delivering 135 basis points of easing in five back to back moves this year however governor shaktikanta das has made it clear that there s more space for monetary easing and a lot depends on how these actions are timed what bloomberg s economists say the reserve bank of india s shock hold on rates in december signaled that it s more concerned about a temporary surge in onion prices pushing headline inflation higher than slumping growth we expect the central bank to keep rates on hold again in february due to the further surge in onion prices since then rbi s accommodative stance signals that room for further easing is available abhishek gupta central bank of brazil current selic target rate 4 5 forecast for end of 2020 4 5 brazil s central bank is closing a monetary easing cycle that has taken its benchmark interest rate to an all time low of 4 5 while investors are still debating whether the rate may drop an additional 25 basis points they mostly agree it should stay near the current level by end 2020 the unprecedentedly long spell of low interest rates is supported by the fact that inflation expectations remain within the official target for the next couple of years at least latin america s largest economy is also gaining traction after nearly three years of disappointing performance but the recovery remains gradual what bloomberg s economists say bcb started a new round of rate cuts last july but appears to be close to a pause anchored inflation expectations and ample economic slack base our expectation that it will remain at this level through end 2020 absent surprises an additional smaller 25bps cut in the february meeting cannot be ruled out if inflation and growth surprise on the downside or if the currency strengthens until then adriana dupita bank of russia current key rate 6 25 forecast for end of 2020 6 after years of struggle to bring down high inflation bank of russia governor elvira nabiullina is now facing a serious undershoot of her 4 target five consecutive rate cuts have so far failed to stoke price growth or do much to boost the sputtering economy partly because of a delay to government spending in the second half of 2019 nabiullina said in december that the effect of easing will take time and the central bank needs to wait to evaluate the impact another rate cut is possible at the next meeting in february or later in the first half but not guaranteed she said russian local currency government bonds have attracted inflows of about 16 billion this year due in part to faster than expected easing investors are waiting to see if 2020 will bring more of the same what bloomberg s economists say sliding inflation will keep one more rate cut on the table in 2020 but policy makers are likely to pause to assess the impact of 150 basis points of reductions since june if price pressure remains muted as we expect the next move could come as soon as march signs of a firmer rebound in inflation as president vladimir putin s fiscal stimulus finally gets going might put policy on hold for longer scott johnson south african reserve bank current repo average rate 6 5 forecast for end of 2020 6 25 the south african reserve bank is facing pressure to ease after the economy unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter and power cuts raised the risk of a second recession in as many years inflation is at a nine year low and close to the bottom of the target range of 3 to 6 still the monetary policy committee has made it clear that some of the factors weighing on economic growth such as policy uncertainty and the deterioration of government finances will probably prevent it from cutting rates using monetary policy to compensate for government failures is not the way forward governor lesetja kganyago said at the final mpc meeting of 2019 the prospect of the country a losing its last investment grade credit rating at moody s investors service in 2020 may also prevent easing while the move is largely priced in it s likely to weaken the rand a downgrade could result in a selloff of between 5 billion and 8 billion of south african bonds deputy governor kuben naidoo said banco de mexico current overnight rate 7 25 forecast for end of 2020 6 5 mexico s central bank slashed the interest rate a full point in 2019 from a decade high after inflation reached its 3 target and economic growth flat lined with a muted economic rebound expected in 2020 policy makers are forecast to continue loosening while banco de mexico expects inflation to pick up slightly in the first quarter of next year it s projected to return to near their goal after that the majority of the board says monetary policy needs gradual adjustment voting for quarter point reductions policy makers appointed by president andres manuel lopez obrador have voted for steeper half point cuts recently pointing out that the central bank s stance remains restrictive even after the easing in 2019 mexico has the highest real interest rate or borrowing costs minus inflation among group of 20 nations what bloomberg s economists say banxico should continue slowly cutting interest rates in 2020 lower inflation subdued pressure on prices and abating inflation expectations support the outlook interest rates remain high and cuts imply less restrictive instead of expansionary monetary conditions felipe hernandez bank indonesia current 7 day reverse repo rate 5 forecast for end of 2020 4 75 indonesia s central bank has been on an aggressive run of easing lowering borrowing costs by 100 basis points since july in a bid to bolster faltering growth while southeast asia s biggest economy is holding up quite well compared to others growing at about 5 it has felt the effects of a global slowdown and the u s china trade war with export growth having contracted for 13 straight months with the economy expected to grow this year at its slowest pace since 2017 governor perry warjiyo has signaled more rate cuts are in the pipeline although dependent on incoming information on the health of the economy at the same time inflation is subdued by indonesia standards and is expected to moderate further prompting bank indonesia to set a new inflation target range of 2 4 for 2020 from 2 5 4 5 this year pointing to more room for further rate cuts what bloomberg s economists say more rate reductions appear to be in the pipeline for 2020 though we expect the pace to slow dramatically the federal reserve signaled an end to its easing cycle which gives bank indonesia less room to maneuver if it wishes to maintain a wide interest rate differential in support of the rupiah a truce in the u s china trade war and significant progress on structural reforms though could reduce the risk premium needed to attract capital inflows tamara henderson central bank of turkey current 1 week repo rate 12 forecast for end of 2020 11 be forecast turkey s central bank may be about to find out the limits of its easing cycle next year when president recep tayyip erdogan says interest rates should fall to single digits while the inflation rate is expected to go up emboldened by the currency s stability in recent months the bank s monetary policy committee reduced its key rate a total of 12 percentage points exceeding all forecasts made six months ago now the return on the lira adjusted for inflation is barely on par with emerging market peers average it may prove extremely difficult for governor murat uysal to abide by his pledge to maintain a reasonable rate of return without upsetting the president who is adamant that inflation will continue to slow if the bank keeps slashing borrowing costs something that goes against accepted central bank assumptions what bloomberg s economists say the political pressure will be immense with the number of monetary policy committee meetings rising to 12 next year but the bank may be unable to deliver the president s orders high inflation will probably prevent rates from falling by more than 100 basis points although balance of risks is skewed toward deeper cuts ziad daoud central bank of nigeria current central bank rate 13 5 forecast for end of 2020 13 5 the nigerian central bank will continue its tight policy stance in 2020 as inflation expectations are picking up food prices have been rising due to supply constraints caused by a closure of land borders to stop smuggling while the central bank sees these moves as temporary governor godwin emefiele has said he would only consider rate cuts when inflation slows to the upper end of the target band of 6 to 9 it s been outside that range for more than four years keeping the monetary policy rate at 13 5 will also help support the naira which is under pressure due to dwindling reserves while the central bank is keen to boost economic growth in the continent s biggest oil producer it s likely to rather keep using non traditional policy tools such as raising lenders loan to deposit ratios to force them to give out credit and support private sector output bank of korea current base rate 1 25 forecast for end of 2020 1 25 the bank of korea is expecting a gradual economic recovery in 2020 as the effects of two rate cuts in the last six months and an expansionary budget feed through the economy and global demand picks up if the expected recovery fails to materialize governor lee ju yeol will face pressure to ease policy further though the central bank doesn t have much room for maneuver with the benchmark rate at a record low and household debt at a record high lee has said it s premature to consider the alternative of taking unconventional measures such as quantitative easing a majority of economists surveyed by bloomberg see the bok either holding rates steady at 1 25 or cutting once to 1 next year a handful expect two cuts or a hike what bloomberg s economists say cautious optimism on growth and continued concerns about financial risk point to a prolonged pause from the bank of korea in the year ahead governor lee ju yeol has reiterated that the central bank still has some policy space but fiscal policy will likely take the lead with another expansionary budget due for 2020 justin jimenez reserve bank of australia current cash rate target 0 75 forecast for end of 2020 0 25 the rba is closing in on its effective lower bound estimated by governor philip lowe as a cash rate of 0 25 when further monetary stimulus will require a shift to unorthodox policy lowe has suggested that while he doesn t expect to have to go the unconventional route if he did a version of qe would be his approach a consensus is emerging among australian economists that in the absence of fiscal stimulus which the government is resisting the rba is likely to have to turn to qe at some point growth is weak business and consumer sentiment soft and unemployment is expected to edge higher lowe a self confessed glass half full optimist argues the economy is at a gentle turning point so most analysts expect more of the same a weak economy requiring ongoing rba stimulus that s against a central bank that maintains the worst is over and the economy is likely to gradually improve in 2020 what bloomberg s economists say it s hard to see the australian cash rate going anywhere but lower in 2020 but once at the elb qe wouldn t come automatically the hurdle would be high whilst there s a strong turnaround in house prices in australia s two largest cities sydney and melbourne forward looking indicators on the labour market point to 2020 being a year where the rba takes the cash rate to the elb and guides that rates will be held there for a very long time james mcintyre central bank of argentina current rate floor 58 forecast for end of 2020 n a argentina s recently appointed central bank chief miguel pesce is facing a daunting task with an economy in crisis and an inflation rate of more than 50 he aims to slash price growth to single digit rates by the end of 2021 and says both monetary policy and a social accord proposed by president alberto fernandez s administration will be part of this fernandez only took office this month and during the campaign trail advisers said the central bank would seek to keep the argentine peso at relatively weak levels in a bid to boost exports and turn the economy around the strategy would require interventions in the foreign exchange market to control inflation the bank might seek to rein in monetary aggregates while the government tries to strike deals with the productive sector to keep prices stable what bloomberg s economists say the new government has a clear focus on growth and poverty relief and is very likely to use credit as a lever on that front in the meantime economy minister martin guzman has already hinted that capital controls will not be lifted at this time and that interest rates are not the only tool to fight inflation keeping the risk of price freeze in the air the bottom line seems to be that interest rates are about to fall both in nominal and even more so in real terms adriana dupita swiss national bank current libor target rate 0 75 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 with the euro area locked into an expansive stance the snb is all but sure to continue with its policy of subzero interest rates and pledge to wage interventions to stem appreciation pressure on the currency with switzerland s negative rate policy about to enter its fifth year opposition particularly from the banking sector is mounting yet inflation is barely about zero and snb president thomas jordan has stressed that moving off the rock bottom rates would increase pressure on the haven franc the snb adjusted its tiering system in 2019 in order to ease the pain from negative rates for the financial sector and also to enable another interest rate reduction if necessary sveriges riksbank current repo rate 0 forecast for end of 2020 0 sweden s central bank ended nearly half a decade of negative interest rates this month by raising its benchmark rate to zero but it will probably stay put throughout 2020 and possibly until 2022 according to its latest rate path the final months of 2019 have seen a determination from governor stefan ingves and his colleagues to put the ultra loose monetary policy experiment behind them that s despite the economy heading towards a slowdown and inflation stuck below the 2 target having earned the sadomonetarist epithet from nobel laureate paul krugman in 2014 for keeping rates too high the board is now risking similar controversy with its latest move what bloomberg s economists say after raising rates to zero the riksbank will be slow to make another move a fragile global outlook will dampen demand in export oriented sweden at the same time the domestic critique against negative rates has been fierce and that makes new cuts highly unlikely even if the economy worsens we expect the riksbank to stay on hold during the remainder of 2020 johanna jeansson norges bank current deposit rate 1 5 forecast for end of 2020 1 5 after four rate hikes since september 2018 norway s monetary policy is on hold for the foreseeable future yet norges bank surprised the market on dec 19 when it kept the door open for another raise next year governor oystein olsen rejects any notion that he s hawkish with a message that he expects a stable benchmark rate possibly for years but some economists had expected him to lower the probability of a hike in 2020 due to weaker than forecast prospects for the norwegian economy instead the bank kept that chance at 40 amid a weak krone and higher oil prices reserve bank of new zealand current cash rate 1 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 signs the new zealand economy may be turning a corner have prompted most economists to scale back expectations for further rbnz easing in 2020 to just one more cut that was reinforced when governor adrian orr announced new capital rules for banks that were less onerous than expected easing fears they could drive up borrowing costs and require an offset from monetary policy the government has also announced a fiscal spending package that may relieve pressure on the rbnz to do more to stimulate growth that said downside risks remain and with room for further rate cuts limited the central bank has said it will outline its unconventional policy options early next year just in case they re needed what bloomberg s economists say the new zealand dollar has appreciated since the november monetary policy statement and with robust commodity prices is likely to remain above the expectations the rbnz s factored into their outlook a further 25bp cut is likely in 2020 but from there rates are likely to be on hold for a considerable period james mcintyre national bank of poland current cash rate 1 5 forecast for end of 2020 1 5 with benchmark interest rates unchanged at a record low 1 5 since march 2015 poland is in the midst of its longest ever period of stable borrowing costs based on the central bank s comments the pause will extend for the foreseeable future despite hitting a six year high this year inflation remains within the central bank s tolerance range while growth of the european union s largest eastern economy is the slowest in three years thate conflicting forces reduce the chance for any shift in rates strengthening governor adam glapinski s long held position that staying put ensures balanced and persistent economic expansion early in december he noted that inflation will only slightly overshoot next year adding so i can only repeat that a change in rates either way isn t necessary czech national bank current cash rate 2 forecast for end of 2020 2 the czech central bank is among the few in europe still discussing whether to raise interest rates but it may end up keeping them where they are for another year after lifting the benchmark to a 10 year high in may the eighth increase since summer 2017 policy makers have stayed put some have called for tighter policy to curb above target inflation driven by the eu s lowest unemployment rate and the bank s own forecast implies two hikes by the end of march but the majority on the monetary panel has voted down several motions to raise rates saying the export oriented economy may be hit by weaker demand from key trading partners mainly germany and faces geopolitical risks like trade wars and brexit methodology based on median estimate in monthly or quarterly survey where available or most recent collected forecasts all interest rate and forecast data is as of dec 19 some surveys were conducted

by sarah abdallah beirut an economic and financial crisis looms over lebanon the third highest indebted country in the world in terms of debt to gross domestic product ratio which stood at 151 in 2018 given the large public debt interest payments now exceed 9 of gdp the international monetary fund imf said in a july report the imf also said deposit growth in 2018 was the lowest since 2005 and the bdl reserves have now decreased by around 6 billion since early 2018 the crisis comes with strict banking procedures lebanese banks imposed restrictions on deposits and capped withdrawals they also suspended housing loans and froze transfers abroad this led to a us dollar scarcity in the lebanese market and increased its exchange price against the lebanese pound the dollar reached 2 400 lebanese pounds at the money changers in late november before settling between 1 980 lebanese pounds and 2 000 lebanese pounds in sales and purchases during the second week of december the official rate however remained dec 20 at 1 507 5 lebanese pounds on the beirut stock exchange remarkably the exchange rate in syria also gyrated hitting 1 000 syrian pounds against the us dollar while its value set by the syrian central bank remained at 434 syrian pounds this has led many to wonder about the connection between the two monetary crises some lebanese fear that large amounts of dollars are being smuggled from lebanon to syria but the dollar scarcity in lebanon has led to the same condition in syria many syrians hold bank accounts in lebanon which at one time was a much more stable market now though these accounts are being frozen or restricted us sanctions prohibit american financial institutions from doing business with syrian banks meanwhile more than 1 million syrian refugees are registered with the un high commissioner for refugees in lebanon the lebanese government estimates the actual number at 1 5 million syrians add to this the syrian merchants who deposit their money in lebanese banks a norwegian refugee council report quoting world bank data showed 17 of remittances to syria come from lebanon second only to saudi arabia with 29 of total financial remittances al monitor spoke to union of money changers vice president elias srour who commented on the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar against the lebanese pound banks started taking measures to limit the sale of the dollar before the outbreak of the oct 17 revolution he believes that any crisis affecting the money market is political people will regain confidence in the banking system in lebanon when a trustworthy government is formed he said the economy politics and security are three interconnected factors srour pointed out that the money changing market in lebanon includes 300 companies with a daily turnover of around 10 million which is not a significant number compared with banking transactions money changers are mediators between the seller and the buyer and the rate of demand for the dollar increased during november he said when the crisis started the lebanese people deliberately withdrew their funds in dollars from banks and kept them at home these amounts are estimated at 4 billion seeing the high exchange rate of the dollar lebanese people stopped paying in dollars and resorted to money changers to exchange their dollar amounts to the lebanese pound to raise their purchasing power before heading to the market and pharmacies regarding the supposed smuggling of the dollar to syria srour argued that the money changers did not witness an influx of syrians exchanging their currencies against the dollar as lebanese merchants represent more than 80 of money changers clients while other citizens make up the remaining 20 he indicated that the exchange rate of the dollar is between 1 980 lebanese pounds and 2 000 lebanese pounds for buying and selling transactions of note the bdl has been pegging the lebanese pound to greenbacks through what has come to be known as financial engineering but at a nov 11 press conference bdl head riad salameh stated we went through challenges including the syrian war that turned the balance of payments from a surplus registering balance to a deficit balance and economic growth declined from 5 to 2 a study drafted by kinan yaghi vice ceo of the damascus securities exchange and published nov 20 by the damascus center for research and studies medad noted that the syrian pound in early november reached the lowest level in its history with the exchange rate hovering around 715 syrian pounds against the dollar on the black market news websites reported that rate jumped to 1 000 syrian pounds the first week of december in his study yaghi asserted that lebanon s economic crisis negatively affected the syrian pound exchange rate he explained that this was due to several bdl measures the bdl banned money changers and traders from cash through rafik hariri international airport and border crossings he said it required money changers to obtain prior authorization to transfer money and to do so through licensed money exchange companies previously people could transfer large amounts of dollars in cash outside lebanon by getting the permission of the lebanese customs authorities only he added the capping of amounts that depositors including syrians are allowed to withdraw deposits estimated at tens of billions of dollars also affected the syrian pound exchange rate for his part nassib ghobril head economist at byblos bank noted lebanon s financial crunch started in late 2017 economic growth for that year was 0 6 at the time the lebanese government imposed new taxes on consumption movable funds and official formalities he told al monitor the rise in the import of oil derivatives in lebanon during 2019 to 8 2 million tons during the first seven months almost doubling from 4 8 million for the same period of 2018 is among the crisis triggers diesel imports increased more than fourfold from 1 1 million tons to 4 7 million tons some of the diesel quantities were sold to syria which enlarged lebanon s oil import bill lebanon buys oil derivatives in dollars and sells them to syria in the syrian currency or in exchange for commodities or industrial goods he said the main reason for the current financial crisis ghobril believes remains the lack of serious political will to implement reforms that would boost confidence lead to the injection of capital and reduce the deficit the solution is forming a credible government that will take serious measures cause a positive shock to the commercial markets and beef up the confidence of expatriates and consumers he noted that the money changing market represents 4 of the monetary mass of foreign currencies and he asserted that syria s economy is different than lebanon s the bdl is taking measures commensurate with the financial stability of lebanon ghobril affirmed sarah abdallah is a ph d student in

part ii of five part series austerity on the island at the first puerto rico oversight board public meeting board member andrew biggs said he had done research showing that the best policy practices for countries struggling with debt are ones that place much more weight on spending cuts than on tax increases in the paper a guide for deficit reduction in the united states based on historical consolidations that worked which biggs authored with kevin hassett and matthew jensen they said that the average expenditure share for successful consolidations is 80 percent if inclusive of our calculations and those from they argued that cuts should be focused on government wages and the provision of social transfers biggs preference is in line with that of alberto alesina an exponent of austerity for countries with large debts the harvard university professor has been writing about government fiscal policy for much of his 33 year career he authored a book with carlo favero and francesco giavazzi austerity when it works and when it doesn t published earlier this year the authors argue that government debt in major industrialized countries should be reduced first large public debts and unfunded pensions imply a redistribution between current generations and future ones who cannot vote this is unfair they say second when interest rates go higher as they will do sooner or later it will become much more painful to finance annual deficits third in some countries high debt levels may generate default risk high interest rates capital outflows as in greece and a debt crisis that may impose austerity when it is particularly costly they wrote their book is a study of 200 multi year austerity plans from 1981 to 2014 in 16 major industrialized free market economies they acknowledge that austerity causes short term economic contractions however they say that austerity is sometimes necessary and desirable and that it can promote long term economic growth through a mathematical analysis of the 200 cases the authors claim to show that plans that try to reduce government deficits through spending cuts have better outcomes than those that focus on tax increases spending cuts based plans have led to reduced government debt to gross domestic product ratios while tax increase based plans have had the opposite effect spending cuts based plans have also harmed the economy less alesina and his co authors say that governments that cut spending give society s participants confidence that the deficit problem will be permanently addressed and this confidence helps promote economic growth for contrast perhaps the best known contemporary economist arguing against austerity policies is paul krugman a city university of new york professor and new york times columnist he made a case against austerity in a 2015 essay in the guardian newspaper the case for cuts was a lie why does britain still believe it the austerity delusion in 2010 british prime minister david cameron warned that britain s growing government debt could trigger a crisis and argued for austerity policies to cut the annual deficit krugman was writing in response to the policies of cameron and his successors in britain krugman wrote primarily about the experience of european countries in the preceding eight years not all of krugman s arguments are completely relevant to puerto rico and some of them concern countries in different circumstances than puerto rico krugman presented a scatterplot of countries on a graph with the rate of gross domestic product growth on a y axis and the harshness of austerity on an x axis both measured 2009 to 2013 the international monetary fund is the source of his data generally those countries with the least austerity had the best economic growth and those with the most had the greatest contraction greece had the most austerity and the greatest contraction krugman says this shows that some pro austerity economists talk of the expansionary impact of austerity back in 2010 was foolish he said that alesina and others have looked at cases that are quite different from those in europe since 2010 to argue for the value of austerity there alesina and many other pro austerians have acknowledged austerity s short term negative economic impacts after the period depicted by krugman s scatterplot most of the countries that had experienced austerity achieved economic growth britain portugal and spain s economies have been growing since 2014 indeed britain which was going through austerity at the time in general had gross domestic product growth from 2009 to 2014 albeit at a low level among other critics of austerity is brown university professor mark blyth who said in his book austerity the history of a dangerous idea that excessive government spending wasn t the primary factor in europe s sovereign debt crisis of the past decade except in greece for everyone else the problem is the banks that sovereign have to take responsibility for especially in the eurozone the eurozone refers to the 19 european countries that use the euro as their currency the european banks assets were a far larger portion of gross domestic product in the eurozone nations than the u s banks assets were in the u s gdp prior to the great recession many of the european banks were over leveraged and had lent to many questionable borrowers blyth said europe s leaders were worried about the effects of deep or widespread debt markdowns on the banking system and how this would affect their economies blyth added according to blyth in the context of their inability to expand their own money supply or devalue individual countries currencies because they were all linked in the euro european countries in the midst of a downturn might normally have considered defaulting on debt blyth said but since this would have blown up the banking system at the heart of the economy europe s leaders turned to austerity in this way blyth explains the prevalence of austerity policies in some european nations this past decade while some economists have argued that with austerity some european countries returned to a long overdue responsibility blyth said the policies were just the result of peculiarities of europe s economy and the use of a single currency by many countries blyth criticized an essay by alesina and other pro austerity economists that aimed to show that in an economic downturn government spending should be cut decisively he said that the economists used poor examples to support their thesis denmark in the 1980s and ireland in the late 1980s blyth cited a congressional research service report that found withdrawing fiscal stimuli too quickly in economies where output is already contracting can prolong their recessions without generating the expected fiscal saving this is particularly true if the consolidation is centered around cuts to public expenditures and if the size of the consolidation is large blyth said that pro austerity economists frequently cite the experience of estonia latvia lithuania romania and bulgaria in the great recession to support their conclusions during this period their economies underwent great stress but according to the austerians austerity helped them return to economic growth in this decade s early years blyth said that latvia was a poor example because it returned to economic growth not during austerity but after it ended by 2013 when blyth s book was published the country still wasn t experiencing growth at the same levels as before the recession he said what s more sovereign debt levels as a percent of gross domestic product rose in the period blyth pointed to ireland and iceland to show what he saw as the bad and good approaches to handling simultaneous economic and banking crises of the great recession anti austerity protestors carry a coffin draped in the irish flag at the labour party conference at nui galway in donegal ireland on saturday april 14 2012 hundreds of angry protesters stormed garda barricades at the labour party conference crowds of placard waving campaigners broke through security lines to picket the bailey allen

niall pa photos abaca newscom when a housing price bubble popped in ireland in 2008 three major irish banks teetered over the following months and years the irish government instituted austerity and spent enormous resources propping up the banking system blyth said writing in 2013 he said ireland had since the recession remained a bad place to be with high unemployment high ratios of debt to gdp and heavy government spending cuts blyth presented iceland as a contrast prior to the recession many europeans parked their money in icelandic banks the ratio of bank assets to gdp reached more than 11 during the recession international faith in the banks withered pushing the banks into default while iceland s government chose to guarantee its residents deposits it didn t extend the guarantee to foreigners deposits where ireland followed the mantra of austerity slashed spending and bailed its banks iceland let its banks go bankrupt devalued its currency put up capital controls and bolstered welfare measures blyth said because of this the great recession had a more moderate and short lived impact on iceland he said according to blyth iceland shows that a country can let its banks collapse however the situation of iceland s banking system was quite different from that of most banking systems as the vast majority of its deposits were made by those outside of the country the damage that resulted from iceland s refusal to backstop foreign deposits almost entirely fell on the economies of other european states further the reality is that while iceland s government let key banks collapse under international monetary fund pressure for a loan in 2010 it voted to pay britain and the netherlands up to 6 of iceland s gdp from 2017 to 2023 to help cover british and dutch losses of iceland bank deposits iceland is also different from many european countries and puerto rico in that it had its own currency the króna which could devalue on the currency markets the independent currency was both a positive and a negative to the economy in the great recession period and its aftermath since the publication of blyth s book the economies of both ireland and iceland have done well iceland s inflation adjusted gross domestic product grew 24 6 to 2018 from 2013 according to the organization for economic cooperation and development its unemployment rate declined to 3 4 in august 2019 from 5 6 in january 2013 according to eurostat ireland s inflation adjusted gross national income grew 18 to 2018 from 2013 its unemployment rate declined to 5 3 in august from 14 5 in january 2013 in this past decade s european economic crises most of the countries turned to some form of austerity as mentioned before iceland took a different route but was in a unique economic circumstance however portugal took a somewhat alternative path to dealing with economic contraction excessive debt and for a brief period inability to borrow more for its deficit spending also making it similar to puerto rico portugal adopted the euro currency from 1999 to 2002 portugal had weak economic performance from 2000 to 2014 indeed per capita income was lower in 2012 than it was in 2000 despite repeated government austerity policies the debt to gdp ratio rose from 50 in 2000 to 68 in 2007 and to 126 in 2012 members of the portuguese armed forces stage a vigil against austerity measures in front of the presidential palace in lisbon portugal on wednesday nov 30 2011 portuguese prime minister pedro passos coelho is cutting spending and raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion euro 103 7 billion aid plan from the european union and the international monetary fund photographer mario proenca bloomberg mario proenca bloomberg in 2011 the government could no longer borrow private capital to finance its deficit and it turned to the international monetary fund european financial stabilization mechanism and european financial stability facility for a 78 billion euros 86 6 billion bailout after several years of intense austerity from 2011 to 2014 voters in november 2015 brought antónio costa to power costa a leader of portugal s socialist party raised the minimum wage pensions public sector salaries and restored the number of vacation days to pre crisis levels creditors like germany and the international monetary fund objected to the policies according to the world bank portugal s inflation adjusted gdp was slowing its fall from the start of 2012 to mid 2013 by the third quarter of 2013 portugal s economy was growing thus portugal s economy had already been improving for two years when costa became prime minister however it is notable that the economy continued to grow with costa lowering the unemployment rate from 12 in late 2015 to 6 2 in august costa has also managed to reduce the government deficit from 4 4 of the gdp when he took office to less than 1 by july 2018 yet government debt outstanding remains high according to moody s investors service it has declined from 130 3 of gdp in 2016 to 123 6 of gdp in 2018 and is expected to continue to shrink in the next few years economic growth alone didn t achieve this shrinkage costa also cut spending on infrastructure and some other areas so he used at least one classic tool of austerity cutting government spending even if he focused on cutting non traditional areas moody s rating of portugal s debt reached its lowest point since 1986 in feb 2012 with a rating of ba3 with a negative outlook as of dec 18 2019 moody s rated the debt baa3 with a positive outlook portugal s

the headline reason i think is structural and probably is not being talked there s not enough talk about it in that technology and particularly technology enabled disruption is a dramatic structural change that s occurred just in the last really fifteen years that is limiting the pricing power of business more than at any time in our lifetime now most of you are sitting here saying oh come on technology has been replacing people for all of our lives what s different is distributed computing and the fact that we each have in the palm of our hands more computing power than the typical company had just ten or fifteen years ago the balance of power has dramatically shifted from the sellers of goods and services to the buyers of goods and services and we do a lot of work on this issue at the dallas fed we ve done two conferences on it we re about to do a third and we think it s creating a dramatic change in the way businesses are run and so the way businesses are dealing with this is to the extent they have cost increases it s just as likely to create margin erosion it s not that they don t want to pass it on terms of prices they can t and what businesses are doing is investing more in technology as a result and they re doing more merger activity because they need more scale to manage this phenomenon but what does it mean for the labor force it means that we can run a tighter labor force than we have historically without at least pricing pressure there is wage pressure and more than people the headline numbers may suggest in that at the 12 to 15 hour range we find there s a lot of there s a lot of wage pressure in the united states and a lot of churn and for skilled workers there s a shortage of skilled workers and there s lots of wage pressure there where there s not wage pressure is in the middle if you re making 55 000 a year with benefits and you work at a good company what we re finding particularly late in an economic cycle is workers very rationally are willing to trade off the quality of their employer the quality of their job for going after the extra x percent in terms of wages and so there is wage pressure but it s for skilled and at the low end but this structural change in terms of technology enabled disruption is allowing us to run a hotter workforce than we would have ten fifteen years ago so the typical fed playbook would be you start getting to levels that you think are at or below full employment you start raising the fed funds rate because you re worried that inflation s going to take off i don t think inflation s going to take off we ve been saying this at the dallas fed for a few years now we think inflation pressures are going to remain muted it s not that there aren t cyclical inflation pressures they are there are but they re being more than offset by these powerful structural forces which are by the way in our view intensifying buiter inflation pressures are muted at current levels of unemployment but how much scope is there for further reducing you know 3 4 3 3 3 2 percent kaplan our own view at the dallas fed is we re going to grow next year around 2 percent maybe a little bit more and you re going to see the unemployment rate pretty well stay stagnant around 3 ½ percent the number we look at more than the headline unemployment rate is a is a concept in the lingo called u 6 which is the number of unemployed plus discouraged workers who ve given up looking out of the workforce plus people working part time who would prefer to work full time but they re counted in the workforce that percentage to us is more relevant that though is 6 9 percent and just to put it in context the last time it was that low was during the dot com boom and the pre recession low i e 06 it was something like 7 9 percent so we if you look at that measure of slack we are well below the pre recession low and we re at historically tight levels all that tells me while there s some slack particularly in groups that haven t been in the workforce that are being pulled in there s not that much slack we think we re at or past full employment in the united states buiter you mentioned that technological change has had a restraining effect on inflation but you ve also mentioned other secular drivers that have similar effects demographics distribution and all that could you elaborate on those kaplan yeah so there s four there s four big structural drivers of the u s economy and i m a businessperson so you want to know i sit around the table with lots of ph d economists and as a and i have thirty ph d economists at the dallas fed and we tend to do a lot of research on cyclical phenomena things there s lots of data on i as a businessperson tend to look in addition a lot at structural drivers there s four big structural drivers that i see in the u s economy number one is the workforce is aging i wish we weren t but we are and so what it means is workforce growth is slowing in the united states and the participation rate all things being equal is trending downward we ve stayed flat at 63 percent the last few years that s an enormous accomplishment the participation rate in 07 by the way was 66 percent the participation rate is those sixteen years old and older that are either in the workforce working or looking for work it s trending down and we think over the next ten years it s going to trend down to 61 percent even though people are working longer that s a headwind for economic growth gdp growth is made up of growth in the workforce and growth in productivity and i m telling you right now workforce growth in the united states unless we make changes to immigration policy and other things we re doing workforce growth here is slowing so that s a headwind for gdp growth and probably has some restraining effect on prices the second one i mentioned is technology technology enabled disruption and i mentioned the impact on businesses it s got one other effect and that s on productivity you would think with all this investment in technology productivity would be going like this and oh by the way it is by industry and by business but when we talk about productivity in terms of gdp we talk about the workforce we measure it workforce wide and what we re finding in our work at the dallas fed is if you ve got a college education which is about two thirds of the workforce or better you re benefitting from technology and technology enabled disruption you might have some traumas in your career but your income you re likely to be in the workforce and it s likely your income is going to go like this in your career and your productivity if on the other hand you re one of the forty six million workers in the united states that has a high school education or lower you re increasingly seeing your job either restructured or eliminated think of the call center worker again that makes 55 000 a year that job ain t going to exist five seven years from now and you ll find another job in a tight labor market but you may well be seeing your income and productivity go like this when you average it all together productivity growth in the united states is sluggish our thought at the dallas fed we feel strongly which is why we spend to much time on this is we ve got to improve early childhood literacy educational attainment skills training and we are lagging in the united states versus other countries particularly on early childhood literacy particularly on the fastest growing demographics groups you know kids are not starting third grade reading at grade level and it means lower productivity and what s the number one skill we hear from employers you need to adapt to technology literacy ability to read write and communicate and we are we are lagging the world in the united states oh by the way texas lags the country the country lags the world so we ve got to work more on that last two and i ll do it quickly globalization is the third drivers globalization is probably having also some muting effect on pricing power not as much we don t think as technology but the bigger concern we have about globalization we think at the dallas fed globalization is an opportunity for the u s to grow faster in a in a society where your population is aging you re highly leveraged you haven t invested enough in your workforce and so you re not as productive integrating with the rest of the world is an enormous opportunity but right now the narrative in the united states is if you re losing your job in wisconsin or michigan it s probably due to either an immigrant or it s due to a lousy trade deal that probably was true fifteen years ago today if you re losing your job in one of those places it s probably due to technology and technology enabled disruption and if we get that diagnosis wrong we re going to make policies that are going to cause us to de globalization will mean slower growth and then the last big issue none of this would matter all that much it would matter but not that much if we weren t so highly leveraged in the united states so the household sector s deleveraged over the last ten years that s good news and the households are 70 percent of the economy as you know willem and the corporates nonfinancial corporates are historically highly leveraged but the government is now on a we think an unsustainable path 77 percent of its debt held by the public of the u s government and the present value of unfunded entitlements is now 59 trillion dollars it was 46 trillion dollars four years ago by the way when i started in this job it s gone up from 46 trillion dollars to 59 trillion dollars i thought it was a typo but it s not and so every year we grow at 2 percent we just get more leveraged and so we ve got to find ways to grow faster and growing the workforce finding policies that grow the workforce improving educational attainment skills training are essential if we re going to grow faster buiter even with regard to household leverage it s only low relative to a crazy benchmark kaplan that s true that s true buiter of ten years ago kaplan that s true buiter so one shouldn t take too much comfort from that having spent some time at the low frequencies and the long run let me move to high frequencies and short run phenomenon of some notoriety here we had a kerfuffle in the repo market a malfunction in september the repo rate overnight went to 10 percent plus the response to it has i think been ad hoc rather than systematic i would have expected the creation of some kind of repo standby facility what is your view of the causes of this malfunction and what is the way to address it in the short run and the medium term kaplan so the reason this happened and this is the first question i get asked i was joking back there that if i if i met clergy person that would be the first question they would ask me right now is what s going on with the repo laughs repo and so here s what s here s what s happened the fed was growing its balance sheet up until about a year and a half ago we halted it and we started then to run down our balance sheet ok in other words we were saying instead of having a 4 ½ trillion balance sheet maybe the economy doesn t need us we re past the crisis maybe we don t need this level of excess reserves so we started to run down our balance sheet what did we and it went fine for a for a time until we got to september and what s changed tax payments are not new but tax payments in september what s new is u s government debt issuance is going like this and the indirect effect of all that debt issuance is it takes reserves out of the system the other thing that s happening is because of regulation the big banks where most of the reserves are concentrated are not as willing to lend to one another and so to your point we were we reacted at least as this happened we in september the u s lost something like 2 00 billion dollars 250 billion dollars of reserves from september 1 to october 1 ok because of these trends that i just talked about so we at the fed immediately instituted an overnight and term repo facility to sort of step in and smooth these markets we started increasing our balance sheet by buying 60 billion dollars a month of treasury bills you mentioned a standing repo facility i think that s something as you may know i ve said publicly we should be seriously considering but i think we ll get through year end i m optimistic we will settle down this volatility but i think the fed has learned something and i think i think this will be a manageable situation but we re going to need to run a little bit bigger balance sheet than we might have thought previously and the draining of reserves because of these trends that i just talked about is going to be something we re going to have to manage for the foreseeable future buiter ok kaplan but i agree with you we should be doing it in a we should we will get to a point i m optimistic where we have facilities in place so it doesn t look like we re reacting it looks more like we re proactively managing this buiter but we should have a peaceful christmas and new year kaplan we ll have some volatility in the repo market but that s not the end of the world but yes we should be able to get through year end buiter all right very good when the next cyclical downturn comes and it will sooner or later the world is cyclical the u s economy will find itself back at the zero lower bound without any doubt a typical peak to trough rate cycle pre great financial crisis was five hundred basis points worth of cuts and we got 150 to 175 to play with now one of the things that strikes me is that many of the colleagues in central bank land have in response to negative shocks of that kind have actually gone into negative territory have gone below the zero lower bound there s considerable scope there i mean ok the japanese are only ten basis points below zero but the ecb fifty and some of the smaller european banks have gone to minus seventy five basis points why has the u s not done this is there i can think of obvious technical reasons like you don t want to embarrass what s left of the inaudible money market fund industry kaplan yeah buiter and there are those who believe that it violates the constitution because negative interest rates are a tax on bank borrowing from the fed and only and only congress can tax that argument makes about as much sense as it sounds but it has been made why has the u s not gone negative is there an argument for doing so at the next time of asking kaplan yeah so let me start with what i take as the lessons from japan europe and negative rates i think we ve studied it very carefully at the dallas fed and i think the lesson for me is i don t think negative rates i question whether negative rates have been effective and i and i think they do a lot of damage or can do a lot of damage to the health of the financial sector and in the united states as you mentioned we ve got a big money market industry and many companies are very dependent on the commercial paper market which depends on a healthy money market industry so the lesson i take from watching these negative rates in europe is actually we don t want to do them here and i think it s an example which is a danger right now for us of central banks trying to do too much so what s an example in europe they very much need broader economic policy and i know there s been a lot discussed in more fiscal policy from germany which hasn t happened yet but i think there s a danger in the united states monetary policy for most of my life has not been the only economic policy in the united states it just seems that way in the last ten years but i think that s a mistake and a trap that i don t want to see us fall in in that we need broader economic policy we need infrastructure spending early childhood literacy we need to find ways to grow the workforce we need other structural reforms away from monetary policy and where appropriate we need sound fiscal policy which we ve used a lot of that capacity i m afraid in the last few years so we don t we have a lot of scope for it but for me no i don t i don t anticipate we ll be using negative rates in the united states i don t think we should and i think this is one of those times where the central bank it s our job to say our role is important but no we re not going to be able to solve this by ourselves and we need to call out more aggressively the need for broader economic policy and i think the european case as an example where i understand why the central bank is doing what it s doing and there s no fiscal policy forthcoming but i m not at all sure that negative rates are helping i m not sure they are and i for one in my seat i am determined that we re not going to use those in the united states buiter very good another policy that hasn t been used yet although it has been used in the in the distant past has been foreign exchange market intervention by the u s kaplan yeah buiter right we at the moment only have tweet versions of that which do not actually directly or indirectly involve the fed is there a case i think say if there were to be divergent economic developments in the u s and abroad for either a unilateral or possibly a multilateral form of foreign exchange market intervention kaplan i think that would be also a fairly dangerous thing so you haven t asked about trade yet but i know we re going to talk about it and we talk a lot about trade uncertainty and people always think china well i actually think if it was just china you know for most businesses in the united states i think that would be manageable i think more broader trade uncertainty is what s been more challenging and the reason i mention this is recently you may remember in the last two weeks the united states has threatened tariffs against brazil and argentina because their currencies are weak well why are their currencies weak currencies are weak because the economies are not doing well and so currencies are a way when economies are underperforming the u k being an example post the brexit vote their currency depreciated it s not manipulation it s basically the outgrowth of a weaker economy our currency the dollar has been stronger mainly because we ve been outperforming it s not necessarily directly a function of where our interests rates are it s a function of the strength of the economy and so i think this is a dangerous situation where we ve already got very low global growth highly correlated with weakening trade and i would be very nervous about other policies that intervene in this area because i think they may further weaken global growth and i think while we are more insulated than other countries from weak global growth it ll hurt us too and i m at this stage i m worried about you know weak manufacturing in the united states weak business fixed investment and weak global growth is feeding into that weakness and if global growth i m hopeful in this next year by the way global growth s going to stabilize somewhat might even improve a bit but if it got weaker i m pretty concerned that that will spread to other parts of the u s economy and we may have more weakening here too buiter what are the drivers of this slow global growth that you see as a major threat partly through the trade channel also to the u s continued economic recovery kaplan i mean i will tell you our own view you know we re the texas is the largest exporting state in the country so it s not surprising we do lots of work on trade at the dallas fed we think probably if you had to correlate why global growth is weak the number one driver we do think is trade if you track what the trend of global trade is versus global growth it s a pretty good correlation so while exports are only 12 or say 13 percent of u s gdp they re more like 40 percent plus of german gdp they re over 20 percent of asian gdp so when global when global trade when there s sand in the gears like there is now of global trade u s is hurt but not as badly as countries around the world so if there s some stabilization of trade policy and we get some resolution of some of these issues that ll probably be the number one catalyst for improving global growth in our view obviously this issue of aging population most advanced economies around the world have the same problem we do germany s got it worse their population aging issue is even worse than ours japan s got it worse and that s a big driver of low global growth and i d say even though our productivity tends to lag the world growth you know productivity growth globally has been surprisingly sluggish just been more sluggish here so those are also issues that are going to require structural reforms i e non monetary policy buiter since we are on the international economy could i tempt you to venturing a forecast about likely future developments of energy prices and the energy sector generally kaplan yeah yeah that s fair to ask because we re we do a lot of work on that obviously at the dallas fed because we re i think if texas were a n independent country i think we d be the fourth or fifth largest energy producer in the world so here s what s going on in energy because global growth is sluggish this the energy industry is a great example for those who say gee the u s is insulated from slow global growth i think energy would be an example where that just isn t true and so oil prices are lower that s number one number two it turns out shale is not as easy to make money in as people thought and there s a 70 percent decline curve which means you need to keep drilling and you need more scale and so that s been more challenging and the other thing that s happening two other things capital providers stocks haven t done well and they haven t been making money so people are basically capital providers are saying i want you now to earn a return and oh by the way if you re going to spend on capex it needs to come out of cashflow not out of borrowing and then the last trend is esg most pools of money out there are under pressure to be much more sensitive to sustainability so i have a number of big private equity firms say to me if we had to raise a fund today i don t think we could raise a fund and so this is a capital starved industry right now and how is that manifesting itself net production growth in the united states in 2018 was 1 8 million barrels a day ok we got up we grew a lot this year it s more like 7 00 000 or 800 000 barrels a day and we ve got up to twelve million barrels a day production so we re the largest in the world there s been a boom next year i e 2020 we think production growth will be less than 500 000 and we re hearing towards zero in 2021 basically because most of the people in the industry just don t want to spend and their capital providers are putting pressure on them not to spend in other words to make higher returns and so in the short run we expect energy prices to be volatile and it s going to be driven primarily by what s going on with global growth if you ask me the price of oil three to five years out this may surprise you global growth global growth is such we still think global demand daily demand will be a million dollars million barrels a day plus it was 1 4 1 5 million was our estimate about a year ago it s slipping down closer to one million barrels if it stays in the million barrels a day plus and u s production growth is actually you know near zero or low hundreds of thousands there isn t a lot of new supply around the world we actually think it s very possible or even likely in the next three to five years we ll be an undersupply situation globally and very vulnerable to some type of production shock you know geopolitical event so you could see the price of oil spike and i d say in the next three years we re more vulnerable to upside spike than downside spike unless global growth just deteriorates much more but i don t think i don t think that case is as likely so i think there s more risk to the upside on prices on oil than downside even though people are not investing in the industry ironically i think there s more upside risk to the price buiter the fed raised rates four times in 2018 cut them three times this year in your view this is the inevitable question i just can pop it in before my time is up what s the appropriate path of rates going forward kaplan i ve got penciled in no change so and i m not alone as i ve read in the newspapers and seen around laughter in our in our meetings so i think the appropriate path of policy is to stay where we are we expect again 2 percent plus growth 2 percent growth for next year unemployment rate around 3 ½ percent we ll have some firming in inflation gradually toward 2 percent and i think with that profile i think the right at 1 ½ 1 ¾ fed funds rate i think the right thing for us to do is stay right where we are unless something changes materially on the upside or the downside buiter on the other policy that i mentioned balance sheet runoff is this going to resume do you kaplan no is the balance sheet runoff going to resume no it s not going to resume i think right now we re growing the balance sheet what i d like to see is after we ve added we ve said we re going to buy 60 billion dollars of bills now for five or six months which will build up our balance sheet not to where it was but it will it will build i would prefer to see us have some mechanism in place and we ll debate around the committee whether that s current repo operations or standing repo that will allow us to have an ample reserves regime but with the smallest possible balance sheet that grows with the economy but no the balance sheet from here is all things being equal going to be bigger and not smaller but i d ideally like to get to the point where the growth comes with the growth in currency and with the economy buiter well i think that exhausts my time it s now time to turn to the members please join our conversation remember this meeting is on the record and may be audio or video recordings if you are selected to speak wait for the microphone and speak directly into it please please stand and state your name and affiliation and limit yourself to one question if you can and we start over there q thank you very much i m david braunschvig i was wondering if you would consider adding a fifth factor to your explanation of the low inflation the dramatic change in the market for corporate control over the past fifteen years the percentage of firms owned by private equity owners has risen from 5 to 15 percent these owners are much more focused on controlling the bottom line than growing the top line and that has probably a detrimental effect on inflation growth so the question is two questions do you see that as a major factor and if so what is your what are your policy recommendations kaplan so let s break it out let me let me set aside well let me start with there are a number of emerging companies today that are funded by private capital and you can airbnb uber you can go down the list that are this is on one part and then i ll get to i think the other part you re referring to but are a lot of these companies not only don t make a profit some of them i ve looked at their registration statements they don t make a gross margin and in a lot of industries incumbent businesses are having to compete with them and so far the financial markets have rewarded gaining share but that may change as there s more demand for price discipline but there s no question the emergence of these platform companies among a broad range of industries and the market rewarding share over profits that has actually limited pricing power everywhere else though in activism that you re talking about has led to private equity firms tend to buy things with more leverage they are highly focused on believe me if they could raise prices these companies they would like to and they re encouraging it because they have to deleverage and they ve very focused on improving gross margin and improving profitability and then the other area where activism is going on is taking you know pressuring companies but most of that is encouraging companies to again either do merger activities get more scale or do share repurchase to mask some of the margin erosion but to your point where private investing is affected the thing i m worried about you asked about inflation it s really for me the first thing which is the private capital fueling of these platform companies and the markets incentivizing those i don t actually think private capital is i think if anything i don t think it s having an effect on inflation the way you re describing as much as the first part is that s my observation q good morning my name is nili gilbert co founder and portfolio manager of matarin capital thanks to you both for being back here with us again today my question is about the network for greening the financial system it was interesting to see the federal reserve join this network of global central banks in september that s focused on the impact of climate risk on the stability of the financial system could be insurance companies that have written policies on climate risky assets or banks that have made similar loans it was interesting because on the one hand this represents a divergence between kind of headline federal policy and the risks that the central bank is considering i was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how this affects you as the head of a regional bank especially dallas with so much energy sector in your region and also do you have any perspective on this from your role as the former head of investment banking at goldman thank you kaplan yeah so let me let me start with so i ll direct your attention look at our site we just we just wrote a lengthy essay on climate change i guess it was two three months ago and you might look at it and what we went through so there s a number of aspects to climate change what the bank of england and the work we re doing broadly at the fed we re starting to do is about financial stability as you said so that s one part of it and i think we ll continue to do more work on that the part i m particularly interested in and we ve done an enormous amount of work in the eleventh district on is the impact economically of climate change and it s already having a significant effect on our district and what do i mean by that hurricanes and our and we did a lengthy analysis which you may look at it of the national climate assessment and if it s even close to being correct we think the frequency and intensity of hurricanes is going to increase a hurricane being seventy four miles an hour or greater you know storm and harvey alone is estimated to have cost about 80 billion and if those you know thousand year events start happening with great frequency which we think they re going to happen more often that has a big economic effect and in addition in texas along the gulf we house a good bulk of the nation s petrochemical and refinery infrastructure we have key ports along the gulf that we think need substantial billions of dollars in refurbishment and investment and in the next hurricane if we don t make those investments our concern is and people who run the ports their concern is it s going to impede global trade for the whole country in addition we have droughts floods you ve got the fires in california so what we did is do actually an analysis of how that s affecting the eleventh district and the country we re also working with the san francisco fed who is also obviously affected by this and obviously the atlanta fed because of you know hurricanes in florida is very affected so there s not only the financial stability issues but i think that s more conventional and you ll see us do more work i d like this we re doing more work on just understanding what s the migration impact the economic impact what are the investments that need to make there s not a week that goes by i don t talk to a mayor or a leader somewhere in the state that isn t actively thinking about making multi billion dollar investments either in building the reservoirs along houston or along the port or protecting infrastructure who isn t worried about this plus agricultural impacts and everything else we think this will increasingly start to manifest itself in affecting gdp and so that s a lot of the work that we re doing on it buiter question here q my name is hariharan i m from nwi management in new york robert you made it clear that you don t like negative interest rates you also made it clear that you are not a fan of dollar intervention but there are two important trends outside america right now you have a lot of the developed world japan europe everybody in deep negative rates you also have a situation in the emerging markets where currency depreciation is not passing through inflation to the economy so there s a motivation for every emerging market now to cut rates and if necessary weaken the currency here s the question by definition the dollar is now on the other side of this equation tightening monetary policy in a manner outside your control does it mean your ability to do anything on rates now is all to the downside meaning you have no ability to raise rates because of this global phenomenon and the path of rates here is here or lower kaplan yeah so i don t think that that wouldn t be the conclusion i would draw what i am concerned about is and again this gets back to it strikes me there s been this isn t true in asia but in the rest of the world again the primary economic policy has been monetary ok and i think by what you are saying which i agree with it s not going that well we need broader economic policy that is going to you know build infrastructure improve educational attainment improve productivity and the other thing is i think some of these issues you are talking about are a symptom of i would call it deglobalization in other words if we re going if we re going away from integrating with the rest of the world to deglobalizing i think you are going to see some difficult economic outcomes as a result of it and so i for me it doesn t mean that the federal reserve won t be able to do what it needs to do on monetary policy but it does mean that unless we address some of these issues global growth is going to be disappointing and if global growth is disappointing it means at a time where potential growth in united states i think is also deteriorating if we don t address these issues i think there were places in the world where there are bright spots for global growth they have better demographics they have emerging middle classes but if we have some of these structural issues i don t think we re going to realize those benefits and i think the path therefore of growth here in the u s is going to be lower rather than higher is my concern and so this is why when we go around we talk more broadly than just monetary policy because i think we re going there s going to be a bunch of policy issues that if we don t like some of these outcomes it s going to have to be about more than just the fed buiter question over there kaplan and we should make sure to get byron buiter yeah i ll get him next kaplan who just announced his ten big surprises buiter laughs q i m looking forward to his surprises as well so andres small partners group i was surprised to hear if i heard you correctly that productivity and or literacy in the state of texas lags the u s lags the world kaplan yeah well literacy does productivity we re still doing well but there are some reasons for that we have substantial migration to the state and my concern about literacy is that our future workforce in the state of texas particularly if migration stabilizes those young people are the future workforce and if literacy doesn t improve our productivity is going to be sluggish q so my question is despite energy trends being negative kaplan yeah q negative weather events adverse immigration policies texas is a brighter spot than looking at other kaplan it is and i can explain why q please and are the beggar thy neighbor policies that if they were replicated by other states you would go spiraling downwards kaplan so there s a lot of the positive trends going on in texas first of all energy even though it s challenging right now is around 8 percent of the state s gdp so over the last thirty years texas has become dramatically more diversified we have a big tech sector and we have and the big thing we have is substantial migration of people and firms to the state and so the population of texas ten years ago was around twenty two million we re on our way to twenty nine million and it s our own estimate the dallas fed over the next twenty five years we may well get to forty million believe it or not yes and by the way i m from the state of kansas let me give you the kansas trends over that period 2 93 million 2 93 million flat and by the way thirty five to forty states in this country illinois others population trends are flat to down and so what s the most valuable thing you can have as a city or a state is a growing population and growing workforce growth that is critical and then obviously you want to make sure they are highly educated they re in good health and they are employable and they are productive texas has almost all of those you can check almost all those boxes migration to some extent has masked some of the issues about early childhood literacy and we ve come together in the state we re part of a group with business leaders the governor and others to try to do we just passed education reform in the state of texas 5 billion to invest in early childhood literacy and improving educational attainment so we can address this but what s the lesson for the country the problem for the rest of the country is population trends are flat to down we are not we are not doing things in the country to grow population and i know for example immigration is a very sensitive it goes without saying it s a very sensitive issue we do a lot of work on it in the state in our bank we think the u s immigration system should be restructured to be more skills based and employer based much more like canada but i would also say if you think you re going to cut immigration in the united states and you are going to grow gdp those two things don t go together the reason texas is outperforming one of the big reasons is population growth and migration and so it makes me feel texas is going to outperform the country but it also makes me worry about the rest of the country because the population trends are flat to down and we can address it but we ve got to have policies that address it or we need to get a lot more productive to offset that slowing population growth and we re not investing enough in education yet i hope we will to offset this slowing population growth buiter yes indeed q byron wien blackstone rob in the year 2000 the accumulated debt of the united states was 6 trillion and the blended interest government interest rate on it then was 6 percent so debt service was 360 billion dollars today the debt is around 22 trillion the blended interest rate is a little over 2 percent the debt service is 450 now can you explain to me how the debt could quadruple kaplan yeah q and the interest rate could go down by two thirds kaplan yeah so let me let me actually that s let me let me give that a shot so there s two things going on number one global growth since 2000 and the prospects for global growth have deteriorated pretty substantially population demographics have deteriorated and instead of growing at you know hopefully to grow at 3 or 4 percent we re growing i think potential gdp growth in the united states is 1 ¾ to 2 percent ok and so what s the number one driver in my view of interest rates along the curve prospects for future growth and i can tell you look global liquidity is part of it and there s been lots of central bank you know central bank balance sheets have gone from 4 ½ trillion dollars to 25 trillion dollars so that s a part of it but i think the bigger part is prospects for future growth have deteriorated substantially so interest rates are lower that s number one number two for the united states we ve got the ability to print money and the dollar is the world s reserve currency and my concern is if for the rest of our lives or beyond our lives our kids lives the dollar remains the world s reserve currency we ve got a unique ability unlike other countries to finance this growing debt but i think it s dangerous to assume that the dollar is always going to be the world s reserve currency and it s not that the world needs to stop buying dollar denominated debt they just need to reduce their overweight and so a hundred basis points on that 22 trillion is a lot of money and i m worried with technology digitization digital currencies other developments we can t even envision today if that ever changes we do a lot of work at the dallas fed we ve analyzed you re not surprised every country in the world what their fiscal situation is what their rules are and how they re dealing with it and the one thing that jumps out to you there s only one country in the world that s not following you know there s rules countries about how much excess reserve foreign reserves they keep excess reserves they keep depending on they try to limit their amount of foreign debt and they try to watch their fiscal situation the only country in the world that s really not paying attention to those rules is us and the reason we re doing it is because we re the world reserve currency but we re relying awfully heavily on it and i m concerned whether it s i think it s dangerous to rely on that for the rest of indefinitely i d rather see us find ways to grow faster and obviously we re going to have to look at entitlements and other ways to moderate this debt growth and the reason i keep talking about these issues every issue we re debating policy issue is a different debate when you do it in the context of how leveraged we are the immigration debate in isolation is one debate and then when you put it in context of the need to grow and how leveraged we are you might have a different discussion and so we just like to see these issues all get put on the table and debated obviously as a central banker we only have purview over certain elements of it but i am allowed to call out these issues and that s why we do it we re worried about this buiter question over there the young lady q robyn meredith from bny mellon i wanted to go back to the laundry list of things you ve named as going wrong in the country you know we have this kind of tale of two labor forces kaplan or i call them opportunities q opportunities for improvement sure kaplan yeah how s that q ok that sounds better but all as sort of the world going the wrong way on globalization going the wrong way on productivity growth et cetera it seems to me that all of the things that are opportunities for improvement are until they re improved really widening income inequality kaplan yes q and that has an effect on so first i d like you to talk about that and then that really increases the partisanship that we have now you ve talked repeatedly as has christine lagarde and others about the need for the world not to just rely on monetary policy to solve problems kaplan right q but given the realpolitik that right now there is a lot of partisanship both in washington and in the states that seems kind of unlikely so are there some contingency plans because it seems like if we rely on monetary policy kaplan right q it will be something along the lines we ve seen before so we re going to see a further exacerbation in income inequality kaplan so if we don t it is i think it is true if we don t improve education early childhood literacy more skills training i do think i m concerned that income and wealth inequality will grow i ve been encouraged and heartened in the state i live in i m pretty optimistic a lot of these changes need to be made locally in other words in cities and in the state skills training would be a great example worker mobility is historically low but i see dallas community college el paso community college greater houston partnership they go out and interview businesses they backward integrate into curriculum either at high schools or at junior colleges and we are creating lots more skills training in the state of texas so i m optimistic it can be done we re expanding pre k in the state of texas takes money and improving teacher pay these things are not overnight or magic bullets they take they re going to take years but i think we talk about them a lot at the fed because if you to me the number one at the top of the list ways to address inequality is improve education the whole ecosystem needs to be dramatically improved and i think without it i think there will likely to be more backlash because more people are going to see again like i talked their jobs getting restructured and eliminated i ve got to tell you technology technology enabled disruption this trend is going like this the improvement in education and skills training is improving like this businesses i have no worries about businesses adapting to this trend they re doing just fine extremely rational very astute but the problem is the impact on the workforce is substantial and i think we need a lot more focus on and much more dramatic improvement in education educational attainment you know i think the last thing i study i looked at we re twenty fifth out of thirty five industrialized nations in math science and reading when did that happen i mean we lag canada by the way in literacy is in the top two or three canada ranks very highly we can get a lot better and every job that goes unfilled skilled job which we think there are over a million skilled jobs that are unfilled there s just lower gdp in the united states so those are things we can do i think infrastructure spending also would be helpful a lot of it can come from private money but yes i m cognizant of the fact these are not monetary policy issues but we can talk about them and i think part of my job you know i didn t leave the private sector to keep quiet laughs part of my job is to do monetary policy and we ve got a big research machine at the fed we do high quality work and we do it in an apolitical way and my job is to disseminate it both sides of the aisle to elected and appointed officials buiter we have a basic skills problem i mean u s pisa scores continue to be underwhelming indeed other questions the gentleman that s over there kaplan there s enough centers of excellence though in the united states that are doing this well i think we can we could do it but it s just going to take a lot more discussion of it and a lot more you know push q josh lynn from caspian capital i m just kind of curious your work or your team s work on energy kaplan yeah q in two ways one the transmission mechanism from the energy sector to the broader economy in the context of more aggressive carbon policy so the puts and takes the positives obviously being maybe cheaper carbon innovation kaplan yeah q the negatives being we make a lot of stuff to send to energy companies and energy companies are big kaplan yeah buiter and then two on more of a micro level whether you guys have done any work on the extent to which regulatory forbearance over the last three years under the new you know federal policy regime post obama kaplan yeah q has maybe masked even more difficult problems within the energy sector at the firm level just given you know what our pretty negative returns on invested capital despite a somewhat easier time to be an energy company today than three years ago so just kind of curious on the macro and the micro level on that kaplan so here s what i d say as long as global let s get to the bottom line yeah regulatory forbearance has been helpful and it s welcome to not only in this industry but other industries but if global growth is going to be sluggish this industry is going to have is going to have challenges i e i would guess just to get to the punchline somewhat higher price of oil is not going to spur more production or capex because of the trauma this industry has been through i think you re going to need to see a 10 plus what i hear from contacts meaningful increase in the price of oil before people decide they re going to try to spend more on capex that could change obviously and sentiment could change i think the irony is so our work on climate change and sustainability a lot of these energy companies and suppliers to them are working on this but the other irony is we think a huge business opportunity in the united states is sustainability we have many of the leading companies in the world we could develop many of the leading companies in the world yes would it have some effect on some of these energy companies it might but our own estimate is even if we had aggressive growth in alternatives in the united states and globally and i mean aggressive we still think by 2040 over 70 percent of global energy consumption is going to be fossil fuel related so the energy business is going to be here for a long the fossil fuel business is going to be here for a long time but we think there is an enormous business opportunity in sustainability and i mean profit making capex oriented opportunity last comment because energy is a pretty big part of business fixed investment in the united states if energy investment turns out to be down 15 percent next year it s going to be hard for business fixed investment to be a positive number next year in the united states buiter next one over there q stephen blank throughout this morning you have pushed you have talked about the need for more pushful more aggressive policies whether it s education whether it is sustainability and so on are you optimistic that in the next years we are likely to see a national government that will deliver these more pushful policies in these very necessary areas kaplan i m careful not to comment on that and i don t know is the honest answer anyhow i would say i am optimistic that locally in cities and in states there s enormous motivation to improve in these areas the problem is you have to go then state by state where are they going to fund it i know where texas is going to fund it we have population growth and we ve got plenty of money to fund it if we don t do it it will be because of choices we made there are a lot of other states whose populations are flat to down their state pension funds are underfunded and they re getting squeezed and they can t you know raise taxes to generate revenue and so they re having to make some tough choices about how they fund these priorities so in that context yes i m worried about education not getting enough funding not because people don t want to but because they are trying to struggle with how to fund it and it may be and i say this as a businessperson i say this to businesspeople everywhere i go particularly in texas but all over it probably is going to require businesses maybe to step up more and maybe play roles that we haven t historically to help fund and encourage and skills training would be the top of the list businesses naturally are already funding skills training i think we may have to do it more and go partners with state development you know workforce commissions and get these projects funded and i think many businesses i talk to are very willing and motivated to do it and so we may have to see more of that buiter ok last question q hi i m joyce chang from jpmorgan i want to bring the conversation back to the monetary policy framework kaplan yes yes q and so with all of these forces of deglobalization slower growth kaplan yeah q muted inflation at the fed s policy review would you consider moving towards a more flexible inflation averaging how can you encourage an overshoot on inflation kaplan so i ll make a couple comments on this and just for those we re going under we re undergoing a year long policy review we probably won t finish it until the middle of next year regarding inflation my own view is so we do an averaging we have an averaging of inflation right now it just happens to be twelve months it s the twelve month pce would i be averse to seeing that averaging period lengthened so that we take into account underages with overages no i d be fine with that the only thing i don t want to do in our framework is make commitments based on that analytic about what actions we re going to take in other words i think we should find new and different ways to look at inflation we should make clear and i would say publicly we should be willing to tolerate some overshoot of inflation as long as it s not persistent you know for some temporary period of time but on the other hand willingness to do that i think when you get into a situation you need to have the ability around the fomc able to make decisions and use our judgment and i wouldn t be committing to what actions we re going to take but i think you will see us talk a little bit differently about our inflation i think the other thing you will see us talk more explicitly about it financial stability we are also very aware yes we re running a hotter labor force i think there s a number of benefits that could come from getting people into the workforce and having them stay in the workforce but also that creates excesses and imbalances that we have to watch in terms of financial markets and other excesses and i think you ll see us in the framework i would like to see us more explicitly note that as one of our explicit considerations as we weigh off these options buiter ok it s left to me to thank robert kaplan kaplan thank you willem buiter for a very stimulating q a session applause kaplan thank you willem buiter thank you end
is the road clear for eco with the west african economic and monetary union agreeing with france to several changes to the cfa franc currency including a new name assistant editor bola olajuwon writes about the hurdles against the taking off of the eco currency initiative the economic community of west african states ecowas on june 29 announced the adoption of eco as its monetary currency and january 2020 as tentative date for its take off to many economic analysts the cfa franc used in two african monetary zones one for eight west african countries and the other for six mostly petro states in central africa was seen as a major hurdle against the implementation of the regional currency initiative but on saturday ivory coast s president alassane ouattara said the west african bloc inched closer to a split from french backed cfa franc currency he said the west african economic and monetary union has agreed with france to several changes to the cfa franc currency including a new name the monetary union will keep its euro peg while moving its currency reserve from france the former colonial power ouattara told reporters during a two day visit by french president emmanuel macron that france would no longer have a representative on the board of the central bank this decision shows our determination to create an integrated and dynamic regional market a source of prosperity for us and for future generations ouattara said the decision constitutes a key step in the long standing hurdles between the west african economic and monetary union and france for the countries that have used the cfa franc since independence almost 60 years ago the changes marked a significant shift the ivorian leader also flew to abuja same day where he briefed a meeting of presidents of member states of ecowas on the agreement with france president muhammadu buhari welcomed macron s decision not to oppose the creation of the new regional currency benin s president patrice talon last month called for on west africa s francophone countries to move some reserves from france to have more control over the management of their currency psychologically with regards to the vision of sovereignty and managing your own money it s not good that this model continues talon said moving closer to the dream of integration the authority of ecowas heads of state and government at their meeting in abuja on june 29 moved closer to the dream of integration as espoused by the organisation s founding fathers the leaders in a communiqué read by nigeria s permanent secretary ministry of foreign affairs mr mustapha suleiman at their 55th ordinary session adopted eco as the name of the sub region s single currency to be issued in january it came after the implementation of the single currency was postponed several times since 2003 they instructed the ecowas commission to work in collaboration with west african monetary agency west african monetary institute wami and member states central banks to accelerate the implementation of the revised roadmap on the symbol of the single currency the communique directed the commission to ensure implementation of the recommendations of the meeting of the ministerial committee held in abidjan on june 17 and june 18 as well as preparation and implementation of the communication strategy for the single currency programme the authority takes note of the 2018 macroeconomic convergence report it noted the worsening of the macroeconomic convergence and urged member states to do more to improve on their performance in view of the imminent deadline it added a crawling baby the goal of ecowas leaders is to merge the new currency with the west african cfa franc a currency used by the french speaking members of ecowas since 1945 the common currency was proposed to be introduced in the west african monetary zone wamz countries the gambia ghana guinea conakry a french speaking which does not use the cfa franc liberia nigeria and sierra leone it will then flow into the whole of ecowas countries the eco was first planned to be introduced in 2003 but this was postponed several times to 2005 2010 and then 2014 at a meeting of the convergence council of ministers and governors of west africa on may 25 2009 the start of the currency was rescheduled to 2015 due to international economic crisis the december 2009 meeting also established a plan to begin work to merge the eco with the cfa franc immediately upon the launch of the eco this was planned to be achieved by next month in 2001 wami was set up with headquarters in accra ghana it is to be an interim organisation in preparation for the future west african central bank its function and organisation are inspired by the european monetary institute thus wami is to provide a framework for central banks in the wamz to start the integration and begin preliminary preparations for the printing and minting of the physical money can the revived dream fly loft as the dream of the single monetary currency may be its implementation is doubtful if available reports are anything to go by the first hurdle confronting ecowas members states is meeting the 10 convergence criteria for implementing the eco monetary unit as set by wami wami divided the criteria into four primary and six secondary criteria surprisingly only ghana has up to the fiscal year 2011 been able to meet all the primary criteria in any single fiscal year the four primary criteria to be achieved by each member country are a single digit inflation rate at the end of each year a fiscal deficit of no more than 4 of the gdp a central bank deficit financing of no more than 10 of the previous year s tax revenues and gross external reserves that can give import cover for a minimum of three months the six secondary criteria to be achieved by each member country include prohibition of new domestic default payments and liquidation of existing ones tax revenue should be equal to or greater than 20 per cent of the gdp wage bill to tax revenue equal to or less than 35 per cent public investment to tax revenue equal to or greater than 20 per cent a stable real exchange rate and positive real interest rate according to available records assessments of member countries efforts to meet the criteria are very bleak the performance scorecard presented at the 2012 annual statutory meetings of the wamz showed that gdp growth was projected to decline to 6 9 in 2012 from 8 7 in 2011 the convergence scale of the whole wamz area was also projected to go down from a score of 79 2 in 2011 to 62 5 in 2012 as no member met all the convergence criteria the average annual inflation rate also increased from 11 6 in 2011 to 12 6 in 2012 the average inflation rate in 2019 is put at 8 38 for 2020 it s envisaged to be 8 04 in a reaction to these indicators director of multilateral surveillance ecowas commission lassane kabore described the performance as dismal but charlie robertson chief global economist at renaissance capital was quoted as saying in a report that only five countries cape verde ivory coast guinea senegal and togo of the region s 15 countries presently meet the single currency s criteria of a budget deficit not higher than 4 and inflation rates of not more than 5 but kabore affirmed the commitment of his commission to the establishment of the eco on february 23 2018 an economist jean joseph boillot said no serious work on the technical aspects of this implementation has been undertaken either at the university level or the state level low trading among ecowas member states it is often said that countries that trade together grow together but this is not the case of ecowas the countries have the same international passport with assigning countries indicated on the back of the booklet this has been lauded in the international circle as a major landmark but still ecowas is the least integrated region in the world in terms of cross border trade a report by the borderless alliance group said according to the report the non application of ecowas directives relating to the free movement of goods and people ecowas trade liberalisation scheme etls and the common external tariff cet are some of the factors responsible for the low level of trade integration in the region goods have been moving but with a lot of restrictions and undermining rules created by countries in violation of the ecowas agreement which allows movement without tariffs and duties experts pointed out that local manufacturing among ecowas states is very low about 92 per cent of the goods traded in the region are foreign and imported to the countries only nigeria has a higher local production volume according to a journalist and executive director of the afri china media centre lagos ikenna emewu there is also the problem of confidence building between members states investors in nigeria have had terrible times in the hands of ghanaian officials because of the need to protect the market in ghana nigerian traders are also experiencing other challenges in ghana for instance the continued deportation of some nigerians from ghana on allegations of cybercrime prostitution and illegal stay as well as the use of domestic policies to stifle business owners in parts of ghana have been cited as discouraging to the implementation of the economic integration agenda most members states would rather prefer goods from outside the region and would mount obstacles to stop the domestic goods from the members states market emewu said fewer restrictions have been placed on goods from asia europe and america a clarion call for more trade among ecowas countries it is envisaged that the african continental free trade area agreement afcfta described by the united nations as a potential game changer that could create the world s largest free trade area of 55 countries will help afcfta is predicted to create a single market with a combined gdp of 2 5trn and 1 2 billion consumers it goes beyond the scope of existing trade agreements on the continent aiming to create a continent wide single market in goods and services free movement of people and investment and eventually a customs union with a common external tariff advocates of afcfta believe that the trade deal will help to address africa s economic challenges and allow for the greater prosperous flow of trade within the continent they argued that ecowas will benefit from the ripple effect the african development bank group urged countries on the continent and ecowas especially to break down all barriers to trade and investment the bank s president akinwumi adesina made the call at the opening ceremony of the 54th annual meeting of the lender in malabo equatorial guinea adesina also urged countries to accelerate regional integration close of borders by nigeria in august just three months after celebrating its signing the afcfta nigeria under what is called border drill ban the movement of all goods from countries with which it shares a land border benin niger and cameroon nigerian officials argued that the primary objective was to curb smuggling of goods such as rice tomatoes and poultry to bolster nigeria s agricultural sector it was also argued that it was designed to strengthen security along the borders but analysts said the border drill will affect afcfta when it finally took off eco take off to be changed the january proposed take off date for the commencement of eco may not be realised as many countries within the region had yet to meet the convergence criteria for the monetary union according to the minister of finance budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed who confirmed the development in abuja she said only togo had met all the convergence criteria within the last two years for the monetary union mrs zainab ahmed who spoke on friday at the opening session of a meeting of ecowas ministers of finances and governors of central banks on the ecowas single currency programme the minister said the inability of other countries in the sub region to achieve the criteria would make the operationalisation of the eco currency in 2020 problematic she said there was a need for member states to pursue appropriate policies and structural reforms that would enable them to meet the convergence criteria this meeting is important because we are at a crossroads the recommendations we make will have significant implications on the monetary policies we undertake can political will help but ecowas chairman president issoufou mahamadou insisted that the single currency will be issued in january we have not changed that but we will continue with assessment between now and then we are of the view that ready countries will launch the single currency and countries that are not yet ready will join the programme as they comply with all six convergence criteria mahamadou said he also said there was a real firm political will for the region to hastily achieve the single currency experts said they are waiting to see the walking of the talk by next month but when it was expected most issoufou at the end of the bloc s meeting at the weekend rather called on member states to take decisive steps in tackling terrorism in their countries instead of pronouncing the ecowas decision in respect of eco currency take off thus adding to the assertion that the currency initiative may not fly next month

pessimists may find little evidence again to flesh out their ill informed and misleading claims on the economy in their eyes doom and gloom seemed the only possible scenario for china amid trade disputes and mounting external uncertainties to their surprise or dismay resilience and vigor of the chinese economy have proved quite the opposite here is a fact check on how at least six false claims about china s economy have fallen apart this year natural slowdown or bleak growth some scare mongers have long tried to sell the message of a hard landing of the chinese economy whose resilient growth this year made this theory all the more flimsy china s gdp expanded 6 2 percent year on year in the first three quarters of 2019 data from the national bureau of statistics nbs showed the growth in line with the government s annual target of 6 6 5 percent set for 2019 still outpaces other major economies including the united states japan germany india the slowdown rather than a steep fall is to be expected and not surprising or alarming in any sense as the economy is moving along an expected natural path of maturing growth following its unprecedented growth pace over four decades said ahmed saeed vice president of the asian development bank global ratings agency fitch in november maintained its a credit rating on china affirming its stable growth outlook supported by the country s robust external finances and strong macroeconomic performance stable job market or employment crisis navigating through headwinds china has delivered robust job gains with a stable unemployment rate instead of massive lay offs like some naysayers suggested nbs data showed that 12 79 million new urban jobs were created in the first 11 months this year exceeding the annual goal of creating more than 11 million new jobs as china s economic structure has shifted from an industry led one to a service led one the growing service sector new business models and multiple support policies are also generating more opportunities every percentage point growth of the country s economy can be translated into around 2 million new jobs said liu aihua spokesperson of the nbs adding that the job market is kept stable as steady economic growth structural adjustments and entrepreneurial innovation continue apace made in china boom or gloom in another sign of economic resilience made in china continued to display dynamism in spite of increased downward pressure nbs data showed that the purchasing managers index for china s manufacturing sector re entered the expansion zone by firming up to 50 2 in november from 49 3 in october analysts suggested that china as the only country that possesses all the industrial categories in the united nations industrial classification has the competitive edge of a complete and efficient supply chain as the country continued its structural shift to quality oriented growth high tech manufacturing has also been forging ahead with an output increase of 8 9 percent in november and investment surging 14 8 percent year on year in the first 11 months of the year far outpacing the manufacturing sector s average growth of 2 5 percent

published tuesday 24 december 2019 print disqus joseph t salerno the flood of obituaries that noted the passing of paul volcker 1927 2019 last week have almost all lauded his achievement as fed chair 1979 1987 in reining in the double digit inflation that ravaged the us economy during the 1970s volcker was referred to as the former fed chairman who fought inflation here inflation tamer and a full fledged inflation warrior here and the fed chairman who waged war on inflation and led the federal reserve s brute force campaign to subdue inflation here mr volcker certainly deserves credit for curbing the great inflation of the 1970s however he also merits a lion s share of the blame for unleashing the great inflation on the us and the world economy in the first place for it was mr volcker who masterminded the program that president nixon announced on august 15 1971 which unilaterally suspended gold convertibility of us dollars held by foreign governments and central banks imposed a fascist wage price freeze on the us economy and slapped a 10 percent surcharge on foreign imports tragically by severing the last link between the dollar and gold volcker s program scuttled the last chance of restoring a genuine gold standard more than two years before nixon slammed down the gold window volcker the recently appointed undersecretary of the treasury for monetary affairs gave an oral presentation to nixon and his closest advisors on us balance of payments problems the presentation was based on a memo that the secret volcker group initiated by henry kissinger spent five months preparing among other things volcker recommended a continuation of capital controls to prop up the inflated dollar s overvalued exchange rate and a massive appreciation or revaluation of the currencies of less inflationary countries such as west germany placing the burden of adjustment to unrestrained us inflation on these countries volcker then planted the time bomb that would eventually detonate and seal the fate of the gold standard he suggested to nixon that if these measures did not work to sustain the pseudo gold standard of the bretton woods system a run on the us gold stock could only be avoided by unilaterally repudiating the postwar us pledge to convert foreign official dollar holdings into gold unfortunately the volcker group report summarily dismissed the alternative of raising possibly doubling the dollar price of gold i e devaluing the dollar which would have increased the value of the us gold stock and facilitated the restoration of a genuine gold standard only a real gold standard could have halted and reversed the slow motion collapse that the international monetary system had been undergoing since the mid 1960s due to large and persistent us payments deficits driven by profligate dollar creation volcker however hated and wanted to get rid of the last vestiges of the gold standard and replace it with a fixed exchange rate system dominated by the us fiat dollar to further enhance the power and prestige of the us in international affairs according to volcker the stability and strength of our currency was important to sustaining the broad role of the united states in the world years later volcker revealed i have never been able to shake the feeling that a strong currency is generally a good thing and that it is typically a sign of vigor and strength and competitiveness one of his biographers intimated that volcker s longstanding regret at having been rejected for military service during world war ii because of his height was at the root of his single minded determination to maintain the supremacy of the american dollar as the world s premier currency indeed volcker struggled mightily to make the dollar appear strong even while rampant money printing to finance great society welfare programs and the vietnam war inexorably weakened it but volcker bitterly opposed raising the price of gold because he feared that open devaluation of the inflated dollar would not only diminish the status and reputation of the us but also reward people and countries he detested namely speculators in gold and gold producing countries such as the soviet union and south africa he especially loathed and wanted to punish president charles de gaulle and the french for embarrassing and discrediting the us by withdrawing from nato and exposing the weakness of the dollar by insisting on converting their dollars into gold in the face of us threats to remove military protection against the soviet union to add insult to injury de gaulle had sent naval ships to retrieve french gold when a full blown run on us gold stock appeared imminent in early 1971 volcker prepared a memorandum for the new treasury secretary former texas governor and master political operative john connally the memo contained three main proposals first countries with less inflationary monetary policies and therefore balance of payments surpluses such as west germany and japan would be imposed upon to substantially appreciate the value of their currencies thereby encouraging us exports and stifling its imports while sparing the it the embarrassment of openly devaluing the dollar second volcker recommended a preemptive strike against gold in the form of a cold blooded suspension of gold convertibility volcker s final proposal was a temporary wage price freeze as one of volcker s biographers characterized his motivation e wanted america to act preemptively to avoid appearance of defeat at the hands of currency speculators emphasis added secretary connally bought into volcker s program when a severe dollar crisis struck a few months later he used all his substantial political wiles to persuade nixon of the merits of the volcker plan then fed chairman and nixon advisor arthur burns for all his erroneous monetary ideas and policy failures was convinced that gold should play at least nominally a central role in the international monetary system in fact fter nixon took office burns proposed to end the balance of payments problem by increasing the official price of gold which would have effectively devalue the dollar in burns s view this would maintain gold as the anchor of a fixed exchange rate system an outcome that volcker would have detested not surprisingly burns was troubled by volcker who he thought had given a stupid reply to nixon about raising the price of gold burns also recognized and bemoaned volcker s influence over connally somehow poor and wretched volcker never knowing where he stood on any issue had succeeded in instilling an irrational fear of gold in his tyrannical master whom he tried constantly to please by catering to his hatred of foreigners particularly the french unfortunately burns had badly underestimated volcker and had mistaken his tact and strategic compromising for vacillation and indecisiveness as his biographer noted volcker admired john connally s social skills and had learned much from the master politician he preferred to equivocate qualify and risk being branded a poor communicator rather than feign certainty in the end the wily connally volcker axis prevailed over the politically na ve burns burns s biographer clearly recognized volcker s political cunning in winning over nixon the president decided against burns paul volcker convinced him that suspension was inevitable and that delay would only create financial chaos perhaps more important nixon realized if he announced the move as part of a new economic package he would appear to be acting decisively to take charge of the crisis making as volcker put it the devaluation of the dollar into a political triumph which was no mean feat thus it was that volcker s memo was used as the basis of the new economic policy that was hammered out by nixon and his advisors including volcker at camp david and announced in nixon s fateful sunday address to the nation one obituarist listed volcker s great public accomplishments thusly he was the point man at the treasury department in 1971 who managed the dollar s untethering from gold he quelled the double digit inflation that took root in the u s in the late 1970s he helped guide the country s response to the 2008 financial crisis unfortunately this list grossly overstates volcker s public accomplishments because it does not reveal the causal connection between his vanquishing the last remnants of the gold standard and the ensuing inflation of the fiat dollar whose supply was then subject solely to the decisions of bureaucrats eagerly

the impeachment process was a nauseating display of moral hypocrisy the sound bites by republicans and democrats swiftly became predictable the democrats despite applauding the announcement of the voting results before being quickly silenced by house speaker nancy pelosi sought to cloak themselves in gravitas and solemnity pelosi s calculated decision to open the impeachment proceedings with the 1954 under god version of the pledge of allegiance was an appropriate signal given the party s new mccarthyism the democrats posited themselves as saviors the last line of defense between a constitutional democracy and tyranny the republicans as cloyingly sanctimonious as the democrats offered up ludicrous analogies to attack what they condemned as a show trial including rep barry loudermilk s statement that pontius pilate afforded more rights to jesus than the democrats have afforded to this president the republicans shamelessly prostrated themselves throughout the 10 hour process at the feet of their cult leader donald trump offering abject and eternal fealty they angrily accused the democrats of seeking to overturn the 2016 election in a legislative coup it was a mind numbing spectacle devoid of morality and ethics the kind of political theater that characterizes despotic regimes no one in the house chamber was protecting the constitution no one was seeking to hold accountable those who had violated it no one was fighting to restore the rule of law the two parties which have shredded constitutional protections and rights and sold the political process to the highest bidders have engaged in egregious constitutional violations for years and ignored them when they were made public moral stances have a cost but almost no one in congress seems willing to pay trying to tar trump as a russian agent failed now the democrats hope to discredit him with charges of abuse of power and contempt of congress the politicization of the impeachment process has only exacerbated the antagonisms and polarization in the country it has ironically increased support for trump who in this toxic environment may well be reelected his approval rating has jumped to 45 percent up from 39 percent when the impeachment inquiry was launched according to the latest gallup survey conducted from dec 2 to dec 15 this is the third consecutive increase in trump s approval rating among republicans trump has a job approval rating of 89 almost nine in 10 in the gop fifty one percent of americans oppose impeachment and removal up five percentage points since the house inquiry began gallup reports yes trump s contempt of congress and attempt to get volodymyr zelensky the ukrainian president to open an investigation of joe biden and his son hunter in exchange for almost 400 million in u s military aid and allowing zelensky to visit the white house are impeachable offenses but trivial and minor ones compared with the constitutional violations that the two parties have institutionalized and i fear made permanent these sustained bipartisan constitutional violations not trump resulted in the failure of our democracy trump is the pus coming out of the wound if the democrats and the republicans were committed to defending the constitution why didn t they impeach george w bush when he launched two illegal wars that were never declared by congress as demanded by the constitution why didn t they impeach bush when he authorized placing the entire u s public under government surveillance in direct violation of the fourth amendment why didn t they impeach bush when he authorized torture along with kidnapping terrorist suspects around the world and holding them for years in our black sites and offshore penal colonies why didn t they impeach barack obama when he expanded these illegal wars to 11 if we count yemen why didn t they impeach obama when edward snowden revealed that our intelligence agencies are monitoring and spying on almost every citizen and downloading our data and metrics into government computers where they will be stored for perpetuity why didn t they impeach obama when he misused the 2002 authorization for use of military force to erase due process and give the executive branch of government the right to act as judge jury and executioner in assassinating u s citizens starting with the radical cleric anwar al awlaki and two weeks later his 16 year old son why didn t they impeach obama when he signed into law section 1021 of the national defense authorization act in effect overturning the 1878 posse comitatus act which prohibits the use of the military as a domestic police force there are other bipartisan constitutional violations including violating treaty clauses that are supposed to be ratified by the senate violating the constitution by making appointments without seeking senate confirmation and the routine abusive use of executive orders but the two major political parties salivating at the thought of wielding the king like power that now comes with the presidency have no desire to curb these far more dangerous violations the selective use of the two violations to impeach trump is a weaponization of the impeachment process should the democrats take control of the white house and the republicans control of the congress impeachment with or without merit will become another form of political pressure exerted within our dysfunctional and divided political system the rule of law will be a pretense as in the current process of impeachment and senate trial the impeachment circus which will culminate in a preordained choreographed and televised show in the senate coincided with the washington post s release of what is being called the afghanistan papers the post through a three year legal battle obtained more than 2 000 pages of internal government documents about the war the papers detail bipartisan lies fraud deceit corruption waste and gross mismanagement during the 18 year conflict the longest in u s history it is a blistering indictment of the ruling class which as the papers note since 2001 has seen the defense department state department and u s agency for international development spend or win appropriation of between 934 billion and 978 billion according to an inflation adjusted estimate calculated by neta crawford a political science professor and co director of the costs of war project at brown university these figures the post adds do not include money spent by other agencies such as the cia and the department of veterans affairs which is responsible for medical care for wounded veterans this window into the inner workings of our bankrupt ruling elite responsible for widespread destruction and the loss of tens perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives in afghanistan was largely ignored by the media during the impeachment proceedings neither political party and none of their courtiers on the cable news shows is interested in exposing the bipartisan failure lying and grotesque incompetence on the part of the united states in the years it has occupied afghanistan afghan and u s officials concede that the taliban is stronger now than at any other time since the 2001 invasion in a functioning democracy the publication of the afghanistan papers would see generals and politicians who knowingly deceived the public hauled before congressional committees the fulbright hearings during the vietnam war although they did not lead to prosecutions at least aggressively held u s officials to account and made public their duplicity and failure but in the wake of the new disclosures no one in either political party or the military will be held accountable for the debacle in afghanistan a conflict that saw a vast waste of resources including nearly a trillion dollars that could have been used to address our pronounced social inequality rebuild our decaying infrastructure and help end our reliance on fossil fuels the afghanistan papers lay bare a truth the hyperventilating republican and democratic mandarins in congress prefer to mask on all the major structural issues war the economy the use of militarized police and the world s largest prison system for social control the infusion of corporate money to deform the electoral and legislative processes slashing taxes for the wealthy and corporations exploitative trade deals austerity the climate emergency and the rapidly accelerating government debt there is little or no difference between the republicans and the democrats the political clashes are not substantive despite what we heard in the impeachment hearings they are rhetorical and largely inconsequential the republicans and the democrats recently passed a 738 billion defense bill for fiscal year 2020 a 21 billion increase over what was enacted for fiscal year 2019 the vote was a lopsided 377 to 48 the u s spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined also a day after the impeachment of president trump the republicans and democrats in the house passed a thinly veiled rewrite of the clinton administration s north american free trade agreement nafta the 25 year old free trade agreement that hollowed out our manufacturing centers and sent u s jobs and production to mexico again the vote was lopsided 385 to 41 when the wealthy and our corporate masters want something done it gets done our elected officials serve them not us we are to be controlled the republican and democratic politicians like the generals government bureaucrats and intelligence chiefs once they leave their government posts will be generously rewarded by being given jobs as lobbyists and consultants or being appointed to corporate boards these politicians are the mutant products of our system of legalized bribery shameless kleptocrats the only interests they serve are their own this truth binds half the country to trump who although a con artist and himself flagrantly corrupt at least belittles and mocks the ruling elites who have betrayed us trump and his supporters are not wrong in condemning the deep state the generals bankers corporatists lobbyists intelligence chiefs government bureaucrats and technocrats who oversee domestic and international policy no matter who is in power the afghanistan papers while detailing the quagmire in afghanistan where more than 775 000 americans were deployed over the 18 years more than 2 300 soldiers and marines killed and more than 20 000 wounded also illustrate how seamlessly the two ruling parties and the deep state work together what did we get for this 1 trillion effort was it worth 1 trillion jeffrey eggers a retired navy seal and white house staffer for bush and obama is quoted as saying by the washington post after the killing of osama bin laden i said that osama was probably laughing in his watery grave considering how much we have spent on afghanistan the post writes the documents also contradict a long chorus of public statements from u s presidents military commanders and diplomats who assured americans year after year that they were making progress in afghanistan and the war was worth fighting several of those interviewed described explicit and sustained efforts by the u s government to deliberately mislead the public they said it was common at military headquarters in kabul and at the white house to distort statistics to make it appear the united states was winning the war when that was not the case as commanders in chief bush obama and trump all promised the public the same thing the post notes they would avoid falling into the trap of nation building in afghanistan on that score the presidents failed miserably the united states has allocated more than 133 billion to build up afghanistan more than it spent adjusted for inflation to revive the whole of western europe with the marshall plan after world war ii there is no difference the afghanistan papers make clear in the mendacity and incompetence of the policymaking apparatus no matter who controls congress or the white house no party or elected official dares defy the military industrial complex or other titans of the deep state the democrats through impeachment have no intention of restoring constitutional rights that would curb the power of the deep state and protect democracy the deep state funds them it sustains them in office the democrats are seeking to replace the inept and vulgar face of empire that is trump with the benign and decorous face of empire that is joe biden what the democrats and the deep state that has allied itself with the democratic party object to is the mask not what is behind it if you doubt me read the six part series on

us officials have repeatedly accused china of engaging in debt trap diplomacy swamping poor countries with so much debt that they cannot repay their loans and surrender control of strategic assets to beijing these criticisms have been made publicly by some of the most senior figures in the trump administration including vice president mike pence and secretary of state mike pompeo alice wells the senior official responsible for south asia at the us state department chimed in during a recent event at the wilson center on the china pakistan economic corridor wells claimed in response to an audience question that the us was concerned about chinese projects that don t have an economic basis and that lead to countries ceding sovereignty but there are almost no such projects debt trap diplomacy is little more than a fantasy since the term was first coined in 2017 various studies have shown that china is not trying to seize strategic infrastructure by crippling poor countries with unsustainable loans while chinese lending has certainly contributed to debt overload in some economies it is not the driving force behind their problems the example most commonly cited including by wells is that of sri lanka s hambantota port which was leased to a chinese state owned company but chinese lending only accounted for around 10 percent of the country s external debt in 2017 and a host of domestic economic problems including protectionism and weak exports did more than china to bring about sri lanka s malaise even if hambantota did count as an example of debt trap diplomacy it appears to be a one off of more than 3 000 chinese backed projects tracked by various researchers hambantota is the lone case of asset seizure donghyun park an economist at the asian development bank told me in a recent interview that it was the only example of china seizing strategic assets in this way other data shows that asset seizures are the exception not the rule the rhodium group catalogued 40 chinese loan renegotiations in most instances china extended loan terms or wrote off the debt the researchers determined that asset seizures were very rare other than hambantota the only example they could find was an apparent land seizure in tajikistan referenced by wells but the details of that case are murky as the authors of the rhodium study write china s leverage in debt renegotiations is often exaggerated and many of the examples in their study involved an outcome in favour of the borrower not the supposedly predatory chinese lender indeed the center for global development tracked chinese lending from 2000 to 2017 and found more than 80 instances of debt relief looking at specific regions it is far from clear that china is intentionally driving poor countries into debt in africa china is now the largest foreign creditor in a number of countries assessed by the imf to be at risk of debt distress but as deborah brautigam of johns hopkins university writes china holds half or more of the foreign debt in only three of the 17 countries identified by the fund likewise in latin america data compiled by boston university shows that chinese lending has not driven countries except possibly venezuela over the debt sustainability threshold and in the pacific a new study by the lowy institute determined that china has not been the primary driver behind rising debt risks according to the authors the evidence to date suggests china has not been engaged in deliberate debt trap diplomacy in the pacific in south asia pakistan is currently undergoing a balance of payments crisis but while chinese lending and imports under the china pakistan economic corridor cpec have clearly exacerbated pakistan s problems beijing is not primarily to blame pakistan s over reliance on imported energy its low tax revenues and general economic mismanagement have done more than china to send it over the cliff edge proponents of debt trap diplomacy suggest that china s geostrategic interests are served when its partners struggle with debt economic crises allow beijing to pounce seize assets and amplify its political influence but the evidence points in the opposite direction far from boosting china s global power heavily indebted recipients of chinese largesse are a clear liability for beijing look at pakistan china has had to slow down its flagship cpec initiative there and provide emergency financing to fend off economic catastrophe pakistan has been forced to approach the imf for yet another bailout exposing china s loans and investments to scrutiny and increasing washington s leverage over islamabad as the us is a majority shareholder in the imf this is no gain for beijing but a massive headache venezuela is another example china lent huge amounts of money to the government in return for oil imports however venezuela s economy collapsed and it could no longer provide enough oil to pay its bills this undermined china s interests by reducing its energy supplies and driving up global oil prices adding to the country s already enormous import bill the debt trap diplomacy narrative implies wrongly that china is forcing its loans on passive and helpless developing countries but nations like sri lanka enthusiastically embraced china s lending and are in many ways masters of their own misfortune and others such as malaysia have proven themselves to be more than capable of standing up to beijing and demanding changes to belt and road initiatives bri projects even if china wanted to seize assets from debt ridden countries it has limited ability to do so take the example of ukraine which agreed to repay its loans to china via grain shipments when it failed to provide enough grain beijing had to resolve the matter through international arbitration seizing a foreign country s assets is easier said than done even for a superpower like china the bri is actually more disorganised than proponents of the debt trap diplomacy thesis like to imagine far from being a grand systematic plan to take over the world the initiative is in fact rather chaotic a 2018 study by csis tracked bri activity and found that it did not align with the government s proposals many projects fell outside the six economic corridors described by chinese officials beijing is trying to impose some order by drawing up an official list of bri projects it is also conscious of the need to rein in debt at the 2019 belt and road forum president xi said that china should ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects there are already signs of caution with loans being withheld from some heavily indebted countries moreover beijing has signed up to g20 guidelines on financing and infrastructure investment and its ministry of finance recently introduced a new debt sustainability framework for the belt and road this is not what you would expect if china was trying to overwhelm weak countries with debt of course there is more work to be done beijing could join the paris club of official creditors and its financial institutions could adopt formal lending rules like the multilateral development banks the us should engage with china to encourage further reform not inflame tensions by making baseless accusations

in 1960 cuba and hong kong had a similar level of gdp per capita at around 4 500 in today s money by 2018 cuba s gdp per capita had risen to around 9 000 by contrast hong kong had reached 64 000 per capita a similar level to the us and switzerland over 60 years cuba had doubled its economic prosperity where hong kong had achieved a 14 fold increase in the early 1960s hong kong and cuba faced a choice each government needed to determine what economic policies to pursue whilst they broadly voiced the same objectives to improve living standards manage unemployment and develop their economies they would end up following very different solutions and helpfully for those interested in the results of economic policy they would largely remain true to their choices for the following six decades in cuba the crony capitalist regime of fulgencio batista was overthrown by an alliance headed by fidel castro on 1 january 1959 castro had communicated little by way of an economic agenda other than a commitment some years earlier to land reform when he took control he appointed a liberal president and prime minister even six months after the revolution in july 1959 the one certainty castro asserted was i am not a communist and neither is the revolutionary movement but being a consummate politician castro knew that he could not leave a policy vacuum his land reform agenda would need to be followed by a more active agenda than the coalition government was likely to develop to create his economic plan he turned to an unlikely source his deputy in the revolutionary army che guevara meanwhile hong kong was also questioning what economic direction to take hong kong had made a surprisingly rapid recovery from the desolation of wartime japanese occupation the entrepôt trade with china had bounced back only to be decimated by us sanctions on china during the korean war remarkably a nascent textile industry founded by entrepreneurs fleeing communist china emerged taking up the slack soon spindles were spinning yarns looms were weaving cloth dyes were colouring fabric and needle workers were sewing garments a wave of competitively priced textiles hit the us and uk markets and although prime minister macmillan and president kennedy championed free trade in general in practice they tried to protect their decaying domestic industries in 1960 arthur clarke the financial secretary the equivalent of finance minister argued hong kong could continue until markets were closed to exporters or we can do something to plan our economy abandon laissez faire and move to regulation and control since he was retiring he left the decision to his successor john cowperthwaite these two men che guevara and john cowperthwaite would be the architects of a great natural economic experiment most people today think of che guevara as a revolutionary who fought against capitalism authoritarianism and us imperialism less well known is that guevara was central to the creation of cuba s economic policy in the early 1960s policies that remain largely unchanged he ran the land reform programme was president of the national bank of cuba minister of industry member of the national directorate for the economy member of the council of ministers and chief negotiator with the soviet bloc guevara would steer castro and cuba towards a marxist economy he led the collectivisation and nationalisation of agriculture nationalised virtually all industrial and commercial activity introduced central planning established price controls and rationing replaced the currency and seized most savings set the wage levels of all jobs set industrial policy and investment and controlled all foreign exchange and bartered with russia china and other communist countries cowperthwaite spent much of his first year as financial secretary persuading the us and the uk to remain open to imports from hong kong he then turned to the question posed by his predecessor many including the government and civil service in london were keen that hong kong follow the emerging uk consensus of industrial planning keynesian deficits nationalisation activist economic policies high inflation high levels of government spending and high taxation how much of this emerging global consensus did cowperthwaite and his colleagues adopt virtually nothing cowperthwaite defended the free market laissez faire free trade low taxation privately owned model where firms risking their own money decided where to invest and which industries to liquidate the sunday times would note that it was one of those glorious accidents that a man unversed in the 20th century s fad for socialism could apply his 18th century ideas in a territory unencumbered with democracy governors came and went but cowperthwaite kept balancing budgets lowering taxes and keeping markets open including the market in immigrants the times 3 february 2006 friedman 1953 noted that we must rely on evidence cast by the experiments that happen to occur milton friedman 1953 introduction and a key feature of this comparison between hong kong and cuba is its longevity and stability of policy in part due in each case to the lack of democracy and whilst natural experiments are never perfectly controlled so that no single natural experiment can be viewed as dispositive the constancy of policy stance has been matched by a remarkable and consistent difference in outcome anyone interested in the link between economic policy and prosperity will find lessons as to what worked in this period in hong kong and equally powerful lessons as to why cuba has failed to deliver affluence for its people with the rise of self employment in cuba and the troubles in hong kong this important natural experiment may be coming to an end but its lessons will remain valid whatever the future holds for the people of cuba and of hong kong neil monnery studied at exeter college oxford and at the harvard business school between 1983

by nouriel roubini new york financial markets were cheered recently by the news that the united states and china have reached a phase one deal to prevent further escalation of their bilateral trade war but there is actually very little to cheer about in exchange for china s tentative commitment to buy more us agricultural and some other goods and modest concessions on intellectual property rights and the renminbi the us agreed to withhold tariffs on another 160 billion worth of chinese exports and to roll back some of the tariffs introduced on september 1 the good news for investors is that the deal averted a new round of tariffs that could have tipped the us and the global economy into recession and crashed global stock markets the bad news is that it represents just another temporary truce amid a much larger strategic rivalry encompassing trade technology investment currency and geopolitical issues large scale tariffs will remain in place and escalation may well resume if either side shirks its commitments as a result a broad sino american decoupling will likely intensify over time and is all but certain in the technology sector the us regards china s quest to achieve autonomy and then supremacy in cutting edge technologies including artificial intelligence 5g robotics automation biotech and autonomous vehicles as a threat to its economic and national security following its blacklisting of huawei a 5g leader and other chinese tech firms the us will continue to try to contain the growth of china s tech industry cross border flows of data and information will also be restricted raising concerns about a splinternet between the us and china and owing to increase us scrutiny chinese foreign direct investment in america has already collapsed by 80 per cent from its 2017 level now new legislative proposals threaten to bar us public pension funds from investing in chinese firms restrict chinese venture capital investments in the us and force some chinese firms to delist from us stock exchanges altogether the us has also grown more suspicious of us based chinese students and scholars who may be in a position to steal us technological know how or engage in outright espionage and china for its part will increasingly seek to circumvent the us controlled international financial system and to shield itself from america s weaponisation of the dollar to that end china could be planning to launch a sovereign digital currency or an alternative to the western controlled society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift cross border payments system it also may try to internationalise the role of alipay and wechat pay sophisticated digital payments platforms that have already replaced most cash transactions within china in all of these dimensions recent developments suggest a broader shift in the sino american relationship towards de globalisation economic and financial fragmentation and balkanisation of supply chains the 2017 white house national security strategy and the 2018 us national defence strategy regard china as a strategic competitor that must be contained security tensions between the two are brewing all over asia from hong kong and taiwan to the east and south china seas the us fears that chinese president xi jinping having abandoned his predecessor deng xiaoping s advice to hide your strength and bide your time has embarked on a strategy of aggressive expansionism china meanwhile fears that the us is trying to contain its rise and deny its legitimate security concerns in asia it remains to be seen how the rivalry will evolve unfettered strategic competition would almost certainly lead eventually from an escalating cold war to a hot war with disastrous implications for the world what is clear is the hollowness of the old western consensus according to which admitting china into the world trade organisation and accommodating its rise would compel it to become a more open society with a freer and fairer economy but under xi china has created an orwellian surveillance state and doubled down on a form of state capitalism that is inconsistent with the principles of free and fair trade and it is now using its growing wealth to flex its military muscles and exercise influence across asia and around the world the question then is whether there are sensible alternatives to an escalating cold war some western commentators such as former australian prime minister kevin rudd advocate a managed strategic competition others speak of a sino american relationship built around coopetition likewise cnn s fareed zakaria recommends that the us pursue both engagement and deterrence vis à vis china these are all variants of the same idea the sino american relationship should involve cooperation in some areas especially where global public goods such as the climate and international trade and finance are involved while accepting that there will be constructive competition in others the problem of course is us president donald trump who does not seem to understand that managed strategic competition with china requires good faith engagement and cooperation with other countries to succeed the us needs to work closely with its allies and partners to bring its open society open economy model into the twenty first century the west may not like china s authoritarian state capitalism but it must get its own house in order western countries need to enact economic reforms to reduce inequality and prevent damaging financial crises as well as political reforms to contain the populist backlash against globalisation while still upholding the rule of law unfortunately the current us administration lacks any such strategic vision the protectionist unilateralist illiberal trump apparently prefers to antagonise us friends and allies leaving the west divided and ill equipped to defend and reform the liberal world order that it created the chinese probably prefer that trump be reelected in 2020 he may be a nuisance in the short run but given enough time in office he will destroy the strategic alliances that form the foundation of american soft

thirty years ago india endured its last big financial crisis when it had to send gold held in the central banks vaults over to london to borrow hard currency from the bank of england luckily the flights landed safely and so did india the turnaround in economic thinking triggered by that balance of payments humiliation saw the state shed controls on production and imports the emergence of a globally attuned software services industry as well as vibrant capital markets which india opened up to the world faster than china helped spawn entrepreneurship and create a middle class hundreds of millions were lifted out of poverty the 1990 91 crisis became the starting point of two decades of rising prosperity all that progress is now at risk because of a very different failure growth is crashing jobs have become scarce investments have cratered profits have vanished tax collections are low government deficits high debt has surged but there isn t enough loss absorbing cushion either on corporate balance sheets or with financial intermediaries to allow orderly de leveraging india is not in the midst of an external crisis it s grappling with a vicious internal cycle of defaults more crucially what s missing is the national determination of the 1991 reforms economist manmohan singh then a newly appointed finance minister who later became premier invoked victor hugo in his budget speech no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come the emergence of india as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea unlike singh current prime minister narendra modi is a career politician who won a resounding popular mandate in 2019 for a second five year term there is no dearth of slogans and goals such as a 5 trillion economy by 2024 from under 3 trillion now yet except for a recent move to make india a low tax enclave for manufacturing units fleeing the united states us china trade war there is not much of a plan in place it is not even clear if a search for enduring solutions will get under way in 2020 or if the economy will only muddle through today s problems result from past successes in a withering critique of what he calls a finance construction growth model princeton university economist ashoka mody has rightly blamed india for ignoring labour intensive manufacturing the country has short changed its blue collar workers especially women whose participation rate in the workforce has swooned a nation of 1 3 billion people is producing only what 150 million affluent customers want with rampant automation everywhere a bulging low cost labour force is not the advantage it once was even in software exports cloud computing and digital technologies have diminished the value of work done by infosys ltd and tata consultancy services tcs ltd engineers in maintaining bulky enterprise software for global corporations can india in the 2020s try to reinvent its finance construction model so that it works for everyone and not just for a few thousand financiers in mumbai here are some ideas first india must reinvent infrastructure financing the sudden collapse of highly rated infrastructure operator financier owner il fs group in september 2018 was the last straw the nation was already reeling under a disastrous 2016 ban on 86 per cent of the currency in circulation modi s demonetisation failed in its goal of freezing out ill gotten wealth it depressed consumption and pauperised farmers and tiny businesses instead then came a botched up goods and services tax in 2017 after il fs went under the economy gave up il fs was a monster to ensure a cash strapped government never again allows another cabal to exploit india s hunger for roads power plants and sewage disposal units for private riches the country should adopt the australian model of asset recycling this means privatising existing infrastructure including power grids government land roads and commercial real estate with an explicit promise to use the proceeds to build new public assets that will make privatization politically palatable tap long term money rather than being stuck with defaulted bonds of il fs india s employee provident fund epf should be owning revenue generating domestic hard assets alongside the likes of australian super pty and the ontario teachers pension plan and india s own fledgling national investment and infrastructure fund ltd having enough public funds to invest means being able to employ the private sector as contractors partnerships in which the private sector shares the risk of building new assets don t have a great track record in india they lead to inflated costs corruption and disputes as a high court judge noted about an il fs backed water supply project water started flowing or trickling down to the common users both industrial and domestic in may 2005 what flowed thereafter appears to be only litigation a new model for infrastructure supported by more flexibility to companies when it comes to acquiring land or engaging labour would give india a shot at large scale manufacturing for domestic markets as well as exports however there is a shortage of income and savings channelling meagre resources to productive activity via deposit taking banks may have been the only way after india disbanded its development finance institutions that did not work well as is clear from the 200 billion plus pile of dud corporate loans on banks books nor did switching credit delivery to non banks which rely on wholesale funding produce desired results shadow financiers gave too many loans to developers for homes that never got built capital markets became casinos where brokers lure day traders with additional leverage on already leveraged derivative products not many of india s one dozen state run banks will survive technology will render their deposit taking privilege obsolete over the coming decade a lenders expertise will lie in using big data to find customers with stable cash flows originating credit against those cash flows and selling to investors this is the model that shadow financiers caught napping making loans for long term assets using short term borrowings are gravitating toward india should give them a nudge the part of india s finance construction growth that survives will be worth saving it may be no less important to the country s future than the software firms of the 1990s that had honed their skills on domestic projects like computerization of railway tickets they hit the global scene once the y2k millennium change scare stoked demand coming out of the current crisis is priority but without trying to pick winners india should also be getting its financial industry ready for the opportunities the 2020s may have

us officials have repeatedly accused china of engaging in debt trap diplomacy swamping poor countries with so much debt that they cannot repay their loans and surrender control of strategic assets to beijing these criticisms have been made publicly by some of the most senior figures in the trump administration including vice president mike pence and secretary of state mike pompeo alice wells the senior official responsible for south asia at the us state department chimed in during a recent event at the wilson center on the china pakistan economic corridor wells claimed in response to an audience question that the us was concerned about chinese projects that don t have an economic basis and that lead to countries ceding sovereignty but there are almost no such projects debt trap diplomacy is little more than a fantasy since the term was first coined in 2017 various studies have shown that china is not trying to seize strategic infrastructure by crippling poor countries with unsustainable loans while chinese lending has certainly contributed to debt overload in some economies it is not the driving force behind their problems the example most commonly cited including by wells is that of sri lanka s hambantota port which was leased to a chinese state owned company but chinese lending only accounted for around 10 percent of the country s external debt in 2017 and a host of domestic economic problems including protectionism and weak exports did more than china to bring about sri lanka s malaise even if hambantota did count as an example of debt trap diplomacy it appears to be a one off of more than 3 000 chinese backed projects tracked by various researchers hambantota is the lone case of asset seizure donghyun park an economist at the asian development bank told me in a recent interview that it was the only example of china seizing strategic assets in this way other data shows that asset seizures are the exception not the rule the rhodium group catalogued 40 chinese loan renegotiations in most instances china extended loan terms or wrote off the debt the researchers determined that asset seizures were very rare other than hambantota the only example they could find was an apparent land seizure in tajikistan referenced by wells but the details of that case are murky as the authors of the rhodium study write china s leverage in debt renegotiations is often exaggerated and many of the examples in their study involved an outcome in favour of the borrower not the supposedly predatory chinese lender indeed the center for global development tracked chinese lending from 2000 to 2017 and found more than 80 instances of debt relief looking at specific regions it is far from clear that china is intentionally driving poor countries into debt in africa china is now the largest foreign creditor in a number of countries assessed by the imf to be at risk of debt distress but as deborah brautigam of johns hopkins university writes china holds half or more of the foreign debt in only three of the 17 countries identified by the fund likewise in latin america data compiled by boston university shows that chinese lending has not driven countries except possibly venezuela over the debt sustainability threshold and in the pacific a new study by the lowy institute determined that china has not been the primary driver behind rising debt risks according to the authors the evidence to date suggests china has not been engaged in deliberate debt trap diplomacy in the pacific in south asia pakistan is currently undergoing a balance of payments crisis but while chinese lending and imports under the china pakistan economic corridor cpec have clearly exacerbated pakistan s problems beijing is not primarily to blame pakistan s over reliance on imported energy its low tax revenues and general economic mismanagement have done more than china to send it over the cliff edge proponents of debt trap diplomacy suggest that china s geostrategic interests are served when its partners struggle with debt economic crises allow beijing to pounce seize assets and amplify its political influence but the evidence points in the opposite direction far from boosting china s global power heavily indebted recipients of chinese largesse are a clear liability for beijing look at pakistan china has had to slow down its flagship cpec initiative there and provide emergency financing to fend off economic catastrophe pakistan has been forced to approach the imf for yet another bailout exposing china s loans and investments to scrutiny and increasing washington s leverage over islamabad as the us is a majority shareholder in the imf this is no gain for beijing but a massive headache venezuela is another example china lent huge amounts of money to the government in return for oil imports however venezuela s economy collapsed and it could no longer provide enough oil to pay its bills this undermined china s interests by reducing its energy supplies and driving up global oil prices adding to the country s already enormous import bill the debt trap diplomacy narrative implies wrongly that china is forcing its loans on passive and helpless developing countries but nations like sri lanka enthusiastically embraced china s lending and are in many ways masters of their own misfortune and others such as malaysia have proven themselves to be more than capable of standing up to beijing and demanding changes to belt and road initiatives bri projects even if china wanted to seize assets from debt ridden countries it has limited ability to do so take the example of ukraine which agreed to repay its loans to china via grain shipments when it failed to provide enough grain beijing had to resolve the matter through international arbitration seizing a foreign country s assets is easier said than done even for a superpower like china the bri is actually more disorganised than proponents of the debt trap diplomacy thesis like to imagine far from being a grand systematic plan to take over the world the initiative is in fact rather chaotic a 2018 study by csis tracked bri activity and found that it did not align with the government s proposals many projects fell outside the six economic corridors described by chinese officials beijing is trying to impose some order by drawing up an official list of bri projects it is also conscious of the need to rein in debt at the 2019 belt and road forum president xi said that china should ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects there are already signs of caution with loans being withheld from some heavily indebted countries moreover beijing has signed up to g20 guidelines on financing and infrastructure investment and its ministry of finance recently introduced a new debt sustainability framework for the belt and road this is not what you would expect if china was trying to overwhelm weak countries with debt of course there is more work to be done beijing could join the paris club of official creditors and its financial institutions could adopt formal lending rules like the multilateral development banks the us should engage with china to encourage further reform not inflame tensions by making baseless accusations by rupert stone the views opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not

repo activity household debt tariffs and shelter costs in the capital markets where are the well known democratic presidential hopefuls on housing issues as with most politicians it s a little vague while we re on politics regardless of gender senators make 174 000 per year plus lots of benefits the president s comp is 400k if they take it plus even more benefits also regardless of gender while workers with a bachelor s degree earn about double that of their co workers without a college education the difference between men s and women s earnings actually widens with more education as women unfortunately earn 74 cents for every dollar men make which is less than the 78 cents for workers without the college degree the influx in recent decades of college educated women has driven their numbers to record levels in fact the number of women working full time year round with a bachelor s degree is almost equal to men s 18 million women and 21 million men and women are more likely to

conference on feb 16 18 in new orleans read the full partnership announcement capital markets the yield curve was inverted for four months in 2019 does it matter in terms of predicting a recession we ll see but there are other economic activities that originators should be aware of corelogic took a deeper look at how specific regions were hit during and after the great recession to show the economic evolution and the role the housing market has played some interesting trends corelogic identified include in 2009 home prices dropped by 11 2 percent nationally with nevada experiencing the largest decline 25 5 percent followed by arizona 21 3 percent florida 19 7 percent and california 14 5 percent north and south dakota were the only states to see any annual growth in 2009 but in june 2019 north dakota experienced only 0 7 percent annual home price increase while south dakota had an annual decrease of 4 7 percent as california goes so goes the nation while california s home prices grew considerably from 2013 to 2018 the state s average annual home prices have fallen off mostly due to affordability issues that isn t the case in all western states as idaho and nevada not only became the fastest growing states but they also led the country in annual home price growth from 2018 to 2019 about 32 percent of the 392 metro areas analyzed were overvalued in may 2019 for comparison in september 2006 this figure was over 70 percent corelogic considered home prices in individual markets as undervalued at value or overvalued by comparing home prices to their long run sustainable levels which are supported by local market fundamentals such as disposable income millennial homebuyers are moving away from overvalued markets and toward more affordable areas of the top 10 metros for millennial buyers in may 2019 four were undervalued and five were at value with only salt lake city being overvalued corelogic next expects the housing market to enter a normalcy phase over the next 24 months with prices neither rising too fast nor too slow and a healthy housing market for the next couple decades with a growing stream of young households looking to buy homes despite the muted inflation figures of this current economic expansion most consumers largest expense housing costs have risen faster than all other major categories of expenditures that is until recently as home price appreciation has slowed dramatically over the last year potentially dragging overall inflation down just as core inflation seems to finally be in line with the fed s 2 percent target core cpi over the last year is running at the fastest pace of the current economic expansion but shelter costs account for about one third of the overall figure compare that one third to goods directly exposed to tariffs which are less than one tenth of the overall figure and you get a sense of why slowing home appreciation may be such a troubling trend shelter costs have been rising at over 3 percent for the last four years accounting for about 60 percent of inflation over that time and adding more than a full percentage point to headline cpi inflation but the slowdown in home price appreciation since early 2018 will eventually drag on core cpi inflation though hopefully modestly as sales have firmed recently and income growth has remained decent additionally housing costs as measured by official inflation indices aren t particularly representative of consumers costs as homeowners with a fixed rate mortgage or no mortgage do not see a rise in their housing costs consummate with official indices remember housing holds significant sway over inflation and thus central bank policy but with low vacancies and strong demand amid steady wage growth housing costs should not derail inflation too far from the fed s target turning to what is moving rates now with the full value of many finished goods subject to tariffs there is less scope for businesses to absorb the additional cost retailers and wholesalers already operate under thinner margins than manufacturers meaning some of the tariffs that importers pay will be passed on to consumers via higher prices the fact that higher prices for consumer goods might be lurking around the corner does not mean that consumer spending is going to fall off the map because of the tariffs but higher prices will either lead to lower sales of these items the same amount could be spent on less goods a decline in other spending categories or result in a lower saving rate the latest escalation in the trade war likely means that after so much effort in previous rounds to avoid collateral damage to consumer confidence and spending consumers are now in the crossfire of the trade war higher prices alone may not derail consumer spending but to the extent that higher prices get into consumers heads it could weigh on sentiment and eventually spending as a result until trade tensions dissipate the fomc is likely not finished with its mid cycle adjustment s anyone reading this commentary is happy that people incur debt in buying homes but on a bigger scale how worried should we be over financial sector debt leverage in the financial sector increased significantly in the years leading up to the financial crisis and the rise in debt was especially notable around gse associated mortgage pools and issuers of asset backed securities the size of the sector mushroomed from 15 trillion in 1990 to 70 trillion on the eve of the financial crisis debt in the u s financial sector exploded from 2 5 trillion in early 1990 to more than 18 trillion at its peak in 2008 nearly doubling the sector s debt to asset ratio and tripling it as a percent of gdp debt in the financial sector however currently stands nearly 2 trillion lower than at its peak ten years ago and the debt to gdp ratio of the sector has receded to a 20 year low and sits at less than 80 percent today from nearly 125 percent in 2008 commercial banks and other depository institutions are now relying more heavily on checking and savings deposits which are non debt liabilities to finance their assets than they were a decade ago because deposits tend to be a more stable form of financing than short term debt instruments the banking sector is not as vulnerable today as it was prior to the financial crisis the household debt to income ratio has receded by more than 30 percentage points since its peak in 2008 and the financial obligations ratio of the household sector currently stands near a four decade low widespread defaults by households on their mortgage debt does not seem to be in the cards as the debt to gdp ratio of the financial sector is down by nearly 50 percentage points in the bond market remember the federal reserve s recent balance sheet expansion is not quantitative easing qe despite the mechanics appearing similar repo market volatility over the past couple months caused the fomc to officially announce in october it will conduct overnight and term repo operations to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample through at least january 2020 the fed has been conducting overnight and term repo operations since repo rates skyrocketed on september 16th causing its balance sheet to grow for the first time since 2013 fed officials have repeatedly emphasized that these purchases are not qe as the main motivation is to add banking reserves to the system and not to put downward pressure on long term interest rates as was the case in previous asset purchase programs funding pressures are expected to be most acute until year end at which it is expected the fed will gradually scale back its purchases the commitment to purchase t bills at least into q2 of next year is because it will take a few months before the impact of more reserves fewer treasury securities to be fully felt and the fed wants to maintain ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early september 2019 over time the end result will be the fed going from owning a tiny share of the t bill market to around one sixth in just six months these policy moves have not necessarily altered rate cut projections looking at the actual bond market u s treasuries and agency mbs pulled back slightly to open this holiday week on reports more encouraging u s china headlines china announced that it was cutting import tariffs on nearly 900 products beginning january 1 while president trump said over the weekend that a phase one deal would be signed very shortly while that was positive news it wasn t all rosy for markets as the commerce department revealed an unexpected decline 2 0 percent in durable goods for november a key measure of the health of the manufacturing sector economists expected a jump of 1 2 percent the reading will negatively factor into gdp computations additionally new home sales in november missed the mark due to a lack of available supply at more affordable price points which hurts first time homebuyers data today consists of just the december philly fed non manufacturing firm and region indexes and december richmond fed manufacturing and services indexes later this morning there will also be a 41 billion 5 year treasury note auction before the bond market closes at 14 00 et 11 am pt we begin the day with both agency mbs prices and the 10 year

fundamentals of successful investing planning and living have undergone a dramatic and potentially dangerous transformation the ground has literally changed under your feet the number of complex legal regulatory medical and retiree unfriendly tax traps has mushroomed to the point that ignorance is downright dangerous and with president biden s newest multi trillion dollar social safety net tax hike it s about to get worse the upshot is cash hungry bureaucrats are now looking for full control over everything from cash in the bank to private retirement assets held anywhere they can get their hands on it and they want to suppress alternative asset protection and wealth building information that can make people more self reliant like the kind in this letter to prosper in biden s america yes it s still possible and i ll show you how you need to consider some new developments and plan accordingly the information i want to send you is essential to anyone who wants to protect their wealth prepare for their retirement or is already in retirement i am convinced that the u s is now facing some of the most serious economic and political threats in its history after nearly 40 years of unprecedented prosperity the u s economy is now in shambles millions of americans have lost their jobs their life savings and soon it will be their homes while the u s military remains the most powerful force in the world the most immediate threats america now faces are closer to home these include companies forced out of business soaring government spending that will lead to hyperinflation runaway taxes older citizens no longer able to retire and live what used to be known as their golden years and more fortunately you don t have to just sit by and do nothing there are simple easy inexpensive steps you can take right now to protect your family but if you can t answer yes to these questions you may be behind the 8 ball have you packed away every penny you legally can for your retirement if cash hungry federal bureaucrats dilute the value of iras and other retirement accounts would you be affected what is your exposure to and what preparations have you made for the coming housing bubble collapse you deserve to be just as protected against the coming inflation wave as any tech giant or financial titan of wall street that s why i want to send you the inside information and strategies they already know before it s too late as i am about to show you with shocking urgency now is the time to make basic preparations to come out ahead in the collapsing value of dollar denominated assets to not be a victim or a sucker i have no intention of being either and i know you feel the same way at the end of this letter i will tell you how to get the newest most authoritative source of information about hidden inflation how it is ripping you off and what you can do to protect yourself the ultimate hyperinflation defense manual is probably among the most important guides i have ever offered you can t find this information anywhere else and you haven t a moment to lose a dire warning from two past federal reserve board chairs as the editor of the bob livingston letter i pay very close attention to recently resigned or soon to be departed high level u s officials once they are out of office many are remarkably candid even as the mainstream media stop reporting their words in my experience recently retired officials often hint at dangers to come leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in which americans like you and i should pay close attention that s why it s so important to note the departing warning of former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan a man noted for understatement who flatly told congress serious economic disruptions are in the works due to trillions of dollars in federal obligations that will be visited upon taxpayers and retirees like a gigantic balloon payment and that was well before the trillions in helicopter money started raining down on america now listen to former fed chair paul volker who presided over 70 s era inflation and was even more blunt he warned that the chances of an all out dollar collapse due to runaway spending were greater than 50 50 these former insiders are referring to a level of unfunded liability by the federal government which is so gigantic as to boggle the mind to give you some idea of the scope of this problem the government would have to extract 473 000 from each and every u s household to cover the rapidly approaching national balloon payment on unfunded liabilities obviously something is going to have to give this is why i want to rush you information on how treasury bureaucrats are forming emergency contingency plans to freeze ira and 401 k accounts in the event of a national financial panic similar to the banking holidays used by the franklin roosevelt administration to bilk millions of americans during the great depression you especially need this expanded updated and revised manual because passive retirement planning is a thing of the past to get the most out of your life over 50 you can no longer listen to only one or two paid experts make your house payments and assume the best it s not enough anymore not by a long shot this is true if you re 10 15 years away from retirement and particularly if you are already in retirement the latter group has even more to lose through inaction how to live through hyperinflation in the past few months prices have been skyrocketing lumber prices have almost tripled real estate is soaring prices for some commodities have shot through the roof and let s not even talk about the grocery store but don t be fooled the current temporary period of inflation will soon be followed by even more massive inflation that s because president biden and his allies in congress have embarked on the biggest government spending spree in history this socialistic expansion of government will inevitably lead to a devaluation of the u s dollar hyperinflation that could wipe out your life savings imagine a world of 20 per gallon of gasoline 50 hamburgers and average housing rentals costing 10 000 a month or more the economic stimulus packages of the last few years alone will amount to 6 trillion nearly 7 times what the troubled assets relief program tarp program spent and the stimulus plan is only the tip of the iceberg when you add in the unfunded liabilities that s trillions the government doesn t have over the next few years whether the government borrows it or prints it an increase that big in the money supply is going to do only one thing send inflation through the roof the last time the u s government tried to spend its way out of a recession in the 1970s the inflation rate increased by 500 the ultimate

for a century the gop has been bankrolled by big business and wall street trump wants to keep the money rolling in his signature tax cut two years old last sunday has helped u s corporations score record profits and the stock market reach all time highs to spur even more corporate generosity for the 2020 election trump is suggesting more giveaways chief of staff mick mulvaney recently told an assemblage of ceos that trump wants to go beyond his 2017 tax cut trump also wants to expand his working class base in rallies and countless tweets he claims to be restoring the american working class by holding back immigration and trade incumbent republicans and gop candidates are mimicking trump s economic nationalism as trump consigliore stephen bannon boasted recently we ve turned the republican party into a working class party keeping the gop the party of big money while making it over into the party of the working class is a tricky maneuver especially at a time when capital and labor are engaged in the most intense economic contest in more than a century because so much wealth and power are going to the top armed with deductions and loopholes america s largest companies paid an average federal tax rate of only 11 3 percent on their profits last year roughly half the official rate under the new tax law the lowest effective corporate tax rate in more than eighty years yet almost nothing has trickled down to ordinary workers corporations have used most of their tax savings to buy back their shares giving the stock market a sugar high the typical american household remains poorer today than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007 trump s giant tax cut has also caused the federal budget deficit to balloon even as pretax corporate profits have reached record highs corporate tax revenues have dropped about a third under projected levels this requires more federal dollars for interest on the debt leaving fewer for public services workers need the trump administration has already announced a 4 5 billion cut in food stamp benefits that would affect an estimated 10 000 families many at the lower end of the working class the administration is also proposing to reduce social security disability benefits a potential blow to hundreds of thousands of workers the tax cut has also shifted more of the total tax burden to workers payroll taxes made up 7 8 percent of national income last year while corporate taxes made up just 0 9 percent the biggest gap in nearly two decades all told taxes on workers were 35 percent of federal tax revenue in 2018 taxes on corporations only 9 percent trump probably figures he can cover up this massive redistribution from the working class to the corporate elite by pushing the same economic nationalism tinged with xenophobia and racism he used in 2016 as steve bannon has noted the formula seems to have worked for britain s conservative party but it will be difficult this time around because trump s economic nationalism has hurt american workers particularly in states that were critical to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has suffered as tariffs raised prices for imported parts and materials hiring has slowed sharply in pennsylvania michigan and other states trump won and in states like minnesota that he narrowly lost the trade wars have also harmed rural america which also went for trump by reducing demand for american farm produce last year china bought around 8 6 billion of farm goods down from 20 billion in 2016 a new tentative trade deal calls for substantially more chinese purchases meanwhile health care costs continue to soar college is even less affordable and average life expectancy is dropping due to a rise in deaths from suicide and opioid drugs like fentanyl polls show most americans remain dissatisfied with the country s direction the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day the only tricks left to trump and the republicans are stoking social and racial resentments and claiming to be foes of the establishment but bigotry alone won t win elections and the detritus of the tax cut makes it difficult for trump and the gop to portray themselves as anti establishment this has created a giant political void and an opportunity democrats have an historic chance to do what they should have done years ago create a multi racial coalition of the working class middle class and poor dedicated to reclaiming the economy for the vast majority and making democracy work for all

the bickering over impeachment did not stop the president and congress from coming together last week to avert a government shutdown by passing a 1 4 trillion dollar spending package the bipartisan agreement has something for everyone a 22 billion dollars increase to bring total spending on militarism to 738 billion dollars and a 27 billion dollars increase to bring total spending on domestic programs to 632 billion dollars it also imposes a national ban on selling tobacco products including e cigarettes to anyone under 21 the agreement was split into two bills both bills were unveiled last monday afternoon the bills passed the house on tuesday so only the house leadership and the members of the appropriations committee and their staffs who helped write the over 2 000 page deal had any idea what was in the bills but most members voted for the spending bills because they were fearful of backlash over another christmastime government shutdown house leadership simply waived the rule requiring that all legislation be available at least three days before being voted upon end the fed ron paul best price 2 18 buy new 5 68 as of 09 55 utc details the modern practice of funding the government via gigantic omnibus bills that are rushed into law puts the growth of government on autopilot this practice also gives the president more influence over the budget violating the spirit if not the letter of the constitution s grant of authority to congress to appropriate funds which was intended as a check on executive power meanwhile the federal reserve continues pumping billions into the repurchasing market when the fed began injecting money into the market in september it said intervention was a temporary measure to address a short term liquidity shortage three months later the fed is not only continuing to bail out the repurchasing market it is preparing for other bailouts this is further evidence that we are on the verge of another fed created economic crisis when the crisis hits the best thing the fed could do is not to lower interest rates below the levels set by the market this would allow consumers businesses and government to liquidate their debt and restore a sound foundation for future growth if the fed did not interfere with the painful but necessary correction it would only be a short time before a real economic boom commenced the federal reserve is unlikely to follow this path because of the short term pain it would cause debt ridden consumers and more importantly the pain it would cause politicians who would be forced to cut spending and or raise taxes but continuing to artificially lower interest rates will inevitably result in an economic crisis brought about by a rejection of the dollar s world reserve currency status the federal reserve s manipulation of interest rates depreciates the dollar s value enabling the growth of the welfare warfare state while enriching the insiders who receive the new money before prices rise the brunt of dollar depreciation is felt by middle and working class americans whose paychecks do not keep up with the rising cost of living inflation is nothing more than a hidden and regressive tax auditing and ending the fed should thus be a top priority of those concerned about rising income inequality and poverty as well as those dreaming of a christmas free of 2 000 page omnibus spending bills the best of ron paul md

throughout history there have been a number of extremely meaningful volatility spikes across major financial markets each had defining characteristics that made them similar despite occurring in very different markets and for different reasons the continuity seen across these volatility cycles is a good thing because while it doesn t necessarily make a major volatility spike highly predictable historical precedence offer a blueprint for identifying conditions that are supportive for a potential vol event to occur and how they are likely to unfold once in motion this can be of great help in guiding trading decisions whether that is to steer clear of a potential vol blow up or move towards it with the appropriate strategy that can take advantage of the outsized price swings that come with unusual levels of volatility we will first discuss what a volatility event typically looks like in terms of the behavior of volatility itself then take a close look at some of the largest spikes ever witnessed in major financial markets get your report on the impact of market volatility here what is volatility in simple terms volatility can be defined as the variations at which a market fluctuates the morean asset s price moves the higher the volatility the less the price moves the lower the volatility paul robinson dailyfx in this piece we are looking at a short term measure of volatility two week duration called realized volatility which is volatility as it has already occurred it is also known as historical volatility what does a volatility event cycle look like in the lead up to a volatility spike there is often a build up period where volatility rises gradually indicating markets could be headed for significant dislocation and disruption the period of subtle unrest is followed by a sudden vertical move in volatility that reaches a climax before quickly reversing and normalizing through a gradual but bumpy decline towards pre event volatility levels the graph below is a composite of several past volatility cycles accounting for 100 days before and after the peak in volatility notice the build up period the volatility spike itself and the normalization phase as well as the asymmetry between the phases cycle of a volatility spike behavior of volatility differs among asset classes another aspect of market volatility to understand is that it doesn t behave in the same way across all asset classes nor necessarily even within the same asset class for example stock market volatility generally behaves much differently than it does in currencies and commodities stocks have an inherent long bias to them as they are generally an asset of appreciating value over the longrun market participants invest in company shares making the stock market almost an exclusively long market with limited short interest because of this bias volatility runs high in down markets when there is fear as a result of financial losses and selling and low in up markets where fear is minimal occasionally you will see stock market volatility rise in a bull market as participants collectively suffer from fomo but this isn t the norm and only happens towards the end of long powerful trends a couple of which we will look at here shortly vix demonstrates that volatility rises on selling declines on buying as shown in the graph above volatility typically runs opposite of the s p 500 especially when the market declines over the long run currencies and commodities don t have a natural bias to them and tend to oscillate in large bull and bear cycles that end in minimal net change volatility can rise in either direction and isn t consistent over time in the case of commodities i e gold volatility can actually be more likely to rise with a price rise than during a decline but again this is not wholly consistent across a cycle gold vs two week realized volatility in the graph above the green boxes mark periods when volatility rose while price appreciated and the red boxes mark periods when it rose while the price of gold depreciated this highlights the non directional bias that volatility can have in commodities the same also holds true for currency volatility a history of market volatility the biggest volatility cycles we ll have a look at the most significant volatility cycles that have happened in the major financial markets since 1929 and investigate their build up peak normalization phase and after effects crash of 1929 at the end of the roaring 20s bull market the crash of 1929 kicked off the great depression of the 1930s the october 28 29 crash in 1929 is particularly noteworthy and resulted in a two day loss of 24 in the dow jones industrials average with two week realized volatility rocketing to 127 in the short term aftermath the dow price spent the next two weeks closing 6 higher or lower from the prior day s session as was the case with the death of other major historical stock markets the crash didn t come from all time highs ath but after a period of weakness that caused volatility to rise ahead of the major spike heading into the late october rout the market was already off the ath by 21 with short term volatility rising from only 11 to 81 after the initial episode of the 1929 1932 stock market decline volatility initially normalized by falling from a two week reading of 127 to under 10 in about five months time volatility would ramp up again later but did not exceed 100 again until almost two years later when the worst part of the bear market drew near its conclusion dow jones industrial average 1929 1931 in the chart above volatility spiked sharply red after weeks of rising in an unsteady market orange then dropped sharply green as market confidence firmed up in the wake of the two day crash silver 1980 during the late 1970s 80s period the hunt brothers attempted to manipulate the price of silver in what was one of the most famous market cornerings ever it wasn t just the brothers trading activity though inflation was rapidly rising and precious metal hedges were in high demand silver topped out at over 49 after trading only 6 a year prior during the spectacular price rise volatility at times rose sharply with each major surge including the final one that concluded in january 1980 volatility declined during the initial portion of the sell off before spiking to near record levels as the market panicked out of long positions during the spring of 1980 from there it was a bumpy ride but the two week realized volatility declined to only 12 a mere five months after super spiking to 240 silver 1979 1981 in this chart the green boxes highlight the volatility spikes during bullish phases and the red boxes when volatility spiked on selling it is clear there was a larger tendency for volatility to rise with the price of silver versus when it fell black monday 1987 the 1987 stock market crash in the united states was in large part blamed on program trading the first technology financialengineering driven crash of its kind however massive speculative excesses were built up prior to the crash unlike anything since the 1920s this played a significant role in the decline of stock prices and the massive spike in volatility the one day 20 decline in the major averages was of course a significant surprise outside the possibility of predicting but just as has been the case with most other major volatility cycles it didn t exactly occur out of the blue during the last 10 of the bull market two week realized volatility rose with the s p 500 from 8 to 15 highlighting growing instability in the uptrend by the time black monday rolled around the spx had already declined from the high by 16 while volatility was materially higher with a short term reading of 25 short term volatility spiked to over 130 in the wake of the monday collapse in stock prices before easing off and eventually dropping back to near 10 by the following march s p 500 1987 88 growing unrest orange shows volatility increasing as the market is still in a bullish phase when black monday rolled around volatility went spiraling higher red before dropping off after the market stabilized green great financial crisis gfc 2008 the great financial crisis was driven by irresponsible banking practices on wall st that eventually came at the cost of main st the decline from 2007 to 2009 was the largest plunge in both stocks and the economy since the great depression but it wasn t without some type of warning that a major blow up in volatility could be in the works just before things got really wild in the fall of 2008 two week volatility was already at 41 from there the s p 500 fell another 27 in about five weeks which saw short term volatility rocket to 97 during that time the widely watched vix index exploded from 36 to 80 in the year following volatility normalized with two week realized vol and the vix hitting 20 and 23 respectively but even going back to 2007 before the bear market began like in so many other bull markets nearing their conclusion volatility began creeping higher despite the s p 500 having rose about 8 ytd up to the october 9 2007 high the vix itself had also rose from around 12 to 16 a 25 increase the wheels on the bus were beginning to wobble despite all looking well on the surface s p 500 2007 08 looking at the chart above one can see volatility was generally heading higher orange prior to the big spike in 2008 once panic hit a zenith red and market confidence came back volatility died down green aud usd 2008 09 turning to currencies one of the biggest casualties of the great financial crisis was the australian dollar aud usd which plunged nearly 40 while two week volatility spiked to 80 from just single digit levels a few months earlier australia s strong export ties to china proved to be costly when the emerging economy s growth rate took a serious hit during the global recession the rout wasn t a total surprise as few are volatility rose steadily in the months prior to the final collapse of aussie short term volatility climbed from a mere 5 in july 2008 to nearly 30 before the final spike to 80 occurred into october once aud usd bottomed there was a fairly sharp drop in volatility before it tapered off during the first few months of 2009 other currency pairs were also hit in a big way such as eur usd and usd cad but volatility never escalated like it did in aud usd volatility in those pairs rose to only 30 40 which is still extremely high for currencies s p 500 e mini flash crash 2010 the first major flash crash to speak of occurred on may 6 2010 when the s p 500 e mini futures were rocked by over 6 in about seven minutes before erasing all losses in less than fifteen minutes a london based trader navinder singh sarao was accused and found guilty of spoofing the placing of large orders which are cancelled just before getting filled now while this may have contributed to the decline the market was already in a fragile state to begin with as is typically the case when flash crashes occur to put volatility into perspective the vix had risen from 15 to 25 in the weeks prior before rocketing past 40 on the day of the crash volatility actually didn t finish rising until about three weeks later when the vix hit 48 from there volatility declined in typical fashion until early 2011 before popping again s p 500 2010 the s p 500 e mini flash crash showed afamiliar theme the orange highlights a period where stocks were still generally heading higher but the unrest underneath the hood was becoming apparent via rising volatility the spike and higher levels of volatility red followed suit along with the may 6 flash crash eurchf blow up 2015 of the blow ups in volatility this was one of the most surprising the swiss national bank snb had a floor in the eur chf exchange rate that caused wide spread complacency in the market and fueled the thinking that the central bank would keep the cross supported as it turned out this was not the case when the snb yanked the floor eur chf collapsed from 1 20 depending on the quote source to as low as 0 68 short term volatility went from virtually zero to nearly 100 in a flash it only took days to take back most of the spike but vol spent the next three months slowly normalizing eur chf 2014 15 with the snb floor in place volatility dropped to nearly zero orange but once the floor was lifted the market was caught off guard causing volatility to rocket to over 100 red before backing off once the dust had settled green brexit 2016 the brexit vote in june 2016 wasn t expected despite it being a possibility as evidenced by the way markets were railroaded when the vote came out in favor of the uk leaving the european union sterling was in a near term upswing right before the results were announced but gbp usd ended up closing down 8 on the day the vote was finalized two week realized vol exceeded 46 thereafter this was a known event to take place so there was no surprise to see volatility rise ahead of time in anticipation nevertheless volatility provided a warning that things could get dicey in the month before the vote two week realized volatility rose from a mere 6 to over 16 as market participants weighed in on the potential outcome one that the market wasn t fully prepared to handle even with warning post brexit vote volatility initially cratered from 46 back to 16 in only about a month before entering the typical post event grind towards normalization of around 7 in six weeks time a few months after that there was the pound flash crash in october that again saw volatility spiral higher momentarily gbp usd vol chart above it can be seen that volatility rose in anticipation of the brexit vote orange then rose sharply on the surprise brexit outcome red to eventually fade in the aftermath green volpocalypse 2018 the volpocalypse of february 2018 while nowhere near as dramatic and damaging as the 87 crash didn t exactly happen out of the blue in the final months of 2017 u s stocks accelerated higher in an unsustainable fashion taking vol with it two week realized volatility rose from just 3 at the end of september to around 8 at its peak in january 2018 after stocks peaked in late january the market began to decline for about a week before the indices plunged and volatility shot up the dow experienced a 4 flash crash in the span of about ten minutes the vix the most popular measure of broad stock market volatility saw an extremely unusual spike as the market was caught betting heavily on low levels of volatility via futures options and etfs aimed at direct bets on the level of the vix this caused an exaggerated move in the vix that pushed it to an intra day high of 50 like most vol blow ups this one too spent several months normalizing to pre event levels s p 500 and vix 2018 above you can see that volatility began rising during the last stage of the blow off rally as it became unstable green and rose further on price weakness before super spiking on a sharp decline in stock prices red followed by a period of normalization orange vix hits 50 intra day the intra day vix spike was much larger than the actual stock market decline would have caused under normal circumstances but massive short vix bets helped fuel it much higher market volatility going forward major

a year ago john bolton trump s short lived national security advisor invoked the 1823 monroe doctrine making explicit what has long been painfully implicit the dominions south of the rio grande are the empire s backyard yet 2019 was a year best characterized as the revolt of the dispossessed for a better world against the barbarism of neoliberalism as rafael correa points out latin america today is in dispute what follows is a briefing on this crossroads andean nations venezuela the leader for regional integration and 21st century socialism continued to be ground zero in the clash between the empire and those nations pursuing post neoliberal alternatives and a multipolar world on the evening of january 22 trained us security asset and head of the suspended venezuelan national assembly juan guaidó received a call from us vice president pence giving guaidó the green light to declare himself president of venezuela the next day guaidó proclaimed his presidency on a caracas street corner within minutes trump recognized the self appointment later followed by some fifty us allies still most nations in the world did not recognize guaidó and the united nations continues to recognize maduro as the constitutional president of venezuela guaidó called for harsher us sanctions on his own people and even the us military option gone was the pretext that sanctions targeted only the government the former us ambassador to venezuela william brownfield boasted that these measures would have an impact on everyone to accelerate the collapse from president barack obama s sanctions in 2015 trump progressively ratcheted up the pain to the current blockade this illegal collective punishment had already caused over 40 000 deaths by the beginning of the year according to the center for economic and policy research cepr in a war by economic means denying the venezuelan people vital food and medicine yet guaidó failed to come to power his publicity stunt on february 23 to bring humanitarian aid from colombia fizzled to make things worse envoys of guaidó in colombia were caught embezzling some of the very funds slated for humanitarian assistance soon after this debacle a staged coup on april 30 by guaidó and a few military officers on an overpass in eastern caracas aborted in november guaidó made an even more pathetic coup attempt his ability to garner support atrophied drawing the ire even of some hardline opposition who formerly backed him while the maduro government continued to rally substantial popular demonstrations and signed a peaceful coexistence agreement with some moderate opposition parties in september despite attempts by washington to incite ruptures within the venezuelan security forces the civic military union built by chavez and continued under maduro held firm and the ranks of the militias continue to grow and despite heavy lobbying by the trump administration venezuela was voted onto the un human rights council on october 27 in a bid to compensate for the diminished stature of the anti venezuela lima group on december 3 colombia convened a summit for the activation of the inter american treaty of reciprocal assistance tiar against venezuela to ratchet up sanctions even further and keep the military option on the table by the end of 2019 even the wall street journal conceded venezuela s nicolás maduro once thought ripe for ouster looks firmly in place in washington north american solidarity activists defended the venezuelan embassy from being taken over by guaidó collaborators april may 2019 with the permission

re elected president on october 20 because the us backed candidate lost the us called his election fraudulent a compliant organization of american states oas disseminated misleading information on the validity of the election thus the stage was set for the november 10 coup when morales was forced to resign by the military thirteen us members of congress sent a dear colleague letter condemning the administration s support for military backed regime and silence on violent repression contributes to spiraling crisis this letter stands in stark contrast to the close associationof key figures behind the coup with allies in washington the oas secretary general s embrace of coup leader luis fernando camacho and the endorsement of the coup by the right wing neighbors president trump applauded the bolivian military despite its well documented systematic violations of human rights the self proclaimed president jeanine áñez smeared indigenous communities as satanic in tweets later deleted morales

took the prize moreno had served as vice president in a previous leftist government headed by rafael correa who had campaigned for moreno upon assuming the presidency in 2017 moreno inexplicably and unexpectedly betrayed the platform the voters and the party that put him in office he jailed his vice president and later other leaders of his former party and put out an arrest warrant for correa who is now in exile on april 11 moreno handed wikileaks founder julian assange who had been in asylum in the ecuadorian embassy in london to the british police moreno withdrew ecuador from alba the

the loss of a countervailing element to us hegemony brazil voted with the us and israel for continuing the us blockade on cuba and against 187 other un members former left leaning president lula da silva would have easily beaten bolsonaro if the polls were any indication but corrupt judge sergio moro sent lula to prison on evidenceless charges the judge was rewarded by ironically being made minister of justice in the new bolsonaro government similarly dilma rousseff who was lula s left leaning successor as president of brazil had been deposed on a technicality by the right leaning congress in what amounted to a parliamentary coup in 2016 an international campaign to free lula finally succeeded in november but far too late for him to run against bolsonaro lula is free and fighting now but could be incarcerated again bolsonaro went about dismantling social welfare measures firing government workers and rewarding multinational corporations while the amazon burned

judging by his appointment of a first rate economist to his cabinet as minister of economy argentina s new president alberto fernández is off to a good start in confronting his country s economic problems martín guzmán with whom i have frequently collaborated in recent years is among the world s leading experts on sovereign debt and the problems it can cause making him the right person in the right place at the right time after completing his phd at brown university under peter howitt co author with philippe aghion of seminal work in modern growth theory guzmán obtained a coveted position at columbia university where he forged an academic career and became an influential expert on crucial policy debates at the domestic and global level he has testified before the us congress on puerto rico s debt crisis and spoken at the united nations about the need for a better international system for resolving sovereign debt crises in recent years he has divided his time between new york and argentina where he is a professor of macroeconomics at the university of buenos aires when the former president mauricio macri took office his economic team openly admitted that while they had inherited many problems they started with one major advantage a low level of debt they gambled on a set of policies making for instance untimely and unnecessarily large cuts in export taxes paying off old defaulted debt to so called vulture funds with unconscionably high returns and taking on new high interest long term dollar denominated debt all in the hope that market friendly signals would lead to a rush of growth spurring foreign investment even at the time i thought it was a foolhardy gamble the rest is history it didn t work out and as matters went from bad to worse macri compounded the mistakes more borrowing including a 57bn programme with the international monetary fund austerity misguided sterilisation efforts to prevent inflation which built up a debt overhang the worst of all possible worlds was soon at hand more inflation reaching almost 60 in the current year higher unemployment already at double digits and rising and the re imposition of the exchange controls the removal of which macri had lauded at the outset of his administration as the cornerstone of his economic policy as fernández has put it one doesn t solve a problem of excessive debt by taking on more debt as a result fernández inherits a far worse economic situation than macri confronted higher inflation higher unemployment and now a debt beyond argentina s ability to service doubling down on a failed policy will not work nor will returning to what preceded it that is why it is so important that fernández has appointed a knowledgeable brilliant economist who combines youthful energy with a wisdom well beyond his 37 years given the mess that macri has handed fernández there are no magic bullets it is easier to say what not to do as fernández has put it one doesn t solve a problem of excessive debt by taking on more debt nor does one solve a problem of recession and unemployment by imposing more austerity which in every recession always leads to more economic contraction the reality is that there will be no substantial private sector flows in the immediate future no matter what policies the government enacts but argentina must husband its limited resources devoting them to reigniting the economy one hopes that the multilateral development banks will provide countercyclical lending for investment projects that spur growth and poverty alleviation under macri poverty has once again grown enormously to more than 35 of the population there is enormous potential tourism for example boomed after the last major devaluation argentina has first rate universities and large numbers of highly educated entrepreneurial people sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk bondholders will not necessarily be thinking however of argentina s people or of the country s long run potential many of them will be thinking only of the short run gains from squeezing argentina into more austerity they will spin a story about a profligate country that lived beyond its means once again even though they encouraged macri in his misconceived policies and gave him the money that led argentina into its current debt crisis presumably they knew there was a risk that s why they demanded and received such high interest rates some may be more thoughtful and understand that restoring argentina s debt service capacity depends on economic recovery in recent months many other countries in the region have confronted political instability and economic turmoil it is in no one s interest that argentina be added to that list we should celebrate the orderly transfer of power and the commitment on all sides to maintain and defend democracy we should also celebrate the shared vision that any effective economic programme must involve not only shared sacrifice but also shared prosperity when the fruits of that programme are achieved fernández with guzmán appears to be formulating a programme of moderation avoiding the extremes of the past unlike macri s agenda the fernández programme is not based on big gambles and wishful thinking it is based on the hard realities of the situation that he has inherited it represents argentina s best chance to achieve gradual restoration of growth obviously the more assistance the international community can provide the faster and more robust the recovery will be joseph

for a century the gop has been bankrolled by big business and wall street trump wants to keep the money rolling in his signature tax cut two years old last sunday has helped u s corporations score record profits and the stock market reach all time highs to spur even more corporate generosity for the 2020 election trump is suggesting more giveaways chief of staff mick mulvaney recently told an assemblage of ceos that trump wants to go beyond his 2017 tax cut trump also wants to expand his working class base in rallies and countless tweets he claims to be restoring the american working class by holding back immigration and trade incumbent republicans and gop candidates are mimicking trump s economic nationalism as trump consigliore stephen bannon boasted recently we ve turned the republican party into a working class party keeping the gop the party of big money while making it over into the party of the working class is a tricky maneuver especially at a time when capital and labor are engaged in the most intense economic contest in more than a century because so much wealth and power are going to the top armed with deductions and loopholes america s largest companies paid an average federal tax rate of only 11 3 percent on their profits last year roughly half the official rate under the new tax law the lowest effective corporate tax rate in more than eighty years yet almost nothing has trickled down to ordinary workers corporations have used most of their tax savings to buy back their shares giving the stock market a sugar high the typical american household remains poorer today than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007 trump s giant tax cut has also caused the federal budget deficit to balloon even as pretax corporate profits have reached record highs corporate tax revenues have dropped about a third under projected levels this requires more federal dollars for interest on the debt leaving fewer for public services workers need the trump administration has already announced a 4 5 billion cut in food stamp benefits that would affect an estimated 10 000 families many at the lower end of the working class the administration is also proposing to reduce social security disability benefits a potential blow to hundreds of thousands of workers the tax cut has also shifted more of the total tax burden to workers payroll taxes made up 7 8 percent of national income last year while corporate taxes made up just 0 9 percent the biggest gap in nearly two decades all told taxes on workers were 35 percent of federal tax revenue in 2018 taxes on corporations only 9 percent trump probably figures he can cover up this massive redistribution from the working class to the corporate elite by pushing the same economic nationalism tinged with xenophobia and racism he used in 2016 as steve bannon has noted the formula seems to have worked for britain s conservative party but it will be difficult this time around because trump s economic nationalism has hurt american workers particularly in states that were critical to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has suffered as tariffs raised prices for imported parts and materials hiring has slowed sharply in pennsylvania michigan and other states trump won and in states like minnesota that he narrowly lost the trade wars have also harmed rural america which also went for trump by reducing demand for american farm produce last year china bought around 8 6 billion of farm goods down from 20 billion in 2016 a new tentative trade deal calls for substantially more chinese purchases meanwhile health care costs continue to soar college is even less affordable and average life expectancy is dropping due to a rise in deaths from suicide and opioid drugs like fentanyl polls show most americans remain dissatisfied with the country s direction the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day the only tricks left to trump and the republicans are stoking social and racial resentments and claiming to be foes of the establishment but bigotry alone won t win elections and the detritus of the tax cut makes it difficult for trump and the gop to portray themselves as anti establishment this has created a giant political void and an opportunity democrats have an historic chance to do what they should have done years ago create a multi racial coalition of the working class middle class and poor dedicated to reclaiming the economy for the vast majority and making democracy work for all

santa marta colombia along the cobblestoned streets of the coastal city of santa marta demand for bolivares from venezuela is skyrocketing but not for the bills monetary value instead of using his homeland s money to pay for daily essentials in his native country venezuelan immigrant hector cordero weaves the currency into wallets and purses which he sells to tourists in colombia his artful crafts underscore the creative methods that venezuelans are using to extract value from a currency that amid skyrocketing inflation many consider worthless these bolivares soberanos notes are worth nothing cordero who is from caracas told al jazeera the notes i use are not circulating any more since last year cordero uses about 70 notes of 100 bolivares each to handcraft a small coin purse or 100 of the notes to make a larger wallet a handbag can take up to 1 200 notes to produce all in all the artist incorporates 16 different denominations of venezuelan currency into his crafts many of them the discontinued bolivares soberanos cordero sells wallets made from hundreds or even thousands of bills of the now valueless currency for about 8 the handbags go for about 12 he says most of his clients are european and north american tourists people who want to take home a piece of what was once one of the strongest economies in south america he learned his technique by watching others in the streets of caracas and by studying dozens of youtube tutorials uploaded by fellow venezuelans to teach people how to make what has become known as origami venezolano when i run out of bolivares my brother goes to venezuela and brings more notes cordero said people have a lot of these notes and we buy them we give them what they ask for he explained that people in venezuela exchange unworthy bolivares by the weight for other forms of currency usually united states dollars or for food people also make the swap for high denomination bolivares bills that still hold some dwindling value the crafts help cordero and his family get by in their temporary home in colombia but he dreams of returning to venezuela some day i hope things change in venezuela i want to go back there s nothing like our country and i don t feel comfortable living in another country he said the government has let everything break down i m only waiting for problems to get solved so i can go back to venezuela hyperinflation the venezuelan government does not publish data related to inflation but the finance commission of the opposition controlled national assembly calculated that inflation for october 2019 was 20 7 percent and that cumulative inflation for 2019 was 4 035 percent even so those numbers may be very conservative the international monetary fund estimates that inflation in venezuela this year will reach 200 000 percent and that the economy will contract by 35 percent venezuelans first suffered the expropriation wave and now the hyperinflation hurricane which has devastated private enterprise congressman angel alvarado said on november 14 few in venezuela use bolivares to buy goods or services most people have turned to us dollars euros cryptocurrencies or bartering to survive the venezuelan government headed by president nicolas maduro is well aware of the situation during a november 17 interview with former vice president jose rangel who served during the era of president hugo chavez maduro said that all economies around the world use the us dollar for different transactions the president also recognised that in some sectors of the venezuelan economy such as the oil sector that had been the case as well however due to hyperinflation the trend of using us dollars in the streets instead of bolivares is becoming unstoppable this process that they call dollarisation can be used for the recovery and deployment of the country s productive forces and the functioning of the economy maduro said exodus fuels implicit dollarisation venezuela has gradually dollarised with even supermarket transactions happening in foreign currency and many employees are being paid in us dollars or euros however a substantial portion of the country still has no access to foreign currency especially the least fortunate daniel di martino a us based economic analyst and a spokesman for the us chapter of the political movement vente venezuela come venezuela told al jazeera those least fortunate often choose to leave venezuela craft seller cordero is just one of roughly 1 5 million venezuelans who migrated to colombia as of the end of august up 39 percent from a year earlier according to data collected by the colombian government i had to go out of venezuela because i have three girls and one boy cordero said the situation is really tough in venezuela nowadays and i had to go out to make a living like many of his countrymen cordero sends money to relatives in his native land and by doing so he is contributing to the growing use of foreign currencies in venezuela i expect dollarisation to continue naturally as people lose confidence in the currency and they access remittances from their family members abroad di martino told al jazeera eventually as more venezuelans escape the country even the less fortunate venezuelans should be able to access foreign currency cordero s way of accessing foreign currency is taking what s left of his country s once shining economy and making trinkets out of its devalued currency small gifts he hopes will at least retain their sentimental value
the greed is good dogma has its roots in the chicago school of economics led by milton friedman and known as the chicago boys they set about defining what makes a thriving economy low regulation privatisation and the rolling back of the public sphere crucially this would be an global project to be implemented by the international monetary fund among others this brand of rampant capitalism which has come to be known as neoliberalism was exported with profound and long lasting consequences and often through the use of force and anti democratic coercion for friedman and his ideological acolytes who became hegemonic in the 1970s and 80s greed was in reality the organising principle of the corporation the executive the shareholder and indeed all individuals in this way the sole purpose the only task of a corporate executive was to enrich their shareholders in a wide ranging critique of friedman and the political representatives of the chicago boys who triumphed in the 1980s and set the economic consensus for the ensuing decades thatcher and reagan nobel prize winning economist dr joseph stiglitz argues that this approach has been socially and economically disastrous for stiglitz who disagreed but never the less respected friedman the approach led to intolerablelevels of inequality such inequality is now seen as a threat to social peace and the basis of political instability domestically and across the world as well as a grave social ill by many defenders of capitalism as a whole including stiglitz paying attention to everyone else s self interest in other words to the common welfare is in fact a precondition for one s own ultimate wellbeing it isn t just good for the soul it s good for business he argues but such is the short term nature of profit making that planning investment shoring up environmental protections and prioritising the needs of the many not the few to coin a phrase is countervailing to the logic of the system so the logic needs to be accompanied by something a little more doctrinaire after all when ceos earn 300 times as much as their employees a great deal of ideological pressure is needed to make this reality as sustainable one that the amazon is being cut down or that amazon workers earn pennies in comparison to its anti union ceo these can simply be rationalised as moral economic incentives that deliver for shareholders and if anyone still buys this for society as a whole as wealth trickles down perhaps consumer capitalism is what people really want and that is really what defines us as human beings like it or not or so the argument goes we ve all seen the images of black friday where people push each other to the ground in the rush for cheap consumer goods we ve all apparently accepted our entry into a competition for the latest gadgets cars or clothes especially at christmas time there is of course a jarring and blatant contradiction on the one hand we are bombarded with advertising to make us want to buy products and be made to feel that unless we have them we are inferior especially if we cannot ensure they are waiting under the tree on the big day and on the other we have an economy based on low pay temporary jobs and in work poverty little wonder then that a recent yougov poll showed that over a third of people were planning on taking out lines of credit to cover festive shopping it is a quite dizzying cycle one day the adverts are for the latest must have products the next about how much lower in price those products are in the new year sales and then finally we get the ads for debt helplines and do we even want life to be commodified in this way last year a survey found that in the uk there were around 60 million unwanted gifts perhaps that s this biggest trick of all all of these products we are told we need all of the greed is good dogma and all of the short term accumulation of profit doesn t make us happy in reality it does the opposite it makes us anxious adds to our economic stress and damages our mental health the never ending slew of useless consumer goods produces fantastic wealth which is then systematically held back from society at large often funnelled into off shore accounts in the us international headquarters of the chicago boys the greed is good logic is alive and well what do general motors netflix starbucks and chevron all have in common none of them paid a dollar in federal income tax last year while millions will be worrying about the impossibility of affording health insurance this festive season such a social and economic system breeds a culture of individualism where the end of society unless there is a photo opportunity at a food bank is finally realised fear and division comes to trump solidarity and hope but maybe that is just what we are meant to believe i ve never bought into such a pessimistic view of humanity indeed despite political events i m sure that the longing for sharing looking after one an other and community will overcome the ravages of late capitalism this year glaswegians donated 430 270 worth of gifts for over 13 000 children living at the sharp end of austerity and poverty

2019 has been quite an eventful year for gold with the major highlight being the yellow metal crossing the threshold limit of 1 500 an ounce at levels last seen in 2013 uncertainty in the u s china trade front geopolitical concerns between the united states and the middle east the brexit mayhem and concerns over the global economic outlook have compelled investors to seek safe haven investment options like gold further three rate cuts by the fed this year has been favoring the rally notably lower the interest rates lesser will be the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion making gold an attractive option for investors holding other currencies a sluggish manufacturing sector also drove the gold prices so far this year gold prices globally have gained about 15 a striking

limited last year the trend of consolidation in the industry seems to have revived after a lull over the past few years when the companies were forced to cut debt levels and slash capital expenditure thanks to lower gold prices given that gold production is anticipated to drop eventually owing to scarcity of new discoveries and depleting existing resources miners prefer to build up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging for new ones that are inherently risky and capital intensive major markets india and china that roughly account for around 50 of consumer gold demand continue to sustain demand for gold the expanding middle class in china and india and broader economic growth will have a significant impact on gold demand use of gold across energy healthcare and technology is on the rise moreover the yellow metal has long been considered as a safe haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty emerging market central banks are turning their attention to gold after years of exposure to the u s dollar and as a natural currency hedge against other reserve currencies so there will be an eventual demand supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices

bloomberg mexico s central bank could take monetary policy action as soon as february if it sees that inflation as well as internal and external risks remain low governor alejandro diaz de leon said in an interview we have to monitor if conditions in the economy continue having this favorable trend in terms of inflation and lower external and internal risks and if this occurs it allows us to take monetary policy actions he said but this is precisely what we ll be monitoring from now until the next decision the central bank has cut borrowing costs by a quarter point in each of its past four rate decisions to 7 25 but still has one of the highest real rates in the world that s fueled division within the board about how quickly it should ease monetary policy without risking a rebound in inflation and peso volatility inflation has slowed markedly and even fell below target to 2 63 in early december the peso has been the best performing major emerging market currency this year gaining further after the u s house of representatives voted for an updated north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada and earlier this month mexico s sovereign credit default swaps fell to the lowest since 2014 as traders see risks receding capital flows diaz de leon who has voted with the majority for a cautious easing cycle signaled that mexico s monetary policy may be better positioned to mitigate fluctuations in investor flows than to boost an economy that has low lending rates monetary policy channels are different for different economies diaz de leon said in what he described as his last interview of 2019 in mexico probably due to its low penetration in financing as a percentage of gdp it has a credit channel and sensitivity to interest rates different than other economies and yet we re an economy very open to capital flows he added he said however that the central bank isn t pre announcing future policy actions and will make its decision based on data available at the time of its meetings dissenting votes diaz de leon said that mexico s minimum wage hike of 20 for 2020 is expected to have a moderate effect on inflation but that there are risks of a greater impact in its quarterly inflation report in february banxico could update its projections as more information becomes available he said he wouldn t respond to recent comments from fellow board member gerardo esquivel who said on twitter that those who criticize the wage hike seem to be using arguments from economy 101 two out of five board members have repeatedly voted against the majority and for deeper half point cuts amid concerns over an economy that dipped into a technical recession earlier this year in contrast to the prior three decisions only one member voted for a deeper half point cut in the december 19 meeting all five members voted said diaz de leon after speculation arose that either esquivel or jonathan heath the two who had sought deeper cuts in previous meetings had been absent both esquivel and heath were appointed by president andres manuel lopez obrador who has said in the past that he d like to see lower rates at the end of 2020 the president will get a chance to name a third member when javier guzman s term expires giving the president a majority of appointees on the board that shouldn t be a point of concern said diaz de leon we trust that the legal requirements and procedures that need to be carried out will result in the right candidates being picked for the board of governors as has happened in the past he said source bloomberg com 2019 bloomberg l p

by richard bernstein advisors rather than write yet another short term year ahead report it might be much more fruitful to investigate secular investment changes market leadership always changes decade by decade and the leadership of the past decade which are now lauded as core investments seem highly unlikely to be the leadership of the next decade globalization has historically acted like an expanding and contracting accordion and our long standing hypothesis has been that the accordion is contracting politics both inside and outside the united states have been supporting our contention trade barriers the fraying of alliances populist governments and even military tensions are all on the rise content continues below advertisement chart 1 shows the baker bloom and davis economic policy uncertainty index for trade there have been two periods of extreme trade policy uncertainty the initial period of the early 1990s was the beginning of the modern period of globalization nafta was implemented and there was significant uncertainty regarding the implications of increased global trade and flexible supply chains today s unprecedented uncertainty nearly twice the uncertainty associated with nafta is clearly associated with the repercussions of the reversal of free trade chart 2 shows the us trade balance nafta certainly contributed to the deterioration of the us trade balance but that was expected because of the opening of freer trade with more productive economies since 2008 potentially the true end of globalization there has been a noticeable change in the trade balance s trend the balance may have deteriorated during the past two years but the longer term downtrend appears to be broken some might consider our thoughts about the end of globalization as extremely bearish but we view them simply as highlighting a potentially potent secular change in the global economy that could present significant long term investment opportunities we are aware these themes may run counter to today s consensus market leadership will naturally shift if the global economy changes but investors tend to be slow to acknowledge these changes and prefer to follow past momentum accordingly here are several secular investment themes one should put in a portfolio time capsule to be opened on december 31 2029 1 inflation 2 emerging markets vs venture capital 3 tech becomes dreck 4 gold inflation returns for the first time in the past 30 40 years both us monetary and fiscal policies are explicitly pro inflation yet investors continue to largely shun asset classes that benefit from higher inflation despite this noticeable policy change few investors seem to be considering the combination of the upward inflation pressures of reduced globalization and the us s current pro inflation policies economic theory suggests that globalization allows production to shift to the most productive regions and that improvement in productivity increases competition which puts downward pressure on prices in fact globalization and global competitive pricing was one of the primary reasons us inflation was secularly lower than many forecasted chart 3 shows globalization s downward pressure on us prices because core import price increases were consistently below the us core cpi in other words the us has been importing deflation the end of globalization implies less competition production shifting to less productive regions and upward rather than downward pressure on prices chart 4 highlights that us productivity measured by the oecd as gdp per hour worked is not competitively strong this further suggests a shift of production from more competitive economies to the us could result in higher inflation the us simply does not have a modern enough and competitive enough public and private infrastructure to support a broad production increase without prices also increasing there are also shorter term inflation pressures that investors are largely ignoring 1 current monetary policy is pro inflation the fed has a dual mandate of low unemployment and stable prices and the fed just lowered rates three times the fed can t be worried about employment because it is a mere 3 5 which is a multi decade low thus the only justification for easing policy is to support higher prices in fact there has recently been some discussion within the fed system regarding raising the fed s inflation target from 2 0 to 2 5 we can never remember the us central bank ever suggesting a goal of higher baseline inflation 2 fiscal policy is pro inflation one must remember that tariffs by definition are always inflationary the goal of a tariff is to raise the prices of imports so that domestic companies can compete on level ground raising prices on a broad scale is called inflation
on december 21 2019 president alassane ouattara of cote d ivoire and emmanuel macron of france announced a major currency reform in several west african francophone countries in 2020 eight west african countries belonging to the west african economic and monetary union waemu will rename their cfa franc to eco benin burkina faso cote d ivoire guinea bissau mali niger senegal and togo as part of this agreement french officials will no longer be represented on the governing bodies of these african central banks and member states will no longer keep half their foreign reserves in france reported france 24 but the currency reform struck a nerve with many netizens who feel that the change does little to address the harsh legacy of french colonialism in west africa where many nations are still indebted to france originally called the franc of the french colonies of africa the cfa franc currency morphed later into the franc of the african financial community in west africa the financial cooperation in central africa was established in 14 former french colonies upon gaining independence the central african economic and monetary community cemac made up of chad cameroon the central african republic democratic republic of congo equatorial guinea and gabon is not currently part of the agreement though it also uses a version of the cfa franc also pegged to the euro the french franc became the benchmark for the cfa franc after world war ii according to financial analyst frances coppola in 1999 when france took up the currency of the european union the euro was hard pegged to the cfa both versions of the cfa franc are hard pegged to the euro when the cfa franc was first created it was pegged to the french franc at 50 cfa francs to 1 french franc it was devalued in 1994 and then remained at 100 to 1 until france adopted the euro in 1999 at that point the french franc was converted to the euro at 6 55957 to 1 the cfa franc s currency exchange rate thus became 655 957 to 1 euro where it remains pegged to this day a legacy of french colonial debt despite this largely symbolic break from a colonial history with france 14 countries have remained indebted to france since their liberation from them in the 1960s benin burkina faso senegal cote d ivoire mali niger togo cameroon central african republic guinea bissau equatorial guinea chad congo brazaville and gabon through a colonial pact france forced these countries to put 85 percent of their foreign reserve into france central bank under the control of the french minister of finance journalist mawuna koutonin wrote in 2014 koutonin and other critics essentially called this foreign reserves deposit system a colonial era tax others argue that this is an exchange for the guarantee of a more stable currency and unlimited convertibility into any currency according to africa check those who defend this deposit system argue that it has offered financial stability to these nations since independence but critics see this enforced debt as part of a harsh legacy of dependence on france african leaders who refuse are killed or victim of a coup those who obey are supported and rewarded by france with a lavish lifestyle while their people endure extreme poverty and desperation koutonin wrote many recognize that france would not hold the power it does without its dependence on the billions deposited through this system former french leader jacque chirac once stated that without africa france will slide down into the rank of a third power on twitter feminist scholar and writer judicaelle irakoze outlined all the ways in which the 14 former french colonies in west africa have been indebted to france through this foreign reserves deposit system since december 21 over 20 000 netizens have shared irakoze s twitter thread that schools readers on the history of french colonization and the ways in which former colonies are still locked into debt since i can t sleep a thread on france and the 14 african countries who still pay tax colonies up to now i know we cannot compare colonizers but france as a state continues to the most racist and white supremacist and thriving on colony taxes feminist in chief judicaelle_ december 21 2019 irakoze details how in 1958 when guinea fought for independence the french who lived in guinea caused mass destruction ahmad sékou touré resisted and became the first president of guinea and attempted to cut ties completely with france between 1965 1975 when burkina faso became independent from france in 1960 thomas sankara attempted to cancel their agreement to hold at least 50 percent of their foreign reserves in france and tried to cut ties but was killed months later subsequent leadership restored the foreign reserves deposit agreement writer rosebell kagumire notes the irony of the currency change announcement on the same day as sankara s birthday on this holy day that is thomas sankara s birthday and coloniser announces half withdrawal from the economies of african countries france must end this nonsense a their being a guarantor of new african currency in 2019 is shameful and shows how long we still have to go rosebell kagumire rosebellk december 22 2019 when mali became independent from france in 1961 resistance fighter modibo keita the first president of mali actively tried to sever ties with france he was eventually overthrown and later died as a prisoner for years mali agreed to hold at least 50 percent of their foreign reserves in france and in 1963 togo also agreed to hold at least 50 percent of their foreign reserves in france irakoze sees this as a kind of colonial era tax like koutonin and continued in her twitter thread to explain the various ways in which leaders who resisted france paid with their lives with either assassinations or coups new currency move at odds with regional goals the economic community of west african states ecowas also plans to launch a regional currency called eco by 2020 that is not pegged to the euro the new york times described president alassane ouattara of cote d ivoire s move to peg the new currency to the euro as a hijacking of the eco that will likely disrupt ecowas plans this is because the seven other ecowas countries all have separate currencies with heavy government restrictions on their exchange rates established in 1975 ecowas is made up of benin burkina faso cape verde gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau ivory coast liberia mali niger nigeria senegal sierra leone and togo to float a common currency all 15 ecowas countries must meet the following criteria a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product inflation of 10 percent or under and debts worth less than 70 percent of gdp but none of these countries have achieved these criteria reports the afp the continuation of colonization in june 2019 chihombori quao former ambassador of the african union au to the united states stated that france takes over 500 billion from francophone african countries based on a pact they forced these countries to sign before they were granted independence she made these remarks in a presentation the pact for the continuation of colonization and is known to have strong views toward french colonization in africa chihombori quao was fired by the au on november 1 2019 for her criticism of france in january this year luigi di maio italian deputy prime minister accused the french of exploiting africa and fueling migration maio said that france had never stopped colonizing tens of african states the bbc reported maio further stated that were it not for africa france would rank 15th among world economies not in the top six the currency name change is symbolic and historic but it does not undo years of french colonization in west african francophone countries editor s note an earlier version of this post referred to the foreign reserves deposit system as a colonial era tax on january 2 2020 we updated the post to clarify what is meant by colonial era tax and also clarify the terms of the foreign reserves deposit system between french and former colonies in west africa

speak at any more meetings after he tried to talk about the valuation later in october according to people familiar with the discussions motassim al ma ashouq the top aramco executive in charge of the

often agree to buy into an ipo earlier than others becoming cornerstone shareholders on the deal aramco s banks pitched from china to singapore russia to malaysia everywhere they got a polite thanks but no thanks al rumayyan 49 who had no experience of the oil and gas industry before becoming aramco chairman felt betrayed by the very same wall street bankers who had told him that securing a us 2 trillion ipo was possible saudi arabia had a tough choice go ahead lose face and settle for a valuation below us 1 5 trillion and attract foreign investors or delay the deal perhaps forever riyadh keen to restore the kingdom s standing after the murder of jamal khashoggi opted for a third way ignore foreign investors and sell the aramco shares at home the government would pressure wealthy local families many of whom had members locked up in riyadh s ritz carlton in 2017 and bring in a few friends in the middle east region including funds controlled by the governments of the united arab

wall street already stung by the collapse of wework s ipo and uber technology inc s chronic under performance aramco is another embarrassment after offering unrealistic valuations to win a place on the deal the world s most famous banks were unable to deliver attracting scorn from their client and derision from investors now many banks face the prospect of not getting paid for nearly four years of work the fact the ipo happened at all this year was a surprise the deal has been in the works since early 2016 when prince mohammed told the economist newspaper he thought privatization would aid his vision 2030 campaign to modernize the oil dependent saudi economy but the sale initially scheduled for 2018 was delayed several times as the saudi leadership grappled with where to list it and how much it was worth advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content by the start of this year then aramco chairman and oil minister al falih believed the ipo was in the deep freeze and he hoped the deal would go away for good but the crown prince and al rumayyan who headed the sovereign wealth fund that would get the proceeds were still keen he sought advice photo by chris ratcliffe bloomberg files throughout the stop start ipo one banker played a key role although he rarely sought the limelight the boutique operation of michael klein a veteran wall street dealmaker who d gone out on his own when he wasn t made ceo of citigroup inc during the financial crisis advised aramco directly helping the company s chairman to select the banks which would handle the ipo alongside lazard ltd and moelis co al rumayyan appointed his firm as an independent financial adviser if anyone could have warned al rumayyan

2021 but in the summer al rumayyan became anxious the u s china trade war was going to cause an economic slowdown sending crude prices tumbling and ruling out an ipo for several years the royal palace panicked thinking oil prices were about to crash said a person who has worked on the ipo for nearly four years they saw two options rush the ipo immediately or forget about it until much much later first saudi arabia tried to juice the oil market cutting production to 9 6 million barrels a day more than 700 000 barrels a day below its official opec quota for the kingdom it was an unprecedented move even so the price of oil briefly dropped to close to us 55 a barrel in august below the us 60 to us 70 a barrel range that was needed to support the ipo al rumayyan convinced time was running out decided the deal needed to be fast tracked persuading prince mohammed that if he wanted an ipo he should put him in charge paid the price al falih who mixed administrative ability with an abrasive style paid the price for his opposition he was removed as aramco chairman on sept 3 and replaced by al rumayyan he was replaced as oil minister a few weeks later the ipo s champion now sat at the head of the company advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content with little time to organize the deal aramco ruled out an international listing but al rumayyan still wanted to bring billions in international money into saudi arabia to ensure success and positive coverage from analysts he hired almost every bank on wall street including goldman sachs morgan stanley bank of america and jpmorgan al rumayyan and amin nasser the aramco ceo thought the ipo would be fairly easy only a few months earlier the company had sold its first massively oversubscribed international bond perhaps blinded by that success aramco walked into the ipo under prepared despite four years of work executives still struggled to answer simple questions from foreign investors its legal team couldn t produce documents on time and nobody at aramco could convincingly explain why aramco deserved its us 2 trillion valuation then in the early hours of sept 14 a fleet of drones attacked the very heart of the saudi oil industry the giant crude processing plant at abqaiq in the kingdom s eastern desert half of aramco s production was

but said there would be no interruption in oil supplies to customers around the world oil traders looking at photos of punctured tanks and mangled pipework were skeptical many assumed the ipo would

damage could be fixed in weeks bankers on the ipo were told to keep working saudi arabia did everything they could to boost the valuation tax rates were cut further and investors were offered

doctor copper diagnoses the health and wellbeing of the global economy since china is the demand side of the equation in the copper market the trade war weighed heavily on the price of the red metal in 2018 and 2019 the high in copper in 2018 was more than 30 cents per pound above the peak in 2019 the bearish price action caused decreased earnings for companies that extract copper from the crust of the earth codelco the state owned chilean group is the worldâ s single largest copper producer controlling around 20 of total global reserves freeport mcmoran nyse fcx is the leading publicly traded copper producer in 2018 the companyâ s output was about 3 8 billion pounds of the red metal north american production accounted for 1 4 billion pounds while 1 3 billion came from south america and 1 1 billion from indonesia fcx had a market cap of 19 billion at a share price of 12 85 on monday dec 23 fcx shares follow the price of copper and since early october the stock made a substantial comeback copper has been in the crosshairs of the trade war what began as a trade dispute between the us and china in 2018 escalated into a trade war in 2019 the chinese consume more of the red metal than any other nation on earth weakness in the chinese economy weighed on the price of copper as well as some of the other industrial commodities at the same time a bullish trend in the us dollar added to price weakness source cqg the monthly chart shows that after hitting a high at 3 3220 per pound in late 2017 the price of copper rose to a lower peak of 3 3155 in june 2018 the mid 2018 high came on the back of supply fears during a strike at leading chilean mines however the impact of the escalating trade war weighed on the price of copper throughout the second half of 2018 sending the price to a low of 2 5430 per pound in early 2019 optimism over trade negotiations lifted copper to a peak at 2 9955 in april 2019 but a further escalation of the trade war in early august sent the price to its lowest level since late 2016 when it fell to 2 4675 per pound in early september since then the price has moved higher on the long term chart the price momentum indicator crossed to the upside below neutral territory and the relative strength metric moved above a neutral reading open interest the total number of open long and short positions in the comex futures market recently turned higher moving from under 210 000 to over 260 000 contracts as the price broke out to the upside a move above technical resistance on dec 13 the us and china announced they had reached an agreement on a â phase oneâ trade deal to de escalate the trade war copper had been trading in a range between just over 2 50 and 2 73 per pound on the continuous futures contract on comex since rebounding after the early september low at 2 4675 per pound source cqg the weekly chart highlights that the copper futures market put in a bullish reversal during the first week of december the trade deal pushed the price above the top end of the trading range and over 2 80 per pound nearby march comex futures were trading at 2 8120 per pound on monday dec 21 source lme the chart of three month lme copper forwards illustrates that the price broke out over the 6 000 per ton level which had been a technical resistance point for the base metal inventories continue to decline the london metals exchange is home to the worldâ s most liquid international copper market since the lme offers forwards rather than futures consumers and producers flock to the lme to hedge requirements and production forwards are available for all delivery dates throughout the year while the comex futures market only offers delivery periods on monthly contracts since industrial market participants tend to favor the lme more copper flows into and out of lme approved storage facilities than comex warehouses over recent months lme stockpiles have been dropping which is a sign of increased demand for the nonferrous metal source lme kitco the chart shows that since early september lme copper warehouse stocks declined from almost 340 000 to 154 450 metric tons as of dec 20 lme stockpiles of copper have more than halved in a little over three months which tends to be a bullish sign for the red metal source comex kitco meanwhile stockpiles of copper in comex approved warehouses have only increased by around 5 000 metric tons as they moved from 35 000 to 40 000 tons since october the overall decline in stockpiles is supportive of the price of copper stan druckenmiller likes copper for 2020 stanley druckenmiller the legendary hedge fund manager and former chief investment officer for george soros recently told bloomberg that he currently owns copper he s also long us and japanese equities as well as the canadian and australian dollars while he holds short positions in the yen and long dated treasuries all of his positions should profit in a stable to growing global economy druckenmiller said â we have negative real rates everywhere and negative absolute rates in a lot of places with that kind of unprecedented monetary stimulus relative to the circumstances itâ s hard to have anything other than a constructive view on the marketâ s risk and the economy intermediate term â a long copper position is a wager on global and chinese economic growth fcx shares come back from the abyss the price action in freeport mcmoran shares was the same as in the copper futures and forward markets source barchart fcx dropped to a low at 8 43 per share on oct 9 on a combination of weakness in both the copper and stock markets however the turnaround in equities and copper caused a rebound to its most recent high of 13 38 per share on dec 13 as fcx moved 58 7 off its low the next level of technical resistance in the stock is at the mid april high at 14 68 per share in 2018 fcx peaked at 20 25 if stan druckenmiller is correct copper could have a lot more upside than most analysts expect over the coming months low interest rates around the world and progress on a comprehensive trade deal would likely push the price of the base metal a lot higher the next level to watch on the upside in the copper market is 3 per pound if copper decides to challenge that level fcx shares could move significantly higher

the conventional wisdom about the 2017 trump tax cuts is that they did not work out the way republicans promised the white house claimed that slashing the corporate tax rate would spark a boom in business investment eventually leading to higher wages for workers and putting thousands of extra dollars in the average family s pocket according to everyone from the international monetary fund to the congressional research service there is little evidence that those predictions have come true but that isn t stopping some of the tax cuts architects from declaring mission accomplished kevin hassett who chaired the white house s council of economic advisers and gary cohn who helped spearhead tax reform during his time as head of trump s national economic council have popped up in the wall street journal this week with an op ed titled tax reform has delivered for workers it s a valiant exercise in assembling a few true data points to paint an overall misleading picture the argument that cutting corporate taxes would lead to higher wages for the middle class is a multi part bank shot first the thinking goes the prospect of higher after tax profits in the u s would lead companies to invest more in their businesses by buying more software machinery and such second this investment boom would make workers more productive and as a result they d earn more hassett and cohn try to argue that each of these predictions has come true take business investment they point out capital spending was 4 5 percent higher in 2018 than economists had predicted it would be before the tax law passed this is true the imf s economists have pointed out the same exact thing based on their modeling however they concluded that u s companies likely weren t investing because of the tax cut rather companies were likely just responding to increased demand in the economy the trump tax cuts may have helped by putting money in people s pockets and increasing the federal deficits but that wasn t the story republicans told advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement the bigger problem for hassett and cohn s story is that after that temporary pop in early 2018 business investment has cratered for the past two quarters it has actually been a drag on the economy advertisement some of the investment bust has been due to trouble in the oil and gas industry but even if you subtract those sectors you can see the same basic story after a bump in early 2018 investment tails off advertisement advertisement investment would likely be in better shape were it not for donald trump s trade war which began to rage in earnest around the middle of 2018 this is a public relations tragedy for the tax cuts supporters and an empirical challenge for economists who would like a clear sense of what the gop s bill actually accomplished but in the end all it means is that the corporate tax cuts benefits were small enough that they seem to have been swamped by other factors advertisement having made a less than persuasive case that the tax cut meaningfully boosted business investment cohn and hassett move on to claiming that it has already paid off for workers in 2017 hassett s cea went so far as to suggest that the average household would see its income rise by 4 000 to 9 000 within a few years due to the corporate cuts now he says things are ahead of schedule advertisement over the past year nominal wages for the lowest 10 of american workers jumped 7 the growth rate for those without a high school diploma was 9 the median worker benefited as well but much less so helping to begin closing the income inequality gap and about that 4 000 real disposable personal income per household has increased 6 000 since the tax cuts were passed advertisement advertisement wages for low income workers have indeed been growing but most economists would attribute that to minimum wage hikes and the gradually strengthening labor market which has been on basically the same slow upward trajectory since the the obama years as for trends in disposable income there s not exactly a huge swerve in 2018 and again much of the improvement is likely due to the generally hot economy created by the administration s deficit spending advertisement advertisement hassett and cohn see this criticism coming and try to pre empt it they write advertisement advertisement those who say that the strong economy under president trump is merely a continuation of past trends are in full scale denial before mr trump took office in january 2017 the congressional budget office forecast the creation of only two million jobs by this point the economy has in fact created seven million jobs since january 2017 at the same time the federal reserve s median forecast had the unemployment rate inching up toward 5 almost 1 5 percentage points higher than the current 50 year low again all of these data points are true but all they indicate is that both the cbo and federal reserve underestimated how much more the u s job market could improve before we reached full employment something they ve both since admitted none of these facts tell us much about the influence of trump s tax cuts two years in the most honest case for the trump tax cuts is that if the administration hadn t passed them the economy might be in even worse shape due to the president s trade war though it s hard to tell for obvious reasons the ex administration officials defending the cuts can t admit that either publicly or to themselves they re bound to keep doing victory laps no matter how unconvincing their case might be
