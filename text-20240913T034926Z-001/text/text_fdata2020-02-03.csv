many factors affect the emerging markets including the 2020 us presidential election alex rolandi canvasses opinion about bonds and equities since the us federal reserve cut interest rates in july for the first time in a decade redemptions from emerging markets equity funds have been slowing while bond funds have ebbed and flowed following two more cuts and after five months in the red emerging market equity funds finally saw a relative trickle of positive flows again in october 12 3 million 11 1 million globally according to data from morningstar emerging market bonds funds saw a strong 16 months up until april 2018 more recently in august 2019 they suffered outflows of 2 9 billion then in september there was another turnaround as 4 3 billion was invested followed by just over 2 billion in october from an equity perspective the prospects of select emerging markets especially in europe and asia rank high relative to other asset classes particularly relative to us and australian equities as well as real estate investment trusts says michael kruger investment analyst at morningstar investment management south africa in the medium term depressed developed market bond yields should drive investment toward higher yield emerging market sovereign debt despite this tentative turning of the tides for both asset classes emerging market growth is strongly linked to the uncertainties defining our times investor appetite for emerging markets is cyclical with sentiment influenced by trade issues between the us and china as well as future gdp growth expectations as many countries have export economies says kruger however central banks in emerging market countries have generally been more prone to lowering rates this year against a backdrop of slowing economic growth expectations declining inflationary pressures and easing monetary policy in developed countries this makes some managers positive chetan sehgal a portfolio management director at franklin templeton believes the trend is set to continue with rate cuts in various markets such as india brazil russia and mexico coupled with improving earnings expectations and relatively undemanding valuations and dividend yields we believe the outlook for em equities remains attractive he says we expect overall corporate earnings to strengthen in 2020 as upturns in some parts of the technology sector offer support but for maarten jan bakkum senior emerging markets strategist at nn investment partners nnip the emerging markets growth outlook for the next few years is bleak for both bonds and equities his not so optimistic forecast is due to limited growth coming from demographic drivers and from china as well as negative growth due to higher levels of protectionism global interest rates remain low enough to sustain yield searching portfolio flows to em debt but these positive capital flows are unlikely to compensate for the expected slowdown in foreign direct investments to em he says a decade of underperformance for emerging markets equities should create room for better performance in the future but if growth remains as weak as we think it will it remains hard to make a convincing investment case and though em debt looks better at first sight with local currency bond yields at 5 the risk reward is challenging particularly given the increasing political risk he says taking to the streets one risk that is not being priced in according to gustavo medeiros a fixed income portfolio manager at ashmore group is inequality inequality is the big issue that we re going to have to grapple with over the next ten years in terms of causing volatility and concern basically because of the way the system is anchored today he says not only was inequality the root cause of the 2008 mortgage debt crisis medeiros says but it is also a driving force behind demonstrations in many emerging markets countries from beirut to santiago in lebanon for example where people have been taking to the streets since october bond prices are at 30 year to date following a mass sell off while the index is up around 12 according to medeiros a lot also hangs on us politics especially with an election on the horizon next year where the inequality issue could also play a key part he says inequality is going to be a very strong force for people and how policy decisions are made across the world that s going to start becoming a reality in 2020 with the election in the us the outcome of the us election could have a trickle down effect on emerging markets if the government swings to the left it would have a very strong impact in terms of capital flows which could cause a spike in volatility though medeiros says volatility tends to create opportunities for active investors at some point when enough is priced in you can take the opportunity to buy some exposure if us chinese or european growth plummets emerging markets will suffer but even if the us economy grows at a better rate compared to the rest of the world and the fed looks to raise rates it won t bode well for emerging markets assets either says sergey dergachev lead emerging markets debt manager at union investments a lot depends on the path of the us dollar this year it has not been that volatile but a key risk will be strong and quick us dollar appreciation and the risk of more renminbi depreciation and its second round effect for emerging markets currencies he says bakkum at nnip says em currency risk remains high due to the difficult global trade outlook and the depreciation trend of the chinese renminbi trade uncertainty remains and protectionism is likely to affect growth in em in the coming years for morningstar s kruger there are competitive advantages in several technology and consumer related companies according to him they have the potential to extend their market positions even in a challenging environment franklin templeton s sehgal is of a similar mind technology is expected to become a key driver of global growth especially in emerging markets where companies have been using innovation and technology to leapfrog and disrupt traditional business models he says increasing internet use in emerging markets is also accelerating opportunities for efficiencies cost savings and the general ease of doing business sehgal adds medeiros describes emerging markets as like small ships navigating this sea of liquidity which is mainly driven by the reserve currency of the world and with the european central bank already at what he calls a reverse rate any more interest rate cuts could also have unintended consequences country selection choosing which emerging market and which sector to invest in is key dergachev says this year we had positive support from monetary policy feedback but there are many geopolitical hotspots like hong kong latin america chile ecuador bolivia etc it will be crucial to determine where country specific risks will either ebb down or where there is potential that they will critically affect institutions and a country s credit metrics so careful country and corporate selection will matter a lot one country medeiros cites for opportunities for those who can stomach them is argentina where bonds are trading at around 45 cents to the dollar assets are relatively cheap there and there is the prospect of a strong rebound from the perspectives of both bond prices and economic growth if alberto fernandez proves to be more pragmatic increases taxation of the market closes the primary deficit of their fiscal account so it becomes a primary surplus argentina could reprofile its debt he says polina kurdyavko senior portfolio manager and head of emerging market debt at bluebay asset management also sees opportunity in argentina where other investors might shy away the recent uptick in volatility has created a good entry point and even in argentine assets we believe that the market reaction is overdone she says kurdyavko believes that risk posed by trade issues economic growth and brexit have decreased emerging markets credit remains resilient with a supportive backdrop for emerging markets performance the generally dovish tone from global central banks is counterbalancing weakened global growth the value trade remains in foreign exchange and higher yielding hard currency bonds but for this trade to perform there needs to be less concern over a global recession mainstream em countries with positive reform momentum will be rewarded she says whatever unfolds in the geopolitical landscape next year is going to be crucial for emerging markets investors both in equities and debt thanks to factors like the us election one thing investors can be sure of is that this uncertainty is not going away any time soon especially when it comes to the us and chinese diplomatic squabbles it is a recurring theme that crops up again and again any escalation in the us china trade war says medeiros and all bets are off 2019 funds europe

if long term negative rates haven t worked in sweden what chance do they have of working for the economies of the eurozone the riksbank s decision to hike its repo rate to zero in late december has symbolic importance as it was the first central bank to cut rates below zero a decade earlier given sweden s growth is now lower than it has been for most of the past 10 years the decision supports the view that the risks to financial stability are now becoming so great that negative rates cannot go on bankers whose job it is to transmit monetary policy to the real economy have long argued that negative rates could end up doing the opposite of what they are meant to do or even lead to bank runs according to many of them as it is practically and sometimes legally impossible to charge the bulk of depositors a negative rate the only way to offset the money they lose on central bank deposits and government bonds could be to lend less and to raise prices for credit to businesses and consumers german bank chiefs egged on by the local press have been the most vocal in expressing the view that negative rates are not just ineffective but irresponsible

as you fly into doha and cast your eyes over the gleaming towers of west bay or the striking new facilities emerging on a daily basis both in central doha and education city it can appear incredulous to countenance qatar as a nation afflicted by the resource curse indeed it s gdp per capita of 72 700 marks it out as one of the wealthiest nations on earth yet in an economy whereby 60 of gdp and 85 of exports are derived from oil and gas the need to diversify is evident not least due to the decline in oil prices since 2014 that many believe is the new normal and the political and economic blockade that was imposed by some neighboring countries in june 2017 the concept of the resource curse emerged a few hundred years before the term was first coined by economist richard auty the term describes the apparent difficulty many countries that have abundant natural resources have in terms of growing their economy institutions and macroeconomic policies in resource rich arab economies a new book by kamiar mohaddes jeffrey b nugent and hoda selim explores the topic through the particular lens of the six arab nations that make up the gulf cooperation council the authors argue that the challenges imposed by the resource curse are not so much due to the price volatility of the resource itself but rather weak institutions qatar have attempted to overcome this via the creation of the qatar foundation in 1995 which aimed to unlock the human potential of the nation via education innovation and entrepreneurship in the two decades since the institution was forged they believe that the foundations for success have been established with the centrepiece being the education city district that houses the educational scientific and entrepreneurial efforts of the city unlocking human potential the 12 square km education city is home to a wide range of k12 and higher education facilities including seven international campuses from institutions such as northwestern texas a m and carnegie mellon universities with hec paris then offering executive mbas from its campus in west bay rather than providing a full range of programs each university specializes in particular disciplines so that each campus provides a complementary rather than competitive experience the international universities are complemented by qatar s own hamad bin khalifa university which offers a range of research and graduate programs collectively there are over 3 000 students from over 60 nations on campus undertaking 55 programs these facilities help to fulfil the ultimate ambition of the project to create good jobs for the citizens of qatar by equipping them with the skills they need to thrive in the future of work the campus is complemented by a wide range of facilities that aim to capture and combine the knowledge produced on campus via a range of dedicated research facilities qatar foundation research development and innovation strives to develop innovative solutions both for the unique challenges faced by the nation but also those of the wider world the centrepiece of the institute is the qatar science technology park which brings together applied research and technology innovation incubation and entrepreneurship the park which has been operating for a decade has created a free zone and business park to encourage multinationals to rub shoulders with researchers and startups to generate technology driven businesses the park aims to support enterprises at all stages of their development from early stage product development via the incubation center to venture capital and joint r d projects for more advanced startups to date 20 startups have been created and sit alongside over 50 multinational companies including cisco microsoft general electric and a who s who of the global oil and gas community core sectors the park is bordered by a range of biomedical innovation facilities including the qatar biobank and genome programme and the cutting edge sidra medicine teaching and research hospital specializing in women s and children s health these projects sit alongside the national ai strategy that was published recently with biomedicine and precision medicine one of the pillars of the strategy to date over 15 000 qataris have had their genomes sequenced as part of the qatar biobank project with the ultimate aim to ensure all citizens have their genomes sequenced in what is hoped will be the world s leading repository of arab genomic data in the world this will feed into the country s precision medicine program that underpins the qatari national health strategy 2018 2022 which strives to take a more preventative and community based approach to medicine and healthcare this is especially important as the country suffers disproportionately from lifestyle related conditions such as diabetes and obesity with nearly 70 of mortalities occurring from these conditions room to grow how effective have these efforts been in driving the qatari economy the results to date have been mixed there is no doubt that the city is awash with incredibly impressive facilities but as mohaddes et al highlight the inefficient spending patterns that are common in oil rich countries combined with insufficient public scrutiny results in significant waste while it s not clear that qatar has personally been beset by waste or more mendaciously fraudulent behavior the output from the considerable investments has been modest indeed many of the gleaming facilities are crying out for the throngs of people and energy that most characterize the very best innovation hubs around the world this is undoubtedly a long term project and while the economic realities of the country do allow for a long term investment approach to be taken there remains uncertainty about whether the oil price slump and the economic blockade have provided a sufficiently significant burning platform to trigger the kind of changes required to truly shift the economy away from hydrocarbon based industries indeed while direct revenue from oil and gas fell to below 50 of gdp in 2017 from 60 1 in 2011 this hides the fact that much of the other half of the economy is heavily reliant on the oil and gas sector for its revenues this is reflected in the 80 of exports that are accounted for by hydrocarbons nordic noir norway has been in a similar situation since oil and gas deposits were discovered in the north sea shelf in the 1960s since then oil and gas has regularly contributed around 20 of national gdp with figures in 2012 revealing that the petroleum sector constituted 23 of gdp 30 of government revenues and 52 of total exports with estimates that nearly half of the petroleum resources on the norwegian shelf have been produced however it s clear that diversification of the economy is necessary the factors prevalent during the dutch disease of the 1960s have also been evident in norway as high oil revenues led to increased public consumption which in turn led to higher domestic costs indeed in 2012 hourly wage costs in the manufacturing sector were 69 higher than the european union average and while this can t account for the entire decline in norwegian manufacturing it has undoubtedly played a part nonetheless research comparing norway s economic performance with that of sweden who are in many ways comparable albeit with no oil and gas reserves to speak of found that even accounting for petroleum based revenue the norwegians were doing better than their scandinavian neighbors so how did they do this research from the university of oslo suggests the quality of norway s political institutions is a major factor with strong protection of property rights reliable public bureaucracy and minimal corruption all contributing to robust economic growth indeed the global innovation index produced each year by insead and wipo places norway in 19th place with the quality of their institutions ranked 2nd in the entire world this contrasts noticeably with qatar who linger in 65th place in the index and are a noticeable outlier in the high income countries covered by the report for their poor performance qatari institutions perform particularly poorly with the overall business environment ranked down in 91st place globally which coupled with poor performance in primary and secondary education and the investment landscape hamper their attempts to diversify the economy successfully institutional advantage the relative advantage norway enjoys is therefore partly explained by the fact that the country already had a long and stable tradition of democratic rule by the time oil was discovered this has allowed the country to not only attempt to sustain some of the success historically achieved in manufacturing but flesh out complimentary prominence in related areas such as shipbuilding and geological services for instance the katapult ocean aims to build on the country s rich nautical heritage to encourage entrepreneurship in areas such as ocean health and aquaculture while startuplabs accelerator specialize in industrial iot startups that build upon the engineering expertise established after extracting oil and gas from the north sea over the past 50 years in many ways the slump in oil prices since 2014 have been a boon to the startup scene in oslo as so many engineers have either voluntarily or otherwise chosen to deploy their talents in non oil disciplines with many choosing to create startups as recent research from mit reminds us older entrepreneurs are often better equipped to handle the rigors of startup life not least because they have well developed networks from their career to date that can be tapped into when growing the business this is certainly the case in norway where many of the corporate partners required to prove the merits of an idea are the large oil and gas companies so many of the entrepreneurs have left despite this there are clear challenges in attracting the best talent away from the relative comfort and security of a well paid job in the oil and gas sector when comparing the regular income provided by such work with the high levels of uncertainty inherent in entrepreneurial life and it can be challenging to make the leap especially when one has family responsibilities and a mortgage to pay this can be compounded by government policies that continue to tax stock options highly if we re to truly diversify from oil and gas then it really is all about talent and ensuring we have the best skills possible alexander woxen founding partner and ceo of startuplab told me recently so access to talent is really a key value driver and what can prevent us from growing and the tax system is really not helping us to square the opportunity cost considerations people inevitably have when thinking about leaving their job the region has had a degree of success with companies like freyr raising several million to build a giga factory in the rana municipality but even this has largely been overshadowed by neighboring northvolt with the swedish green battery company raising 1 billion to help develop its own facility in skelleftea curating inspiration so what lessons can be learned from both countries a recent paper from stanford s nicholas bloom recently highlighted five things that hey believes are crucial to the development of successful innovation ecosystems r d tax incentives with their data suggesting that reducing the cost of r d by 10 results in an increase in innovation by 10 norwegian companies can apply for a 20 deduction in r d costs with qatar offering complete tax exemption for activities conducted at the qatar science and technology park promote free trade with research published last year highlighting how valuable free trade can be to innovation especially in the medium term this is an area that norway has an obvious advantage in as a member of the european economic area provides access to the european single market whereas qatar is blocked off from neighboring economies support skilled migration with research showing that an increase in overseas college graduates of just 1 can increase the number of patents per capita by 18 norway benefits from free movement from across the eu and while not without hurdles for non eu citizens is a diverse and welcoming country qatar has arguably gone even further with just 10 of the qatari population native although with just 44 of the population having completed upper secondary school education they lack the high skill levels seen in other rapidly advancing countries train workers in stem fields with a number of policy options to improve the number of people studying a science technology engineering or maths discipline this is an ongoing challenge for most countries but with both norway and qatar having small native populations there is a clear requirement to improve the ability to attract talent from overseas provide direct grants for r d with bloom arguing that many research projects have long time horizons and are therefore best suited to government backing as they can take a longer term view both nations have sovereign wealth funds but it was noticeable that norway was primarily investing its windfall overseas in a bid to both keep inflation under control locally and to try and get the best returns in previous research bloom has highlighted how innovation today is getting more expensive so state support is likely to be ever more important in the coming years it is perhaps in the talent side of the equation that both countries struggle with the most there is an overwhelming temptation when developing innovation districts to focus on the built environment and it s hard to escape the huge amount of construction being undertaken in doha streets subways faculties and hospitals are all being built but such infrastructure is not enough to make a community innovative 22 barcelona provides a notable illustration of this as the district which is widely regarded as one of the pioneering developments of its type has many of the hallmarks of innovation districts there is a strong sense that the best ecosystems emerge organically out of existing strengths however not least as research has shown that london s techcity district grew faster before the government decided to back it than afterwards what both barcelona and london enjoy however is an extremely high density of people who are dispersed across clusters of public spaces these are what the world economic forum refers to as the glue of innovation systems as such ecosystems typically thrive because of the dense social interactions and networks that spread across innovative hotspots we literally get smarter by being around other smart people universities research parks and so on can undoubtedly help to promote those connections but so too can bars parks and cafes as such there is much to be said for the deliberate curation of networks to support the kind of social interactions that are so crucial to the innovation process this is especially important in cities like doha and oslo which are beset by not only high costs of living but very lucrative incumbent economies that draw talent to them the right ingredients there is a strong sense that norway is perhaps further along on this journey than qatar and indeed a recent paper from berkeley suggested that growth in the country would have remained strong even without discovering oil in the 1960s the data shows that without oil norway would have developed similarly to western europe the authors say it shows that the real gdp growth for a quarter of a century may have been 1 8 per year without oil compared to 3 3 with oil indeed it s perhaps illustrative to look at the performance of neighbors such as denmark and sweden both of whom sit at the top of imperial college london s recent european index of digital entrepreneurship systems which ranks european nations by virtue of their ability to support startups both sweden and denmark for instance score very highly for the quality of institutions the market conditions for startups and the quality of human capital the success of the nordic nations should perhaps come as no surprise as helsinki was rated the best startup ecosystem in the world in last year s global startup ecosystem report which was compiled based upon data from over 1 million companies spread across nearly 100 cities around the world whilst the us remains the market leader in terms of share of vc investment there is a clear shift towards europe and asia with china leading the pack clayton christensen has famously chronicled the challenges organizations have in diversifying income after achieving success with a particular product or service and the resource curse is that writ large on a national scale qatar and norway are at different stages of their personal battle to move on from the oil bonanza that has so enriched both countries and while it s fair to say that petroleum looms large over both economies there is equally no shortage of effort to encourage fresh industries to emerge time will tell just how effective both prove in overcoming the resource curse and ensuring a prosperous future post oil

address tuesday night ap photo j scott applewhite washington ap a portrait of a robust u s economy is sure to take center stage tuesday night when president donald trump gives his third state of the union address it is an economy that has proved solid and durable yet hasn t fulfilled many of trump s promises nine months before the election the economy keeps growing steadily if only modestly unemployment is at a half century low and consumers the lifeblood of the u s economy continue to spend average pay is rising faster than when trump took office three years ago with the largest percentage gains now going to lower wage workers some research has found that this trend which began in 2015 before trump s election partly reflects higher state minimum wages economists warn though that the u s expansion now in its record long 11th year faces an array of threats most immediately china s viral outbreak has paralyzed business with the world s second largest economy starbucks and apple have closed stores in china airlines have canceled flights and companies like general motors have halted production there all of that could shave one half percentage point off annual growth in the first quarter goldman sachs economists forecast though they expect the slowdown to be offset by a rebound in the second quarter boeing s decision to halt production of its 737 max should also weaken growth in the first six months of the year economists say america s manufacturing sector is struggling a reflection of trump s trade conflicts high corporate debt levels have sparked concerns some analysts also worry that the federal reserve s ultra low interest rates have helped feed risky bubbles in stocks or other assets and leading democratic presidential candidates especially sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built their campaigns to unseat trump around the message that the economy remains rife with inequality with many workers struggling to afford college housing or health care advertisement advertisement trump is unlikely on tuesday night to let any such doubts temper his standard message that under his stewardship the economy is thriving unemployment is falling the stock market is roaring and that the best days are still ahead i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before trump said last month in davos switzerland america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before yet what trump calls an unprecedented boom is by many measures not all that different from the solid economy he inherited from president barack obama economic growth was 2 3 in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of obama s eight year presidency during the 2016 campaign trump boasted that his tax cut plan would boost annual growth to 4 a year a brisk pace not seen since the late 1990 s instead trump along with obama is one of two presidents since world war ii not to have presided over a year of at least 3 growth and few economists think the economy will hit that target this year advertisement advertisement most analysts do think trump s tax plan helped accelerate growth just not the way he had promised the trump tax cuts were a sugar high that juiced the economy temporarily said ryan sweet an economist at moody s analytics it put more money in americans pockets boosting consumer spending the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 a healthy pace though the same as in 2015 the year before trump s election story continues the administration had vowed though that the tax cuts would do more than just encourage americans to shop more the president s top economists had said the tax cuts would accelerate corporate investment in machinery computers and plants and office towers all the new equipment would make workers more efficient the argument went thereby boosting productivity the amount of output for each hour worked greater productivity is one of the two main drivers of growth the other is an increase in the number of u s workers both have slowed in the past decade most economists partly blame trump s trade wars particularly with china the trade conflicts have left american companies much less certain about the economic outlook and reluctant to expand and invest business investment shrank in the final three quarters of last year nor have trump s business tax cuts and deregulation made the economy more dynamic the growth of new companies has remained anemic since the 2008 downturn larger businesses continue to dominate many industries from technology to retail to finance advertisement advertisement all this is occurring despite significant stimulus trump has assailed fed chairman jerome powell for not cutting rates more though the fed s benchmark rate is now in a range of just 1 5 to 1 75 a very low level historically and one that is considered stimulative and increased federal spending has also helped support the economy the congressional budget office last week projected that the government s deficit will top 1 trillion annually for the next decade the accelerator is on the floor but the vehicle is moving surprisingly slowly larry summers treasury secretary under president bill clinton and a top economic adviser to obama said in early january trump has also recently highlighted what he calls a blue collar boom pointing to solid wage gains for lower paid workers and healthy hiring in construction and manufacturing but manufacturing jobs barely grew last year as factories hunkered down in the midst of the trade wars and since trump s inauguration manufacturing jobs have grown more slowly than employment overall has advertisement advertisement ernie goss an economics professor at creighton university in nebraska said the midwest s job growth has amounted to only about three quarters of the national pace since trump took office farmers have also suffered from the trade war he said as retaliatory tariffs by china have clobbered exports of soybeans and other commodities that in turn has hurt manufacturers of farm equipment including deere and caterpillar everyone says the economy is going great guns but that is everything except agriculture and manufacturing goss said what s more most campaign battleground states in the midwest such as michigan pennsylvania ohio and wisconsin have lost factory jobs in the past year most manufacturing job growth under trump s presidency has occurred in southern and western states said dean baker senior economist at the liberal center for economic and policy research with fewer union members in those states those factory jobs generally pay less in fact manufacturing jobs once a bulwark of the postwar middle class now pay less on average than private sector jobs overall baker said still despite modest growth the record economic expansion has endured under trump there is also evidence that its durability has in recent years finally started to benefit a broader swath of americans advertisement advertisement more people have come off the sidelines and found jobs defying most economists predictions the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who are employed is now higher than before the great recession and last year wages rose nearly 5 for the poorest one fourth of americans far more than for the richest fourth whose pay rose just 3 according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta still richer americans hold a far greater portion of the nation s wealth with the top 10 owning nearly 85 of the value of all stocks the moderate pace of growth has meant that so far the economy isn t showing evident signs of excess akin to the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial meltdown this expansion has been slow and steady but it could run for a few more years sweet said there s no reason that it needs to die sometimes slow and steady does win the race
washington ap a portrait of a robust u s economy is sure to take center stage tuesday night when president donald trump gives his third state of the union address it is an economy that has proved solid and durable yet hasn t fulfilled many of trump s promises nine months before the election the economy keeps growing steadily if only modestly unemployment is at a half century low and consumers the lifeblood of the u s economy continue to spend average pay is rising faster than when trump took office three years ago with the largest percentage gains now going to lower wage workers some research has found that this trend which began in 2015 before trump s election partly reflects higher state minimum wages economists warn though that the u s expansion now in its record long 11th year faces an array of threats most immediately china s viral outbreak has paralyzed business with the world s second largest economy starbucks and apple have closed stores in china airlines have canceled flights and companies like general motors have halted production there all of that could shave one half percentage point off annual growth in the first quarter goldman sachs economists forecast though they expect the slowdown to be offset by a rebound in the second quarter boeing s decision to halt production of its 737 max should also weaken growth in the first six months of the year economists say america s manufacturing sector is struggling a reflection of trump s trade conflicts high corporate debt levels have sparked concerns some analysts also worry that the federal reserve s ultra low interest rates have helped feed risky bubbles in stocks or other assets and leading democratic presidential candidates especially sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built their campaigns to unseat trump around the message that the economy remains rife with inequality with many workers struggling to afford college housing or health care advertising trump is unlikely on tuesday night to let any such doubts temper his standard message that under his stewardship the economy is thriving unemployment is falling the stock market is roaring and that the best days are still ahead i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before trump said last month in davos switzerland america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before yet what trump calls an unprecedented boom is by many measures not all that different from the solid economy he inherited from president barack obama economic growth was 2 3 in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of obama s eight year presidency during the 2016 campaign trump boasted that his tax cut plan would boost annual growth to 4 a year a brisk pace not seen since the late 1990 s instead trump along with obama is one of two presidents since world war ii not to have presided over a year of at least 3 growth and few economists think the economy will hit that target this year most analysts do think trump s tax plan helped accelerate growth just not the way he had promised the trump tax cuts were a sugar high that juiced the economy temporarily said ryan sweet an economist at moody s analytics advertising it put more money in americans pockets boosting consumer spending the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 a healthy pace though the same as in 2015 the year before trump s election the administration had vowed though that the tax cuts would do more than just encourage americans to shop more the president s top economists had said the tax cuts would accelerate corporate investment in machinery computers and plants and office towers all the new equipment would make workers more efficient the argument went thereby boosting productivity the amount of output for each hour worked greater productivity is one of the two main drivers of growth the other is an increase in the number of u s workers both have slowed in the past decade most economists partly blame trump s trade wars particularly with china the trade conflicts have left american companies much less certain about the economic outlook and reluctant to expand and invest business investment shrank in the final three quarters of last year nor have trump s business tax cuts and deregulation made the economy more dynamic the growth of new companies has remained anemic since the 2008 downturn larger businesses continue to dominate many industries from technology to retail to finance all this is occurring despite significant stimulus trump has assailed fed chairman jerome powell for not cutting rates more though the fed s benchmark rate is now in a range of just 1 5 to 1 75 a very low level historically and one that is considered stimulative advertising and increased federal spending has also helped support the economy the congressional budget office last week projected that the government s deficit will top 1 trillion annually for the next decade the accelerator is on the floor but the vehicle is moving surprisingly slowly larry summers treasury secretary under president bill clinton and a top economic adviser to obama said in early january trump has also recently highlighted what he calls a blue collar boom pointing to solid wage gains for lower paid workers and healthy hiring in construction and manufacturing but manufacturing jobs barely grew last year as factories hunkered down in the midst of the trade wars and since trump s inauguration manufacturing jobs have grown more slowly than employment overall has ernie goss an economics professor at creighton university in nebraska said the midwest s job growth has amounted to only about three quarters of the national pace since trump took office farmers have also suffered from the trade war he said as retaliatory tariffs by china have clobbered exports of soybeans and other commodities that in turn has hurt manufacturers of farm equipment including deere and caterpillar everyone says the economy is going great guns but that is everything except agriculture and manufacturing goss said what s more most campaign battleground states in the midwest such as michigan pennsylvania ohio and wisconsin have lost factory jobs in the past year most manufacturing job growth under trump s presidency has occurred in southern and western states said dean baker senior economist at the liberal center for economic and policy research with fewer union members in those states those factory jobs generally pay less in fact manufacturing jobs once a bulwark of the postwar middle class now pay less on average than private sector jobs overall baker said advertising still despite modest growth the record economic expansion has endured under trump there is also evidence that its durability has in recent years finally started to benefit a broader swath of americans more people have come off the sidelines and found jobs defying most economists predictions the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who are employed is now higher than before the great recession and last year wages rose nearly 5 for the poorest one fourth of americans far more than for the richest fourth whose pay rose just 3 according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta still richer americans hold a far greater portion of the nation s wealth with the top 10 owning nearly 85 of the value of all stocks the moderate pace of growth has meant that so far the economy isn t showing evident signs of excess akin to the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial meltdown this expansion has been slow and steady but it could run for a few more years sweet said there s no reason

shanghai plunges on virus fears to lead fresh asia market retreat several countries have banned flights to and from china as the coronavirus continues to spread fanning concerns about the impact on the world economy hong kong chinese equities plunged almost eight percent monday as nervous traders returned from their extended lunar new year break hit by fears that the coronavirus which has killed more people in china than sars could hammer the country s economy the steep losses led another sell off across asia following a painful week for global markets with the virus death toll topping 360 people and more than 17 000 infected and governments around the world banning flights to and from china analysts have warned the outbreak could slash global growth this year throwing a spanner in the works just as economies were showing signs of stabilising after more than a year of slowing observers said that with china being a crucial part of the global trade infrastructure other countries would also be badly hit while major corporate names have frozen or scaled back their chinese operations threatening the global supply chain the world health organization invoked a global health emergency last week but stopped short of recommending trade and travel restrictions that could have had a bruising effect on china the situation is terrible and china s economy will be dealt a bad blow said stephen innes at axicorp as will association of southeast asian nations countries that have built significant trade ties with china even more so those countries that are tourist destination spots and

10 percent limit while the main iron ore contract fell by its maximum allowed eight percent copper crude and palm oil also sank by their limit the near term impact on chinese gdp growth is likely to be large oxford economics said in a research note considering the affected areas account for just over 50 percent of total chinese output we think this could lead china s annual gdp growth to slow to just four percent in the first quarter it added down from a previous forecast of six percent growth remaining upbeat still jp morgan asset management strategist tai hui remained relatively upbeat about the future as the number of infections is still likely to rise in the weeks ahead we would expect the chinese onshore equity market to come under pressure he said in a note that said we still believe that economic activities should recover swiftly once the number of new cases comes under control and subsequently market sentiment should also improve this could take time to play out but this

lahore indian government s 428 billion budget for fiscal year 2020 21 has been announced at a time when the country s economy is stuck in its biggest economic slump in more than a decade though the economic wizards in new delhi are optimistic that the country s economic growth will rebound and hit a rather promising 6 per cent to 6 5 per cent mark during the forthcoming financial year starting april 1 it is imperative to note that just last year india was the world s fastest growing major economy currently the fifth largest economy in world india s debt had come down to 48 7 per cent in march 2019 from 52 2 per cent in march 2014 but snags have obstructed the smooth sailing since although indian businessmen were expecting of their government to inject more fiscal stimulus into an

government unveiled a modest budget that one economist called smoke and mirrors but it offered no large stimulus program to provide more jobs or money in the pockets of india s 1 3 billion residents most of who barely get by through farming or work in the informal economy nor did the budget propose any additional support for the country s weakened financial institutions this was indian union finance minister nirmala sitharaman s second budget which thus means that she became the second women ever to present an indian budget twice after the late indira gandhi this also incidentally was the second budget after the premier narendra modi led national democratic alliance had returned to power for a second successive term more highlights from indian budget 2020 21 according to the economic

much has been written about the dramatic increase in income and wealth inequality in the united states over the last four decades this volume of literature not only warns about the injustice of our current system but also raises alarm that extreme inequality poses a serious risk to our democracy concern about inequality is at least as old as the united states itself writing in 1792 about the necessity and dangers of political parties james madison made the connection between excessive wealth and its political influence the great object should be to combat the evil 1 by establishing a political equality among all 2 by withholding unnecessary opportunities from a few to increase the inequality of property by an immoderate and especially an unmerited accumulation of riches 3 by the silent operation of laws which without violating the rights of property reduce extreme wealth towards a state of mediocrity and raise extreme indigence towards a state of comfort excessive wealth concentration in madison s view was as poisonous for democracy as war in war he continued the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes wealth is power an extreme concentration of wealth means an extreme concentration of power the power to influence government policy the power to stifle competition the power to shape ideology together these amount to the power to tilt the distribution of income to one s advantage this is the core reason why the extreme wealth of some can reduce what remains for the rest why part of the income of today s superrich can be earned at the expense of the rest of society that s what earned john astor andrew carnegie john rockefeller and other gilded age industrialists their epithet of robber barons an extreme concentration of wealth means an extreme concentration of power the power to influence government policy the power to stifle competition the power to shape ideology in much of the twentieth century the u s tax system protected against such extreme disparities but far from curbing this trend the tax system in the last four decades has instead reinforced it the three traditional progressive taxes the individual income tax the corporate income tax and the estate tax have all weakened the top marginal federal income tax rate has fallen dramatically from more than 70 percent every year between 1936 and 1980 in fact often higher peaking at 94 percent during the final years of world war ii to 37 percent in 2018 the income threshold at which this rate kicked was several million of today s dollars corporate taxes which are progressive in the sense that they tax corporate profits a highly concentrated source of income have declined from about 50 percent in the 1950s and 1960s to 16 percent in 2019 and estate taxes on large bequests are now almost negligible due to a high exemption threshold many deductions and weak enforcement a renewed political demand calls for progressive taxation to reverse these trends to achieve greater tax justice raise revenue to pay for important public goods and curb the rise of inequality indeed two major presidential candidates have proposed wealth taxes in january 2019 elizabeth warren proposed a progressive wealth tax on families or individuals with net worth above 50 million with a 2 percent marginal tax rate and 3 percent above 1 billion she revised that to 6 percent rate for billionaires in the fall and in september 2019 bernie sanders proposed a similar wealth tax starting at 32 million with a 1 percent marginal tax rate rising to 5 percent for billionaires and 8 percent for deca billionaires the key difference between these proposals and earlier proposals for instance the one made by edward wolff in these pages as well as existing or past wealth taxes in other countries is the high exemption thresholds fewer than 0 1 percent of u s families would be liable for the warren or sanders wealth tax both presidential candidates rightly believe that a wealth tax of the sort they have proposed would fill a critical gap in the u s tax system it would ensure greater tax justice by requiring that the ultra wealthy pay taxes commensurate with their ability to pay but in the long run an ambitious wealth tax with marginal tax rates high enough for billionaires could also help address the threat that extreme inequality poses for democracy a wealth tax the proper way to tax the ultrarich why isn t the income tax sufficient for taxing the superrich because many of the most advantaged members of society possess substantial wealth but low taxable income maybe they own a valuable business that does not make much in profits but which everybody anticipates will be immensely profitable in the future think amazon before 2016 or as is more frequently the case they may structure their already profitable business so that they generate little taxable income consider warren buffett according to forbes buffett owned 62 billion in wealth in 2015 we don t know the exact rate of return on his wealth but let s assume it was 5 percent on this conservative assumption buffett s real pre tax income his share of his company berkshire hathaway s profits was 3 1 billion that year buffet paid federal income taxes of about 1 8 million corresponding to an effective income tax rate of around 0 058 percent in much of the twentieth century the u s tax system protected against extreme disparities in wealth far from curbing this trend the tax system in the last four decades has only reinforced it buffett s effective income tax rate is so low because his wealth primarily consists of shares in his company berkshire hathaway which does not pay dividends when berkshire hathaway buys other corporations buffett forces them to stop paying dividends too as a result buffett s wealth has been accumulating for decades free of individual income taxes within his firm eliminating dividends and perpetually reinvesting profits boosts berkshire hathaway s share price year after year one share now costs some 330 000 thirty times more than it cost in 1992 to finance any spending buffett need only sell a few shares by selling forty shares for example he can move 13 million to his personal bank account he then pays tax a modest one on the small amount of capital gains he just realized and that s the limit of his tax liability raising the top marginal income tax rate wouldn t affect the tax bill of buffett or bezos notably since neither of them has much taxable income in the first place that s how billionaires such as buffett jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg can live almost tax free today and that s how the top 400 richest americans have come to pay the lowest tax rate of any income group when we combine all taxes at all levels of government federal state and local we find the u s tax system indeed now resembles a giant flat tax that becomes regressive at the very top all groups of the population pay effective tax rates of roughly 28 percent with mild progressivity up to the top 0 1 percent and a significant drop at the top where effective tax rates fall to 23 percent for the 400 richest americans what about corporate taxes the 1950s u s tax system was highly progressive in large part thanks to very high effective corporate tax rates of about 50 percent those rates applied to profitable companies which at the time had relatively few owners typically individuals rather than institutional investors now however more than 20 percent of listed u s equities are owned by foreigners and 30 percent by pension funds who accumulate assets on behalf not only of the wealthy but also of middle class taxpayers so even a massive hike in the corporate tax rate would not create the same degree of tax progressivity as the 1950s the corporate tax is too blunt an instrument to restore tax justice why isn t the income tax sufficient for taxing the superrich because many of the most advantaged members of society possess substantial wealth but low taxable income raising the estate tax also would not have the desired effect why should we wait for decades until today s superrich americans contribute to the public coffers neither a more progressive income tax nor a higher corporate tax nor a stronger estate tax would significantly address the lack of progressivity at the very top end of the scale the way to address this problem is by taxing wealth itself today and not at some long distant future date to be sure a wealth tax will never replace the income tax top executives athletes or movie stars who earn a lot of income but own relatively little wealth can be appropriately taxed by a comprehensive income tax the goal of a wealth tax is more limited it is just one part of the strategy to ensure that the ultra wealthy are taxed according to their ability to pay taxing the superrich involves three essential and complementary ingredients a progressive income tax a corporate tax and a progressive wealth tax the corporate tax ensures that all profits are taxed whether distributed or not it acts as a de facto minimum tax on the affluent the progressive income tax ensures high earners pay more and a progressive wealth tax gets the ultrarich to contribute to the public coffers even when they including buffett manage to realize little taxable income how to tax wealth leverage the power of markets a progressive wealth tax is possible because wealth is well defined at the very top in contrast to realized income which can be artificially reduced wealth is defined as the market value of one s assets net of all debts the taxable income buffett reports to the internal revenue service is a tiny amount of his true economic income he is worth more than 50 billion with a wealth tax at a rate of 3 percent for fortunes above 1 billion buffett would pay more than 1 5 billion a year taxing the superrich involves three essential and complementary ingredients a progressive income tax a corporate tax and a progressive wealth tax not all forms of wealth are as easy to value as buffett s shares in berkshire hathaway and this has been a concern for critics of a wealth tax who believe it would be impossible to implement fairly a publicly traded company such as berkshire hathaway has a well defined market value because buffett s wealth is fully invested in berkshire hathaway shares it is easy to tax him but the affluent can also own shares in unlisted also called private or closely held businesses other forms of wealth such as art or jewelry are sometimes hard to value too but these concerns as well as the claim that wealth taxation failed in many european states so they must fail here are often exaggerated the valuation problems can be addressed if there is political will to address them here s how modern capitalist economies such as the united states have well defined property rights and put value on most assets around 70 percent of the wealth owned by the top 0 1 percent richest americans consists of listed equities bonds shares in collective investment funds real estate and other assets with easily accessible market values for the remaining 30 percent mostly shares in private businesses valuation raises fewer problems than you might think in the first place shares in large private businesses though not publicly listed are regularly bought and sold even before lyft and uber went public in 2019 for instance people could invest in the ride sharing service companies private companies regularly issue new stock to banks venture capitalists wealthy individuals and other accredited investors with sufficiently deep pockets these transactions put a de facto value on private firms in some cases however no transactions take place for years especially for mature private businesses controlled by a small number of owners for example 90 percent of the agribusiness giant cargill the largest private company in the united states is owned by 125 or so members of the cargill and macmillan families cargill shares were last transacted in 1992 when 17 percent of the company s shares were sold for 700 million thus valuing the entire firm at a bit more than 4 billion here is a striking case where taxing wealth might seem hopeless what is the value of cargill today almost thirty years after this last share transaction isn t any estimate fraught with countless risks of abuse but in fact taxing the cargills and the macmillans equitably is not impossible to start with the tax administration can take the 1992 cargill valuation and update it based on any changes in the company s profits since then if the company makes three times more profits today it is not unreasonable to believe it is worth about three times as much as in 1992 of course much more information ought to inform a reliable valuation what sort of information data about cargill s direct competitors that are listed as public companies such as archer daniels midland and bunge for example to better assess cargill the irs can consider how much a dollar of earnings made by these firms is valued by the stock market it can study how the price to earnings ratios of archer daniels midland and bunge have changed since 1992 every day hundreds of financial analysts value private firms in this and more complex ways the united states with its sophisticated financial markets has no shortage of expertise in this area drawing on standard private sector practices it would not be terribly complicated for the irs to come up with a reasonable estimate of cargill s market value at the end of each year neither a more progressive income tax nor a higher corporate tax nor a stronger estate tax would significantly address the lack of progressivity at the very top end of the scale but suppose that the macmillans and cargills feel cheated by the irs they complain that the irs out of an interest in generating tax revenue over estimates the value of their firm perhaps cargill has fundamentally changed since 1992 in ways that state of the art valuation techniques may fail to capture perhaps it has weaknesses that its competitors do not share what is to be done the heart of the problem is a missing market while there is an active liquid market for archer daniels midland and bunge shares no such market exists for cargill s stock the solution to this problem in our view is for the government to step in and create the market that is missing the irs would give the option to cargill s shareholders to pay the wealth tax in kind with cargill shares rather than in cash if they used this option which they would do only if they believed the irs valuation was exaggerated the tax authority would then sell the shares to the highest bidders on a market open to any and all bidders venture capitalists private equity funds foundations or other rich families interested in acquiring a stake in the agribusiness giant this solution addresses the challenge head on just as a well functioning income tax should treat all income equally a good wealth tax should treat all assets in the same way at their current market value if some values are missing the solution is to create them and there is nothing better to create a market value than well to create a market for a wealth tax imposed at an average rate of 2 percent cargill s shareholders would hand in 2 percent of their shares each year or the cash equivalent if they prefer to retain full control of the company as with buffett s berkshire hathaway there would be no getting away transforming cargill s shares into cash would be the government s job concerns about implementing a wealth tax are often exaggerated these problems can be addressed if there is political will to address them this solution also addresses another frequent objection to wealth taxation the problem of liquidity very rich people may have a lot of wealth and yet not enough income to pay their tax bills isn t it unfair to force them to pay a tax when they don t have cash in hand to be frank liquidity concerns are often put forward in bad faith the claim that people worth hundreds of millions of dollars may not have enough cash to pay a million dollars in tax does not often withstand scrutiny if ultrarich individuals say they have little cash it is usually because they choose to realize little income to avoid the income tax they organize their own illiquidity but suppose the liquidity problems are real the most relevant case might be a highly valued startup that makes no profit generating cash each year may turn out to be complicated or costly for anyone whose primary source of wealth is shares in the company since young firms typically do not pay dividends in that case allowing taxpayers to pay in kind with shares of the companies addresses the problem because the wealth of the rich mostly consists of equity and equity in contrast to real estate can always be divided it can be used to pay for the tax if the wealth tax can be paid with assets rather than cash a progressive wealth tax isn t harder to implement in practice than a progressive income tax the middle class already pays taxes on its wealth in the form of property taxes the wealthy don t since most of their wealth consists of financial assets which are exempt from the property tax in the nineteenth century by contrast the property taxes of most states fell on all assets both real and financial in the beginning of the twentieth century the united states pioneered the progressive taxation of property with its federal estate tax now moribund before turning its back on this distinguished tradition the united states was at the forefront of the democratic regulation of property via the tax system curbing wealth concentration a radical wealth tax from 1930 to 1980 the top marginal income tax rate in the united states averaged 78 percent it exceeded 90 percent from 1951 to 1963 these quasi confiscatory top rates championed by franklin delano roosevelt and his successors in office were meant to reduce the income of the superrich not simply to achieve tax justice but to compress the income distribution these tax rates applied to extraordinarily high incomes only the equivalent of more than several million dollars today only the ultrarich were subjected to them in 1960 for example the top marginal tax rate of 91 percent started kicked in at an income threshold that was nearly 100 times the average national income per adult the equivalent of 6 7 million in income today the merely rich high earning professionals medium size company executives people with incomes in the hundreds of thousands in today s dollars were taxed at marginal rates in a range of 25 percent to 50 percent in line with what is typical nowadays for instance in states such as california and new york when you count state income taxes an ambitious wealth tax would not only ensure greater tax justice but also help address the threat that extreme inequality poses for democracy according to the evidence the policy of quasi confiscatory tax rates for sky high incomes achieved its objective from the late 1930s to the early 1970s income inequality fell the share of pre tax national income earned by the top 1 percent was reduced by a factor of two from close to 20 percent on the eve of world war ii to barely more than 10 percent in the early 1970s in 1960 for example only 306 families earned more than 6 7 million in taxable income a year the threshold above which income was imposed at 91 percent this tax policy reflected the view that extreme inequality hurts the community that the economy works better when rent extraction is discouraged indeed the economy grew strongly in the mid twentieth century and that unfettered markets lead to a concentration of wealth that threatens our democratic and meritocratic ideals extreme wealth concentration like carbon emissions imposes a negative externality on the rest of us the point of taxing carbon is not to raise revenue but to reduce carbon emissions and the point of high tax rates on the very highest incomes is not fundamentally to fund government programs they are aimed at reducing the income of the ultra wealthy the reason for reducing those incomes is not as critics sometimes say to give vent to envy it is to disrupt privilege impede rent extraction and protect democracy when 90 cents out of any extra dollar earner will go to the irs we will disincentivize negotiating a 20 million salary earning millions by creating a zero sum financial product and spiking the price of patented drugs quasi confiscatory tax rates equalize the distribution of pre tax income make the market place more competitive and limit the concentrations of economic power that pave the way for undemocratic concentrations of political power to see how wealth taxation might work to reduce such concentrations of wealth and power let s contrast a moderate with a radical wealth tax a moderate wealth tax say with marginal tax rates of 2 percent above 50 million and 3 percent above 1 billion would generate a lot of revenue about 1 percent of gdp each year according to our estimates consider now a more radical wealth tax with a marginal tax rate of 10 percent above 1 billion a person with 1 billion in wealth would pay the same 19 million as under a moderate wealth tax a radical wealth tax would not make it harder to become a billionaire it would make it harder to remain a multi billionaire a person with 2 billion would pay almost 5 percent a year a decabillionaire such as david geffen 9 percent and a centibillionaire such as bezos 10 percent instead of 3 percent with a moderate wealth tax just as roosevelt s 90 percent top marginal income tax sharply reduced the number of families earning more than 10 million of today s dollars a radical wealth tax would eventually lead to a reduction in the number of multi billionaires more than collecting revenue it would de concentrate wealth a wealth tax to limit the rise of inequality or de concentrate wealth forbes 400 share of total wealth actual vs with wealth taxation since 1982 there would still be multibillionaires no doubt if a wealth tax of this higher sort had been in place over the last decades zuckerberg would still be worth 21 billion in 2018 instead of the 61 billion recorded by forbes why because zuckerberg s wealth has grown at a rate of 40 percent a year since 2008 when he first became a billionaire a 10 percent annual wealth tax would not have stopped his stratospheric ascent but a more mature billionaire such as bill gates would be worth only 4 billion instead of 97 billion in 2018 because he has been a billionaire for over three decades now giving the radical tax more time to reduce his wealth if a radical wealth tax had been in place since 1982 most of the 400 richest americans would still be billionaires in 2018 but they would be only one third as wealthy as they currently are see graph 1 their share of u s wealth would be similar to what it was back in 1982 before the wealth inequality took off a radical wealth tax would have raised 250 billion in revenue from the 400 richest americans alone in 2018 that is more than 1 percent of gdp but if such a tax had been in place since 1982 it would have only raised 66 billion from the 400 wealthiest families in 2018 while a moderate wealth tax despite its much lower rate would have yielded almost as much about 50 billion in the long run a radical wealth tax erodes top fortunes so much that it reduces the

billionaires are soaring poor kids are losing more the plight of impoverished children anywhere should evoke sympathy exemplifying as it does the suffering of the innocent and defenseless poverty among children in a wealthy country like the united states however should summon shame and outrage as well unlike poor countries sometimes run by leaders more interested in lining their pockets than anything else what excuse does the united states have for its striking levels of child poverty after all it has the world s 10th highest per capita income at 62 795 and an unrivalled gross domestic product gdp of 21 3 trillion despite that in 2020 an estimated 11 9 million american kids 16 2 of the total live below the official poverty line which is a paltry 25 701 for a family of four with two kids put another way according to the children s defense fund kids now constitute one third of the 38 1 million americans classified as poor and 70 of them have at least one working parent so poverty can t be chalked up to parental indolence yes the proportion of kids living below the poverty line has zigzagged down from 22 when the country was being ravaged by the great recession of 2008 2009 and was even higher in prior decades but no one should crack open the champagne bottles just yet the relevant standard ought to be how the united states compares to other wealthy countries the answer badly it has the 11th highest child poverty rate of the 42 industrialized countries tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd winnow that list down to european union states and canada omitting low and middle income countries and our child poverty rate ranks above only spain s use the poverty threshold of the oecd 50 of a country s median income 63 178 for the united states and the american child poverty rate leaps to 20 the united states certainly doesn t lack the means to drive child poverty down or perhaps even eliminate it many countries on that shorter oecd list have lower per capita incomes and substantially smaller gdps yet as a unicef report makes clear have done far better by their kids our high child poverty rate stems from politics not economics government policies that since the 1980s have reduced public investment as a proportion of gdp in infrastructure public education and poverty reduction these were of course the same years when a belief that big government was an obstacle to advancement took ever deeper hold especially in the republican party today washington allocates only 9 of its federal budget to children poor or not that compares to a third for americans over 65 up from 22 in 1971 if you want a single fact that sums up where we are now inflation adjusted per capita spending on kids living in the poorest families has barely budged compared to 30 years ago whereas the corresponding figure for the elderly has doubled the conservative response to all this remains predictable you can t solve complex social problems like child poverty by throwing money at them besides government antipoverty programs only foster dependence and create bloated bureaucracies without solving the problem it matters little that the actual successes of american social programs prove this claim to be flat out false before getting to that however let s take a snapshot of child poverty in america sizing up the problem defining poverty may sound straightforward but it s not the government s annual official poverty measure opm developed in the 1960s establishes poverty lines by taking into account family size multiplying the 1963 cost for a minimum food budget by three while factoring in changes in the consumer price index and comparing the result to family income in 2018 a family with a single adult and one child was considered poor with an income below 17 308 20 2012 for two adults and one child 25 465 for two adults and two children and so on according to the opm 11 8 of all americans were poor that year by contrast the supplementary poverty measure spm published yearly since 2011 builds on the opm but provides a more nuanced calculus it counts the post tax income of families but also cash flows from the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc both of which help low income households it adds in government provided assistance through say the supplemental nutritional assistance program snap temporary aid to needy families tanf the children s health insurance program chip the national school lunch program nslp medicaid subsidies for housing and utilities and unemployment and disability insurance however it deducts costs like child care child support payments and out of pocket medical expenses according to the spm the 2018 national poverty rate was 12 8 of course neither of these poverty calculations can tell us how children are actually faring put simply they re faring worse in 2018 16 2 of americans under 18 lived in families with incomes below the spm line and that s not the worst of it a 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine study commissioned by congress found that 9 of poor children belong to families in deep poverty incomes that are less than 50 of the spm but 36 of all american children live in poor or near poor families those with incomes within 150 of the poverty line child poverty also varies by race a lot the rate for black children is 17 8 for hispanic kids 21 7 for their white counterparts 7 9 worse more than half of all black and hispanic kids live in near poor families compared to less than a quarter of white children combine age and race and you ll see another difference especially for children under five a population with an overall 2017 poverty rate of 19 2 break those under fives down by race however and here s what you find white kids at 15 9 hispanic kids at an eye opening 25 8 and their black peers at a staggering 32 9 location matters too the child poverty rate shifts by state and the differences are stark north dakota and utah are at 9 for instance while new mexico and mississippi are at 27 and 28 nineteen states have rates of 20 or more check out a color coded map of geographic variations in child poverty and you ll see that rates in the south southwest and parts of the midwest are above the national average while rural areas tend to have higher proportions of poor families than cities according to the department of agriculture in rural america 22 of all children and 26 of those under five were poor in 2017 why child poverty matters imagine for a moment this scenario a 200 meter footrace in which the starting blocks of some competitors are placed 75 meters behind the others barring an olympic caliber runner those who started way in front will naturally win now think of that as an analogy for the predicament that american kids born in poverty face through no fault of their own they may be smart and diligent their parents may do their best to care for them but they begin life with a huge handicap as a start the nutrition of poor children will generally be inferior to that of other kids no surprise there but here s what s not common knowledge a childhood nutritional deficit matters for years afterwards possibly for life scientific research shows that by age three the quality of childrens diets is already shaping the development of critical parts of young brains like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in ways that matter that s worth keeping in mind because four million american kids under age six were poor in 2018 as were close to half of those in families headed by single women indeed the process starts even earlier poor mothers may themselves have nutritional deficiencies that increase their risk of having babies with low birthweights that in turn can have long term effects on children s health what level of education they reach and their future incomes since the quality of nutrition affects brain size concentration and cognitive capacity it also increases the chances of having learning disabilities and experiencing mental health problems poor children are likely to be less healthy in other ways as well for reasons that range from having a greater susceptibility to asthma to higher concentrations of lead in their blood moreover poor families find it harder to get good health care and add one more thing in our zip code influenced public school system such children are likely to attend schools with far fewer resources than those in more affluent neighborhoods our national opioid problem also affects the well being of children in a striking fashion according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 2008 and 2012 a third of women in their childbearing years filled opioid based medication prescriptions in pharmacies and an estimated 14 22 of them were pregnant the result an alarming increase in the number of babies exposed to opioids in utero and experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth which is also known as neonatal abstinence syndrome or nas in medical lingo its effects a penn state study found include future increased sensitivity to pain and susceptibility to fevers and seizures between 2000 and 2014 the incidence of nas increased by a multiple of four in 2014 34 000 babies were born with nas which as a cdc report put it is equivalent to one baby suffering from opioid withdrawal born approximately every 15 minutes given the ongoing opioid crisis it s unlikely that things have improved in recent years and the complications attributable to nas don t stop with birth though the research remains at an early stage the opioid crisis only began in the early 1990s it suggests that the ill effects of nas extend well beyond infancy and include impaired cognitive and motor skills respiratory ailments learning disabilities difficulty maintaining intellectual focus and behavioral traits that make productive interaction with others harder at this point you won t be surprised to learn that nas and child poverty are connected prescription opioid use rates are much higher for women on medicaid who are more likely to be poor than those with private insurance moreover the abuse of and overdose deaths from opioids whether obtained through prescriptions or illegally have been far more widespread among the poor combine all of this and here s the picture from the months before birth on poverty diminishes opportunity capacity and agency and its consequences reach into adulthood while that rigged footrace of mine was imaginary child poverty certainly does ensure a future rigged society the good news though not in donald trump s america the race to a half decent life or better doesn t have to be rigged it needn t be this way but will be as long as trump is president can children born into poverty defy the odds realize their potential and lead fulfilling lives conservatives will point to stories of people who cleared all the obstacles created by child poverty as proof that the real solution is hard work but let s be clear poor children shouldn t have to find themselves on a tilted playing field from the first moments of their lives individual success stories aside americans raised in poor families do markedly less well compared to those from middle class or affluent homes and it doesn t matter whether you choose college attendance employment rates or future household income as your measure and the longer they live in poverty the worse the odds that they ll escape it in adulthood for one thing they re far less likely to finish high school or attend college than their more fortunate peers conversely as harvard economist raj chetty and his colleagues have shown kids life prospects improve when parents with low incomes are given the financial wherewithal to move to neighborhoods with higher social mobility rates thanks to better schools and services including health care as in that imaginary footrace the starting point matters but here the news is grim the social progress index places the united states 75th out of 149 countries in access to quality education and 70th in access to quality health care and poor kids are of course at a particular disadvantage yet childhood circumstances can be and have been changed and the sorts of government programs that conservatives love to savage have helped enormously in that process child poverty plunged from 28 in 1967 to 15 6 in 2016 in significant part due to programs like medicaid and the food stamp act started in the 1960s as part of president lyndon johnson s war on poverty such programs helped poor families pay for housing food child care and medical expenses as did later tax legislation like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our own history and that of other wealthy countries show that child poverty is anything but an unalterable reality the record also shows that changing it requires mobilizing funds of the sort now being wasted on ventures like america s multitrillion dollar forever wars certainly an increase in jobs and earnings can reduce child poverty wall street journal odes to donald trump s tax cuts and deregulation policies highlight the present 3 5 unemployment rate the lowest in 60 years a surge in new jobs and wage growth at all levels notably for workers with low incomes who lack college degrees this storyline however omits important realities programs that reduce child poverty help even in years when poor or near poor parents gain and of course are critical in bad times since sooner or later booming job markets also bust furthermore the magic that trump fans tout occurred at a moment when many state and city governments were mandating increases in the minimum wage employers who hired especially in heavily populated states like california new york illinois ohio and michigan had to pay more as for cutting child poverty it hasn t exactly been a presidential priority in the trump years not like the drive to pass a 1 5 trillion corporate and individual income tax cut whose gains flowed mainly to the richest americans while inflating the budget deficit to 1 trillion in 2019 according to the treasury department then there s that impenetrable powerful beautiful wall its estimated price ranges from 21 billion to 70 billion excluding maintenance and don t forget the proposed extra 33 billion in military spending for this fiscal year alone part of president trump s plan to boost such spending by 683 billion over the next decade as for poor kids and their parents the president and congressional republicans are beginning to slash an array of programs ranging from the supplemental nutritional assistance program to medicaid 1 2 trillion worth over the next 10 years that have long helped struggling families and children in particular get by the trump administration has for good measure rewritten the eligibility rules for such programs in order to lower the number of people who qualify the supposed goal to cut costs by reducing dependence on government never mind the subsidies and tax loopholes trump s crew has created for corporations and the super wealthy which add up to many billions of dollars in spending and lost revenue these supposedly work ethic driven austerity policies batter working families with young kids that for example desperately need childcare which can take a big bite out of paychecks 10 or more for all households with kids but half in the case of poor families add to that the cost of unsubsidized housing median monthly rent increased by nearly a third between 2001 and 2015 put another way rents consume more than half the income of the bottom 20 of americans according to the federal reserve the advent of trump has also made the struggle of low income families with healthcare bills even harder the number of kids without health insurance jumped by 425 000 between 2017 and 2018 when according to the census bureau 4 3 million children lacked coverage even before donald trump s election only one sixth of eligible families with kids received assistance for childcare and a paltry one fifth got housing subsidies yet his administration arrived prepared to put programs that helped some of them pay for housing and childcare on the chopping block no point in such families looking to him for a hand in the future he won t be building any trump towers for them whatever make america great again may mean it certainly doesn t involve helping america s poor kids as long as donald trump oversees their race into life

barrington m salmon if asked ivonne luces pineros would not call herself a refugee but two and a half months ago she like more than 4 million other venezuelans fled her country after years of deprivation a life threatening illness political turmoil and relentless punishing us sanctions washington urdupoint news sputnik 03rd february 2020 barrington m salmon if asked ivonne luces pineros would not call herself a refugee but two and a half months ago she like more than 4 million other venezuelans fled her country after years of deprivation a life threatening illness political turmoil and relentless punishing us sanctions she is living in bogota colombia with her daughter anyuli after a dangerous trek traveling from caracas mainly by bus car and walking the fact she recently underwent surgery made the journey even more perilous in addition luces pineros said she left behind her mother whom she misses greatly my mother is doing so so she s very weak she s still in venezuela caring for my sister who s wheelchair bound and who has a debilitating illness luces pineros told sputnik she s frail and sick it s hard for her to walk and have proper nutrition she s my rock and i m longing to see her luces pineros said she would never have left her homeland but conditions have gotten so bad it breaks my heart to say this but i had to leave in order to survive and not starve to death or die from a relapse or complications of my surgery luces pineros said it wasn t an easy decision just a matter of survival there are simply no other options january 23rd marked one year since opposition leader juan guaido opposing the outcome of the 2018 presidential election declared himself interim president the trump administration immediately backed guaido whom they coordinated with before the announcement and imposed crippling sanctions on the country this was all in a bid to oust president nicolas maduro just as venezuela was suffering through a deepening economic crisis other factors driving the crisis include over reliance on oil revenues at a time when global prices have plummeted and paralyzing and sometimes violent partisan wrangling between maduro supporters and opposition forces and there appears to be no end in sight to venezuela s economic spiral downward on january 29 the international monetary fund imf announced that the country s gross domestic product gdp is expected to drop by another ten percent in 2020 venezuela s real gdp has contracted by 65 percent since 2013 the imf said due to declining oil production hyperinflation collapsing public services and plummeting purchasing power luces pineros said she believes government corruption and mismanagement have also complicated the situation this has led to the exodus of approximately 4 3 million venezuelans the un estimated in a report last year in 2018 on average about 5 000 people left venezuela every day the report said caribbean and latin american countries are hosting an estimated 2 7 million of the total number of venezuelans who have left while other regions account for the rest colombia hosts the highest number of venezuelans with 1 1 million a group that now includes luces pineros among them it is followed by peru with 506 000 chile 288 000 ecuador 221 000 argentina 130 000 and brazil 96 000 mexico and countries in central america and the caribbean like trinidad and tobago are also hosting significant numbers of venezuelan refugees and migrants my mother encouraged me to leave venezuela in search of better opportunities and making sure i could get adequate medical care in colombia and also that eventually i would be able to help her financially but i m still longing to be back home in venezuela luces pineros said after being on the road for several weeks luces pineros stayed in the city of cucuta colombia until it was safe to continue her journey to bogota to reunite with her daughter anyuli well my journey was a few weeks and it was extremely rough she recalled my health is fine now but i am still feeling the effects of the surgery unfortunately luces pineros added during the journey she got very sick with bronchitis and flu like symptoms the treatment at the border was hard and now venezuelans have such a bad reputation that they don t want to accept any immigrants from venezuela anywhere in south america she said luces pineros said the massive exodus went beyond neighboring countries and included destinations such as the united states canada the european union and especially spain the countries i ve included in the list are for people who have the means most of the neighboring countries have a limit and now they don t want venezuelans in their country she said after finally reaching bogota luces pineros was able to rent a room at a boarding house for 350 pesos 18 usd a month she gets up every morning at 4 00 a m and works until 5 30 p m to try and make money to survive selling coffee herbal teas and bread to people for their morning commute although the situation is difficult luces pineros said she s a survivor the trump administration has been banking on a deadly assortment of sanctions the most recent being economic restrictions imposed on banks the oil industry government officials and other individuals and entities to oust maduro in fact senior us officials have even publicly expressed a desire to use sanctions to drive a stake through the heart of the socialist revolution us companies have long been interested in venezuela because it has one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world oil revenues account for about 98 percent of the country s export earnings and 25 percent of gross domestic product which is why washington has sought to shut down this industry as expected high prices provided a boon to venezuela s economy from 2006 until the first half of 2014 when oil prices mostly hovered between 100 and 125 per barrel during that time venezuela used its oil revenues to fund its budget and wield regional political power by providing subsidized oil to as many as thirteen neighboring latin american countries most notably cuba however venezuela s oil production has now fallen to its lowest point in more than 70 years in 2017 america imported more than s10 billion worth of oil from venezuela making it one of the top sources of crude for us refineries but now that figure is at about zero as a result of us economic restrictions the economic recession in tandem with the devastating us sanctions have been lethal according to doctors economists and other experts in may 2019 leading economist jeffrey sachs co authored a center for economic and policy research cepr report with mark weisbrot which examined how us sanctions increased disease and mortality and reduced the availability of food medicine and medical supplies in venezuela since 2017 the report concluded more than 40 000 people have died as a result of us sanctions sachs a columbia university professor and director of columbia s center for sustainable development described the sanctions regime as collective punishment for all 30 million venezuelans as described in both the geneva and hague international conventions to which the us is a signatory sanctions imposed by the us government in 2017 prevented the country from accessing international capital markets and the oil company from restructuring its loans the report noted the two economists said that after the sanctions were implemented venezuela lost an estimated 6 billion in oil revenue over the ensuing 12 months weisbrot and sachs argued that the loss in foreign exchange needed for vital imports of food medicine and productive inputs caused by us sanctions were the main shock that pushed venezuela into hyperinflation in late 2017 that s when the social humanitarian crisis went spiraling out of control sachs told the washington based democracy now in an interview after the report was released it s not an economic standstill it s a complete economic collapse a catastrophe in venezuela there was a crisis before trump came to office the public policy analyst said but the trump administration from the start has wanted to overthrow maduro in fact the us president sachs said was explicit in discussions with latin american allies about a us military invasion of venezuela however the south american leaders told washington they did not want to see military action which forced trump to consider other options so the us government has been trying to strangle the venezuelan economy sachs said then in 2019 he continued trump imposed another round of even tighter sanctions which essentially confiscated the earnings and assets of the venezuelan government sachs said the trump administration does not even understand the idea of negotiation instead the us government has deliberately created massive suffering to achieve its objectives however he said this all or nothing strategy has failed to overthrow maduro it s not working and it s very cruel because it s punishing 30 million people sachs said critics cite mismanagement and corruption as among the reasons for venezuela s slide maduro members of his administration and allies blame the sanctions whoever is ultimately responsible the fact is that store shelves are empty of bread sugar coffee cooking oil toilet paper milk and other basic food items and even if the items were available the prices would be unaffordable for most because of hyper inflation which currently stands at around 1 million percent people like luces pineros have watched with dismay as their country s economy has crumbled under the weight of government mismanagement and crushing sanctions luces pineros home in venezuela is in la pastora in the heart of caracas a marginalized neighborhood she says used to be one of the nicest neighborhoods in the capital city but things are much different today luces pineros said that for months before her departure to colombia it was customary for her to eat one arepa a day because of the severe food shortages that plague venezuela arepas are one of venezuela s national foods handed down over generations it is made of white cornmeal salt and water then the dough is shaped into a patty grilled baked and stuffed with a variety of tasty ingredients like beef pork chicken olives raisins peppers and other vegetables that one meal is all luces pineros a caraquena a caracas resident could afford she said reflecting the extreme difficulties most venezuelans are enduring because they are caught in the political crossfire between the government of the bitter conflict sparked by america s desire to overthrow the socialist government and its 21 year old bolivarian revolution i used to sell coffee donuts and food to workers from a small mobile food cart but i am barely able to walk much less stand for hours because of the surgery she said people can t get around because there s no gas and there s no electricity the lights are only on two hours a day the metro station has stopped running due to lack of maintenance and power outages life on the ground grinds people down she said the average monthly income for workers is 40 000 bolivares which is about 4 20 usd meanwhile a half a kilo of cheese costs 40 000 bolivares for six eggs a customer would pay 20 000 bolivares undoubtedly the average venezuelan can t even afford to buy cheese said luces pineros to get half a chicken which comes from brazil by the time it reaches the local market it smells rotten or is spoiled shortly before her journey to columbia luces pineros had surgery to correct an ailment that needed immediate medical attention the surgery was delayed because of the skyrocketing cost of medicines due to hyper inflation and the economic freefall johns hopkins university school of public health researchers in a report released last march found that venezuelans across the country were facing a situation similar to luces pineros patients in hospitals required to bring their own food and medical supplies like surgical thread scalpels syringes and the like including soap and water cases of measles and diphtheria have surged to 9 300 and 2 500 respectively while confirmed cases of malaria increased from 36 000 in 2009 to 414 000 in 2017 according to the report edited and reviewed by dr paul spiegel spiegel and human rights watch expressed surprise at the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis and called for swift international action caritas venezuela a catholic humanitarian organization found that venezuela has also recently seen dramatic increases in child malnutrition while other humanitarian groups reported that maternal and infant mortality rates have spiked in the past five years luces pineros experienced firsthand the damage inflicted on the quality of healthcare and lack of medical supplies during her recent surgery i had to bring everything with me she said there was no alcohol no cotton balls bandages or pain relievers no equipment no sheets no mask and no gloves contaminants were everywhere the doctors who have just graduated from med school have no skills you have to rely on nurses who have some skills it s completely chaotic moreover as she recuperated luces pineros said she was unable to work us sanctions have demonstrably harmed venezuelans like luces pineros but have failed to achieve the outcome they were designed for that being regime change rights groups and even some former us government officials have expressed concerns about the sanctions targeting the populace along with the strategy to force maduro out regardless the cost although last year s us backed coup against maduro failed the saber rattling continues with trump administration officials signaling the us willingness to send in the military yet several media accounts note that trump is trying to avoid stepping into yet another military conflict then there is consideration for the valid concerns of some regional leaders who are against military intervention because that would destabilize the region despite america s best efforts to smash the socialist state maduro is still in office primarily because he has retained the support of venezuelans who still support the revolution and who are opposed to any outside threat to the country s sovereignty not to mention the maduro administration has the loyalty of the military military institutions and control of the primary instruments of government part of the interventionists dilemma is guaido s lack of legitimacy both at home and abroad guaido has the support of only the united states and about 50 of its allies including eu members and right wing latin american countries meanwhile china russia iran syria cuba and turkey along with most un member states still recognize maduro fernando cutz who was director for south america at the white house national security council during the obama administration told sputnik that he was disappointed the move to back guaido did not change much inside venezuela yeah unfortunately things have been at a standstill i had a real expectation that that moment would lead to positive change and a return to democracy cutz who is currently a senior associate with the cohen group said no doubt there has been additional pressure but it hasn t worked regime change isn t an end goal for me it s about helping people and restoring democracy cutz said he believes that maduro was not fairly elected in the 2018 presidential elections and that venezuelans should be given the opportunity to participate in a free and fair vote if under those conditions venezuelans voted for maduro he would have no issues or misgivings the trump administration is pursuing policy objectives it feels will get results which is its right cutz said however he added there are ways to punish the maduro government so that the pain to ordinary venezuelans is minimized looking back a year ago i was very hopeful there was international recognition of guaido and we had the support of a strong coalition we were working with the european union the lima group the oas and the un we all were making a great effort but i am less hopeful in 2020 he said during the obama administration cutz said the sanctions were responsible and targeted individuals in the regime who were bad actors however he added trump s former white house national security adviser john bolton oversaw a drastic expansion of sanctions which have had an impact on the people of venezuela there are ways to focus on individuals without harming citizens in such a wholesale manner cutz claimed cutz who also served as a senior aide to former white house national security advisor h r mcmaster said in addition to blind sanctions he opposed military action us officials he said should step back from the rhetoric and recalibrate it s a devastating situation in venezuela it s horrific but some sort of military move would not be good using the military should only be a last resort cutz said the trump administration he added should also step back from imposing sanctions for sanctions sake i hope there are still good people around in the government willing to side with the people but i don t see a clear path the former white house official said but you never know what may spark change the arab spring was one guy in tunisia who set himself on fire enough people were fed up and it all started netfa freeman a peace activist who visited the country last year as part of the embassy protection collective said venezuela as a sovereign nation has the right to determine its own course free from threats and intimidation from the united states freeman an organizer in the international committee for peace justice dignity for the people formerly the international committee for the freedom of the cuban 5 told sputnik that americans must stop aiding and abetting the imperialist narrative that maduro is a dictator and must be removed to protect human rights when you support saudi arabia that doesn t even have elections and is a monarchy or you bomb innocent children in yemen and in syria and those kind of things and you prop up dictators and depose democratically elected people in honduras and haiti that shows that you don t care about human rights said freeman who is also a radio co producer co host for voices with vision on wpfw 89 3 fm in washington since the late president hugo chavez introduced what he termed the bolivarian revolution in 1998 successive us administrations have tried to overturn venezuela s socialist government including trump s by backing guaido and intensifying sanctions the current economic crisis has been a setback for the revolution and has both strengthened venezuelans resolve to defend their country and also turned some people nostalgic about the chavez years including luces pineros although chavez certainly benefited from high oil prices he is remembered for using the funding to improve the lives of many across all classes and races building on what he started for example the maduro government has so far built 5 million houses for venezuelans in addition to class the mainstream american media has largely ignored the role race has played in the problems plaguing venezuela several analysts point out that racism is one of the main engines and expressions of the counter revolution best illustrated by the fact that the national assembly is overwhelmingly white and upper and middle class while the constituent assembly appointed by maduro much more accurately reflects the multi ethnic makeup of the country filmmaker and educator catherine murphy who lived in venezuela from 2006 2010 told sputnik that chavez s programs transformed the lives of the country s lower classes and afro venezuelans he started to run pdvsa and the money went to pay for housing paving streets providing clean running water and nation building it benefited everyone he started the mission robinson literacy program and invited thousands of cuban doctors who lived in communities practicing medicine for free she noted in light of the malnourishment the collapse of venezuela s healthcare system the general economic collapse and the resultant hardship and privation visited on venezuelans luces pineros who still counts herself as a chavez supporter said she is no longer sure that what she envisions as success as it relates to the goals of the socialist revolution can be attained under the current circumstances although usually not one to cast blame she feels widespread corruption is at the root of so many of venezuela s problems i didn t want to leave because i felt there was hope with chavez for a better venezuela but not today with the maduro regime she said however despite the greed corruption a lack of governance and the inestimable damage caused by us sanctions she still holds out hope i still feel that under a fair socially democratic state there is a future for the venezuelan people luces pineros said
published monday 3 february 2020 print disqus missing the yen buy hold pray passive investing by the numbers floating aimlessly dallas and new york regular readers know i often criticize so called experts usually economists or central bankers whose flawed decisions are punishing the rest of us i find their expertise is not nearly as reliable as they seem to think at the same time i rely on experts whose judgment i respect i know they aren t perfect usually because they know and disclose their own limitations and limitations of the data they rely on i take ideas from many sources load them in my mental blender and produce what is hopefully a smooth tasty concoction you read in my letters the interesting part one that often slips my mind is that sharing these ideas makes many readers consider me an economic expert then they hold me responsible for whatever i said just as i do with central bankers they re absolutely right we who have large audiences should be accountable for everything we say in my case that s not in a legal sense because these letters aren t investment advice per se but i still owe readers my best efforts and sorry if this shocks anyone i sometimes get it wrong as you will see today sometimes i get it really badly completely wrong thankfully not too often that opens an interesting question can an expert be both incorrect and valuable are we sometimes better off with them than without them i think so and recently someone proved it even as they highlighted my own mistakes missing the yen earlier this month you read my forecasts for both 2020 and the 2020s see part 1 part 2 in the course of which i re examined my 2019 outlook i put a lot of work into those letters so much so that i completely forgot about the five year forecast i had published five years ago i should have reviewed it too incidentally if you ever want to know what i thought at some point in the past my complete archive back to 2001 is on our website visit this page and see the right sidebar some of it i wish would disappear and i like to think my writing has improved over time but keeping it online is part of my self accountability but back to that january 2015 five year forecast financial advisor larry swedroe recently eviscerated it at the advisor perspectives site a little research revealed he s written many variations of this same article over the years larry believes all forecasts are useless and all forecasters are incompetent it must be nice to know your conclusion before you start writing i m a bit envious that said i gave larry plenty to criticize several of my expected events didn t happen in the next five years my main failure was thinking the japanese yen would collapse i didn t anticipate the bank of japan could get away with injecting the vast amounts of stimulus they did let s backtrack this was the timeframe i was suggesting when i wrote japan is a bug in search of a windshield i said correctly the boj would have to monetize significant amounts of japanese government debt which was close to 250 of gdp at the time their bond market was stretched to the limit and monetize they did with a vengeance i looked at the more limited quantitative easing we did in the us and which was still going on in europe while our qe exploded asset prices it didn t seem to affect the dollar all that much however i expected the bank of japan would have to do 6x 8x more relatively speaking than the us or europe had i could find no example in history where such massive intervention by the central bank hadn t devalued the currency now we know what happened let s just say i didn t get the same results george soros and stan druckenmiller had betting against the pound decades earlier sigh corollary to the yen prediction the us dollar didn t strengthen like i thought it would this let china and other emerging markets avoid hard landing scenarios which might have triggered a us recession and bear market too the sequence of events was plausible at the time and i still think something much like it would have happened had i been right about the yen but i wasn t and that error led to the others when you have a bunch of dominoes lined up and the first one doesn t fall the others will probably stay upright too but they will fall eventually right now the federal reserve is injecting billions into the repo market which is in turmoil because bond markets are beginning to choke on our huge and growing treasury debt issuance they said last year this effort would end in march my 2020 forecast was that the fed would continue the program past march this week they extended it to april i believe we will see yet another extension or they will quickly resume after a short hiatus as the market has become addicted to stimulus the wall street journal reported last week the fed is considering a plan to cap long term treasury rates by purchasing unlimited amounts of t bonds you may recognize that as essentially what the bank of japan has been doing we really are turning japanese turning japanese i really think so with apology to the vapors buy hold pray larry swedroe uses my mistake and those of others to argue that forecasting is futile and no one should pay attention to people like me who do it much better he thinks to passively allocate your money to index funds and hope for the best his firm will gladly help you do so too for a fee i m not against buy and hold indexing it deserves a place in some portfolios my main problem with it is that very few people can hold on through the kind of drawdowns that happen every few years they ll say they can handle it and sincerely mean it you can give them suitability questionnaires personality profiles and any other kind of test you can promise to hold their hand through tough times but when half their life savings disappears within what seems like a matter of weeks and they were counting on that money to reach their dreams almost everyone gives up they typically will regret it later because they probably sold near the bottom but their reaction was natural and predictable i don t see the value of setting up yourself or your clients for that outcome this isn t just conjecture we have 25 years of dalbar s qaib quantitative analysis of investor behavior studies dalbar looks at mutual fund inflows and outflows to measure actual investor results given when they bought and sold they have consistently found the average investor s return sharply lags those long term returns the funds advertise in 2018 when the s p 500 retreated 4 4 the average investor lost more than twice as much 9 4 this is greed and fear at work buy and hold strategies presume you can remove greed and fear from the equation that is possibly true for a few highly educated disciplined people not most or anything close to most investors are human they have emotions those emotions aren t going anywhere nor do we want them to because they are important to other parts of life active strategies don t necessarily have better results for the last 10 years passive investing has clearly outperformed active management which is why we see investors piling into passive funds passive managers actually disprove their own theory they assume markets will behave certain ways based on patterns and correlations they can t know will continue if forecasting is pointless then looking at the past and extrapolating it into the future is also pointless and indeed those presumed correlations have sometimes fallen apart under stress we saw it in the 1990s with long term capital management and again in the 2008 2009 financial crisis asset classes that were supposed to zig when everything else zagged decided they would zag as well thank you let s also note many of the indexes on which index funds are based are hardly passive committees decide which stocks to include and which weighting methodology to follow so not only is passive investing impractical it s often not even passive for example in 1965 the average tenure of companies on the s p 500 was 33 years by 1990 it was 20 years it s forecast to shrink to 14 years by 2026 about 50 percent of the s p 500 will be replaced over the next 10 years if innosight s forecasted churn rate holds so what they call passive is really active management by expert committees passive investing by the numbers clearly the stock market is hard to predict from year to year that s why larry argues that predictions are pointless and that you should buy and hold that s been really good advice for the last 11 years passive kicked derri re over active management during that time when larry argues for passive buy and hold strategies he is talking his book passive is what he does for a fee i do the same in private or behind regulated websites every money manager does it s part of our dna nothing wrong with that let s look more closely at the book larry preaches from unless otherwise indicated the charts below are from my friend ed easterling of crestmont research who was just named the benton county oregon s timber farmer of the year i have been there and it is a truly fabulous place with 150 foot tall douglas firs he also runs cattle for monthly income a far cry from his big hedge fund days but ed still offers some of the best data and analysis this first chart is about the ups and downs for the last 20 years from the s p 500 ending in 2019 just for grins and giggles here s a chart going all the way back to 1928 a tad more volatile source macrotrends the next chart shows the past 20 years which despite good periods trended toward lower long term returns that is because the past 20 years reflect contrasting decades a poor start followed by great post recession returns as we see in the next chart your buy and hold return for the first 10 years was negative even before inflation and management fees in real terms with fees knock off another 2 3 that was an ugly decade but since the great recession it s been nothing but rainbows and ponies why such a contrast because starting valuations drive long term returns something ed and i have jointly written about at least a dozen times from currently elevated levels with p e at historic highs second only to 2000 the next decade will probably be more like the 2000s than the 2010s or at least that s what 100 years of stock market history suggests here are some relevant questions for those who believe buy and hold is all you need buy and hold worked for the last 10 years do your clients have 10 years from now we just ended the first decade in us history without a recession and thus no significant bear market do you think that is likely to continue through the 2020s what if we have two recessions in the 2020s are you prepared to hold through a decade of zero or negative returns we are now clearly in the top 10 of historical p e valuations when 10 year long term returns historically have been the lowest on record on an inflation adjusted basis you can actually have negative returns for 20 years it took 26 years to get back to breakeven from the bear market that began in 1966 we don t know the future i get that but i also know that every time somebody like greenspan or bernanke says we are in a new era it turns out not to be the case p e ratios matter have you shown your clients what happens at the beginning of bull and bear markets in terms of p e ratios are you telling them lower returns over the next 10 years is a real possibility based on history just asking floating aimlessly another irony is that swedroe published his article on advisor perspectives a site that frequently promotes exactly the kind of forecasts including mine swedroe says are useless i m not sure why he would want to be in that company even stranger swedroe doesn t just argue forecasting is futile he questions the value of expertise generally he cites the example of a physician stating he knows exactly what is wrong and what to do that s probably not a good sign but it s also a straw man i ve been to many doctors in my life they examine diagnose and treat as well as they can based on what they know limited though it may be i am still alive and knock on wood healthy for my age that might not be the case if doctors said i can t be sure what is wrong and anything i do might make you worse just go home to bed i want their expertise and i m better for it no economic forecaster i have ever seen save a few obvious crackpots claims certainty we try to offer insight that helps investors understand what they are doing and why we try to point out the extraordinary difficulty in predicting the future i said this in the opening to my 2019 forecast letter we re all blasted with too much information and it s easy to get overwhelmed i find that having a framework helps organize my thoughts of course you have to be flexible and modify the framework when it no longer fits if the facts change etc but that s better than floating aimlessly at least to me i wasn t thinking of it at the time but floating aimlessly is a good way to describe passive investing you can t aim if you have no target or have no idea where the target is you just float and hope you find it before something bad happens to you in the real world my managed portfolios are fairly bullish as they should be but they are diversified and hedged and in some cases can go to cash we certainly can t pick market tops and bottoms but we can avoid the worst of bear markets and enjoy the power of bull markets accredited investors who have more options thanks to the us government s protection of small investors there are opportunities to enjoy market like returns with significantly less volatility yes that is me talking my book so let me make a 10 year forecast that may come back and bite me i think we see a recession in the early part of the 2020s and i expect an extraordinarily volatile end of the decade where another great recession is quite possible if so total returns will look more like the 2000s rather than the 2010s for buy and hold investors bull markets simply don t begin at valuation levels like we have today that doesn t mean you shouldn t be invested there are lots of opportunities besides us and world stock markets but i think the mad rush we ve seen into passive investing will turn out very badly boomers who are near or in retirement should be very conservative and investing in buy and hold large cap stocks at today s valuations is the opposite of conservative it is simply bad advice to suggest they do so retirement savings should focus on income and capital preservation in my best dirty harry imitation a final question for buy and hold advocates do you feel lucky you think the 2020s will look like the 2010s are you sure we won t have another decade like the 2000s are you really prepared for a 20 year cycle are your clients hope is generally a bad strategy people often say i am bearish or a perma bear that is so not true i am cautiously optimistic 2019 was a stellar year 2018 not so much i have no idea what this year will bring so i look for strategies that offer opportunity no matter what happens cautious optimism rules i am bullish on humanity and worried about governments and central banks i see opportunities everywhere but they are rifle shots buy and hold ruled for the last 10 years i think the 2020s will see the return of active management let s bring this letter out and look back in 10 years dallas and new york shane and i fly to dallas frisco next wednesday i have meetings and shane will be getting her last rental homes ready for sale sometime at the end of february i will have to be in new york city otherwise i m trying to stay home write and think i m spending a great deal of time finalizing the schedule for the strategic investment conference at the scottsdale phoenician may 11 14 this will be our 16th conference and according to our many repeat attendees each has been better than the last i think this will continue the tradition this year we ve reduced the number of seats by almost 40 because long time attendees asked us to make the conference smaller we listened so if you want to come look for your invitation in the next week or so and don t procrastinate sign up as soon as you can you really want to be in the room and with that i will hit the send button you have a great week and don t go passively into that good night or the future of the 2020s there is too much opportunity to miss your not passively watching the world go

there is no such thing as a nonracist or race neutral policy every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups ibram x kendi how to be an antiracist august 13 2019 since 2000 policy matters ohio has provided an essential voice in ohio s policy debate we do our best to make the case for good jobs strong neighborhoods and smart solutions to complex problems that support communities and help working families get ahead but that s not enough if we want to build an ohio that works for everyone the policies we advance must be antiracist below we share with you the policy areas we know can bend the arc of history toward social and economic justice for african americans in ohio jasmine ayres policy matters ohio policy liaison pay everyone fairly for all the work they do by michael shields black people are a critical part of ohio s workforce and helped turn the state into an industrial powerhouse during the great migration of the 20thcentury african americans came to ohio and other midwestern states in search of jobs in a booming industrial economy they faced backlash and discrimination but many joined unions and earned good wages when that boom turned to a bust and manufacturing companies moved out of state and overseas in search of a cheaper workforce many black ohioans lost their stable well paying jobs the black workforce in ohio fares worse today than they did in 1979 the typical black worker in ohio earned 16 90 in 1979 but just 14 62 by 2018 over that time black workers earnings fell in comparison to white workers from 90 cents on the dollar to 74 cents black workers continue to face both outright discrimination and segregation that force them into lower paying less stable jobs the legacy of past discrimination has left black families with less wealth and fewer avenues to education that could lift them up even when black workers do pursue advanced education they are still paid less and are more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts the civil rights act of 1964 made flagrant racial discrimination in employment illegal yet more tacit forms of discrimination persist the loss of manufacturing jobs has been especially devastating to black workers and their families african americans have found work in lower paying service jobs the same type of jobs that are becoming more prevalent in ohio six of ohio s 10 most common jobs today pay too little to support a family of three without food aid these jobs include cashiers janitors and cleaners and stock clerks fast food companies are projected to have the most annual job openings in ohio through 2026 prep workers will see just under 32 000 openings a year there will be 12 020 openings for home health aides which is likely to be the state s single fastest growing job increasing by nearly 44 fast food employers pay a typical service worker 9 21 an hour a typical home health aide earns barely more 10 33 because outright and implicit racism has forced black ohioans to the bottom of the labor market raising the minimum wage is a targeted antiracist policy one that will help many white ohioans as well a coalition called ohioans for raising the wage is asking voters to approve a 13 an hour minimum wage by 2025 if it passes nearly 41 of all black ohio workers would be paid more fairly for the work they do a total of 227 200 people in addition employers are more likely to steal wages from african american employees estimates show ohio employers stole wages from more than 35 120 black workers and 164 600 white workers each year from 2013 2015 among black workers 8 7 experienced wage theft compared with 5 1 of white workers black workers were 70 1 more likely than their white counterparts to be victims of minimum wage violations meaning their employers paid them less than the minimum wage currently ohio has five investigators and one supervisor covering all wage and hour violations with the state failing to do its job cities like cincinnati can use their power to ensure employers pay all working people for the hours they spend on the job when they contract with private businesses grant tax incentives and issues licenses most state policies do not explicitly express racist intent but the outcomes have led to disparities among racial and ethnic groups we support antiracist policies that will have significantly positive effects for african americans in ohio policy recommendations support ohioans for raising the wage which filed initial petitions to raise ohio s minimum wage to 13 per hour over five years ohio lawmakers can substantially increase resources available to protect workers and enforce wage and hour laws if state lawmakers fail to step up ohio cities can follow cincinnati s lead and pass anti wage theft ordinances let everyone build financial security by kalitha williams public policies and business practices systematically deny black people opportunities to build wealth and financial security when lawmakers created social security benefits in the 1930s they deliberately excluded domestic workers a large share of whom were black women black veterans were seldom able to take advantage of the benefits of the g i bill which helped build the white middle class after world war ii banks often refused credit to people of color or charged significantly higher rates than they did for white people while policymakers in the late 1960s and 1970s passed laws that tried to dismantle discriminatory financial exploitation new practices have emerged that require strong regulation as well in the early 2000s and even before mortgage lenders deliberately targeted black borrowers with subprime loans regardless of their credit history the foreclosure crisis that ensued caused black families to lose billions of dollars in wealth that likely will never be recovered financial institutions continue to prey on black people with predatory financial products like payday loans and high fee prepaid debit cards in 2018 congress voted to allow car lenders and dealers to charge black borrowers higher interest for auto loans research has shown that auto insurance companies engage in redlining by charging higher rates to customers who live in zip codes where the majority of residents are black earlier this year prosperity now reported that poverty among black ohioans is nearly triple that of white ohioans more needs to be done to protect black consumers from new schemes and business practices meant to strip their ability to build wealth racial segregation included policy business practices and coordinated violence to limit where people of color could live redlining deceptive real estate agents and landlords prevented blacks from living in white neighborhoods today these practices are illegal but according to analysis of u s census data of the top 20 most racially segregated cities in the country five are in ohio cleveland cincinnati dayton toledo and youngstown according to the prosperity now scorecard in ohio the white homeownership rate of 72 is twice that of black homeownership which is 36 one in three black ohioans spend over 30 of their income on their home vs one in four white ohioans banks also have denied black families access to federally backed mortgages pushing them into predatory land contracts homeownership is the primary asset for most americans and this business practice prevented many african americans from creating financial security and building generational wealth predatory lenders continue to target black communities during the national home foreclosure crisis lenders stripped black families of billions in wealth ohio was ground zero and 10 years later still had more than 33 000 foreclosures in 2018 this perfect storm encouraged the growth of predatory land contracts land contracts are rent to own schemes that saddle the consumer with the costs of home repairs and often exorbitant fees the seller agrees to transfer the title to the buyer after the house has been paid in full in this new iteration land contracts target low income families especially african americans policy recommendations ohio policymakers need to step in to protect black people from predatory schemes house bill 103 would regulate land contracts and ensure that consumers are not saddled with the upkeep of dilapidated homes that prevents them from building wealth and financial security ohio legislators should pass house bill 103 which is currently pending in the in the ohio legislature make higher education affordable for everyone by piet van lier and jasmine ayres ohio s public universities are some of the best in the nation but they don t serve black students as well as they serve white ones the ohio state university s student body is just 5 black less than half the share of black people in the state in addition to lack of investment in african american students around the state high tuition and other costs keep many college students from succeeding affordability is a problem at all ohio public universities including tuition fees room and board and costs defrayed by financial aid the institute for research on higher education ranks ohio 45th in college affordability students whose families have incomes below 30 000 nearly a quarter of all families would need to spend 81 of their income to pay for one year of the net price of a public university in ohio and 38 for community college for black families who are more likely to be paid low wages and have lost wealth due to predatory lending ohio s colleges can be out of reach in addition to the challenges black students face in attending a traditional state public school they must also overcome barriers and even penalties to pursue their secondary education at a community college or publicly funded historically black college or university hbcu in ohio central state university is ohio s only public hbcu and one of only a few in the midwest it is one of the 13 state assisted universities in the ohio university system the ohio senate passed legislation in 1892 that would have given central state federal land grant funding however the ohio house at the urging of former president and osu trustee rutherford b hayes reversed course and gave the funds to osu instead it was not until 2014 that congress finally recognized central state as a land grant institution our state has ambitious goals to dramatically increase the number of ohioans who have some education beyond high school but there are too many barriers that keep ohioans from achieving those goals especially black ohioans part of the problem is that state lawmakers don t put enough resources into the state s need based aid program the ohio college opportunity grant ocog a deeper problem is the program s structural flaw that gives students at central state and community colleges less aid than it gives students at traditional state schools ocog is a last dollar award which means that other resources are factored in first including federal pell grants and expected family contributions according to the ocog website as a result of this structure ocog is not available to many low income ohio students who would otherwise qualify including more than 110 000 attending community colleges and regional campuses students at central state receive lower amounts than students at other state schools on top of that ohio allows the aid to be used at expensive often poor performing for profit colleges affordable higher education is part of what built ohio s economy it is important that ohio s college aid system build on this legacy increased public support for ocog and better policies can make the grant more effective we recommend four changes to improve equity and make the program meet the needs of ohio s growing college population policy recommendations change the state s definition of total state cost of attendance to include all fees books housing food transportation child care and other education expenses the ocog formula should mirror the federal definition of attendance instead of only considering tuition and general fees make ocog a first dollar grant to ensure all eligible ohio students receive it making ocog first dollar means it will be applied to a student s cost of attendance before all other aid such as pell grants or other scholarships the cost to expand ocog to community college students and increase the grant for central state students is estimated at 106 million a year increase state support for ocog to the initially planned 250 million per year and set an inflation adjustment so ocog keeps pace with rising costs eliminate ocog for for profit institutions by providing ocog to students at for profit colleges ohio encourages people to attend even though for profit institutions have poor outcomes and engage in predatory practices in fiscal year 2018 the state sent 3 4 million to for profit colleges this money should be invested in more effective public institutions like community colleges and regional campuses ohio built a world class system of public colleges and universities and created financial aid programs to help a previous generation attend as college becomes increasingly important to finding family supporting employment and to our economy we must make sure young people can afford college to build a better future for all of us make sure everyone counts by daniel ortiz since 1790 the u s constitution has required the government conduct a count of the entire population every 10 years from the beginning the census has been used as a tool to advantage some groups over others at that time the government only counted white male property owners and any free people living in the home until the 1865 passage of the 13th amendment the government counted enslaved people as three fifths of a person this gave southern states increased congressional representation without extending voting rights to the people who were enslaved and without recognizing black americans full humanity the census didn t count native americans until 1870 it s precisely because of this history that we must make deliberate efforts to count people who may not otherwise participate the people in these communities are referred to as our hard to count population because of years of inadequate and delayed funding and the trump administration s failed efforts to add an untested citizenship question to the form reaching everyone could be even harder ohio has about 140 census tracts where poverty rates are at least 50 these are concentrated in about a quarter of the state s 88 counties mostly in big cities and a few small cities this is where a full census count is likely to be difficult in part because of the uncertain scheduling of low wage jobs lack of telephone services and informal housing arrangements of low wage workers the largest share of ohio s funding for health and human service programs comes from the federal government and ohio could lose federal funding and congressional representation if state residents are undercounted in the 2020 census undercounting of people is common in hard to reach places like rural counties and densely populated central cities or among people who may be afraid to be counted like undocumented families or people who currently have arrest warrants which are often given for minor violations such as unpaid parking tickets policy recommendations ohio lawmakers should appropriate 100 000 for community or church groups in these low income places hire outreach staff to find uncounted residents and provide assistance in filling out census forms the funds could be based on two months of work for up to 20 individuals at about 15 per hour the appropriation should flow through the development services agency and the money given as grants directly to local groups for outreach purposes call to action by jasmine ayres every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions but we must all protest martin luther king jr beyond vietnam april 4 1967 the center on budget and policy priorities puts it very well states and local governments collect roughly one third of the nation s taxes and account for nearly half of all domestic public sector spending they also provide over 90 of k 12 school funding and nearly all public college and university funding own over 90 of the country s non defense public infrastructure roads and other transit systems water systems airports and the like given that level of economic power states could be a potent force for expanding opportunity and enhancing equity how states choose to raise revenue and how and where they choose to spend it has major implications for who moves ahead and who is left behind state policies can and often do promote opportunities and enhance equity however over the past 15 years ohio has cut taxes by 6 billion a year while underinvesting in public services including public education from preschool through college this has harmed most ohioans especially african americans that s why ohio s policymakers need to address the harm they can make a good start by ensuring everyone is paid fairly for all the hours they work everyone has a chance to build wealth everyone can afford to go to college and everyone is counted at policy matters ohio we recognize the harm past and current policies have on the african american community and aim to push an antiracist policy agenda that focuses on equity for african americans living and working in our state we welcome you to join us because we believe in an ohio for everyone gordon

this is a guest post by george cook the cofounder and ceo of honeycomb credit working on honeycomb credit an investment crowdfunding platform that focuses on connecting small businesses with hyperlocal capital i am often thinking about the intersection of small business lending and impact investing in this post i walk through my case for why investing in local businesses is inherently impact investing after reading this you will understand why small businesses struggle to access capital even in a strong economy why decentralized local lenders provide fair capital and how you and everyone around you can participate in transforming the trillion dollar small business lending industry currently failing many local small businesses what s wrong with the small business lending market if you were to read the headline economic numbers you would assume that small businesses are doing great and by many metrics they are business creation is up owner confidence is high and over 30 of business owners say that now is a good time to expand as of early 2018 according to the national federation of independent business but digging deeper into the data access to affordable capital eludes many small businesses in our community a recent sba report found that bank lending to small businesses declined by approximately 100 billion from 2008 to 2016 despite an unprecedented run of economic growth lending remains far from the highs of 12 years ago impacting smaller businesses most the recently published small business credit survey by the federal reserve found that of businesses seeking smaller loans between 25 000 and 100 000 in financing about half received less money from lenders than they were looking for as businesses are denied bank capital they are increasingly turning to high interest sources such as credit cards or online lenders the online small business lending market has grown dramatically in 2018 one third of small businesses turned to online lenders up from 19 in 2016 online lenders such as paypal kabbage and ondeck help businesses meet their capital needs but often at exorbitant rates averaging annualized rates of 45 throughout the industry according to the wall street journal our favorite local businesses are paying exorbitant aprs and losing livelihoods as a result we need to find out what s wrong with the small business lending market and how we can fix it an econ 101 explanation for small business lending s retreat why have banks small business lending stagnated despite positive economic conditions most economists point to the fact that from 1984 to 2017 we lost over 10 000 community banks due to a combination of increased regulation branch shutdowns and acquisitions consolidation in the banking industry has stunted small business lending leaving many local businesses unable to access capital first consolidation has increased information asymmetries in the small business lending world making underwriting increasingly quantitative in the heyday of community banking the underwriting team was local and familiar with those intangibles that made a business more bankable than the numbers might show because they can t live and breathe the local context most large underwriting operations have made quantitative elements credit scores dscrs years of profitability the key drivers of their decision making leaving many great businesses behind second faraway banks don t internalize the positive externalities of supporting local businesses so they undersupply small business loans an externality is essentially a side effect of one person or group s action that impacts others some economic activities can have negative externalities like a coal plant polluting the air but they can also be positive for example if you walk or take public transit to work you reduce congestion on the highway making everyone s commute a little more efficient although externalities generally work in small ways at scale they add up by setting up shop in our communities small businesses provide many positive externalities small businesses fill empty storefronts increase actual and perceived safety employ local people and grow the local tax base surprisingly banks used to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of these externalities by lending to one business in their community they would inadvertently be supporting the growth of an entire local corridor and the neighborhoods around it making their previous local loans even more secure as the banking industry has consolidated banks have less reason to lend with positive externalities in mind a large bank in manhattan sees virtually no positive externalities from a small business in kensington this means that the laws of economics tell us that large regional banks and national banks are less likely to take chances on small businesses than a community bank and as community banks have disappeared so has capital for small businesses at its core we re seeing a market failure where positive externalities are not being correctly accounted for when making economic decisions where banks are increasingly conservative in their lending because they don t have the qualitative data that used to round out their decisions this means that in aggregate we are underfunding small businesses and we are charging interest rates that are too high hurting the main street growth we need solution keeping the lending decision local so then what should we do if banking consolidation has made small business lending difficult even in positive economic times people passionate about bringing back local lending should take a page from community solutions philadelphia s network of community development financial institutions cdfis and public private small business loan funds such as pidc serve as great resources of capital in philadelphia because they are deeply attuned to their local context and benefit directly for promoting the positive externalities associated with local lending not only have they maintained fair lending but these mission driven organizations have also focused their attention lending to populations historically mis served by the banking industry these are efforts that should be supported both by government dollars and through financially concessionary impact investment however when a trillion dollar industry is retreating from lending to the newest businesses on the block leaving around 350 billion worth of small business loans underserved every year it takes more than local organizations to fix the issue we need to solve the fundamental market failure in the small business lending world why we want to turn as many people as possible into local investors if the banking system is no longer serving our earlier stage businesses because they are not attuned to our local contexts and do not benefit from the positive externalities associated with commercial lending then maybe we should change the face of the lenders themselves if we want more small businesses to access fair capital we need to give the lending decision to those most knowledgeable about a business future those most closely tied to the positive outcomes of their success everyday members of the community broadly defined i m not alone in this hypothesis nor am i the first in 2012 policy analysts entrepreneurs and lawmakers saw that the post recession recovery did not translate to greater levels of investment in business startups and they too believed that everyday people could do something about it they passed the jumpstart our business startups jobs act with overwhelming bipartisan support in the regulation they created an exemption that now made it legal for local businesses to solicit securities investment from non accredited investors publicly on the rails of that regulation we created honeycomb credit the first investment crowdfunding platform dedicated to connecting local investors to main street small businesses seeking capital we work with local businesses assessing their preliminary creditworthiness through conventional means but whether or not the business receives capital depends on the investment of everyday people every day people are expert aggregators of qualitative data they know the business owner they have seen the menu improve and all of these positive beliefs and thoughts are behind their decision to invest we have also seen that everyday people can also appreciate externalities in a way that no bank or solely market driven institution can in pittsburgh we have seen a neighboring business owner invest in the business next door we have seen our investors invest across color lines county lines and state lines when you give everyday people the chance to invest in one another they can quickly see how their futures are intertwined this notion too drives their investment decision and creates a lending market aligned with community values to date we have helped connect over 40 early stage businesses and have turned over 600 everyday folks into community investors the invest local movement much like the impact investing movement is still in its infancy but its urgency is real almost every day our credit analysis committee interacts with businesses who have fallen victim to merchant cash advances or are seeking to escape a mountain of credit card debt the lack of accessible and affordable capital is an issue that plagues our entire economy but i believe that empowering everyday people to become financial participants in their community is a key part of creating a fairer lending ecosystem to make it work i d like to invite you to join us in the invest local movement so we can bring fair capital to our communities one small business at a time technically media
if stirring controversies is part of the present day diplomat s job then it sits somewhere on top of alice wells job description at the us department of state since pakistan shrugged off the concerns she voiced about cpec from washington the diplomat left the comforts of her home to travel to the pakistani capital with more revelations unsurprisingly the ensuing debate earned her no accolades but scathing criticism from beijing and islamabad besides it left many pakistanis including this writer who considers cpec as an economic opportunity for the country wondering if they could distil this diplomatic hubbub for some valuable insights ambassador wells charged cpec in november 2019 with poor commercial viability and lack of transparency she claimed pakistan owed 15bn debt to beijing and 6 7bn to chinese commercial banks is the beijing washington spat over cpec a welcome development for the common pakistani a day after the minister for planning asad umar disputed those figures by disclosing that the public debt to china stood at 18bn of that 4 9bn relates to cpec projects and the rest was borrowed from the chinese government and commercial banks to stabilise forex reserves and finance trade deficit a few weeks later the chinese embassy in islam abad in a rebuttal to wells claims stated that beijing had provided 5 9bn of concessional loans booked as public debt for cpec s transportation projects ad d i tionally chinese companies and their partners in vested 12 8 in the energy sector and are themselves responsible for their ventures commercial viability who will dispute that numbers don t lie but they are utterly deceptive when cherry picked and that s how this exchange appears to have unfolded in some aspects regardless the public statements of umar and the chinese embassy suggest that the amount owed to the chinese government commercial banks and investors combined is nearly 30bn the breakdown concessional loans of 6bn for public infrastructure projects 13bn of public debt borrowed from the chinese government and banks and about 11bn of equity and commercial loans for cpec s power project the volume may grow in the coming years for instance the ml i project to upgrade the railway between karachi and peshawar at an estimated cost of 8 2bn alone will have a major impact before we pakistanis heed wells advice and pose tough questions to our government and china there are tougher questions that demand necessary soul searching for washington and an explanation to the american public for example despite allocating tens of billions of tax dollars in economic assistance to pakistan why has the state department failed perpetually to earn widespread goodwill in the country pakistanis are eager for washington to come clean on its patronising and strengthening of unelected regimes in their country and undermining their nation building exercise endlessly and when if ever will it abandon its local cronies who are the principal beneficiaries of the so called development aid on part of the chinese embassy its willingness to disclose financing details of cpec projects is commendable but most of that information is already in the public domain for being in its sixth year it s most appropriate for cpec to yield the outcomes that can dispel critique of it effectively its success is crucial for the chinese leadership who d wish to showcase it as a success story of the belt and road initiative bri to become a trusted partner for the global south on the contrary critics may argue that if beijing cannot nurture a mutually beneficial partnership with its purported iron brother what well being can it promise to others some matters require beijing s immediate attention to end doubts about cpec s economic viability for pakistan for instance it s a norm for the pakistani government to issue sovereign guarantees to independent power producers to mitigate high country risk the advent of chinese funding set a new costly precedent in addition to sovereign guarantee chinese banks required ipps to buy an insurance cover from china s state owned insurance company sinosure for every dollar owed in principal and interest ipps pay an insurance premium of 7pc to sinosure which is prohibitively high it s no secret that these commercial banks are owned by the state who de f i nes their lending practices and priorities too one wishes for these banks to have placed faith in pak istan s sovereign guarantee as put by international lenders which would result in savings of tens of billions of rupees for the local ratepayer a corrective measure in this regard will reinforce beijing s commitment to the well being of the pakistani public for pakistan this debate or spat has strategic and economic implications firstly we need to understand the context of wells rhetorical critique the us policy of vilifying china s economic diplomacy endeavour the bri is well known for being a major pillar of the bri cpec will naturally attract ame rican criticism and pakistan s fragile economy and its decades long dependence on american handouts make it the cheapest punching bag for washington islamabad must realise that it doesn t belong in the boxing ring among two global heavyweights and should refrain from reacting irresponsibly secondly our government must stop being a desperate borrower and be transparent in its financial dealings for instance we were told that pakistan borrowed 13bn from the chinese government and commercial banks but were not given sufficient information about the lending terms has it ever occurred to our decision makers that such murky practices may undermine the reputation of our allies such as china moreover whomsoever we invite to fund public infrastructure they will demand their risk be priced adequately but what led the pml n government to offer unprecedented incentives for power projects under cpec which prompted doubts about the transparency and competitiveness of this strategically important endeavour to sum up whatever the price tag 60bn or 600bn for cpec to vindicate president xi s pledge of promoting inclusivity and mutual prosperity through the bri the time is ripe for cpec to outgrow the mould of diplomatic cajoling and transform itself into an enduring venture of economic cooperation it s fair to expect that beijing won t shy away from taking measures to ensure that cpec starts benefiting common pakistanis sooner than later the writer is an analyst twitter sohaibrmalik published in dawn february 3rd 2020

briefing highlights market woes china s central bank takes measures markets at a glance bernard ebbers dies at 78 what to look for today required reading what investors should watch it s not the coronavirus alone that should be weighing on the minds of investors but the potential interaction of the ramifications with other things now playing out in the markets that s how matt king citigroup s head of credit products strategy sees it as fears of the economic fallout of the coronavirus rattle the markets what we find particularly troubling is the potential interaction between the shock from the virus already stretched market valuations and central banks approaching the local limits of their ability to prop up markets mr king said in a report while history suggests markets will eventually rebound quickly once the incidence of new cases subsides the risk reward seems to have deteriorated significantly in the meantime mr king suggested too that markets should be on higher alert like most people our base case is still that in a few weeks time new infections are seen to peak and the shock from the coronavirus like those of sars and mers before it is consigned to the history books he said but given the risks not only from the disease itself but also the way in which it interacts with market valuations and central banks limitations for now it still feels as though investors are comparatively complacent fears surrounding the coronavirus have rippled through markets affecting stocks commodities and currencies here are some recent views from other observers on how the virus could affect economies and markets notably where canada is concerned there seems to be an appreciation now that even the best case scenario for the coronavirus isn t good just the efforts to contain the outbreak will be very destructive to growth we can see chinese economic growth being cut in half in the first quarter about 3 per cent year over year instead of the 6 1 per cent reported in the fourth quarter of last year jasper lawler head of research london capital group the coronavirus outbreak in china has rattled markets and will likely be a noticeable but temporary drag on the canadian economy fears and uncertainty over how long the outbreak will last and how many people will become infected will affect canada through three channels commodities currency and global consumption commodities in particular will feel the pain as prices fall due to general market jitters as investors move money to safer assets and to declining industrial demand as the chinese economy seizes up and air travel to and from china is restricted the price factor is canada s primary concern as most oil exports are directed toward the u s not china brendan meighan economist moody s analytics while markets fret over the impact of the wuhan virus the has little chance to recover commodity prices have been devastated but both markets look oversold and risks have to be tilting back towards a consolidation at least if not a rebound u s canada spreads remain more supportive than price action would suggest our predictive week ahead model suggests some stabilization in much will hinge on how virus headlines unfold from here for the political factors democratic primaries may add to volatility over the coming week iowa caucuses monday shaun osborne chief foreign exchange strategist and juan manuel herrera foreign exchange strategist bank of nova scotia very early estimates have suggested china s q1 gdp growth could be reduced by at least 1 percentage point for reference the country s year over year growth in the second half of 2019 was 6 per cent some of that will spill over into canada via lower commodity prices west texas intermediate oil prices for instance are down nearly us 7 per barrel over the last two weeks while the transportation sector will see a more direct hit with some airlines cancelling flights to china global industrial supply chains could also be impacted the longer the clampdown on economic activity in china persists nathan janzen and josh nye senior economists royal bank of canada probably the most vulnerable sector to the coronavirus and fears related to it is the tourism industry casting back over the past 20 years shows that the single biggest drop in visitors to canada from all countries aside from the u s was during and after the sars episode in 2003 visits from abroad fell 25 per cent year over year over a six month period they then snapped back in the following two years note that when looking at the sheer number of visitors i e not the growth rate the lowest tally in the past 30 years was in may 2003 on the flip side the highest tally of non u s visitors ever was in july 2019 even in seasonally adjusted terms that figure had been sagging notably in following months and may be poised for a steeper correction now in the latest year available 2018 china accounted for 11 per cent of all non u s visitors to canada amounting to 757 000 people that was just behind second place britain douglas porter chief economist bank of montreal maybe as much as anything the outbreak is the nudge needed to get investors to do some selling which might have been due anyway after a lengthy run as we noted last week valuations have stretched out in fact we re again in a situation where at least by this basic measure the only time stocks were more expensive was during the late 1990s tech bubble a little cooling off was probably in order robert kavcic senior economist bmo with china poised to slow markedly at least for q1 their purchases from the rest of the world will undoubtedly cool rapidly as well many are looking back to the 2003 sars episode for a playbook and there was about a 4 per cent drop in canadian exports to china that year but there has been a fundamental shift since 2003 china s share of both the global economy generally and canadian exports specifically has ratcheted higher over those 17 years in 2002 03 china accounted for at most 1 5 per cent of total canadian exports in the past 12 months that ratio stood at almost three times that share at 4 3 per cent and that s even including the impact of various constraints placed on canadian goods which chopped the ratio from a peak of more than 5 per cent in late 2018 adding to the mix there s the very real threat of trade diversion owing to the recent phase one deal between the u s and china bmo s mr porter markets have been gripped by the ongoing exponential growth in the coronavirus outbreak but the ultimate magnitude and duration of its impact is still highly uncertain because the characteristics of the virus is still highly unknown at this point but what is concrete and known is that the steps being taken by policymakers will have at least a sharp negative impact on growth in the near term the process of growth downgrades by our economists have already begun daniel hui and paul meggyesi foreign exchange strategists jpmorgan chase compared to previous pandemics the coronavirus has escalated more quickly in terms of infections but also the policy response china factory closings lockdowns and lockouts make the hit to asia output large but could render the outbreak more containable if output buckles just intra quarter the market impact could be less persistent and more localized as investors focus on a q2 to q4 return to reflation the risks are two fold markets are generally expensive and well owned rather than cheap and if factories don t reopen after feb 9 a major but regional and brief demand shock could become a more damaging global supply shock john normand head of cross asset fundamental strategy jpmorgan chase read more china props up system china s central bank moved to prop up the financial system and analysts say further stimulus will be needed the people s bank of china pumped the equivalent of us 21 4 billion in liquidity into the financial system this came as the shanghai composite reopened

the right wing record of jacinda ardern s government the right wing record of jacinda ardern s government in new zealand by the socialist equality group new zealand 3 february 2020 original url new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern announced on january 28 that the next election will be held on september 19 marking the beginning of an eight month campaign since the labour new zealand first greens coalition government was formed just over two years ago it has received significant positive coverage in the world s corporate media new zealand under ardern has been depicted in the new york times the british guardian and elsewhere as an oasis of kindness and egalitarianism in contrast to right wing governments led by trump in the us boris johnson in britain and scott morrison in australia ardern has appeared twice on time s yearly list of the world s 100 most influential people first for having a baby while in office and second for her response to the christchurch massacre her supposedly groundbreaking achievements have been hailed by british labour leader jeremy corbyn and us democrat alexandria ocasio cortez to name just two of many politicians around the world this international praise is aimed at fostering illusions that with leaders like ardern in charge capitalism can be saved and its evils curbed the ruling classes are watching with fear as millions of workers and young people internationally join mass strikes and protests against record levels of social inequality environmental destruction and attacks on democratic rights governments are seeking to combat rising support for socialism particularly among young people advertisement scroll to continue reading announcing the election date ardern declared that the labour party would run a positive factual and robust election campaign highlighting the government s supposed progress on the long term challenges facing new zealand these included she said making critical investments in health and education and reducing child poverty none of this rhetoric has any relationship to reality she was installed as labour leader just two months before the september 2017 election in a desperate bid to prevent the party s collapse labour had suffered historic defeats in 2011 and 2014 and broad sections of the working class correctly view it as a party of big business indistinguishable from the conservative national party after the election labour did not have enough support to govern alone it won 36 9 percent of the votes compared with national s 44 4 percent ardern only became prime minister following a month of sordid negotiations with the right wing nationalist and anti immigrant nz first party which received just 7 2 percent of the votes the unpopular nz first determined the makeup of the government it chose a coalition government with labour instead of the national party because it viewed labour as its preferred partner to whip up xenophobia and integrate new zealand more closely into washington s military confrontation with china labour had campaigned for years in a de facto alliance with nz first and joined its demonisation of chinese immigrants scapegoating them for the housing affordability crisis nz first leader winston peters who became deputy prime minister and foreign minister declared that his coalition with ardern would restore capitalism with a human face ardern echoed this message promising to address poverty homelessness and end nine years of vicious austerity imposed by the national party government after the 2008 financial crisis this propaganda has been exposed by the reality of the past two years the ardern government has overseen increased poverty housing insecurity and starved public services of funding and resources it has attacked democratic rights strengthened the police demonised immigrants and intensified preparations for war the necessary conclusion to be drawn is that capitalism cannot be reformed but must be overthrown labour and the rest of the political establishment are incapable of offering any solution to the dangers of war the climate crisis and the rapidly worsening living conditions the failure of capitalism is leading to revolutionary struggles workers and youth must consciously prepare by building the socialist and internationalist leadership required to unify and lead these struggles imperialist warmongering against china the socialist equality group seg warned from the outset that labour s decision to give the anti immigrant nz first party a central role in government including the roles of foreign minister and defence minister signalled a further rightward shift aimed at aligning new zealand more firmly with us preparations for war against china a key factor in the formation of the government was the unprecedented intervention of us ambassador scott brown who publicly criticised the national party s reluctance to fully endorse trump s criminal threat to totally destroy north korea brown signalled that the us wanted the next government to take a much tougher anti chinese stance just days before the election pro us academic anne marie brady with the support of much of the media and nz first launched a witch hunt against chinese influence within the national party which she implied was compromised by close business ties with china in 2018 the labour led government explicitly named china and russia as the main threats to the international order echoing washington ardern has kept nz troops in iraq and afghanistan assisting the criminal us occupation of those countries in return peters has repeatedly called on the us to deploy more military forces to the pacific region to push back against chinese diplomacy and economic influence and help new zealand enforce its own neo colonial domination over tonga samoa and other small impoverished island nations while starving crucial social services such as health and education of funds the government is committed to spending 20 billion on military assets by 2030 and expanding the size of the army from 4 500 to 6 000 troops new zealand hosts regular military exercises with us and australian troops that are explicitly aimed at preparing to invade pacific countries and suppress popular uprisings encouraged by the government brady and other pro us commentators are engaged in a vicious anti chinese witch hunt demanding state surveillance of chinese born immigrants including members of parliament journalists student associations and community groups brady has also called for stripping voting rights from recent immigrants and reducing economic ties with china nz s main trading partner a major participant in this xenophobic campaign is the pro government trade union funded daily blog which frequently rails against our chinese overlords and paints chinese immigrants as a threat to social stability the same rhetoric is being used by openly fascistic and extreme right wing groups the christchurch massacre and the promotion of the extreme right as in the 1930s the ruling classes in every country are whipping up nationalism and encouraging outright fascist forces to prepare for war divide the working class and pre empt the emergence of a socialist movement the horrific march 15 attack on two mosques in christchurch by fascist terrorist brenton tarrant who killed 51 people and injured 50 more shattered the perception that new zealand was isolated from the growth of extreme right tendencies internationally fascist networks aim to prove that such an atrocity can happen anywhere in the world the seg rejected attempts by politicians and media commentators to paint tarrant as an outsider whose actions reflected nothing about new zealand society because he was born in australia in fact his fascist manifesto contained racist and anti muslim language reminiscent of nz first including an obsession with the low birth rates and the replacement of the white population tarrant blamed immigrants for poor wages and conditions in words similar to those used by the labour party and the trade union bureaucracy the media glorification of ardern s response to the christchurch attack was aimed at preventing any discussion of these glaring similarities likewise the state censorship of tarrant s manifesto is intended to disarm the working class by obscuring the connection between the terrorist s fascist ideology and the right wing nationalism advocated by the political establishment the seg denounced the suppression of the document as a serious attack on democratic rights the circumstances of the attack remain shrouded in secrecy with the official royal commission of inquiry taking place behind closed doors it is clear however that tarrant was part of a network of fascists that enjoyed protection from the australian and new zealand police who turned a blind eye to warnings about tarrant s violent threats against immigrants and communists no explanation has been given for the failure of new zealand s intelligence agencies to stop the attack despite being extremely well resourced to carry out mass surveillance as part of the us led five eyes spying network the massacre was seized upon as a pretext to further boost the resources of the spy agencies and introduce new armed police units in south auckland waikato and canterbury draconian new anti terror legislation will allow police to label someone a terrorist without any need to prove them guilty of a crime and subject them to surveillance and other attacks on basic democratic rights ardern has also become the international poster woman for internet censorship ostensibly to stop the spread of violent extremist and terrorist content what constitutes extremism will be decided by the state in collaboration with internet and social media conglomerates already facebook google youtube and twitter have drastically changed their algorithms to censor anti war left wing and socialist websites including the world socialist web site by directing traffic to the authoritative corporate media at the same time governments in europe the us australia and asia are all creating laws that criminalise left wing protests against inequality climate change and in defence of immigrants escalating social inequality the main target of the government s anti democratic measures and xenophobic propaganda is the working class which is attempting to fight back against decades of attacks on living standards the 2017 election triggered a groundswell of demands that the ardern government fulfil its promise to end austerity teachers nurses and other healthcare workers called for significant wage increases and an end to the under staffing and under resourcing of schools and hospitals this year will see a further intensification of the class struggle at the labour party s 2019 conference in november ardern voiced concern about mass anti austerity protests erupting in chile and elsewhere in this increasingly fractured world she said i m reminded of the impact of inequality on not just our people but also on the strength of our democracy as the country heads towards another election she said the government would create further opportunities to lift people up and make a difference to people s lives but ardern s pledges since 2017 to create a society where we look after the most vulnerable where we support our families where we make sure people have the most basic of needs like a roof over their head were always a fraud the seg explained that labour s promises were fundamentally incompatible with its refusal to increase taxes on the rich the labour greens pact to keep government spending below 30 percent of gross domestic product the same as the national party government and pledges to pour billions into the police and military moreover we insisted that labour had to be judged not on ardern s false promises but on its record as one of new zealand s two main parties of big business and imperialism like social democratic parties internationally labour long ago severed any connection with the program of social reformism by the 1970s the unprecedented globalisation of production had removed any basis for containing the class struggle through concessions to workers based on the nationally protected economy the 1984 1990 labour government of david lange launched an assault on the working class every bit as ruthless as the pro business restructuring under thatcher in britain and reagan in the us labour sold off state owned industries including telecommunications and steel and prepared the forestry and rail industries for privatisation with tens of thousands of layoffs it halved the top tax rate for the rich from 66 percent to 33 percent while introducing the regressive goods and services tax gst fees were introduced for tertiary education and some healthcare services in the name of boosting global competitiveness tariffs and subsidies were removed from uncompetitive sections of the economy leading to the complete shutdown of the auto industry and a wave of factory closures mass redundancies and wage cuts in industries such as meat processing approximately 76 000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992 alone the trade unions played a critical role in suppressing any fightback by the working class the 1990 1999 national party government deepened this pro business agenda with major cuts to welfare attacks on workers rights and more privatisations none of the attacks were reversed under prime minister helen clark s labour government from 1999 2008 which was supported by the pseudo left alliance party and the greens clark cemented new zealand s ties with us imperialism by sending troops to afghanistan and iraq at the same time labour tightly restricted spending on social programs leading to greater poverty household debt and inequality student debt soared as universities hiked fees labour lost power after the onset of a recession in 2008 followed by the global financial crash which sparked a wave of job cuts and government austerity enforced by the unions the 2008 2017 government of national party prime minister john key continued the onslaught it froze public spending including wages for teachers and healthcare workers slashed jobs raised the gst partially privatised power companies and attacked welfare entitlements for single parents in opposition labour backed austerity declaring that any government would have had to cut back in response to the crisis the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen under ardern the super rich have reaped massive profits thanks to low corporate taxes low wages and tax free gains in the property market the 2019 national business review rich list shows the country s richest people have a combined 90 billion in total wealth up from 81 billion in 2018 the richest 10 percent controls 53 percent of the wealth and the top 1 percent holds 19 percent meanwhile 17 percent of children live in households below the official poverty line of half the median income up from 16 percent when labour came to power after housing costs are accounted for nearly a quarter of all children live in poverty there is an explosion of poverty related social problems including a rise in diseases caused by poor quality and overcrowded housing and an epidemic of methamphetamine use suicides reached an all time high in 2018 19 of 685 a staggering 21 percent increase in just four years the soaring cost of housing has pushed household debt to a record 164 4 percent of gross income up from 100 percent 20 years ago median rents increased 12 5 percent since october 2017 about three times the rate of wage increases median house prices increased 8 6 percent in the past year alone and auckland is among the least affordable cities in the world with house prices nine times the median income up from 5 4 in 2004 the ardern government has failed to address the crisis an increase of about 3 400 public housing units since october 2017 has been far outstripped by demand the number of families waiting for public housing has increased from 5 844 to 14 500 more than one in 100 people are homeless the return of the class struggle under considerable pressure from workers trade unions that had for decades suppressed any opposition to government cuts were forced to call nationwide strikes in 2018 and 2019 this movement was part of an international upsurge of the working class that includes the yellow vest protests in france the auto workers strike in the us the strike by factory workers in matamoros mexico and mass protests in puerto rico algeria sudan chile egypt lebanon and other countries healthcare workers and teachers have been at the forefront of struggles because they confront every day the consequences of entrenched poverty and the destruction of essential services the trade union bureaucracy however has systematically isolated workers worn them down and betrayed them the unions ceased decades ago to be workers organisations in any meaningful sense they consist of a privileged layer of officials wedded to the labour party whose role is to police workers and enforce the dictates of big business in the name of national competitiveness the new zealand nurses organisation nzno held a one day strike in 2018 the first by public hospital workers since 1989 the union however echoed labour s lie that there was no money to properly staff and resource hospitals after decades in which health funding has failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth the nzno pressured workers to accept a paltry pay increase that was below the increased cost of living which then became the benchmark for an effective wage freeze throughout the public sector following a strike in may by more than 50 000 primary and secondary teachers the largest strike the country has ever seen the post primary teachers association and the new zealand educational institute forced through a deal similar to nzno s in both disputes the unions agreed to the government s cap on wage increases at 3 percent per year instead of the 15 to 18 percent demanded by workers and no significant measures to address the staffing crisis these rotten deals have led to growing anger and frustration more explosive struggles are inevitable and workers will come into ever more open conflict not only with the labour government but with the union bureaucracy the socialist equality group seg intervened in these struggles publishing dozens of articles and statements which were widely read and holding meetings with workers the seg called on workers to reject the union backed austerity and fight for socialist policies including the demand for tens of billions of dollars for schools and hospitals funded through a major redistribution of wealth from the rich and an end to military spending to carry out such a fight requires a political break from the labour party and all its allies and a rebellion against the pro capitalist union bureaucracies workers must take matters into their own hands through the formation of rank and file workplace committees such organisations democratically controlled by workers will unite workers within new zealand and internationally and carry out a real struggle against the labour government and its austerity agenda the pseudo lefts perspective in tatters the seg s fight for socialism and internationalism is bitterly opposed by the pseudo left groups socialist aotearoa sa international socialist organisation iso and the more recently formed organise aotearoa which seek to politically subordinate workers to the labour nz first greens government and the trade union bureaucracy these groups are not socialist or left wing but represent layers of the upper middle class seeking to advance their positions within capitalism their bread and butter is identity politics which is used to sow divisions among workers based on race and gender while promoting reactionary politicians such as the mana party s hone harawira who fraudulently claim to represent maori workers and the poor before the election sa denounced opposition to a labour led government as sectarian the iso hailed labour s coalition deal with the right wing nz first as better than dared hope possible saying it would bring real benefits to the lives of working people the pseudo lefts falsely insist that the unions remain genuine workers organisations that can pressure the government to make progressive reforms during the nurses and teachers disputes the three groups opposed a break from the unions the iso portrayed both sellout deals as partial victories while sa and oa encouraged the illusion that the nzno bureaucracy could be reformed like their counterparts internationally the iso and sa have embraced imperialism both organisations supported the us proxy war for regime change in syria fraudulently portraying it as a revolution at the same time as the us ramped up its war drive they denounced us rivals russia and china as imperialist the pseudo lefts have abandoned any defense of julian assange who is imprisoned in britain and faces extradition to the us for the crime of exposing us war crimes in iraq and afghanistan likewise they are silent on courageous whistleblower chelsea manning who has been imprisoned in the us for refusing to testify against assange fight for socialism and internationalism join the socialist equality group the reactionary record of the ardern government points to the historical bankruptcy of social democracy labour s embrace of the racist nz first and attacks on immigrants who make up one quarter of new zealand s population is the sharpest expression of its hostility to the working class as a whole the government has refused to give in to any of the demands of working people for decent wages resourcing and funding for services including health and education now it is strengthening police state measures and preparing the country to join devastating us led wars involving nuclear armed powers as another election approaches the working class stands at a crossroads the chief danger facing workers and youth is the lack of a socialist party politically independent of labour and all the bourgeois parties the socialist equality group seg is the only organisation that has consistently fought to warn working people about the reactionary agenda of the ardern government the seg exposed the lie by labour s pseudo left allies that the labour nz first alliance represents a lesser evil to the national party we call on workers and young people to break from the labour party and all its supporters including the greens and the trade union bureaucracy the seg is fighting to build a section in new zealand of the international committee of the fourth international icfi the fourth international is the world party of socialist revolution founded by leon trotsky in 1938 based on the strategy of uniting the working class internationally in opposition to the stalinist bureaucracy which betrayed the russian revolution and strangled socialist movements throughout the world the icfi has fought for decades to uphold this internationalist perspective in opposition to stalinism maoism and every other form of nationalism and opportunism a socialist movement can only be built in a struggle against the nationalist poison peddled by the entire political establishment the working class in new zealand must unite across all nationalities and ethnicities and forge close links with the powerful mass movements that are erupting throughout the world this requires the uncompromising defence of immigrants rights to live and work with full democratic and citizenship rights objective conditions have emerged for working people of all countries to be united in a revolutionary movement to overthrow capitalism put an end to the outmoded division of the world into rival nation states and build a socialist society the establishment of workers governments that will expropriate the banks and major industries place them under democratic control of the working class and abolish national borders is the only way to avert the catastrophes of economic depression climate change and world war we urge those who agree with this perspective to join and fight to build the socialist equality group scoop media

pushed its target interest rate to a record low 0 25 markets have been awash with cheap money corporate america went on a borrowing binge thanks to the 2017 tax cuts uncle sam has taken on a lot of debt too the non partisan congressional budget office cbo last week projected that the federal budget deficit will hit 1 015 trillion this year federal deficits are expected to average 1 3 trillion per year between 2021 2030 when the federal budget deficit is high as it is now a large quantity of bonds must be sold to finance the deficit which in turn compels the government to offer higher rates of interest to sell enough bonds the interest rate on treasury bonds is the single most important rate of interest so as rates on bonds get higher the result is higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses as borrowing costs increase to pay for the deficit it could trigger a wave of corporate bankruptcies and global financial contagion this debt bomb could explode when the economy contracts in developing countries about 3 trillion in loans have been doled out to the corporate sector at the same time deeply indebted euro zone governments such as italy and greece have received

new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern announced on january 28 that the next election will be held on september 19 marking the beginning of an eight month campaign since the labour new zealand first greens coalition government was formed just over two years ago it has received significant positive coverage in the world s corporate media new zealand under ardern has been depicted in the new york times the british guardian and elsewhere as an oasis of kindness and egalitarianism in contrast to right wing governments led by trump in the us boris johnson in britain and scott morrison in australia ardern has appeared twice on time s yearly list of the world s 100 most influential people first for having a baby while in office and second for her response to the christchurch massacre her supposedly groundbreaking achievements have been hailed by british labour leader jeremy corbyn and us democrat alexandria ocasio cortez to name just two of many politicians around the world this international praise is aimed at fostering illusions that with leaders like ardern in charge capitalism can be saved and its evils curbed the ruling classes are watching with fear as millions of workers and young people internationally join mass strikes and protests against record levels of social inequality environmental destruction and attacks on democratic rights governments are seeking to combat rising support for socialism particularly among young people announcing the election date ardern declared that the labour party would run a positive factual and robust election campaign highlighting the government s supposed progress on the long term challenges facing new zealand these included she said making critical investments in health and education and reducing child poverty none of this rhetoric has any relationship to reality she was installed as labour leader just two months before the september 2017 election in a desperate bid to prevent the party s collapse labour had suffered historic defeats in 2011 and 2014 and broad sections of the working class correctly view it as a party of big business indistinguishable from the conservative national party after the election labour did not have enough support to govern alone it won 36 9 percent of the votes compared with national s 44 4 percent ardern only became prime minister following a month of sordid negotiations with the right wing nationalist and anti immigrant nz first party which received just 7 2 percent of the votes the unpopular nz first determined the makeup of the government it chose a coalition government with labour instead of the national party because it viewed labour as its preferred partner to whip up xenophobia and integrate new zealand more closely into washington s military confrontation with china labour had campaigned for years in a de facto alliance with nz first and joined its demonisation of chinese immigrants scapegoating them for the housing affordability crisis nz first leader winston peters who became deputy prime minister and foreign minister declared that his coalition with ardern would restore capitalism with a human face ardern echoed this message promising to address poverty homelessness and end nine years of vicious austerity imposed by the national party government after the 2008 financial crisis this propaganda has been exposed by the reality of the past two years the ardern government has overseen increased poverty housing insecurity and starved public services of funding and resources it has attacked democratic rights strengthened the police demonised immigrants and intensified preparations for war the necessary conclusion to be drawn is that capitalism cannot be reformed but must be overthrown labour and the rest of the political establishment are incapable of offering any solution to the dangers of war the climate crisis and the rapidly worsening living conditions the failure of capitalism is leading to revolutionary struggles workers and youth must consciously prepare by building the socialist and internationalist leadership required to unify and lead these struggles imperialist warmongering against china the socialist equality group seg warned from the outset that labour s decision to give the anti immigrant nz first party a central role in government including the roles of foreign minister and defence minister signalled a further rightward shift aimed at aligning new zealand more firmly with us preparations for war against china a key factor in the formation of the government was the unprecedented intervention of us ambassador scott brown who publicly criticised the national party s reluctance to fully endorse trump s criminal threat to totally destroy north korea brown signalled that the us wanted the next government to take a much tougher anti chinese stance just days before the election pro us academic anne marie brady with the support of much of the media and nz first launched a witch hunt against chinese influence within the national party which she implied was compromised by close business ties with china in 2018 the labour led government explicitly named china and russia as the main threats to the international order echoing washington ardern has kept nz troops in iraq and afghanistan assisting the criminal us occupation of those countries in return peters has repeatedly called on the us to deploy more military forces to the pacific region to push back against chinese diplomacy and economic influence and help new zealand enforce its own neo colonial domination over tonga samoa and other small impoverished island nations while starving crucial social services such as health and education of funds the government is committed to spending 20 billion on military assets by 2030 and expanding the size of the army from 4 500 to 6 000 troops new zealand hosts regular military exercises with us and australian troops that are explicitly aimed at preparing to invade pacific countries and suppress popular uprisings encouraged by the government brady and other pro us commentators are engaged in a vicious anti chinese witch hunt demanding state surveillance of chinese born immigrants including members of parliament journalists student associations and community groups brady has also called for stripping voting rights from recent immigrants and reducing economic ties with china nz s main trading partner a major participant in this xenophobic campaign is the pro government trade union funded daily blog which frequently rails against our chinese overlords and paints chinese immigrants as a threat to social stability the same rhetoric is being used by openly fascistic and extreme right wing groups the christchurch massacre and the promotion of the extreme right as in the 1930s the ruling classes in every country are whipping up nationalism and encouraging outright fascist forces to prepare for war divide the working class and pre empt the emergence of a socialist movement the horrific march 15 attack on two mosques in christchurch by fascist terrorist brenton tarrant who killed 51 people and injured 50 more shattered the perception that new zealand was isolated from the growth of extreme right tendencies internationally fascist networks aim to prove that such an atrocity can happen anywhere in the world the seg rejected attempts by politicians and media commentators to paint tarrant as an outsider whose actions reflected nothing about new zealand society because he was born in australia in fact his fascist manifesto contained racist and anti muslim language reminiscent of nz first including an obsession with the low birth rates and the replacement of the white population tarrant blamed immigrants for poor wages and conditions in words similar to those used by the labour party and the trade union bureaucracy the media glorification of ardern s response to the christchurch attack was aimed at preventing any discussion of these glaring similarities likewise the state censorship of tarrant s manifesto is intended to disarm the working class by obscuring the connection between the terrorist s fascist ideology and the right wing nationalism advocated by the political establishment the seg denounced the suppression of the document as a serious attack on democratic rights the circumstances of the attack remain shrouded in secrecy with the official royal commission of inquiry taking place behind closed doors it is clear however that tarrant was part of a network of fascists that enjoyed protection from the australian and new zealand police who turned a blind eye to warnings about tarrant s violent threats against immigrants and communists no explanation has been given for the failure of new zealand s intelligence agencies to stop the attack despite being extremely well resourced to carry out mass surveillance as part of the us led five eyes spying network the massacre was seized upon as a pretext to further boost the resources of the spy agencies and introduce new armed police units in south auckland waikato and canterbury draconian new anti terror legislation will allow police to label someone a terrorist without any need to prove them guilty of a crime and subject them to surveillance and other attacks on basic democratic rights ardern has also become the international poster woman for internet censorship ostensibly to stop the spread of violent extremist and terrorist content what constitutes extremism will be decided by the state in collaboration with internet and social media conglomerates already facebook google youtube and twitter have drastically changed their algorithms to censor anti war left wing and socialist websites including the world socialist web site by directing traffic to the authoritative corporate media at the same time governments in europe the us australia and asia are all creating laws that criminalise left wing protests against inequality climate change and in defence of immigrants escalating social inequality the main target of the government s anti democratic measures and xenophobic propaganda is the working class which is attempting to fight back against decades of attacks on living standards the 2017 election triggered a groundswell of demands that the ardern government fulfil its promise to end austerity teachers nurses and other healthcare workers called for significant wage increases and an end to the under staffing and under resourcing of schools and hospitals this year will see a further intensification of the class struggle at the labour party s 2019 conference in november ardern voiced concern about mass anti austerity protests erupting in chile and elsewhere in this increasingly fractured world she said i m reminded of the impact of inequality on not just our people but also on the strength of our democracy as the country heads towards another election she said the government would create further opportunities to lift people up and make a difference to people s lives but ardern s pledges since 2017 to create a society where we look after the most vulnerable where we support our families where we make sure people have the most basic of needs like a roof over their head were always a fraud the seg explained that labour s promises were fundamentally incompatible with its refusal to increase taxes on the rich the labour greens pact to keep government spending below 30 percent of gross domestic product the same as the national party government and pledges to pour billions into the police and military moreover we insisted that labour had to be judged not on ardern s false promises but on its record as one of new zealand s two main parties of big business and imperialism like social democratic parties internationally labour long ago severed any connection with the program of social reformism by the 1970s the unprecedented globalisation of production had removed any basis for containing the class struggle through concessions to workers based on the nationally protected economy the 1984 1990 labour government of david lange launched an assault on the working class every bit as ruthless as the pro business restructuring under thatcher in britain and reagan in the us labour sold off state owned industries including telecommunications and steel and prepared the forestry and rail industries for privatisation with tens of thousands of layoffs it halved the top tax rate for the rich from 66 percent to 33 percent while introducing the regressive goods and services tax gst fees were introduced for tertiary education and some healthcare services in the name of boosting global competitiveness tariffs and subsidies were removed from uncompetitive sections of the economy leading to the complete shutdown of the auto industry and a wave of factory closures mass redundancies and wage cuts in industries such as meat processing approximately 76 000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992 alone the trade unions played a critical role in suppressing any fightback by the working class the 1990 1999 national party government deepened this pro business agenda with major cuts to welfare attacks on workers rights and more privatisations none of the attacks were reversed under prime minister helen clark s labour government from 1999 2008 which was supported by the pseudo left alliance party and the greens clark cemented new zealand s ties with us imperialism by sending troops to afghanistan and iraq at the same time labour tightly restricted spending on social programs leading to greater poverty household debt and inequality student debt soared as universities hiked fees labour lost power after the onset of a recession in 2008 followed by the global financial crash which sparked a wave of job cuts and government austerity enforced by the unions the 2008 2017 government of national party prime minister john key continued the onslaught it froze public spending including wages for teachers and healthcare workers slashed jobs raised the gst partially privatised power companies and attacked welfare entitlements for single parents in opposition labour backed austerity declaring that any government would have had to cut back in response to the crisis the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen under ardern the super rich have reaped massive profits thanks to low corporate taxes low wages and tax free gains in the property market the 2019 national business review rich list shows the country s richest people have a combined 90 billion in total wealth up from 81 billion in 2018 the richest 10 percent controls 53 percent of the wealth and the top 1 percent holds 19 percent meanwhile 17 percent of children live in households below the official poverty line of half the median income up from 16 percent when labour came to power after housing costs are accounted for nearly a quarter of all children live in poverty there is an explosion of poverty related social problems including a rise in diseases caused by poor quality and overcrowded housing and an epidemic of methamphetamine use suicides reached an all time high in 2018 19 of 685 a staggering 21 percent increase in just four years the soaring cost of housing has pushed household debt to a record 164 4 percent of gross income up from 100 percent 20 years ago median rents increased 12 5 percent since october 2017 about three times the rate of wage increases median house prices increased 8 6 percent in the past year alone and auckland is among the least affordable cities in the world with house prices nine times the median income up from 5 4 in 2004 the ardern government has failed to address the crisis an increase of about 3 400 public housing units since october 2017 has been far outstripped by demand the number of families waiting for public housing has increased from 5 844 to 14 500 more than one in 100 people are homeless the return of the class struggle under considerable pressure from workers trade unions that had for decades suppressed any opposition to government cuts were forced to call nationwide strikes in 2018 and 2019 this movement was part of an international upsurge of the working class that includes the yellow vest protests in france the auto workers strike in the us the strike by factory workers in matamoros mexico and mass protests in puerto rico algeria sudan chile egypt lebanon and other countries healthcare workers and teachers have been at the forefront of struggles because they confront every day the consequences of entrenched poverty and the destruction of essential services the trade union bureaucracy however has systematically isolated workers worn them down and betrayed them the unions ceased decades ago to be workers organisations in any meaningful sense they consist of a privileged layer of officials wedded to the labour party whose role is to police workers and enforce the dictates of big business in the name of national competitiveness the new zealand nurses organisation nzno held a one day strike in 2018 the first by public hospital workers since 1989 the union however echoed labour s lie that there was no money to properly staff and resource hospitals after decades in which health funding has failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth the nzno pressured workers to accept a paltry pay increase that was below the increased cost of living which then became the benchmark for an effective wage freeze throughout the public sector following a strike in may by more than 50 000 primary and secondary teachers the largest strike the country has ever seen the post primary teachers association and the new zealand educational institute forced through a deal similar to nzno s in both disputes the unions agreed to the government s cap on wage increases at 3 percent per year instead of the 15 to 18 percent demanded by workers and no significant measures to address the staffing crisis these rotten deals have led to growing anger and frustration more explosive struggles are inevitable and workers will come into ever more open conflict not only with the labour government but with the union bureaucracy the socialist equality group seg intervened in these struggles publishing dozens of articles and statements which were widely read and holding meetings with workers the seg called on workers to reject the union backed austerity and fight for socialist policies including the demand for tens of billions of dollars for schools and hospitals funded through a major redistribution of wealth from the rich and an end to military spending to carry out such a fight requires a political break from the labour party and all its allies and a rebellion against the pro capitalist union bureaucracies workers must take matters into their own hands through the formation of rank and file workplace committees such organisations democratically controlled by workers will unite workers within new zealand and internationally and carry out a real struggle against the labour government and its austerity agenda the pseudo lefts perspective in tatters the seg s fight for socialism and internationalism is bitterly opposed by the pseudo left groups socialist aotearoa sa international socialist organisation iso and the more recently formed organise aotearoa which seek to politically subordinate workers to the labour nz first greens government and the trade union bureaucracy these groups are not socialist or left wing but represent layers of the upper middle class seeking to advance their positions within capitalism their bread and butter is identity politics which is used to sow divisions among workers based on race and gender while promoting reactionary politicians such as the mana party s hone harawira who fraudulently claim to represent maori workers and the poor before the election sa denounced opposition to a labour led government as sectarian the iso hailed labour s coalition deal with the right wing nz first as better than dared hope possible saying it would bring real benefits to the lives of working people the pseudo lefts falsely insist that the unions remain genuine workers organisations that can pressure the government to make progressive reforms during the nurses and teachers disputes the three groups opposed a break from the unions the iso portrayed both sellout deals as partial victories while sa and oa encouraged the illusion that the nzno bureaucracy could be reformed like their counterparts internationally the iso and sa have embraced imperialism both organisations supported the us proxy war for regime change in syria fraudulently portraying it as a revolution at the same time as the us ramped up its war drive they denounced us rivals russia and china as imperialist the pseudo lefts have abandoned any defense of julian assange who is imprisoned in britain and faces extradition to the us for the crime of exposing us war crimes in iraq and afghanistan likewise they are silent on courageous whistleblower chelsea manning who has been imprisoned in the us for refusing to testify against assange fight for socialism and internationalism join the socialist equality group the reactionary record of the ardern government points to the historical bankruptcy of social democracy labour s embrace of the racist nz first and attacks on immigrants who make up one quarter of new zealand s population is the sharpest expression of its hostility to the working class as a whole the government has refused to give in to any of the demands of working people for decent wages resourcing and funding for services including health and education now it is strengthening police state measures and preparing the country to join devastating us led wars involving nuclear armed powers as another election approaches the working class stands at a crossroads the chief danger facing workers and youth is the lack of a socialist party politically independent of labour and all the bourgeois parties the socialist equality group seg is the only organisation that has consistently fought to warn working people about the reactionary agenda of the ardern government the seg exposed the lie by labour s pseudo left allies that the labour nz first alliance represents a lesser evil to the national party we call on workers and young people to break from the labour party and all its supporters including the greens and the trade union bureaucracy the seg is fighting to build a section in new zealand of the international committee of the fourth international icfi the fourth international is the world party of socialist revolution founded by leon trotsky in 1938 based on the strategy of uniting the working class internationally in opposition to the stalinist bureaucracy which betrayed the russian revolution and strangled socialist movements throughout the world the icfi has fought for decades to uphold this internationalist perspective in opposition to stalinism maoism and every other form of nationalism and opportunism a socialist movement can only be built in a struggle against the nationalist poison peddled by the entire political establishment the working class in new zealand must unite across all nationalities and ethnicities and forge close links with the powerful mass movements that are erupting throughout the world this requires the uncompromising defence of immigrants rights to live and work with full democratic and citizenship rights objective conditions have emerged for working people of all countries to be united in a revolutionary movement to overthrow capitalism put an end to the outmoded division of the world into rival nation states and build a socialist society the establishment of workers governments that will expropriate the banks and major industries place them under democratic control of the working class and abolish national borders is the only way to avert the catastrophes of economic depression climate change and world war we urge those who agree with this perspective to join and fight to build the socialist equality group

a worker wearing a protective suit stands in front of an electronic display board in the lobby of the shanghai stock exchange building in shanghai feb 3 2020 the coronavirus crisis is exacting a terrible toll on human lives across asia with the number of deaths and infections continuing to climb but along with the tragic human impact analysts warn the economic cost could threaten the global economy after an otherwise bright start to asia s year of the rat as of monday chinese authorities put the death toll at 361 with 17 302 confirmed cases experts predict more than 100 000 could become infected worldwide however with the virus having already spread to 26 countries including other major population centers in asia such as india with schools and factories shut in china air travel curtailed and major cities resembling ghost towns the economic effects of the world s worst health crisis in decades are becoming more damaging by the day australia joined the united states and singapore on saturday in blocking entry to noncitizens traveling from china with more than 60 nations imposing entry restrictions on chinese nationals chinese tourists spent some 277 billion worldwide in 2018 and the curtailing of this lucrative travel market could erase up to 3 percentage points of gross domestic product gdp from the most exposed economies such as hong kong cambodia and thailand chinese industry is also facing major disruptions with at least 25 provinces and major cities including beijing and shanghai ordering companies to keep workers at home well beyond the chinese new year holidays up until february 13 protracted factory shutdowns threaten the global supply of personal computers smartphones and other electronics including apple s latest iphone model these disruptions also set to hit other asian nations with vietnam taiwan malaysia south korea and thailand particularly exposed due to their supply chain linkages and while a chinese demand shock would have the biggest impact on emerging markets germany and japan are considered vulnerable too due to reduced exports investors have felt the impact too with asian currencies stocks and bond yields all retreating in the rush for safe havens such as gold and u s dollars global equity prices have dropped by around 3 percent with hong kong s bourse down over 7 percent in a month indian stocks down over 3 percent and japanese and korean stocks losing around 2 percent chinese markets were also expected to face selling pressures monday when they reopened from their extended lunar new year holiday the shanghai composite index dropped by almost 8 percent on monday the first day of trading after the break the crisis could yet get worse with capital economics warning of a potential global slowdown the extensive efforts to contain the coronavirus will cause gdp growth in china and emerging asia to slow sharply in global economist simon macadam said in a research note friday we still hope the economic and market disruption will prove temporary but given china s prominent position in global supply chains and some financial assets stretched valuations there could be global economic fallout if factory closures are extended further and the market sell off deepens for financial markets the new virus could be a plausible catalyst for a market correction given that valuations of some financial assets are already stretched according to capital economics sri lanka s central bank has already attributed an interest rate cut partly due to fears over the virus impact with policymakers in thailand and the philippines seen following suit compared to the sars outbreak in 2003 which caused 8 096 infections the impact of the coronavirus is expected to be far greater due to china s current position as the world s second largest economy and biggest resources consumer anz research has estimated that china s gdp growth could be dragged 0 9 percentage points lower by the coronavirus crisis resulting in headline growth of 5 percent its slowest pace since 1990 industrial production and exports will decline based on a loss of 3 5 working days in the quarter while a plunge in tourism will trim the services sector s gdp growth by 0 9 percent the bank s economists said in a january 30 report outside china and india the bank s economists expect asia to lose as much as 0 5 percentage points in the first quarter with the impact dependent on how quickly the outbreak can be contained the already recession hit hong kong could lose up to 1 4 percentage points of gdp growth from reduced chinese tourism and trade followed by vietnam down 0 8 percentage points thailand 0 7 percentage points and taiwan around 0 6 percentage points lower already hit by a bushfire crisis that has caused a slump in overseas tourists australia could lose another 0 2 percentage points of gdp in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus anz research predicts facing a a 4 5 billion us 3 billion hit to international tourist spending tourism australia has quickly launched a holiday here this year campaign encouraging australians to travel domestically in 2020 particularly to bushfire hit areas the predicted downturn follows an otherwise bright start to asia s year of the rat partly thanks to the u s china phase one trade deal that saw analysts upgrade their forecasts for china s gdp growth imf trade bottoming out in its world economic outlook report released on january 20 the international monetary fund predicted an increase in global growth from 2 9 percent in 2019 to 3 3 percent this year and 3 4 percent in 2021 amid signs that manufacturing activity and global trade are bottoming out the report released before the coronavirus crisis erupted had projected china would expand by 6 percent in 2020 and 5 8 percent in 2021 with this year s forecast upgraded by 0 2 percentage points thanks to the u s china trade deal the asean 5 economies comprising indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand were projected to expand by 4 8 percent in 2020 and 5 1 percent in 2021 however japan the world s third largest economy is seen decelerating from 1 percent gdp growth in 2019 to just 0 7 percent this year and 0 5 percent in 2021 as the impact of recent fiscal stimulus fades india which until recently was the fastest growing major economy is expected to post a 5 8 percent gdp gain this year and 6 5 percent in 2021 due to stress in the nonbank financial sector and weak rural income growth with its own forecasts projecting its weakest growth rate since the global financial crisis of just 5 percent the modi government responded saturday with a spending boost the new budget includes increased spending in agriculture water and infrastructure projects as well as income tax cuts including a 3 6 trillion rupee 50 billion project to provide piped water to all households by 2024 financial markets reacted negatively however with the benchmark sensex index dropping by 2 4 percent in saturday trading after the budget failed to meet investors reform expectations with both china and india facing economic challenges and japan cooling the asia pacific region suddenly is facing a much harsher outlook after its bright start to the year of the rat as authorities scramble to contain the coronavirus the jury is out on whether the chinese zodiac animal will bring hardship or prosperity in 2020
dow jones nasdaq 100 s p 500 gold fed trade war talking points wall street and gold prices rallied in 2019 on trade deal bets monetary policy us china phase two deal uncertain this year attention focuses on the fed technical outlook for dow jones nasdaq 100 s p 500 and gold analyzed dow jones nasdaq 100 s p 500 gold price recap rallying in tandem the dow jones nasdaq 100 and s p 500 began last year on a shaky footing after plummeting in the fourth quarter of 2018 which would see them close the year with a negative return in the months to follow us equities continued higher despite a lingering trade war that worked to create volatility and uncertainty alike will the stock market crash in 2020 while stocks fluctuated wildly on the back of new trade war developments gold emerged as an attractive investment amid the uncertainty and began to establish solid returns as the year progressed further trade war headwinds worked to erode global growth forecasts which sent recessionary fears soaring and stocks retreating the fundamental forces at play made it seem as though us equities were destined for another year of losses if not for a key tailwind the federal reserve monetary policy and repurchase agreements originally planned for 2019 was a path that envisioned three rate hikes but this outlook quickly reversed course amid growing concerns about the health of the global economy as trade wars heated up in the end the fed cut rates three times last year instead another crucial development in driving equities and anti fiat gold prices higher was the swelling in the fed s balance sheet amid a sudden cash shortage in the financial system in late september 2019 overnight lending rates unexpectedly surged to as much as 10 percent this was well above the central bank s target window of 1 75 2 00 at the time the fed turned to open market operations omo to tame short term borrowing costs specifically repurchases also known as repos these function as another window for institutions to borrow capital from the central bank in exchange for collateral often in the form of treasuries and interest financial institutions can borrow cash on a near term basis the timeframe for these can range from overnight to 14 days it acts as an injection of liquidity pushing down the cost of capital since these operations began the central bank s balance sheet has climbed from a low of 3 76t in august to above 4 15t in mid january 2020 see chart above the us china trade war with that in mind the road ahead for wall street and the precious metal in 2020 will likely heavily hinge on a couple of fundamental themes trade wars and the fed s balance sheet in the near term there is also the risk of how fears around the deadly coronavirus transpire much of the impact of trade talks has arguably already played out that was marked by the official signing between the us and china on the phase one agreement sentiment markedly improved in the lead up to the accord though follow through was rather lacking about 360b in u s tariffs against china remain and its fate is tied to a phase two trade deal the white house hinted that its completion could come after this year s presidential election it is uncertain whether president donald trump could remain in charge and a change in leadership could throw talks in a different direction in fact the risks for equities around the election seem to be tilted to the downside so what about monetary policy then federal reserve policy outlook after cutting rates three times in 2019 and expanding the balance sheet aggressively to round out the year the fed has doubled down on its wait and see policy in 2020 consequently markets are currently fully pricing in just one cut to the federal funds rate this year while officials like kansas city fed president esther george have argued pausing rate moves is more appropriate while the federal funds rate looks to be relatively stable for the time being policy regarding repo operations is more fluid the case for a continuation to that end the fed s january rate decision revealed the central bank s balance sheet is set to expand further still as it stands the fed has injected more than 400 billion since september and stocks have reacted in kind nevertheless jerome powell announced the central bank would continue overnight repo operations into april in turn the dow jones nasdaq 100 and s p 500 could enjoy a prolonged tailwind similarly gold may enjoy a modest boost from the continued injection of us dollars into the economy as it catches a bid on inflationary concerns cause for concern conversely the precious metal and us indices could fall under pressure if repo operations are unexpectedly terminated or the fed indicates rate hikes are necessary amid improving economic activity while there have been encouraging developments since september it is hard to deny the correlation between the fed s balance sheet expansion and the performance of the two asset classes especially us stocks which makes the threat of a change in fed policy concerning that being said it is exceedingly difficult to attribute specific gains to a single influence therefore it is unknown to what extent the stock market and gold will react when the fed ceases repurchase agreements but it is likely to be adverse mr powell hinted that they anticipate to adjust the size and pricing of these and eventually slow the pace of purchases over time with the dow jones nasdaq 100 and s p 500 trading near record levels after a commanding rally higher resistance to the topside is almost nonexistent barring a few trendline projections and prior highs it appears as though the three us indices are destined for even greater heights should the fundamental landscape remain

get my guide dow jones technical analysis in the case of the dow jones support will likely reside along the ascending trendline from the lows established in december 2018 throughout 2019 the technical level maintained varying degrees of influence a theme it should maintain until a serious break beneath is posted dow jones price chart secondarily a series of prior highs the 200 day simple moving average and horizontal support around 27 400 create an area of confluent support on the other hand resistance is rather sparse aside from the industrial average s all time high around 29 400 nasdaq 100 technical analysis since the technology sector has led much of the decade long rally it is of little surprise the tech heavy nasdaq 100 finds itself among the leaders of the bull market trading near record levels resistance likely resides at prior highs around 9 265 nasdaq 100 price chart underneath the nasdaq should enjoy initial support in the form of an ascending trendline from lows tagged in october secondary and substantial support resides slightly north of 8 900 the confluence of the index s 200 day simple moving average and two ascending bands marked by prior highs and lows additionally the psychologically significant 9 000 milestone could offer a modicum of buoyancy s p 500 technical analysis shifting focus to the s p 500 the chart again reveals a distinct lack of serious resistance apart from prior all time highs around 3 336 unlike the dow jones and nasdaq which enjoy a buffer between current prices and support the s p 500 finds itself suspiciously near an ascending channel should it break bears could look to drive prices lower as they attempt to test potential support around the psychologically significant 3 200 s p 500 price chart subsequent support

possible time in global economic conditions meredith lilly norman paterson school of international affairs one of the really big issues is that we are entering a period where a number of countries are erecting trade barriers for a variety of reasons lilly said in an interview this isn t just an american story the use of non tariff barriers regulatory barriers phytosanitary barriers death by a thousand regulations is happening with increasing frequency around the world canada is waking up and wanting to diversify at almost the worst possible time in global economic conditions the practice of exporting beef under ceta is one of the more stark examples of how individual market regulations can hinder trade the deal which provisionally came into effect in september 2017 expanded the quota of canadian tariff free fresh and frozen beef allowed into the eu to 50 000 tonnes from 20 000 tonnes over six years in exchange canada doubled its quota for european cheese to 18 500 tonnes photo by fabrice coffrini afp getty images european producers used up almost every gram of their expanded market access in canada but canadian exporters were not able to use any of their frozen beef quota in 2019 and just 2 8 per cent of their chilled beef allowance advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content some of the things choking the flow of trade include european health and quality standards require beef to be grown without hormones prohibit the use of certain products to wash bacteria from meat and add a testing requirement to assure eu compliance lowe said until recently there was only one veterinarian in alberta even qualified to give eu certification he said and anyway we believe in the use of science to grow the safest most efficient beef with europe we can t do that meeting the requirements costs too much in all european exports to canada rose 14 5 per cent in 2018 while canadian exports to the eu rose at half that rate such barriers are also on the rise beyond europe for example saudi arabia has cut off purchases of canadian wheat and barley after its diplomatic row with ottawa and india one of the largest buyers of canadian pulses began hiking tariffs on peas and lentils in 2017 amid an excess of domestic supply regulatory hurdles have also emerged as a key irritant for

good informal relationships with other nations to get rid of impediments to trade he said it s not sexy but it s where we are likely to have the most impact at the same analysts said canada will need to resist the rise of managed trade and the erosion of multilateral deals by bilateral pacts for example pork and beef exports to japan initially soared under cptpp were expected to climb further but the u s has since negotiated a standalone deal with the country that eliminated canada s advantage and the recent phase one u s china trade deal includes a commitment from beijing to purchase an

also wants to export to is very threatening for us lilly said it s threatening with china it s threatening with japan for a small trading nation such as canada such actions mean shoring up multilateral bodies such as the wto which was weakened after the u s paralyzed its top trade court by blocking the appointment of new members is essential canada and the eu recently established an alternate mechanism for managing trade disputes that has since won the support of 15 other nations including china efforts like this are important and hugely valuable to canada lamp said our main trading relationship is with the u s under nafta but our other trade flows with china and india for example are still governed by wto rules we have to stay engaged amid ongoing international trade

heather long washington post finland s prime minister sanna marin is a big believer in the american dream and she thinks it s a lot easier to achieve right now in her country than in the united states i feel that the american dream can be achieved best in the nordic countries where every child no matter their background or the background of their families can become anything marin told the washington post in an interview on the sideline of the world economic forum in switzerland last month we feel that the nordic model is a success story said marin who became prime minister in december at age 34 making her briefly the youngest world leader she lost that title in january when 33 year old sebastian kurz returned to power as austrian chancellor marin is hardly the first to claim that it s easier to live the american dream in nordic countries british politician and former labour party leader edward miliband said it in 2012 a new york times opinion piece last year dubbed finland a capitalist paradise and presidential candidate sen bernie sanders i vt a self declared democratic socialist has often said that the united states should be more like scandinavia countries like denmark and sweden do very well sanders said in iowa in april he praised them for having an economy in which you have wealth being created by the private sector but you have a fair distribution of that wealth on twitter sanders also praised finland s health care system especially its manageable childbirth cost as election 2020 heats up there s likely to be renewed attention to how the united states compares to other countries including finland on many of president donald trump s preferred metrics the unemployment rate the stock market and economic growth gdp the united states typically performs better but on rankings of happiness social mobility health care and child care finland comes out on top marin told the washington post we have a very good education system we have a good health care and social welfare system that allows anybody to become anything this is probably one of the reasons why finland gets ranked the happiest country in the world when the u s v finland denmark sweden debate escalated on the 2016 campaign trail democrat hillary clinton was quick to say in a cnn debate with sanders we are not denmark many republicans are far more dismissive of the nordic model and trump regularly tweets about how bad he thinks socialism is finland is a country of 5 5 million people close in population size to the state of minnesota but geographically finland is nearly the size of california the united states has 329 million people and about 29 times more land of course every country s situation is different every country s political atmosphere is different marin said but she emphasized again the american dream can be achieved in finland for everyone here s a look how the united states compares to finland on several economic and well being indicators happiness finland is the happiest country in the world according to the world happiness report which looks at a variety of factors including social support economic growth life expectancy freedom and generosity the united states came in at no 19 last year s report noted the years since 2010 have not been good ones for happiness and well being among americans it cited widespread addiction problems and unhealthy digital media use as reasons for alarm social mobility nordic countries are at the top of the world economic forum s social mobility index which looks at how people born across the income spectrum fare in health educational achievement and income the united states ranks number 27 behind not only finland but germany canada france japan australia and more social mobility in the united states has been falling widely cited research by harvard professor raj chetty shows that back in 1940 more than 90 of children born in the united states that year went on to earn more than their parents that same benchmark has fallen to 50 for children born in the early 1980s unemployment one of the metrics where the united states looks better than finland is the unemployment rate the u s unemployment rate is 3 5 a half century low and most americans agree it is easier to find a job right now the unemployment rate in finland is 6 that said the share of the population that works is slightly higher in finland 66 2 than in the united states 63 2 life expectancy according to the world health organization finland ranks 21st for life expectancy with an average of 81 4 years the united states comes in at no 34 with a life expectancy of 78 5 finland also has much lower maternal death rates during childbirth compared to the united states according to the cia factbook health care cost the u s health care system spends over 10 000 per person per year finland s system spends 4 000 per person per year according to the health system tracker in finland health care is free because it is paid for by the government there are some complaints of uneven care in finland since the system is largely run at the municipal level which means health care services can vary there are also concerns of how to continue funding the finnish system with an aging population still there is overwhelming satisfaction with finland s system versus a slim majority of americans 52 who say they are satisfied with the u s quality of care economic growth gdp the united states has a faster growing economy the imf projects 1 5 gdp for finland in 2020 versus 2 for the united states in recent years the finnish economy has been growing 1 3 to 1 7 while the united states has averaged 2 3 during this expansion home ownership home ownership is higher in finland 72 7 than in the united states 63 7 according to the urban institute data from 2015 home ownership dropped sharply in the united states after the 2008 09 financial crisis with many people losing their homes to foreclosure there was an especially large drop in african americans homeownership but even before the crisis the united states had never topped 70 homeownership child care cost for a typical middle class couple with two kids child care costs are much higher in the united states than in finland the organization for economic co operation and development oecd found that 41 of pay goes toward childcare in the united states versus 17 in finland the united states actually has the highest costs among the countries studied while finland is just below average government subsidizes child care in finland and there is a cap on how much even wealthier families have to pay educational achievement there are several ways to look at educational achievement a global test given to 15 year olds found that finnish teenagers performed better on reading math and science exams than their u s peers somewhat backing up the finnish prime minister s claim of educational quality for all that said according to oecd data the united states has a higher share of its population with college or advanced degrees than finland does this might sound surprising since college is free for finnish students but the higher education system is selective with a lot of finnish students rejected because there isn t enough funding for all taxes finns pay much higher taxes in order to pay for so many government benefits finland routinely ranks as one of the top tax collection countries in the oecd while the united states is routinely toward the bottom in 2018 a single worker earning a typical middle class wage paid about 30 of their income in taxes in finland versus 24 in the united states according to oecd data that figure includes the federal income tax and payroll taxes like social security that are paid by workers poverty finland has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world it is about half of the u s rate the official u s poverty rate in 2018 was 11 8 according to the u s census compared to 6 3 in finland according to the oecd stock market performance there are a lot of ways to judge stock market performance but the u s wins this one hands down in the past year the popular s p 500 index of u s companies has gained over 21 while the omx helsinki 25 a popular finnish index is up a bit shy of 13 but far more of the world s most significant and highest performing companies trade on the u s markets looking at the past decade the finnish stock market is up about 150 versus a roughly 250 return for u s stocks ease of doing business the united states is usually at or near the top of lists for global competitiveness and entrepreneurship for example the u s is no 1 on the global entrepreneurship index while finland ranks 12th similarly the united states ranks 12th while finland is 20th conservative heritage foundation s index of

new york stocks rose in much of the world monday and recovered some of their losses from earlier weeks but markets are still far from giving the all clear on the virus that has spread to more than 20

indexes remains 1 4 to 3 2 below their records set last month all the unsettled trading is a sharp departure from 2019 which saw stocks and bonds make powerful moves higher and it s the result of growing uncertainty nobody knows how much the virus will ultimately hurt economies and corporate profits let alone human lives around the world past disease outbreaks have seen stocks hit bottom when the number of new cases peaked this new virus that first spread from china has already shut factories there halted some global air traffic and caused economists to cut their 2020 growth forecasts for

revenue to s p 500 companies than any country besides the united states ceos from a wide range of industries have said they expect some kind of hit to their businesses the fears have also struck just as investors believed economic growth would re accelerate around the world thanks in large part to interest rate cuts and bold actions by the federal reserve and other central banks around the world a report on monday said u s manufacturing returned to growth in january for the first time in six months but many investors discounted it because it doesn t fully reflect all the virus concerns think about what global central bankers are thinking about now said emily roland co chief investment strategist at john hancock investment management she imagined them saying are you kidding me we pumped so much liquidity into the economy last year and now the yield curve is inverting again the yield curve is a tool inside the bond market which investors see as a rather reliable predictor of recessions though it doesn t have a perfect track record it triggers when it becomes inverted or when short term treasurys offer higher yields than longer term treasurys on monday the three month yield was at 1 56 above the 1 52 yield of the 10 year which itself rose from 1 51 late friday sentiment builds on sentiment and there s so much uncertainty right now roland said we re not ready to call the all clear

in an effort to revive economic growth the union government recently announced a rs 102 lakh crore five year infrastructure investment plan this has naturally raised questions about the source of its financing before diving into the financing challenges it may be useful to categorise the infrastructure sector from a financing perspective importantly there is no single infrastructure asset category the risk return profiles vary widely not only across sectors but even within too eg electricity generation and distribution or water treatment and distribution they also vary based on stage of the project construction and operation and across locations some are commercially viable some can be made commercially viable using public finance or enabling policies while many cannot be done so some face risks some uncertainties and some both complicating matters with evolution of the market these profiles vary it may therefore be useful to divide infrastructure into four illustrative categories depending on their commercial viability certain sectors category i can recover their construction and operation costs through tariffs or user fees and therefore are commercially viable they include telecommunications power generation and transmission gas transmission and distribution high traffic roads and railway corridors major airports and port terminals and sometimes bulk water supply certain other types or category ii can be made commercially viable if a part of the capital expenditure is excluded or covered otherwise they include sectors like many road stretches and metro rail projects on high density routes or the smaller airports or those in general which require large capital expenditures but which are not offset by the long term revenues they can be made commercially viable if a part of the capital expenditure is subsidised in the form of concessions and transfers directly made to the project asset or in the form of viability gap funding during the bidding process the former includes transfer of land parcels to a metro railway project to generate additional real estate based revenue streams the latter include viability gap funding of airlines as part of the udaan programme to service remote regions then there are the category iii projects which involve assets which can theoretically become commercially viable and some of them are so in some developed countries however especially but not only in developing countries they suffer from both construction and operational uncertainties urban infrastructure water and sewerage solid waste management and mass transit and power distribution are good examples of such assets in these for example contracted tariff increases often get embroiled in the local political economy and come to naught investors hesitate to invest without significant risk mitigation all the remaining infrastructure assets which are not commercial in nature are best financed by governments social infrastructure works like schools hospitals irrigation etc belong to this category in such projects private participation if at all comes through service concessions for specific activities like facilities management the world bank s public private partnership ppp database of private participation in infrastructure in low and middle income countries informs that category i and ii projects made up 87 1 per cent of all ppp projects in the 1995 2019 period in contrast urban infrastructure made up just 6 3 per cent the corresponding indian figures are 96 per cent and 1 1 per cent in fact power generation national highways and telecoms formed over 90 per cent of the 265 8 bn worth ppp projects in india over the 1990 2018 period add in airports and ports and the rest all put together is rounding error incidentally this categorisation neatly coincides with an index of maturity and investment attractiveness of different infrastructure asset categories developed by the rating agency crisil the important takeaway is that while some infrastructure sectors are commercially viable some others can be made so in any case there is no alternative to public finance for a large segment of infrastructure it is therefore encouraging that public finance is expected to cover 78 per cent of the cost of the new infrastructure plan what s the role of public policy in financing infrastructure there are four potential sources of finance three domestic government private corporate and private household savings and foreign the domestic private capital which has to do the heavy lifting is determined by the available investible long term savings from households and corporates foreign capital is limited by the level of the country s sustainable external balance the envelope of finance available for infrastructure is therefore limited in simple terms capital mobilisation has hard accounting constraints india s gross domestic savings gds for 2017 18 stood 30 5 per cent of the gdp of this government savings formed 1 7 per cent of the gdp private corporate 11 6 per cent and private household 17 2 per cent however of the private household savings physical assets like gold silver land etc formed 10 6 per cent of the gdp leaving financial savings at just 6 6 per cent of the gdp adding everything up the total financial savings available for the economy in 2017 18 was no more than 19 9 per cent of the gdp here too bank deposits which are unsuited for long term investments like infrastructure formed nearly half the aggregate financial savings further in recent years india s gds have been falling and its share of investible savings is smaller compared to the east asian economies in its high growth years and even now china had sustained 40 50 per cent gds and could therefore afford gross fixed capital formation rates of 45 50 per cent further they all had a far greater share of investible household savings and industrial policy played a very active role in this intermediation also as an asset category infrastructure is considered a stable but low return investment thereby lowering its attractiveness on a global perspective the median net internal rates of return irr on all private capital has ranged from 8 12 per cent over the 2007 15 period over a ten and five year horizons to september 2018 infrastructure funds have delivered an average irr of less than 6 per cent and 8 per cent respectively both being the lowest among all private capital investment categories therefore only a small share of investors have the risk appetite and returns expectations which match that of infrastructure given all this and the diversity within the infrastructure sector itself there is an important distinction to be made between the use of public policy to efficiently leverage the available long term private capital to invest in infrastructure and its use to expand the envelope of available long term private capital to invest in infrastructure in mainstream debates it is often assumed that public policy can expand the envelope of available infrastructure finance however in reality the envelope of public policy can meaningfully expand if the supply of projects can be made attractive enough for the available capital expanding the envelope of available capital itself requires boosting the country s gds further given the variations in the nature of infrastructure segments the role of government too varies widely in category i projects it is more about efficient crowding in of infrastructure itself than of capital in others like category ii and iii projects and greenfield assets generally governments may have a primary financing role to de risk to crowd in private capital finally the use of foreign capital faces a currency mismatch problem infrastructure projects have local currency expenditures and revenues and are risky and low return investments if we add up the country risk higher inflation rate and likely currency depreciations the asset has to generate a very high rate of return to justify foreign capital financing the main sources of infrastructure finance in india today are domestic banks and capital markets and foreign investors the total infrastructure sector credit outstanding from banks the primary source as on 29 march 2019 was rs 10 559 21 bn usd 148 bn and the total incremental bank credit to the infrastructure sector for the year 2018 19 was rs 1649 84 bn usd 23 bn further infrastructure sector formed 36 6 per cent of the total credit outstanding of the schedule commercial banks to industry and 12 2 per cent of the total non food bank credit outstanding both being at the regulatory limits of exposure in response to the limitations of bank finance experts posit capital markets as an alternative and lament their under developed state but the global experience especially outside the united states shows that domestic banks loans often syndicated have been the primary source of infrastructure financing bonds have formed less than 10 per cent with the vast majority concentrated in the united states annual total infrastructure bonds issuances domestically for all emerging economies excluding china have been less than 10 bn in recent years in fact infrastructure bonds form a very small proportion of the total bond markets what about foreign capital consultants and opinion makers estimate a large volume of foreign capital available for infrastructure investments but this is deceptive and becomes vanishingly small when examined closely as on september 2018 the private capital dry powder or funds available to invest for infrastructure was 189 bn from out of 2 2 trillion across all sectors only a tiny proportion of this targets india for example of the 132 bn infrastructure focused dry powder available at end 2017 just 17 bn was focused on asia among those in the market raising capital as on october 2018 just 15 funds raising 9 bn were primarily focused on asia and within asia too india competes with japan china and the other east asian economies further most of this capital is towards category i projects in particular renewables and on brownfield assets taking all this into account the likely available india bound infrastructure focused private capital annually would be no more than a few billion dollars as india explores various alternatives for financing infrastructure it would do well to keep in mind the global experience of public finance and domestic bank loans being the major contributors while alternative sources like bonds and foreign capital are useful complements we need to be realistic with our expectations for them this also underscores the importance of boosting domestic savings and immediate restoration of the banks balance sheets this is the first article in a three part series on infrastructure financing

for once it must have been a quite interesting not fascinating meeting of the bank of england s monetary policy committee last thursday there was actually a decision to be made on interest rates some 60 of analysts were expecting a quarter point cut in base rate on the grounds that inflation has been running well below the 2 target for many months and critically given the forward looking nature of the target set for the mpc is expected to stay below target until the back end of 2021 policy does not seem to be symmetrical when inflation is running somewhat above target and set to stay so then the mpc appears more likely to raise rates than it is to cut when the obverse applies however this is not to disagree with their decision given the very limited monetary policy ammunition at the committee s disposal it does make sense to keep powder dry just in case there is a further unexpected deceleration ahead the mpc has set out very clearly why it expects a gentle pick up in uk growth this is based upon the assumption of an immediate but orderly move to a deep free trade agreement with the eu the upside then results from three key factors some global pick up reduction in brexit related uncertainties and expansion of public expenditure as per earlier government announcements that is fine for a central expectation but as ever there are downside risks on the global front the corona virus could develop into a real concern on a wide geographical front or there again the risk could dissipate rapidly the us and china have come to some sort of minimalistic agreement on trade this looks sufficient to maintain peace and quiet on this front through to the us presidential elections this is unless impeachment becomes a real possibility or president trump decides to rattle sabres with china as a sign of a continuing robust commitment to america first in the run up to his planned re election or some unpredicted event to note such risks the bank of england in its usual cautious language noted that broader trade tensions and associated uncertainties remained high that no doubt includes a nod to uncertainties in the middle east who knows how the post brexit arrangements will develop uncertainties will diminish if the vibrations are positive regarding trade deals with the eu and usa in particular but neither can be seen as done deals as yet there could still be tears before bedtime and a return to troubling unknowns that would further stifle business investment and rock business confidence more widely we will have no real certainty regarding the uk government s tax and expenditure plans until the march 11th budget here it does seem a done deal that there will be significant fiscal easing with major increases in funding for health education et al and no marked tax rises however the extent of fiscal easing remains inherently unpredictable forecasting this prime minister s decision making is still like reading tea leaves the continuation of uncertainty regarding the uk outlook is shown by currency volatility of late after the conservatives emphatic victory at the general election and the effective removal of the corbyn risk sterling shot up against the us dollar more recently it has returned whence it came there are still clouds on the economic horizon the last governor of the bank of england talked about a nice economy non inflationary consistent growth we have the first element secure but certainly not the second for the time being nevertheless the mpc expects these domestic and global factors to stimulate some growth in the demand side of our economy that is much needed as retail sales volume was down again through the final quarter of 2019 by a full 1 this included the vital month of december consumer credit growth slowed once more particularly spending on credit cards if perceived uncertainties do diminish then there may be scope for some upward movement in consumer demand average earnings growth slowed through last year but remains well above the rate of retail inflation at the same time unemployment continues to edge down in sum there are some positive vibes as we look forward maybe 2020 will be a marginally better economic year and maybe we will end the year on a more significantly positive note but there are plenty of maybes around further global shocks are possible further enhancement of brexit uncertainties quite feasible it will be some time before we see genuine recovery in business investment critical for a sustained recovery and uk consumers remain on edge with many keeping their hands firmly in their pockets until a real recovery in confidence is under way jeremy peat is visiting professor at the university of strathclyde

bloomberg the message from wall street this election season is clear be prepared for surprises even before the first votes are cast monday in iowa investors are bracing for months of uncertainty senator bernie sanders s lead in polling for the state s democratic caucus is signaling an extended primary fight with myriad ups and downs ahead after president donald trump s surprise 2016 victory whipsawed markets no one wants to get caught off guard this time there s been unprecedented levels of equities hedging this early in the election cycle at cboe global markets inc and there are signs that currency traders are sizing up the democratic field and hedging their bets as they weigh the implications for november normally you can have plan a and plan b and now you re going to have plan a through almost z said sean simko global head of fixed income portfolio management at sei investments co there will be multiple plans as there are multiple contenders and each has a similar but different story while markets have been forced to focus in recent weeks mainly on the economic impact of the deadly coronavirus investors say they also need to start prepping for the electoral marathon ahead as they do a handful of themes are prevalent trade policy the bulging federal deficit and taxes trade the focus of trump s trade war has been mainly on china and it produced a phase one deal which the two sides signed last month easing tensions helped push the treasuries yield curve to the steepest in more than a year in december and drove the yuan to a multimonth high in january intensifying virus concerns since then have pummeled china s currency that s added to the uncertainty investors face as they mull whether u s presidential candidates will choose to make exchange rates and renminbi weakness in particular an electoral issue but looking to the next round of trade negotiations the talks may not be any less difficult even if a democrat were to win in november according to invesco s kristina hooper for example sanders s website lays out why he s against most trade agreements while his rival senator elizabeth warren has advocated an approach that departs from pro trade policies of past democratic presidents if we were to get a progressive democrat the u s attitude toward china wouldn t change said hooper invesco s chief global market strategist in new york sanders and warren are protectionist and i believe would take very similar positions that trump has toward china a victory by former vice president joe biden who s perceived to offer a more moderate path than some of his rivals may pressure yields higher on speculation that he might be more inclined than other candidates to roll back tariffs hooper said in national polling for the democratic nomination biden has the lead followed by sanders and warren according to realclear politics averages michael bloomberg is polling fourth he s the founder and majority owner of bloomberg lp the parent company of bloomberg news the top three democratic candidates are leading trump in head to head polls by roughly two or more percentage points according to realclear politics deficits for brad bechtel at jefferies llc in new york there s at least one near certainty an already bulging u s deficit is likely to swell in his view that could spell trouble for the dollar which has gained in five of the last seven years the white house is working on plans for a post election tax cut meanwhile an adviser to sanders says the u s can safely add 500 billion to its deficit which is already poised to exceed 1 trillion without risking a jump in inflation democratic candidates have advanced spending proposals on areas such as climate change infrastructure and education a scenario where a significant fiscal plan emerges combined with a pickup in global growth and trade a prospect that looked more likely before the viral outbreak in china would present a perfect storm for the dollar bechtel said to be sure markets have yet to reach a tipping point on america s swelling budget shortfall despite years of warnings record low yields are within reach even as the treasury is selling historic amounts of debt taxes for zhiwei ren at penn mutual asset management a victory by some of the top democratic candidates risks quicker inflation because the spending increases they advocate may not be funded by sufficient tax increases it matters more if warren or sanders are the candidate from the democratic side because a lot of their policies are extremely inflationary said ren who s firm is based in horsham pennsylvania ten year yields are set to rise if one of these candidates wins the nomination and then november s vote he said of course trump has expanded the deficit and the need for increased debt sales mainly through his tax cuts and he isn t likely to become fiscally conservative if he s re elected ren said so while yields may rise with a trump victory the increase would be more dramatic under some of the democratic candidates ren said hideout no matter how the primaries shape up history shows investors may want to bet on a flatter yield curve in the six to nine months before november s vote that s what s happened in u s election cycles since the 1980s according to deutsche bank ag investors tend to reduce risk and hide out in treasuries as electoral uncertainty is resolved said strategist stuart sparks in new york the starting gun has already fired three month treasury rates are above those on 10 year notes for the first time since october in the wake of the federal reserve s meeting last week bechtel expects that questions around the election will only intensify as nov 3 the day americans vote for president approaches while trump s moves and tweets have been far from predictable upheaval may ensue even if he loses the big issue in markets is certainty bechtel said if you get a democrat into office then uncertainty increases depending on the candidate to contact

other uncertainties could dent global growth the u s market which had calmly been setting record after record suffered its worst january since 2016 and its first monthly loss since august technology companies which do a lot of business with china led the losses airlines fell after delta and american suspended flights to and from china the sell off erased the s p 500 s gains for january and gave the benchmark index its biggest weekly loss since august china s communist leaders have massive resources for intervening to staunch panic selling of shares and have deployed them in past times of

axicorp said in a client note the plunge when markets reopened was expectable he said it s not the earthquake at the open but rather the aftershocks that will drive risk sentiment on monday he said in a separate statement saturday the pboc said financial institutions should follow local quarantine regulations and try to minimize gatherings to reduce risks of spreading the virus that includes allowing rotating shifts working online from home and other strategies it said regulators have also urged banks and other financial institutions to boost lending and soften repayment requirements in areas severely affected by the pandemic trading in shanghai is mostly conducted electronically so there is no crowded raucous trading floor shanghai authorities extended the lunar new year holiday until feb 9 the virus outbreak has cast a shadow over the initially upbeat start to 2020 as the u s and china signed a trade deal that eased a big source of uncertainty and raised hopes a global slowdown might have bottomed out just two weeks ago the s p 500 closed at an all time high having climbed around 13 since early october volatility was running at 12 month lows and even a dust up between the u s and iran didn t rock markets while britain s exit from the european union on friday barely registered the action on other asian markets monday was less dramatic japan s nikkei 225

monday is off to a lively start with the reopening of china s capital markets reopen after an extended chinese new year break as authorities there attempt to control the spread of the wuhan virus despite a circa 22 billion injection of cash and shaving 10 basis points off the 7 and 14 day repo rates by the pboc this morning chinese mainland markets look thunderstruck investors have taken a shoot to thrill approach with the csi 300 and shanghai composite indices falling 9 0 on opening before recovering slightly to post losses of 7 50 after 30 minutes of trading half an hour earlier commodities exchanges opened in china with important benchmarks in oil rubber iron ore and copper amongst a slew of others immediately falling limit down by 5 0 limit down may well be a two word expletive we hear throughout the day in asia with both chinese and regional asian markets unlikely to be back in black anytime soon over in currency markets the pboc put a brave face on proceedings setting the onshore yuan fix at a much stronger than expected rate of 6 9239 that was below the latest pre holiday fixing at 6 9368 currency markets are having none of it though with both the onshore cny and offshore cnh were both trading around 6 9900 to the dollar earlier in the session china s financial authorities appear to be walking the razor s edge this morning in the face of a global panic over the wuhan virus and its potential effects on china and global growth rather than drawing lines in the sand for waves of sellers to crash against they appear to have taken a leaf from bruce lee always a sound strategy be the bamboo or willow tree that bends in the wind rather than the stiffest tree that easily cracks expect the national team of state owned investment managers to be deployed in the stock markets once the initial waves have passed to try and stabilise things we can also expect more direct action from the pboc and other chinese authorities in the days to come if necessary no amount of bending in the wind though is likely to contain the panic surrounding the wuhan virus though asian stock markets have already followed china into the red following that bastion of peak optimism wall street capitulating on friday the self perpetuating negative feedback curve on global growth that i have mentioned previously is in full swing as country after country closes its borders to chinese citizens and more airlines stop flying to the mainland internationally over half of china s provinces have now themselves extended the new year break by another week to help control the potential spread of the virus the noise around the wuhan virus has seen the world choose paranoia over precaution drowning out what would otherwise have been a busy week for the world on the data front the knock on effects in globally intertwined supply lines were there to see this morning china s caixin manufacturing pmi for january easing slightly to 51 1 we would expect that reading to worsen substantially in february as wuhan virus aside the data would have been skewed by the chinese new year break anyway the rest of asia presented a mixed bag with the markit manufacturing pmi s in taiwan and philippines printing slightly higher but the rest of asia notably indonesia and ominously japan s jibun pmi all slumping several central banks have rate decisions this week notably india and australia with the week culminating in with the us non farm payrolls the reserve bank of india will almost certainly have to ease this week after the onshore stock market poorly received saturday s federal budget personal income taxes were slashed although i believe only 5 0 of india s population actually pay them and the federal deficit will increase through higher borrowing with prices rising but growth falling the last thing the central bank probably wants to do is cut rates in a stag flationary environment their hands are likely tied though after stocks fell sharply on saturday an inevitable second wave of sellers of india stocks currency and bonds are likely to arrive this afternoon following the ructions in asia this morning overall equity energy and commodity markets will remain under intense pressure as the economic threat of the wuhan virus ferments fear coming at a time when valuations on equities in particular had been pumped to record highs by the return of easy central bank money expect investment grade government bond yields to keep falling and precious metals to keep rising as investors globally choose discretion over valour equities the shanghai composite and csi 300 in china have fallen by 7 50 at the time of writing after reopening 9 0 lower following the extended chinese new year break the slight recovery looks like more of the oft mentioned dead cat bounce prevalent last week across the world however with the daily 10 0 limit down for both indices potentially achievable today china s national team of state owned investment funds are likely only to be able to fight a rear guard action today which is in fact a sound strategy elsewhere wall street had already set the tone for asian markets as the masters of the universe succumbed to the wuhan virus threat on friday the s p 500 nasdaq and dow jones industrial s falling by between 1 50 and 2 0 that said the damage had already been partially priced into regional apac equity markets last week it has mollified the carnage in china from spilling over to the rest of asia but local markets are still a sea of red the straits times and nikkei 225 are 1 0 lower the kospi 0 50 lower and the hang seng is 0 20 lower australia s china centric all ordinaries is 1 15 lower and the rest of asia s regional markets are all anchored in the red we can expect more of the same for the rest of the session with any incipient recoveries likely to be met with a wall of sellers the wuhan virus effect will also likely compound the negative performance of europe s stock markets on friday as well currencies the us dollar sank against its major counterparts on friday as us yields tanked across the curve on growth worries and haven inflows the dollar index fell 0 50 to 97 40 eur usd and gbp usd shrugged off the uk s official exit from europe on friday approaching 1 1100 and 1 3200 respectively gbp usd has fallen by 50 points to 1 3150 this morning after uk pm johnson signalled a hard line with europe in upcoming trade agreement negotiations over the weekend growth fears are likely to make further rallies hard going though even with a weaker us dollar the usd jpy has fallen to 108 40 boosted by yen repatriation and haven flows and looks set to outperform in the coming days 107 75 looms as monthly support on the downside offshore chinese yuan has capitulated over the last hour with usd cnh crashing through the key 7 0000 level rising 200 points to 7 1000 with one eye on the white house and the us president s itchy trigger finger on trade chinese authorities are unlikely to allow the cnh sell off to become a rout from these levels with us treasury yields continuing to sink weakening the us dollar regional asian currencies have been spared an emerging market sell off thus far today that state of affairs is likely to be intrinsically tied to the performance of the mainland markets over the next few days oil oil fell on friday with both brent crude and wti lower by over 1 8 as wuhan virus growth feared swamped friday s early rally in asia after an initial 1 0 dip on opening this morning both brent crude and wti have made small gains brent crude is down 0 65 at 56 25 a barrel and wti is lower by 0 25 at 51 40 a barrel the recovery is unconvincing however and we would expect renewed selling pressure into europe as petro china has announced refining output cuts to match reduced demand on the mainland opec and its allies will be particularly concerned by brent crude approaching the 55 00 a barrel market being the international pricing benchmark used across the world ex usa a fall through 55 00 almost certainly will see an early opec meeting convened and further price cuts announced they are however only likely to plaster over the wounds as oil remains perhaps the most vulnerable asset class to a global economic slowdown induced by the wuhan virus
25 years ago russian miners strike on february 8 1995 more than 600 000 coal miners staged a one day strike across russia shutting down mines from sakhalin in the east to the don river basin demanding payment of back wages and increased subsidies from the government of president boris yeltsin for the coal industry many of the miners had not been paid since the previous october at least 200 out of 228 coal mines in russia were affected the only major coal producing area which did not participate vorkuta in the northern urals had its own one day strike on february 6 protesters held signs reading where is our money the arctic city was said by tass news agency to be on the brink of social upheaval with local government and construction workers joining in the protest in rostov on don in southern russia 76 000 miners had been on strike indefinitely since february 1 demanding back wages and a meeting with high level officials approximately 250 000 teachers joined the strike as well first deputy prime minister anatoly chubais said he would fly to the region to meet with them however the government at that point had only agreed to pay back wages for november and december about half the total due we have nothing to do we have nothing to live on a miner from the closed down gryzlovskaya mine in the region of tula told a russian television crew an economist in the presidential analytical center mikhail g delyagin told the press the consequences of the strike could be very grave because we are in the middle of winter and coal is vital to our energy plans coal provided heat to nearly 60 percent of homes in russia not to mention its key role in industry in neighboring kazakhstan coal miners on strike for three weeks over unpaid wages began returning to work february 6 after the republic s largest steel works paid most of its debt for coking coal president nursultan nazarbayev refused any other pay concessions to the 100 000 strikers claiming the coal industry owed the government money for past subsidies yugoslavia makes trade agreement with common market countries on february 6 1970 the government of yugoslavia signed a three year trade agreement with the european economic community also referred to as the common market the deal was an early step in the drive to restore capitalism in eastern europe the agreement imposed price fixes on goods imported from yugoslavia and in return the common market countries agreed not to impose any additional import taxes on yugoslavian products beef was the import of particular importance with large amounts being exported from yugoslavia to italy and germany yugoslavia emerged from the second world war with a government formed on the stalinist model but with an independent national basis since the yugoslav communist party of president josip tito had led a successful military struggle against the nazi occupation and the fascist led forces like the croatian based ustasha tito refused to join the moscow dominated warsaw pact military alliance in 1961 tito was a founding member of the non aligned movement which brought together a number of countries that were not formally aligned with either nato or the warsaw pact but rather utilized the cold war conflict to maintain a position outside of the two blocs including egypt india and many newly independent african countries yugoslavia s membership in the organization provided the political basis to maneuver between stalinism and imperialism as the need arose the trade deal with the eec forerunner of the european union was a further development in this process as tito shifted towards economic dependence on the west the 1970 trade agreement not only began a period of increased and regular trading with capitalist countries but also began a period of reckless borrowing from the united states and the international monetary fund yugoslavian debt jumped from 3 1 billion in 1971 to over 20 billion in 1982 in order to meet the demands of capital the yugoslav centralized economy and nationalized property relations were gradually dismantled during the same period 1971 to 1982 unemployment dramatically increased from 6 7 percent to 14 4 percent the pressure put on the yugoslav economy by a sudden influx of foreign capital made the middle road program impossible after tito s death in 1980 yugoslavian leaders found themselves forced into austerity programs that demanded massive cuts in social spending ended nationalized property and planned the restoration of capitalism it was this scramble for the resources made available by the collapse of the yugoslav economy which set the stage for nato s wars in the region and the bombings of serbia in the 1990s 75 years ago at yalta conference churchill roosevelt and stalin discuss post war carve up churchill roosevelt and stalin at yalta on february 4 1945 us president franklin d roosevelt british prime minister winston churchill and soviet dictator joseph stalin gathered in the crimean resort city of yalta to begin negotiations on the carve up of europe and the world in the aftermath of the anticipated allied victory in the second world war the yalta conference was one of a series of such gatherings that included the tehran conference in 1943 and that would be followed by the potsdam conference in august 1945 the meeting was held amid an acute crisis of the fascist regimes the german third reich had suffered crippling military defeats in eastern southern and western europe the allies having invaded and overrun france the previous year were preparing for a full scale invasion of germany in asia the imperial japanese regime was increasingly isolated suffering blows at the hands of the chinese masses in east asia and losing a series of conflicts with the us army over control of the philippines in this context the series of meetings between the british us and soviet leaderships were aimed at hammering out an agreement for the establishment of spheres of influence in the post war period the tensions between the rival imperialist powers nominally united as military allies were on display even before the conference proceedings began general charles de gaulle who headed the new french government was excluded from the event he attributed it to enmity towards him on the part of roosevelt american imperialism emerging as the dominant world power was hostile to the ambitions of france to regain control of its colonial possessions throughout africa and asia under the banner of ensuring freedom and democracy the roosevelt administration aimed to supplant the old colonial powers as the dominant force in oppressed regions throughout the world during the discussions stalin reiterated a guarantee he had given to churchill at a moscow meeting in october 1944 that the soviet regime had no designs on western europe in practice this meant that the stalinist bureaucracy would prevent the insurgent anti fascist movements throughout the continent from developing in the direction of a revolutionary struggle for the overthrow of capitalism the logic of this position had been made clear in greece where the soviet bureaucracy had tacitly backed brutal british attacks on anti fascist partisans throughout december 1944 explicitly aimed at establishing a stable capitalist regime in exchange for its service to capitalism the stalinist bureaucracy hoped to win agreement for the establishment of a buffer zone under its control in eastern europe to that end stalin pushed for an agreement at the conference for soviet control of poland at the end of the war this was agreed on the proviso that free elections would be held underscoring his subservience to world imperialism stalin agreed that the soviet union would enter the united nations to be established at the end of the war and lobbied for each of the constituent republics of the ussr to be recognized as individual members 100 years ago new zealand sends troops to fiji to quell strike on february 5 1920 the reform party government of william massey in new zealand sent a contingent of 55 soldiers the fiji expeditionary force under the command of major edward puttick to fiji to help the british colonial government suppress a strike of public employees australian forces were also mobilized to crush the strike fiji s first mass strike began on january 15 1920 after the system of indenture girmit which had imported tens of thousands of indian laborers to fiji since 1879 was abolished on january 1 authorities had told public works workers who largely came from families that had been brought to fiji from india that they would have their work week increased to 48 hours workers rejected this and demanded wage increases because inflation since 1914 had raised prices by 100 percent the government refused to negotiate and the strike spread throughout southeastern viti levu the largest island of fiji and home to the capital of suva the government organized bands of thugs to supplement the police and called on the assistance of the australian and new zealand military one striker was killed by the government and the strike was quelled the struggle however was a prelude to the strikes that erupted among impoverished cane famers and agricultural laborers in the western part of the island the next year against the australian colonial sugar refining company new zealand for its part had participated with the other allied imperialist powers in the first world war over 100 000 men were mobilized out of a population of a million with a stunning 58 percent casualty rate the war had whetted the regional ambitions of the new zealand bourgeoisie particularly after the capture of german samoa in 1914 which it governed as the western samoa trust territory until 1962

follow ambazaarmag in case of another bernanke moment india might be staring at an unprecedented crisis of sorts the indian economy which has been witness to a deficient demand has been forced to go through a fiscal exercise by indian finance minister nirmala sitharaman which would make things even worse with the unemployment rate on the rise and the demand not forthcoming from the consumption or investment side nor the external markets one fails to understand why the mandarins in the ministry responded without taking cognizance of the situation what economist r nagaraj has characterized as india s dream run of the 2003 08 period has become a memory with the economy hamstrung back at the levels of growth which were once characterized by raj krishna as the hindu rate of growth the investment ratios of the economy have been on the downside for years together now the revised estimates of nominal gdp growth in the ongoing year at 7 5 percent belies the expectations of 12 5 percent projected in the budget estimates and this has resulted in the loss of tax revenue to the extent of over three trillion rupees despite all efforts at enticing the corporates to spend by the generous tax concessions not working the government seems to be at it again by further extending tax rebates to the salaried classes hoping that the consumption would pick up strange that those counting on consumption growth have kept the allocation under mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mgnrega aiming to guarantee the right to work stagnant the government itself foresees the economy growing at a nominal rate of 10 percent 6 percent real and 4 percent inflation god alone knows whether it would be the other way round notwithstanding the volatility of the international financial markets the government seems to be trying to stay put with fiscal dharma by even resorting to the disinvestment of the state owned life insurance corporation of india lic only hoping that the flows to the emerging market universe would continue and international finance capital would favor india as an important destination even when the whole world from the usa to china has been quoting keynes as a way out of the downturn the indian policymakers seem to be lying prostrate before the temples of doctrinaire redundant classical postulates of economics stagnant real growth in the economy apart the new highs scaled by the bse sensex crossing 40 000 in the very same year seem to be the only reason pushing them in this direction so much for the financialization of the indian economy the government seems to be hoping against hope that a bubble led growth might work forgetful of the fact that 2020 might be witness to the reversal of the monetary policy by the united states with the recent signs of recovery over there post global financial crisis though the high end indian corporates and financial institutions have been able to mobilize funds through the issuance of dollar bonds that too at far favorable interest rates most of them have used the same towards repayment of debts incurred before while corporates are continuing on the deleveraging phase clearly reflected the sagging investment ratios taking a leaf out of the various studies on fiscal multipliers the government should have gone for scaling up capital expenditure and started a brand new story there have been no new plans towards recapitalization of the banks through this budget though the limit to deposit insurance has been raised from 100 000 to 500 000 rupees no fine print of addressing the crisis amidst the nbfcs outlined in the economic survey has been charted the only sustainable solution of reassuring the health of the financial system would be to pump prime the economy by enhancing expenditure which unfortunately the government fails to do only then would demand recover and the npas in the system decline despite ppp having failed in the infrastructure sector the same has been extended to the health and social sectors too though the reward of the fiscal transfer suggested by the 15th finance commission has been accepted not so much its suggestions on grants in case the current flows to the emerging economies again are subjected to a 2013 bernanke moment of sorts with interest rates firming up in the global economy and if the prices of oil and other commodities firm up india might be staring at an unprecedented crisis of sorts it would be too late then read more india s 300 billion budget targeted at invigorating rural economy farmers income february 29 2016 india budget 2015 much awaited test of narendra modi led government s conscience february 28 2015 india s railway budget aspires to make modern out of archaic february 26 2015

with the world s second largest economy locked down by coronavirus our city editor alex brummer asks will china crisis tip us into recession as if the public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak is not scary enough the economic fallout from the disease could be just as contagious and dangerous the close down of commerce in large parts of china threatens not just the output of the second largest economy on the planet but the whole world the interwoven nature of global trade means that the business and economic consequences of the disease could move rapidly from the asia pacific region infecting the u s and an already stagnating european economy new forecasts from oxford economics suggest a severe impact from coronavirus the uk based forecaster says that with many regions and cities locked down until at least february 9 there will doubtless be disruption a woman is pictured above in london wearing a face mask the danger for britain is that the economic mayhem unleashed by the coronavirus outbreak could wipe out the boris bounce since the december 12 general election business and manufacturing confidence has risen the housing market across the nation has staged a remarkable recovery and public finances have improved the government looked set to open its thorny trade talks with the eu on an optimistic note but brexit could now look like a picnic compared to the economic danger blowing in fast from the east much of what britain consumes from laptops to kettles from suitcases to fashion is made in china and shipped to the uk last year the uk s trade with beijing hit 44 7 billion of which 22 6 billion was exports to the land of the dragon but as china locks down in the face of this unprecedented virus the list of british firms hit grows longer by the day the interwoven nature of global trade means that the business and economic consequences of the disease could move rapidly from the asia pacific region infecting the u s and an already stagnating european economy empty vegetable stalls are pictured in wuhan china the suspension of british airways flights to china s major cities saw the shares of the group s owner iag plummet 4 7 per cent last week british luxury goods company burberry already adversely affected by the unrest in hong kong is among the growing list of companies shutting up shop not just in wuhan but across the entire country some of the biggest international brands including starbucks mcdonald s and the swedish fashion firm h m are also drawing in their horns starbucks for example has closed 2 000 restaurants across china mcdonald s has closed all its restaurants in hubei province where the outbreak started h m has closed nearly 100 shops in china ikea the swedish furniture maker has closed all of its stores there the electric car maker tesla has shut its factory in the country while the virus has caused general motors honda and nissan to suspend production google s parent company alphabet meanwhile is shutting all its offices in china hong kong and taiwan and has restricted its employees from flying to mainland china and hong kong the threat to the world s economy is now so grave that if the coronavirus emergency shows no sign of subsiding in the next week or so global economic policy makers may have to consider special measures in the hope of keeping global recession and soaring unemployment levels at bay the staggering scale of the danger to global business was reflected on wall street on friday as britain marked the departure from europe with parties and gongs the dow jones industrial average the key measure of investor confidence plummeted a startling 600 points chaos can be expected when markets open today one way we have of assessing the potential impact of the coronavirus on the global economy is to look back to 2003 and the sars epidemic which also emerged from china at the time that knocked two full percentage points off china s economic growth back then china accounted for 4 3 per cent of global output today in spite of the current trade war with the u s which has put a dampener on chinese and world growth it accounts for a whopping 16 9 per cent of output in other words if the spread of the coronavirus does not peak soon the impact on global expansion could be four times worse than it was with the sars epidemic when the international monetary fund revised its economic forecast for the world at davos economic forum in switzerland last month it lowered its estimates for prospective world growth for 2020 to 3 3 per cent that number is starting to look decidedly upbeat chinese expansion currently estimated at 6 per cent could tumble new forecasts from oxford economics suggest a severe impact from coronavirus the uk based forecaster says that with many regions and cities locked down until at least february 9 there will doubtless be disruption given that the affected areas account for 50 per cent of all of china s enormous output the forecaster fears that growth could fall to 4 per cent in the first quarter an even more gloomy forecast is made by the city based firm cebr which specialises in long term economic trends based on the evidence from the sars outbreak it reckons a prolonged shutdown caused by the coronavirus could cause global output to shrink by between 1 8 per cent and 6 per cent if that were to happen the world would be plunged into the doldrums if not a full recession it would be the first such global downturn since 2008 09 when the full impact of the financial crisis was felt across the western democracies the dark cloud hovering over china comes at a particularly awkward moment for the uk government last week the national security council defied the u s and awarded the chinese telecoms equipment maker huawei up to 35 per cent of the work in building the uk s ultra fast 5g mobile network infrastructure britain is also looking to a chinese firm to rescue the ailing british steel works at scunthorpe in the face of opposition from france already china is a big investor in the uk s new nuclear reactor at hinkley point in somerset as well as in thames water members of a military medical team are pictured heading for a hospital in wuhan two weeks ago the staggering scale of the danger to global business was reflected on wall street on friday if nothing else the mishandling of sensitive data relating to the coronavirus experts at imperial college london suggest the true number infected could be dramatically higher than the official one demonstrates some of the political risks in giving the autocracy in beijing such a dominant role in the british strategic industries the threat to the world s economy is now so grave that if the coronavirus emergency shows no sign of subsiding in the next week or so global economic policy makers may have to consider special measures in the hope of keeping global recession and soaring unemployment levels at bay taking early action will be seen as particularly important for the white house as the presidential election season kicks off in the iowa caucuses in the u s the simplest way of supporting a slowing global economy is to cut interest rates and both the u s and the uk have room to cut rates in an impending crisis last week the bank of england chose to hold the bank rate at 0 75 per cent that decision may now have to be reversed which could be embarrassing for governor mark carney in his last full month in office in the u s president trump could be expected to renew his war of words with america s central bank the federal reserve which has resisted further interest cuts closer to home the european central bank has virtually no scope to lower interest rates already at rock bottom and might have to print more euros to head off recession the disease outbreak could also make choices harder for chancellor sajid javid he will have to weigh the risk of big spending on investment in infrastructure against a worsening budget deficit should a global slowdown loom one simple way of holding off recession would be tax cuts in addition to those in the manifesto to stimulate spending and growth but the truth is there are no easy answers when china the country that has become a key factor in our own and the world s economy is in lockdown the source of disease in wuhan may be on the other side of the planet but in today s interconnected world it has the power to damage the prosperity and wellbeing of countries businesses and peoples across the globe

interest rate cuts and other bold actions by the federal reserve and other central banks around the world a report on monday said u s manufacturing returned to growth in january for the first time in six months but many investors paid little attention because it doesn t fully reflect all the virus concerns think about what global central bankers are thinking about now said emily roland co chief investment strategist at john hancock investment management she imagined them saying are you kidding me we pumped so much liquidity into the economy last year and now the yield curve is inverting again the yield curve is a tool used by investors that sits in the dusty corners of the bond market markets don t pay it much attention until it becomes inverted a relatively rare occurrence that happens when short term treasurys offer higher yields than longer term treasurys an albeit imperfect rule of thumb says a recession may be a year or so away when the three month treasury s yield is higher than a 10 year treasury s on tuesday the three month yield was at 1 55 above the 1 54 yield of the 10 year which itself rose from 1 51 late friday sentiment builds on sentiment and there s so

consumer credit has outpaced incomes since the great recession getty the economy is not working for average americans the economy and jobs have grown for about a decade yet drug overdoses from fentanyl cocaine and methamphetamine are still going up as are suicides many are anxious about their economic security massive amounts of consumer credit credit cards student loans and car loans in part reflect that economic stress families need more access to stable jobs that offer good pay and strong benefits but those jobs are still hard to find driving families deeper into debt rather than helping president trump has broken his promise to stand up for average americans when facing a choice he has regularly chosen the rich and powerful over the economic security of middle class americans the continued expansion of consumer credit in a growing economy is a clear indication that things aren t going well families often take on more debt because their incomes are not keeping pace with higher costs for education and health care they also borrow consumer credit to help them pay their bills when they face short term drops in incomes for example because of a layoff a cut back in hours at work or unexpected time away from work to care for children parents and spouses costs and risks have gone up while incomes have only grown slowly consumer debt has become the go to pressure valve for squeezed middle class families consumer credit has grown faster than after tax incomes since the great recession it grew from an average of 14 9 of after tax income in june 2009 when the great recession ended to 18 5 in september 2019 see figure below families would have had 653 billion less in debt in september 2019 if consumer credit had just grown at the same rate as income since the end of the great recession that consumer debt has outpaced incomes in an expanding economy is not a sign of middle class wellbeing consumer credit grew faster than after tax incomes even as incomes went up and taxes went down calculations based on federal reserve financial accounts of the united states more consumer debt puts families in a precarious financial situation it tends to carry higher interest rates than mortgages for instance and it can put families finances at risk because repayment entirely rests on people having a stable and well paying job which is still often hard to come by these days many borrowers are at risk of having to make difficult choices between paying their debt and paying their bills the rapid growth of consumer debt has financially hollowed out america s middle class the average amount of consumer debt has grown to record highs for all income groups since the great recession except for those in the bottom fifth see figure below that debt growth has been especially strong among families in the middle 60 of the income distribution see figure below for example the average amount of debt for families between the 20th and 40th percentile of the income distribution increased by 47 1 from 14 180 in 2019 dollars in june 2009 to 20 860 in september 2019 debt also grew by 23 for those in the middle of the income distribution and by 58 9 among families between the 60th and 80th percentile sharply larger debt burdens are a widely shared phenomenon among america s middle class families consumer debt has grown to record high for middle class families calculations based on federal reserve distributional financial accounts and survey of consumer finances it doesn t have to be this way a growing economy doesn t have to go along with widespread financial insecurity a number of things could help to give families real economic security this would include not only having a job but having well paying stable jobs with good benefits it would also include affordable and adequate health insurance among other things to keep costs down it would include protecting key social programs such as social security and it would include making it easier for families to afford sending their children to college families wouldn t need to borrow as much if they weren t so tightly squeezed from slow or no income growth and high costs but on all of these measures president trump has either moved in the wrong direction or failed to act he promised to stand up for average americans worried about their future and that of their children yet he has undermined wage growth by for instance rescinding expanded overtime protections he has also given more power to already powerful corporations by allowing more mega mergers across many industries he has failed to invest in infrastructure despite pledging to do so which would have created good jobs in key industries worse his ad hoc trade disputes have wreaked havoc on manufacturing and agriculture increasing financial insecurity in those sectors farm bankruptcies for instance rose sharply in 2019 and states that heavily rely on manufacturing saw jobs go down in 2019 he has enacted a series of policies to undermine health care leaving millions without health insurance and he has either already cut or proposed to cut social security medicare and medicaid benefits worsening the financial threats to struggling families finally he has failed to take action on the growing student loan crisis president trump and his administration kicked middle class families when they were down it is clear that this economy is not working for a lot of families continued economic growth and job creation are not enough to rebuild a thriving middle class they need more help from president trump and his administration to gain real financial security but rather than actually helping them president trump made it harder for families to get ahead
