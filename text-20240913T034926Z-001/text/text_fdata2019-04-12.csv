euro jumps broadly in asian session today partly by extended rebound in eur aud eur cad and more importantly eur chf the common currency has clearly left behind the mild dovishness of ecb earlier this week eur jpy also resumed recent rise thanks to broad based weakness in yen stocks markets are mixed but resilience in treasury yields is pressuring the japanese currency us 10 year yield close above 2 5 handle overnight and there is prospect of german 10 year yield turning positive again before weekly close dollar is softer after comments from fed officials reaffirmed the patience stance a key message was from bullard that normalization of monetary policy has completed successfully it s seen as the consensus position among fed policymakers this reaffirmed that fed s default position has changed that is before the last hike in december when there was nothing wrong with data fed continued rate hikes now if there is nothing wrong with data upside or downside don t move kashkari also reminded the markets that fed has a symmetric target and inflation could be allowed to run above 2 in other markets nikkei is current up 0 44 hong kong hsi is down 0 36 china shanghai sse is down 0 44 singapore strait times is down 0 16 japan 10 year jgb yield is up 0 002 at 0 057 overnight dow dropped 0 05 s p 500 rose 0 00 nasdaq dropped 0 21 10 year yield rose 0 027 to 2 504 fed bullard upcoming policy adjustments no longer part of normalization campaign st louis fed president james bullard said if economy evolves as expected current interest rate will be appropriate through 2019 balance sheet reduction program will end this autumn these events mark the end of monetary policy normalization in the u s bullard said the normalization campaign has been largely successful nominal short term interest rates have been raised from near zero levels and the size of the fed s balance sheet has been reduced as the economic expansion has continued going forward the fomc may elect to adjust monetary policy going forward however bullard said that will not be part of an ongoing normalization strategy adjustments will be in response to incoming macroeconomic data on yield curve inversion bullard said yield curve information is not infallible and inversion could be driven by other factors unrelated to future macroeconomic performance nevertheless the empirical evidence is relatively strong therefore both policymakers and market professionals need to take the possibility of a meaningful and sustained yield curve inversion seriously fed kashkari we should really live the symmetric inflation target minneapolis fed president neel kashkari noted that fed officially have a symmetric target on inflation actual inflation has averaged around 1 7 for the past seven years which was below the 2 target therefore if we were at 2 3 for several years that shouldn t be concerning he also emphasized that we should really live the symmetric target and not tap the brakes prematurely thus this is why i ve been arguing for more accommodative monetary policy kashkari also said he s concerned with yield curve inversion however he added i don t necessarily believe it causes recessions but i believe it s giving feedback that monetary policy is close to neutral today we don t want contractionary monetary policy unless we have good reason we should be careful not to end the expansion uk pm may urged mps to use easter recess for brexit reflections in the parliament prime minister theresa may insisted that uk can still pass the brexit withdrawal agreement by may 22 to avoid taking part in european parliament elections and it can still leave eu by the end of next month may also emphasized the important of cross party negotiations with labours and she hoped to reach an agreement in the coming days may urged mps to use the opportunity of the recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after easter and let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse boe governor mark carney said with the flexible article 50 extension till october 31 there was now a window of time to forge consensus and we will see how that time is used right up until yesterday it could be argued that the uk had run out of time to forge that consensus there are cross party talks to try to find that and that may take some time he added boj kuroda global economy will recover in second half of the year boj governor haruhiko kuroda said that global economy would recover in the second half as he arrived for the g20 finance ministers meeting in washington yesterday he said our baseline scenario is that the global economy will recover in the latter half of this year and achieve sufficiently high growth next year also he defended rule based multilateral trade system kuroda warned that protectionism benefits neither the united states nor china he urged both countries as well as each g20 economy must make efforts to solve problems based on the understanding that free trade under world trade organization rules has brought enormous benefits to the global economy japan us trade talks to start next week for exchanging views japan economy minister toshimitsu motegi announced today that the first round of japan us trade talks will start next week on april 15 16 in washington he said he d intend to exchange view frankly with us trade representative robert lighthizer it s believed that a core topic is japan s near usd 70b trade surplus with nearly two thirds from auto exports finance minister taro aso reiterated japan s intention to further expand trade and investment between between the two countries in a mutually beneficial manner he also pointed to the joint statement made last september however japan has been very clear on its intention to defend the multilateral trade pact tpp that it leads and us quitted under trump hence no matter what japan is going to offer to the us they won t be something better than what s offered to tpp partners imf gopinath auto tariffs could be more damaging to us china trade war imf chief economist gita gopinath warned that auto tariffs could be more damaging to the world economy than us china trade war she said on the sidelines of imf and world bank annual meeting we are concerned about what auto tariffs would do to the global economy at a time when we are more in the recovery phase trade conflicts of the us and others including china eu canada and japan could spill over into the auto sector and that could have severe damage to the global manufacturing supply chains she warned that would actually be far more costly for the world economy than just the u s china trade tensions that we had in the us the commerce department has already submitted section 232 national security report on auto imports earlier this year trump will have until may 17 to decide whether he wants to extend punitive tariffs from steal to auto and from rival in china to allies in eu

for us companies trading conditions for the international sales division will be determined by economic demand conditions relative us dollar exchange rates and the overall business environment determined in part by the regulatory environment the strength of overseas demand will be an important factor for companies which are looking to sell in international markets the dollar s level is a key element in determining costs and profit margins for both importers and exporters the strength of the dollar will also be crucial in determining competitiveness and the ability to compete in global markets especially in the manufacturing sector if the us currency is notably weak in global markets exporters will be in a stronger positon to gain market share a strong dollar would lead to tough conditions for exporters but importers will gain a significant cost advantage the value of the us dollar will be determined by both us and international factors it is important to remember that the value of global currency pairs is determined by changes in relative fundamentals rather than just absolute trends even if the us economy is performing relatively well the dollar will tend to lose ground if global economies are performing even better the release schedule for major indicators can be seen on the economic calendar us employment data the monthly us employment data is the most important data release for the us and global markets there is data on the change in employment outside the farm sector together with the unemployment rate and change in average earnings this release is considered the most important barometer of underlying strength in the economy strong data maintains confidence in the us growth outlook and will also tend to increase expectations that the federal reserve will move to raise interest rates which tends to strengthen the dollar federal reserve policy the federal reserve controls the level of short term interest rates in the economy although it is important to note that there is no direct control of longer term interest rates even though policy changes will impact rates across the yield curve if the federal reserve raises interest rates there will tend to be upward pressure on the dollar while a cut in rates tends to weaken the us currency the federal reserve policy decisions are a crucial element in determining underlying dollar direction us consumer prices cpi inflation trends within the us are very important in setting monetary policy direction with the federal reserve along with other central banks having a mandate to target inflation in the fed s case it targets a rate of around 2 if inflation moves above this level there is pressure for the fed to tighten policy in order to reduce inflationary pressure and this tends to strengthen the currency low inflation will increase pressure for a cut in interest rates which tends to weaken the dollar us gdp the us gdp data is a benchmark indicator of growth trends in the economy even though there are important doubts surrounding accuracy of the data especially given that there are substantial revisions in this context headline data can paint a misleading picture us elections much of the market attention is often focussed on economic data releases although political developments also play a very important role the domestic and international framework in areas such as trade policy can have a crucial role in the ability to trade successfully overseas there are also important implications from changes in taxation policy and any imposition of tariffs or import duties the outcomes of us presidential and congressional elections are therefore important in setting the overall framework for us trade policy given the importance of mexican and canadian markets for us companies us policy towards nafta is a key focus canada interest rate decision given the importance of bilateral trade between the us and canada the usd cad exchange rate is also vital for us businesses in this context the bank of canada rate decisions have an important impact on the canadian dollar s value ecb rate decision looking at the global economy the most important institution is the european central bank ecb the ecb sets interest rates for the euro zone and is a key determinant of the euro s value in global currency markets if the ecb raises interest rates the euro will tend to strengthen which will have a beneficial impact on us companies looking to export to the euro zone area if on the other hand the ecb cuts interest rates and runs a very loose monetary policy the euro is liable to weaken which will make it more difficult for us exporters to compete in similar fashion the monetary policy decisions of the bank of england and bank of japan will have important implications for the value of sterling and the japanese yen china trade china s economy has a very important impact on the global economy and developments within china will also have a key impact on the wider outlook for asia conditions within china will have an increasingly important impact on us businesses which engage in overseas trade chinese gdp data does command market attention although there are important doubts surrounding its reliability in this context the trade data is a more important indicator of underlying trends in the chinese economy strength in exports and imports are an important indicator of robust growth in both the chinese and global economy baltic dry bulk index this is not a headline indicator by any means but is watched closely by professionals the index measures the global cost of chartering ships to transport dry bulk cargoes when there is strong demand in the global economy with robust trade growth there will be strong demand for shipping which tends to put upward pressure on prices cargo refers to the transportation of goods dry bulk cargo is transported unpacked and in huge quantities such as sugar cocoa grains and coal when global growth is weak demand for shipping will be weak which will tend to put downward pressure on prices the data provides important insights into the strength of global demand further details on the baltic dry bulk index big mac index the big mac index produced by the economist measures the cost in local currency and dollar terms of a standard mcdonalds hamburger given the universal nature of the product the cost gives a useful indicator of relative exchange rates and purchasing power parity this gives important evidence on whether a currency is substantially undervalued or overvalued compared to the dollar as well as the actual degree of undervaluation or overvaluation changes in the positon give important intelligence surrounding competitiveness from a us company s point of view there will be value in targeting exports to countries where the exchange rate is overvalued while looking to source imports from countries where the currency is undervalued further details on the big mac index forecast on the us dollar for the rest of 2019 out of all the things i listed here in this article one thing will have more impact on the dollar in 2019 that is the usa china trade it is the single component that will have significant impact on the state of usa economy the stock market and the dollar treasury secretary mnuchin has mentioned that deal is underway another significant issue for the dollar in 2018 was the regime s stability whenever it was speculated that trump will be impeached the dollar sunk in 2019 the muller reported will be released in the coming days and it is already known it is going to have a positive impact on trump s standing yahoo named the initial results a victory lap for trump hence it seems like the usa market will rally throughout the year and the usa dollar will only strengthen

overview the consolidative week in the capital markets is drawing to a close equity markets are narrowly mixed in asia most indices outside of the greater china china taiwan and hong kong edged higher leaving the msci asia pacific index slightly lower on the week the msci emerging markets index snapped a ten day rally yesterday and is little changed so far today europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is off about 0 25 in late morning turnover and about a 0 5 loss for the week the s p 500 is nursing a margin loss this week coming into today s session it has moved higher in 10 of the last 11 sessions but is continuing to knock on 2900 bank earnings are in focus today bond yields in asia were mostly higher and china s 10 year yield rose a couple of basis points to nose above 3 30 a new high for the year european yields are a little softer while the us 10 year is hovering just below 2 50 the dollar is mostly lower with the japanese yen the notable exception on the week the dollar has risen against only the yen and swiss franc asia pacific china reported its lending and trade data for march the lending data is flattered by the expected rebounded after the lunar new year distortions in february but also the shift in policy from de leveraging to stimulating the economy aggregate lending jumped cny2 86 trillion the median estimate in the bloomberg survey was for an increase of cny1 85 trillion after a cny703 bln increase in february the aggregate lending includes the state banking system and shadow banking state dominated bank lending is seen in the new yuan loans they rose cny1 69 trillion well above the forecast for cny1 25 trillion after a roughly cny886 bln increase in february the difference between the aggregate lending and the new yuan loans is a proxy for the shadow banking its lending jumped to cny1 17 trillion from contracting in february china s trade surplus surged to 32 65 bln in march it averaged nearly 33 7 bln last year month to month swings can be notoriously volatile after the lunar new year the q1 trade surplus stood at 76 5 bln compared with nearly 45 bln in q1 18 exports jumped 14 2 from a year ago after a 20 8 drop in february imports continued to fall the 7 6 year over year pace in march follows a 5 2 contraction in february in australia the economy has conflicting impulses the labor market remains strong but housing s weak the central bank is neutral but the market continues to anticipate that a rate cut late this year news today that the largest lender in australia is considering cutting 10k jobs and closing as many as 300 branches may be the shock to the labor market that pushes the rba out of its neutral stance it appears that the ois curve is discounting about an 80 chance of a cut this year compared with a little more than a 15 chance at the start of the year the dollar is building on yesterday s gains against the yen and is testing the jpy112 00 area in the european morning there is an option there for 1 1 bln that expires today the year s high was set a month ago near jpy112 15 this is the third consecutive week that the dollar has risen against the yen we remain bullish the dollar against the yen and target jpy114 00 in the coming weeks it is the third consecutive week that the australian dollar has gained against the greenback it was turned back from the 0 7170 area in the last two sessions but found new bids near 0 7120 it is currently straddling the 0 7150 level where an a 600 mln option expires today the chinese yuan appreciated by 0 14 against the dollar in the mainland session earlier today it does not sound likely much but it is the biggest move of the week for six weeks now it has been alternating between small gains and declines and net net is fractionally changed over this period europe the euro has jumped up in early asia and follow through gains in europe have pushed it above 1 13 for the first time since march 26 some reports linked the euro demand in asia to a japanese bank s purchase of the aviation finance arm of a german bank it apparently helped trigger a short squeeze of the euro where as we have noted speculators have their largest net and gross short position in the futures market since late 2016 sentiment in europe judging from the pmis is weaker than the hard data february industrial output in the eurozone fell 0 2 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 0 5 decline the january series was revised to show a 1 9 increase rather than 1 4 from a year ago it is 0 3 lower this is the smallest year over year decline since last october the flash april pmi will be reported toward the end of next week in march the french manufacturing and services were both below the 50 boom bust level as was german manufacturing even though we suspect the worst is past for the eurozone on this soft patch many headwinds still threaten a robust recovery the ecb is committed to a new long term loan facility there is a debate over the terms of the new loans some suggest that it ought to be conducted closer to the deposit rate minus 40 bp rather than the repo rate zero the other element that is being debated is whether some measures need to be taken to help mitigate the impact of negative rates for longer this usually takes the form of tiering often seen as exempting some deposits at the central bank from the negative rate or subjecting some deposits to a less negative rate we conceive of it within the context of a segmented market banks in the periphery are the largest users of the tltro facility banks in the north have the surplus of reserves and hence more exposed to the negative yields it seemed that uk prime minister may s overture to labour had stalled however now may appears to be renewing her willingness to consider a customs union type of arrangement she will alienate her own party where some have already tried to dump her but this seems like a path forward this is where to look though for a deal over the next month which would allow the uk to avoid participating in the late may eu parliament election the euro has firmed to test a retracement objective 38 2 of the decline since the march fomc meeting that is found near 1 1315 above there the next target is closer to 1 1350 the euro bears may make another stand and if they can push it back below 1 13 on a closing basis they may feel more confident next week there is a 1 1 bln euro option struck at 1 13 that expires today we anticipated this upside correction in the euro and recognize that there could be follow through early next week but our longer term bearish outlook remains intact sterling is flat it remains within the range seen tuesday against the dollar 1 3030 1 3120 america the economic calendar is light the us reports import export prices and the university of michigan s consumer confidence to the extent that there is a focus it is on the bank earnings that will be reported today and the uber ipo announcement the us 10 year yield has moved back above 2 50 and is at its highest level in three days it is up about three basis points this week the two year yield is up a little more but remains below the effective average fed funds rates 2 41 meanwhile the price of wti is set to post its sixth consecutive week of advances the may contract is up 2 this week and continues to knock on the 65 level our technical target since the end of january is near 67 similarly the s p 500 is pushing at 2900 it has fallen only once since march 27 however coming into today s session it is slightly lower on the week last week after the employment data it closed at almost 2893 the us dollar chopped between cad1 33 and cad1 34 this week it is trading with a weaker bias today but there is a large 1 3 bln option at cad1 33 that expires today the two year rate differential edged a few basis points in the us favor this week the greenback is about 0 4 lower against the canadian dollar this week cad1 3330 but has lost 1 5 against the mexican peso the attractive yield and risk on sentiment have buoyed the peso which is trading near the best levels of the year the dollar has risen against the peso in only one session this week and one session last week which illustrates the persistence of the peso buying a break of mxn18 70 would target mxn18 50

washington dc thousands of delegates and officials have arrived in washington dc for the spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and world bank which is taking place from 8 to 14 april the spring meetings of the boards of governors of the world bank group and the imf bring together central bankers ministers of finance and development private sector executives representatives from civil society organisations and academics to discuss issues of global concern including the world economic outlook weo poverty eradication economic development and aid effectiveness the sessions include the influence of macroprudential policies on household credit and spending export diversification debt vulnerabilities and development needs in low income countries managing capital flow as well as curbing corruption by improving economic governance in the middle east and central asia in addition the sessions also tackle the issue of illicit financial flows money and payments in the digital age cyber security as well as tackling the next wave of the sovereign debt crisis during the current year s meetings the imf expressed its concern regarding the decline of global economies growth calling on policymakers to adjust their policies by making changes to conditions which may occur and constrain their countries economic growth the imf managing director christine lagarde said on 2 april in washington that the global economy is experiencing a delicate moment with increasing risks to growth and an unsettled climate citing trade tensions tighter financial conditions and geopolitical uncertainty surrounding brexit and other events global growth has lost momentum she highlighted during a speech at the united states chamber of commerce only two years ago 75 of the global economy experienced an upswing so it was a synchronised growth acceleration and for this year we expect not 75 but 70 of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth exactly the opposite of what we had lagarde said she added but just to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half h2 of 2019 and into 2020 and indeed the global economy is at a delicate moment the expected rebound in global growth is precarious the expected rebound in global growth later this year and into early 2020 is precarious because it is vulnerable to downside risks including country related uncertainties such as brexit for instance and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors in some countries tensions around trade policy are still uncertain and there is a sense of unease in financial markets for example there should be a sharp unexpected tightening of financial conditions it could create serious challenges for many governments and companies around the world in terms of refinancing and debt services particularly those that have borrowed in non domestic currencies which could amplify exchange rate movements and financial market corrections indeed it is a delicate moment in itself and it requires a delicate mix of policies the weo indicated furthermore lagarde urged policymakers to prepare for slower growth by making smart decisions in trade and fiscal policies additionally gita gopinath the imf economic counsellor and director of the research department stressed that policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty does not weaken investment now i don t want to be overly dramatic because we don t see a recession but we believe that because it is so delicate as it is filled with in a way with self inflicted wounds that only men and women can address that s why it requires this handle with care approach that brings together all domestic policies across borders and international coordination gopinath related according to the weo after strong growth in 2017 and early 2018 global economic activity slowed notably in h2 of last year reflecting a confluence of factors affecting major economies china s growth declined following a combination of needed regulatory tightening to rein in shadow banking and an increase in trade tensions with the us the euro area economy lost more momentum than expected as consumer and business confidence weakened and car production in germany was disrupted by the introduction of new emission standards investment dropped in italy as sovereign spreads widened and external demand especially from emerging asia softened elsewhere natural disasters hurt activity in japan trade tensions increasingly took a toll on business confidence and so financial market sentiment worsened with financial conditions tightening for vulnerable emerging markets ems in the spring of 2018 and then in advanced economies later in the year weighing on global demand conditions have eased in 2019 as the us federal reserve fed signalled a more accommodative monetary policy stance and markets became more optimistic about a us china trade deal but they remain slightly more restrictive than in the fall as a result of these developments the weo projected that global growth would slow from 3 6 in 2018 to 3 3 in 2019 before returning to 3 6 in 2020 growth for 2018 was revised down by 0 1 relative to the october 2018 weo reflecting weakness in the h2 of the year and the forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are now marked down by 0 4 and 0 1 respectively the current forecast envisages that global growth will level off in the h1 of 2019 and firm up after that the projected pickup in the h2 of 2019 is predicated on an ongoing build up of policy stimulus in china recent improvements in global financial market sentiment the waning of some temporary drags on growth in the euro area and a gradual stabilisation of conditions in stressed em economies including argentina and turkey improved momentum for em and developing economies is projected to continue into 2020 primarily reflecting developments in economies currently experiencing macroeconomic distress a forecast subject to notable uncertainty by contrast activity in advanced economies is projected to continue to slow gradually as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group the weo read growth across ems projected to stabilise slightly below 5 growth across ems and developing economies is projected to stabilise slightly below 5 though with variations by region and country the baseline outlook for emerging asia remains favourable with china s growth projected to slow gradually toward sustainable levels and convergence in frontier economies toward higher income levels for other regions the outlook is complicated by a combination of structural bottlenecks slower advanced economy growth and in some cases high debt and tighter financial conditions these factors alongside subdued commodity prices and civil strife or conflict in some cases contribute to subdued medium term prospects for latin america the middle east north africa and the pakistan region and parts of sub saharan africa in particular convergence prospects are bleak for some 41 ems and developing economies accounting for close to 10 of the global gdp in purchasing power parity terms and with total population close to 1 billion where per capita incomes are projected to fall further behind those in advanced economies over the next five years global energy prices declined by 17 regarding commodity prices global energy prices declined by 17 between the reference periods for the october 2018 and the current weo as oil prices dropped from a four year peak of 81 a barrel in october to 61 in february meanwhile supply influences dominated initially notably a temporary waiver in us sanctions on iranian oil exports to certain countries and record high us crude oil production weakening global growth added downward pressure on prices toward the end of 2018 since the beginning of this year oil prices have recovered somewhat thanks to production cuts by oil exporting countries prices of base metals have increased by 7 6 since august as a result of supply disruption in some metal markets more than offsetting subdued global demand following the tightening of financial conditions in late 2018 market sentiment rebounded in early 2019 signs of slowing global growth moderately less buoyant corporate earnings and market concerns about the pace of the fed policy tightening weighed on sentiment at the end of 2018 egypt s inflation is expected to reach 14 5 in 2019 12 3 in 2020 consumer price inflation remained muted across advanced economies given the drop in commodity prices for most countries in this group core inflation is well below central bank targets despite the pickup in domestic demand in the past two years in the us and the united kingdom it is close to 2 although wage growth has been picking up across most advanced economies notably in the us and the uk it is still sluggish despite lower unemployment rates and diminished labour market slack the weo projected that egypt s inflation is expected to reach 14 5 in 2019 compared to 20 9 in 2018 additionally the imf forecasted that the country s inflation will continue to drop to reach 12 3 in 2020 and 6 9 in 2024 global current account deficits and surpluses are estimated to have widened marginally in 2018 compared with the previous year higher oil prices have been the main driver of this widening they are estimated to have boosted the current account balance of oil exporters by about 3 5 of their gdp furthermore the imf s projection for egypt s current account deficit this year is to reach 2 4 of the gdp however it forecasts a decrease reaching 1 7 in 2020 and 1 in 2024

policy debt will continue to grow rapidly and the risk of another economic downturn is emerging many developing countries are using trial and error to seek out sustainable economic development given the different political and economic landscapes in these countries no single model can secure successful sustainable growth as a result many developing countries are exploring and experimenting with different policies in line with their own domestic frameworks zhu xian meanwhile many have not been able to shake off periodic volatility of the us dollar since april 2018 as the dollar index has risen beyond all expectations countries including argentina turkey and brazil have experienced financial turmoil and asset prices have sharply adjusted echoes of the financial crisis a decade on from the 2007 08 financial crisis the smoking gun is now believed to have been an imbalance in the global financial system excessive debt leverage too big to fail financial institutions and shadow banking were to blame however over the past decade there has been no fundamental change to mitigate recurrence of these issues according to the institute of international finance global debt climbed to a new peak of us 247 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 equivalent to 318 of global gdp the top five us banks now control 47 of us bank assets compared with 44 in 2014 with the largest 1 of mutual funds managing 45 of assets the value of the shadow banking industry meanwhile has grown to 45 trillion 28 trillion in 2010 controlling 13 of the world s financial assets regulatory pressure on banks appears to have only created more room to grow for the shadow banks governance reform the us has transformed from being a leader and defender of multilateralism and free trade to a cheerleader for the bilateral principle of america first in trade and investment president donald trump s waving of a protectionist stick has brought increasing uncertainty to economic globalisation technology is pushing back against this new trend the development of intelligent manufacturing the digital economy and the widespread use of renewable energy has led to profound change in global value chains the traditional impetus for globalisation has been diminishing it is now urgent we find new stimuli in a keynote speech at the asia pacific economic cooperation leaders meeting in november 2018 president xi jinping indicated we should improve global governance the existing international multilateral financial system established after world war ii is rules oriented and far from perfect progression remains the priority of developing economies and the solution to social and economic problems including poverty and uneven income distribution developed countries focus more on macro policy and public governance advanced economies generally have a greater influence over the international multilateral financial system and yet it is the developing countries that need their say the most for reform to be successful it must be endorsed by all there is a strong case for reform of the international system including the world bank and the international monetary fund but the direction of such reform is uncertain emerging markets and developing countries have underlined the shortcomings of these multilateral institutions for many years and have demanded more decision making power the demands in emerging markets and countries at various stages of development are not aligned with each other let alone with advanced economies some developing economies are good at destroying an established order but not yet proficient in building a new one in the future multilateral financial institutions will have an important role to play in helping member countries carry out countercyclical regulation temper expectations and boost market confidence through infrastructure investment and other methods in 2015 and 2016 the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and the new development bank ndb were established the two banks are complementary to the existing global multilateral financial system by financing large global infrastructure in the spirit of openness inclusiveness and win win co operation the aiib and the ndb have established close partnerships with existing multilateral development banks bilateral development agencies and the private sector to explore a variety of business models including government and social capital co operation and joint financing so as to jointly improve the level of infrastructure investment and financing in developing countries and promote sustainable development and global economic recovery this article is part of the iff china report 2019 which draws mainly on content provided by china headquartered think tank the international

authored by christopher gisiger via the market no one has any idea what will happen jeffrey gundlach ceo of the investment firm doubleline warns that the stock market is ripe for another correction he spots significant risks in the rapid growth of debt the unpredictability of monetary policy and potential chaos in the 2020 presidential elections an interview with the bond king when jeffrey gundlach speaks investors around the world listen carefully it s hard to find anyone with a better sense for the global financial markets than the renowned ceo of the los angeles based investment firm doubleline he also doesn t shy away from expressing his unfiltered opinion when it comes to the general state of the economy and the political landscape we live in a world where a lot of people are changing the rules mr gundlach says during a wide ranging conversation at doubleline s headquarters in mid march most troublesome in his view is the rapid growth of debt ever more extreme central bank interventions and the toxic political climate in the united states he wouldn t be surprised to see outbreaks of violence during the 2020 campaign he states against this backdrop mr gundlach says it s very hard for investors to earn superior returns according to this view the s p 500 is still in a bear market and will fall into negative territory by the end of summer at the latest in opposite to us stocks he likes short term treasury bonds and emerging market equities as he explains in this exclusive interview with the swiss financial publication the market mr gundlach risk assets staged a remarkable comeback during the first months of the year in the united states the s p 500 is close to its record high what s your take on the stock market it s funny people make these statements that the stock market is booming in fact it s not really going anywhere the s p 500 is basically at the same level as it was back in the fall and at the same level as it was back in january 2018 so it s not doing really well it went way down at the end of last year and then most of the way back up but that s not booming that s just volatile what does this reveal about the state of the financial markets in general nothing is really changing the yield on the ten year treasury went up to 3 25 but it didn t last very long there then it went down to 2 4 and now it s back at 2 5 same thing with the dollar the dollar has been reliably stable for basically four years there was a little bit of variation but the dollar index has been in the mid to top of the nineties most of the time also gold hardly moves around the only thing which is really changing is that the economy is slowing down and the price of oil has been going up but that s about it so what s going to happen next i think us stocks are still in a bear market it s pretty typical for the starting point of a bear market to have a decent down move and then a nearly complete recovery what many people don t understand is that this kind of behavior is actually a really good selling opportunity nothing has a 100 probability of course but one thing which is important for success in investing is what i call trade location putting the odds on your side and when you get this sort of a pattern that s a classic trade location for being a seller at the start of 2018 you predicted correctly that the s p 500 will be negative at the end of the year where do you see us stocks at the end of 2019 i don t really know probably unchanged my highest conviction is an upside down v for the first six to eight months a big move up which we ve had but now given the setup in place i feel like the short term top is very close and maybe has already occurred that s why i think by the middle of the year and certainly by the end of the summer the s p 500 will be negative year to date once again investors are betting on the central banks to bail them out when things get dicey what are your thoughts on monetary policy ten years after the financial crisis the central banks have always been able to set short term interest rates but now they peg long term interest rates as well at any level they want and that creates malinvestment all over the system we ve had years of negative interest rates in europe and in japan even ten year bonds are yielding negative in switzerland and sometimes in japan and germany when interest rates are negative there is no reason to own these bonds whatsoever that means money finds its way into speculation or real estate or venture capital development the danger of this is that if the central banks ever stop trying to peg the rates the consequences of all the malinvestment will be revealed yet the central bankers seem to be confident that their unconventional measures are working there is an old saying that someone has a tiger by the tail in other words they think they have the situation under control but when they let go the tiger will maul them and kill them that s the problem central bankers have gotten themselves into there is almost no way out of the situation they have created as these radical policies have incrementally been implemented they open the door for acceptance of the next increment of radical policies what s the next step in terms of these radical policies here in the us there is growing support for candidates trying to get the democratic nomination by promising to give people money one of them is andrew yang a tech guy out of silicon valley he wants to give everyone 1 000 a month that s 4 trillion a year to which i say why stop there if 12 000 a year is so helpful why not do 24 000 or 24 million or 24 trillion that would eliminate all wealth inequality we could pay off the national debt and have every single person be equally wealthy of course the illogic here is that giving people monetary computer credits doesn t create anything everything is exactly the same except you now have stolen the wealth of everybody who saved and earned it and you have a depression like anarchic system it s weird how people think that a little of this money for nothing is helpful when anyone can see that taken to the extreme such measures would lead to an absolute implosion of the system including weimar republic or zimbabwe style inflation there is also a lot of talk about modern monetary theory what are your thoughts on this idea we ve come to a place where almost anything can be accepted as a valid idea modern monetary theory essentially says it s ok for the us to borrow like japan because our debt is in our own currency japan had a massive increase in debt and it s very difficult to find any obvious consequences other than the fact that it has been thirty years since the peak of the japanese stock market today the nikkei 225 is still about 50 lower than it was at the end of 1989 so i have to believe that there is some connection between zero interest rates enormous growth of debt and the lack of economic success these ideas may be intended to create a better society with more fairness and opportunity but a lot of them have the opposite effect and are distracting from the real problems what are the real problems we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in the united states the roads are falling apart bridges are collapsing and many airports are third world quality california for instance has gone from ten million to forty million residents without doing anything in terms of water projects or expanding the freeway system we can t even afford to build a train from los angeles to san francisco it s very telling when the wealthiest state in the us can t afford to build a train between its two massive population centers what are the consequences of this situation many candidates in the democratic party have an incredible agenda of spending trillions of more unfunded dollars while the us already has unfunded liabilities of nearly 600 of gdp last year the national debt rose by roughly 1 5 trillion or 7 of gdp and this in a supposedly strong economy one has to look at this in sort of disbelief it would be nice if we re just watching a bad movie but in reality we continue to move in an accelerating pace towards a dysfunctional economic system it will be interesting to see just how extreme the policy reactions are to the next economic downturn because it was the last recession that brought in these what could such measures look like the next downturn will massively expand the federal deficit this means that the amount of bonds which would need to be issued would also be massive so on natural market forces interest rates would have to go up on long term bonds this would make a severe recession even worse so it s possible that the federal reserve will aggressively emulate the bank of japan and maybe own every single treasury bond that s why it s very difficult to predict where long term interest rates are going how surprising is it to you that long term yields are still quite low despite the rapid growing debt interest rates should be higher based on what is going on structurally in the market and based on what the fed said it was going to do in december the fed said it was going to keep on with quantitative tightening no matter what then the stock market fell apart and within weeks the fed in a fairly spectacular way completely changed its guidance in terms of rate hikes and quantitative tightening they abandoned their forward guidance for 2019 before 2019 even began so it s all laid bare that the fed s forward guidance is completely uninformed and can change 180 degrees in a very short period of time yet on wall street everybody is happy that we are not going to have these economic stresses anymore bond yields have come down some as well in celebration of less quantitative tightening which means fewer bonds in the market some investors are even expecting interest rate cuts now what will the fed do next in the united states interest rates are likely to go up in the next downturn if market forces are allowed to prevail but the fed could very well resume quantitative easing they already have begun talking about it while nominal gdp is at 5 3 they have made statements that they are thinking about quantitative easing not in response to a crisis but as a normal exercise this strikes me that they re priming the market for qe4 happening certainly in response to the next downturn what s more by saying it s a normal policy tool they might do it even without a downturn or without taking the fed funds rate down to zero so we live in a world where a lot of people are changing the rules a downturn could happen right at the same time as the presidential elections you were one of the very few people who predicted donald trump s victory in 2016 who will win in 2020 it s too early to tell there are going to be twenty democratic candidates so you have to at least see how they perform on the debate stage at the end two candidates might have a real chance to compete for the democratic nomination and both could be well funded one who s a democratic socialist and someone like joe biden there could also be a funded mainstream republican in opposition to trump there is a plausible scenario in which no one would win the electoral college how come there is this ever increasing discord even though the 2016 election struck people as unusual the 2020 election will be far worse in terms of bizarre behavior we could have a real crisis in which the house of representatives picks the president and the senate picks the vice president imagine the uproar over how illegitimate that election would be but you have these two parties that philosophically do not jibe together in any way anymore also we will likely see violence in the 2020 campaign there will be more than just people heckling there will be real violence maybe even riots what should investors do in this kind of environment since january of 2018 i have been saying it s going to be a very difficult market to make money in last year more than 90 of world assets lost value and we are continuing to be in a very hard environment one of my recommendations is something as unspectacular as two year treasury bonds they re paying 2 5 interest you are going to get your money back when the world will probably be in a very bad place as these bonds mature so you may want liquidity to take advantage of the pain that other investors are feeling what kind of pain are you thinking about we had a legitimate presidential election and the establishment didn t like the result they spent the last two years plus trying to wait it out cause problems try to slow things down and regroup so here s the question if trump s victory based on the electoral college caused so much friction what will a president chosen by congress do if i m right that there could be a legitimacy of more than one candidate per party the financial markets are doomed no one will have any idea what will happen what does this mean for bonds the biggest problem of the bond market in the next economic downturn is going to be high grade corporate debt this segment has really increased in terms of outstanding supply corporate bonds have been used to finance buybacks and they have been purchased also by corporate pension systems there are so many of these bonds and many of them are misrated a lot of what s rated investment grade should be rated junk so it will be rated junk in a downturn the market will be just overwhelmed with supply during a period when there are no natural buyers what should investors look out for right now i think the dollar is going down and that will change a lot of things after a decent move up the momentum of the dollar is basically non existent and whenever you have momentum of an asset disappearing and prices holding up it s a great trade location to bet on it going down moreover the expansion of the twin deficits is highly correlated with a weaker dollar i also think the fed signaling no more interest increases is incrementally negative for the dollar a softer dollar could benefit emerging market stocks is that a good place to put money in i m not sure that you will make a lot of money in emerging markets but if equities do well this year you will make more money in emerging markets stocks than in us stocks on the other hand if equites do badly maybe the fourth quarter pattern will re emerge emerging markets stocks went down less than us stocks this is very rare usually when developed markets have a problem emerging markets do much worse because they have a higher beta but incredibly emerging markets have outperformed during the recent market downturn even without a weaker dollar and now they are performing just fine on the rebound and how about european stocks i don t want to do anything with europe the euro might go up but i have no interest in european bonds which yield negative in addition european equities have been a persistent value trap europe s problems are unbelievable part of it has to do with negative interest rates just look at the merger talks between deutsche bank and commerzbank one seemingly bankrupt german bank merging with another not quite so bankrupt but not healthy german bank so it s like what do you get when you merge two unhealthy banks together one unhealthy bank
european union leaders and the uk on thursday agreed to delay brexit until october 31 with a review in june thus avoiding a situation where britain crashed out of the bloc on april 12 international investors particularly those who trade britain s volatile currency cannot say they have not been warned of the damage that a no deal brexit would wreak on the uk and european economies the latest warning was delivered by the international monetary fund on tuesday when it published a special analysis of a no deal brexit in its flagship world economic outlook reports the imf anticipates that in the event of significant border disruptions and a severe tightening in financial conditions britain s gross domestic product would shrink by 1 4 per cent in the year after brexit and a further 0 8 per cent in the following year even without border disruptions britain s economy would still contract and only recover its 2018 level of output in 2021 yet financial markets have never taken much notice of the bleak forecasts of the consequences of a messy divorce while the british pound plunged 19 per cent against the us dollar in the four months following the brexit referendum in june 2016 it rose 10 5 per cent in 2017 and has continued to experience sharp swings in response to the twists and turns of the brexit saga this year sterling has been the best performer among the world s most liquid currencies according to bloomberg in equity markets while britain was the least favoured region in a global fund manager survey published by bank of america merrill lynch last month the ftse 100 index is still up by more than 20 per cent since the referendum mainly as a function of broader gains in global equities more importantly despite constituting one of the most momentous political events in europe since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brexit has never been a key determinant of sentiment in financial markets there are several reasons why first uk stocks account for a relatively small proportion of global equity indices making up less than 6 per cent of the msci world index a leading gauge of stocks in advanced economies compared with a weighting of more than 62 per cent for us shares second while the pound is one of the world s most heavily traded currencies many investors have steered clear of it since the brexit vote on the grounds that it has become too volatile hsbc described the pound as a political currency shortly after the referendum third and more saliently brexit is one of several vulnerabilities in markets which investors perceive as idiosyncratic as opposed to a threat that poses a systemic risk to financial stability since the uk voted to leave the eu brexit has never topped the list of concerns of fund managers according to the bank of america merrill lynch survey the biggest tail risks events that have a low probability of occurring but have significant implications for the global economy and markets since mid 2016 have been a hard landing for china s economy political populism the tightening of monetary policy and the us china trade war this is mainly because markets have discounted the worst possible brexit scenario faced with a binary outcome either a manageable brexit or a painful and messy divorce investors have always assumed that uk and european politicians will find a way back from the brink either by agreeing to put off the day of reckoning or removing the threat of a no deal outcome while there has been an element of complacency partly because an ultra hard brexit is too bleak a prospect for investors to contemplate it has been clear that there is no appetite in westminster for an abrupt and disorderly departure from the eu markets have also been more concerned about the health of the broader european economy particularly the euro zone while britain s manufacturing sector remains firmly in expansion territory euro zone factory output began to contract in february and is suffering its sharpest downturn since the region s debt crisis in 2012 according to survey data from ihs markit the pessimism surrounding the euro zone is reflected in the recent surge in speculative bets against the euro which have reached their highest level since 2016 according to the financial times the brexit drama moreover has been eclipsed by a series of positive catalysts for asset prices in recent months the federal reserve has shelved plans for further interest rate increases washington and beijing are moving closer to a trade deal and crucially china s economy appears to have stabilised the msci all country world index a gauge of global stocks is up by almost 14 per cent this year the brexit chaos will continue but for markets it is likely to remain a sideshow source south china morning post
welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up frank holmes of u s global investors joins me to update us on some of the best value propositions he sees in the markets he also reveals why he s very bullish on the metals right now and why he expects the next leg higher to happen in the blink of an eye don t miss another wonderful conversation with the man the mining journal named america s best fund manager frank holmes coming up after this week s market update precious metals markets are struggling to gain ground as gold prices continue to oscillate around the 1 300 level for a 7th straight week gold traded into or out of 1 300 per ounce earlier in the week gold climbed above that key level but got pulled back below it thursday on heavy selling as of this friday morning the yellow metal checks in at 1 293 per ounce essentially unchanged for the second week in a row now despite the weakness in gold the gold to silver ratio rose to a new multi decade high of 87 to 1 on thursday as the white metal got pounded to register its lowest close of the year spot silver prices currently trade at 15 11 an ounce and are posting a weekly decline of 0 5 platinum prices are down 0 6 this week to trade at 899 and finally palladium is off 0 3 on the week to trade at 1 383 the ounce metals bulls are currently feeling disappointed that these markets aren t getting any boost from the dovishly postured fed minutes from the federal reserve s march meeting were released on wednesday policymakers telegraphed a pause on rate hikes for the rest of the year however they did not give any indication that rate cuts as advocated by president donald trump will be on the table the fed also telegraphed an end to quantitative tightening by september in the meantime the central bank continues to unload billions of dollars in assets off its balance sheet every month effectively trimming back growth in the currency supply perhaps that is weighing on precious metals markets and the broader inflation trade last friday president trump called for the fed to reverse course and re start quantitative easing steve liesman cnbc president trump s substantially raising the ante in his comments and criticism of the fed not only does he think the fed should cut rates he also today for the first time advocated new quantitative easing that s the emergency measure from the financial crisis where the fed buys bonds and increases its balance sheet to push down interest rates donald trump i personally think the fed should drop rates i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing a new qe deployment probably won t happen until the economy takes a dramatic turn for the worse but the odds of some form of fed easing in the months ahead are growing as economic indicators soften this week the international monetary fund downgraded its growth forecasts for the global and u s economies the imf forecasts the american economy will grow 2 3 in 2019 down from a previous projection of 2 5 wall street analysts are also downgrading their outlook for corporate earnings lower profits and lower growth rates will mean lower tax revenues for the government the already ballooning federal budget deficit would then become a much bigger problem and could serve as impetus for the fed to resume purchasing treasury bonds well speaking of taxes the filing deadline is just around the corner for some it may not be too late to take advantage of some last minute tax reduction strategies for others it s not too early to begin making smart tax moves for the current year unfortunately for precious metals investors tax laws are rigged against them under current irs rules capital gains on all forms of bullion are arbitrarily treated as collectibles the irs taxes collectibles at a rate of 28 instead of the lower rates that apply to stocks and other financial assets fortunately there are legal ways to shelter your gold and silver gains from taxation one of the most straightforward and effective ways is through an ira you can hold certain types of tangible assets including irs approved gold silver platinum and palladium bullion products inside a self directed ira within the ira you can sell some or all of your holdings trade one metal for another or even switch the account back to conventional financial assets when you think metals markets have peaked none of your precious metals ira gains are taxable until you actually take withdrawals in the form of cash or the physical metal itself an ira backed by hard assets can be a powerful way to preserve wealth during times of rising inflation inflation may not be on most investors radar at this point but there is a danger in the fed s recent statements essentially declaring it will do nothing more this year to fight inflation once the inflation genie is let out of the bottle it becomes hard to control it can give the illusion of rising prosperity through rising asset prices on the one hand while on the other acting as an oppressive tax on workers and savers whose wealth is stuck in depreciating

specialists a call at 1 800 800 1865 well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer at us global investors mr holmes has received various honors over the years including being named america s best fund manager by the mining journal he is also the co author of the book the gold watcher demystifying gold investing and is a regular guest on cnbc bloomberg fox business and also right here on the money metals podcast frank welcome back and thanks for joining us again frank holmes it s great to be back in a day that the market is up and it s all good for us mike gleason yeah exactly we ll get into that well frank we focus a lot on federal debt around here of course the numbers there command a lot of attention the national debt is 22 trillion and has grown exponentially as we both know particularly over the past two decades but you wrote about something recently in your frank talk blog that probably isn t getting enough attention corporate debt is also a serious problem can you talk a little bit about corporate debt and why metals investors might want to keep an eye on that as well frank holmes just to add to that what was interesting that came up this morning is that the number of small cap russell 2000 stocks have almost a record of deteriorating earnings in cash flow and it s the highest percentage of b rated debt so there s a train wreck coming on those stocks in those industries according to these two dynamics but i think that the debt in the business element one thing about business they sort of adapt and adjust and they go through this cleansing process and i don t think that that is as big of a worry as when you have some of these quant funds that are leveraged 8 to 1 so you got a guy with a billion dollars and he is able to leverage himself 8 to 1 because their gamma of their information is good for three days to seven days so this is a big issue when you get these unwinds so all of a sudden you have 200 billion dollars getting unwound and the underlying capital behind it is 20 billion so you have 180 billion dollar hitting bids everywhere and i think that is probably for me a scary thing because i feel that in the markets every day up and down days so that s my thoughts on the debt mike gleason you ve also been keeping an eye on brexit and that s a topic we ve been interested in since the referendum was passed nearly three years ago unfortunately we find it almost impossible to predict what will happen the machinations of british parliament are hard to follow it looks just like the politicians there are wringing their hands perhaps hoping to wear people out if we had to guess the british will wind up throwing in the towel on brexit though we hope we re wrong on that but we re hoping you might venture a guess on what to expect with regards to brexit is the eu still in trouble or are they going to weather the storm that started a few years back frank holmes well the eu blames england for everything and the big difference is common law so the success of canada america singapore hong kong they re all based on common law same thing with new zealand and australia and so europe is civil law and that s where you seem to get the hardest core socialists it always surprises me that most the media is pro that and that s what happened with chavez getting into power and destroying venezuela so one has sit back and say where s the media where s the real thoughts etcetera and england is the second biggest contributor to the eu they were unfair and unreasonable and they used bully tactics with them and so the brits finally got fed up and are leaving so i think that the eu is going to have negative real interest rates that s why i think the bank of international settlements is concerned enough that they are now saying the banks don t have to have discounts on their gold holdings and so they re not treated as illiquid assets it in fact gold is the fourth most liquid asset in the world but we re seeing something that s really significant and that is a 5 year high in new central bank buying of gold poland czech republic hungary they re buying six tons at a whack and we saw gold get stumped a couple of weeks ago and basically the thoughts were maybe that was turkey because they had a financial crisis the day before and they ll sell the gold to try to stem it and then they ll be buying it back later so they use gold on a regular basis and last time they blew up their gold and knocked gold down it was the hungarians that bought it all so we re having a new phase of bankers central bankers around the world very attracted to gold and then we have the rising gdp per capita the rising gdp per capita of china and india is really significant because collectively those two countries are 40 of the world s population the gdp per capita the purchasing power parity right now of china and india and america is impacting the world and if you look at these market forces the chinese and the indians and then you got the middle east etcetera they all get gold for gifts and they buy 24 carat gold and this has led me into an investment in north america called mene gold and mene is listed in toronto but you can buy and go the website mene com and you can buy 24 carat gold for your loved one and then you want to buy some gold coins and silver coins and so to me what you re seeing with companies like this they re disruptive but we have such a big chinese and indian population now of young professionals and they want to buy 24 carat gold jewelry and so i think this idea of how much chindia is growing globally and it s highly correlated to gold jewelry demand and that is 60 of gold demand so i m very bullish mike gleason sticking with china here we d like to get an update from you with regards to trade it will soon be a year since the trump administration imposed tariffs and began earnestly trying to force the chinese and others to renegotiate trade deals it s pretty hard to gauge the actual progress in these negotiations rumors of a trade deal being imminent float out periodically that s been going on for months now but as yet nothing has been inked that hasn t kept stock prices from rallying each time one of those rumors appear what are you expecting in terms of a trade deal and what do you think it will mean for markets frank frank holmes well it s really a great question because where i was talking about earlier was some of these big numbers you have to look at macro forces i call them china and america are 40 of the world s gdp so them in a spat is very significant and the more impact that a china slowdown has and what they start doing is printing money like ferociously and staging the rules that anyone could borrow in january and all of a sudden we saw a trough in pmi now why is pmi important purchasing manufacturers index is a great predictor of rising commodities or falling commodities there are lots of highly correlated research has been done on that by us and we report on it so what we saw is a huge surge in pmi and whenever the one month is above the three month then you start seeing oil up so oil s up coppers up so this is very very bullish and you re seeing gold up too so i think the trade war what it s really about is a level playing field tech gets a lot of concern but it s just unlevel we have the biggest economy in the world to sell consumers of 13 trillion dollars they want to sell to us but we can t sell to them and i think that s pretty fair what trump has done he has taken the task he did it to the germans and said look if you want to be able to sell mercedes and bmws here then you re hurting gm and ford selling into germany then we re putting a tariff on you and then immediately they changed the rules over there so i think this is some of the positive parts of what s going on for the global trade i feel very confident that the second half is going to much stronger than what happened last year in the selloff in gold mike gleason getting back to metals here for a little bit gold and silver got off to a pretty start in 2019 it s fallen back in recent weeks somewhat but they ve been pretty fickle frank positive developments for gold such as the fed doing an about face on interest rates hasn t really provided the bump that many thought it would what do you make of the recent action in the metals where do you think they might be headed in the months ahead will we finally get a sustained upside move and take out some of these major overhead resistance levels say 1 350 1 375 in gold and 16 50 17 in silver what are your thoughts there frank frank holmes i think it happens in a new york second and then it s going to go sideways for a while but it s just going to surprise everyone and just explode and find that new level and hang around 1 400 that s my thoughts on it and it will surprise in the blink of an eye how that happens there will be some type of event and i believe that the peak gold is here so if we have rising in the amount of printing money and gdp per capita is rising around the world and with the cultural affinity for gold we have peak mine supply i remain pretty constructively bullish mike gleason you obviously talk a lot about the negative real interest rate environment that can be very bullish for precious metals is that what you re kind of looking for moving forward do you see those coming back in spates here and it being a good tailwind for gold frank holmes what s interesting is that rates peaked last october and then the market really sold off rates started coming down and had been falling since october but what really hurt the market last year in the fourth quarter was the unwinding of qe3 and the selling of bonds that was very destructive even though the rates were coming lower impacted bids everywhere i think the worst of that is behind us and so i think that that s why we have got more stability in the capital markets and inflation came down so it was allowed for these rates to come down but what really makes it is that europeans they re at big negative and they should be backing up the truck and just loading up on the bullion and the quality gold stocks and that s what i think you ll start to see that as we go further in the year mike gleason well finally frank as we begin to wrap up can you give us any final thoughts here as we look toward the middle part of 2019 and maybe any other comments that you d like to share that maybe we haven t covered as we conclude today frank holmes we have a great product called near term it s short term munis and it s around a 2 dollar nav it s very stable hardly any fluctuations and you get a higher yield than you re going to get in any bank account for money fund and i think investors have to look at making sure that they have a good cushion of cash in the muni space not like when we talked earlier where you brought up and highlighted the small businesses in mid cap stocks that have debt deterioration and they have greater risk no that muni s are in great financial shape and that s where you get some of the best relative attractive returns so from that end that s something for investors and if you re going to go into the gold space there s a note on the toronto stock exchange called grand columbia which is the largest gold producer in columbia 200 000 ounces very high grade and they have a gold note just under a hundred million it pays just under 10 yield and pays monthly and as the price of gold goes up they pay out a higher monthly dividend those are sort of the unique investments and the most recent invest i made is a micro cap space that s called gold spot and that s with nine phds who are doing artificial intelligence for major mining companies and juniors who they take a royalty from and do work on it so i love having all these young scientists that are just changing the world with ai and then goau our smart beta gold etf it s demonstrated what it said it would do it would perform the gdxj 92 of the time on a rolling twelve month basis and it s done that so we re very proud of that and since the new york go gold goau if you re into buying gold equities otherwise stick with you and get those beautiful gold coins mike gleason

stage but any new referendum could probably take six months to organize thence time would be tight even though brexit date is delayed to october 31 also hammond added the government s position has not changed the government is opposed to a confirmatory referendum and therefore we would not be supporting it bundesbank weidmann german growth plausible to be just 0 8 this year bundesbank president jens weidmann warned that german economy could slow sharply in 2019 growth rate could eventually be lower than 1 he pointed to imf s new projections of just 0 8 for this year and noted that s entirely plausible it s just half the rate of 1 6 bundesbank projected back in december weidmann also added fiscal policy as the minister finance minister olaf scholz said is already expansionary in germany and we estimate the impact of fiscal policy on gdp for this year to be between one quarter to one half percentage point german economy ministry less dynamic but still upward trend german economy ministry said in the april economic report today that the economy continues to show a mixed picture service and construction are expanding strongly however global oriented manufacturing is still in a weak phase the reported note that both global industrial production and world trade were on the decline at the end of 2018 and this continued in january 2019 in industrial production trade had a slightly recovery but remained below last year s level pmi was at lowest since june 106 while ifo reflected a gloomier mood and in light of the indicators and the accumulation of global risks international organizations are predicting a less dynamic but still upward global trend also industrial economy is likely to remain subdued in the face of declining foreign demand and high international risks japan us trade talks to start next week for exchanging views japan economy minister toshimitsu motegi announced today that the first round of japan us trade talks will start next week on april 15 16 in washington he said he d intend to exchange view frankly with us trade representative robert lighthizer it s believed that a core topic is japan s near usd 70b trade surplus with nearly two thirds from auto exports finance minister taro aso reiterated japan s intention to further expand trade and investment between between the two countries in a mutually beneficial manner he also pointed to the joint statement made last september however japan has been very clear on its intention to defend the multilateral trade pact tpp that it leads and us quitted under trump hence no matter what japan is going to offer to the us they won t be something better than what s offered to tpp partners imf gopinath auto tariffs could be more damaging to us china trade war imf chief economist gita gopinath warned that auto tariffs could be more damaging to the world economy than us china trade war she said on the sidelines of imf and world bank annual meeting we are concerned about what auto tariffs would do to the global economy at a time when we are more in the recovery phase trade conflicts of the us and others including china eu canada and japan could spill over into the auto sector and that could have severe damage to the global manufacturing supply chains she warned that would actually be far more costly for the world economy than just the u s china trade tensions that we had in the us the commerce department has already submitted section 232 national security report on auto imports earlier this year trump will have until may 17 to decide whether he wants to extend punitive tariffs from steal to auto and from rival in china to allies in eu canada and japan eur usd mid day outlook daily pivots s1 1 1241 p 1 1264 r1 1 1278 more eur usd s rise from

eur usd extends gains after signs of economic rebound leave forecasters in a tight spot grecaud paul adobe stock eur up on m a speculation chinese and euro economic news q1 industrial fall shallower than thought sector may be turning leaves forecasters in awkward spot pending further information the euro advanced against rivals friday when official data appeared to suggest the first quarter industrial downturn may have been shallower than markets had previously thought and after chinese economic figures surprised on the upside europe s single currency received a sharp boost overnight which analysts say was the result of merger and acquisitions activity with some suggesting the move could be connected to mufg s agreement to buy the aviation financing business of dz bank that was announced on march 01 usd is generally slightly softer overnight led by eur pushing back to the top of the week s range on reports that mitsubishi ufj would buy the aviation financing business of dz bank valued at around eur6bn says adam cole of rbc capital markets otherwisae news flow has been very light and as we go to press china s march trade figures have still not been released people s bank of china pboc data later showed loan issuance by domestic lenders almost doubling during march after having fallen sharply in february while the trade surplus also rebounded from depressed levels too chinese economic weakness resulting from the so called trade war with the u s was one of the key drivers behind the 2018 collapse of eurozone factory activity so any signs of a pick up in the world s second largest economy would always be positive for the euro that set the euro on a positive path before the opening of the european session although the currency has since made further headway against the u s dollar following signs the industrial downturn on the continent may not be as severe as some surveys have been suggesting above euro to dollar rate shown at hourly intervals we re not at all surprised to see eurusd trading above 1 1300 and this corroborates our earlier arguments concerning patience when it comes to the right time to sell eurs but we re naturally sceptical of the positive vibe markets have adopted in the wake of the latest chinese data and of what the data are really telling us says stephen gallo european head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets eurozone industrial production fell by 0 2 during february when markets had looked for a much larger 0 5 decline furthermore the estimated 1 4 increase in production from january was revised higher to 1 9 which means industrial output thus far in 2019 has been substantially higher than markets thought was the case the eurozone industrial sector has been the key driver behind the economic slowdown that saw gdp growth fall from from 0 4 in the second quarter of 2018 to 0 1 in the third and just 0 2 for the final quarter most of the core manufacturing sectors registered modest declines though in all cases the dips were much smaller than the gains in january says claus vistesen chief eurozone economist at pantheon macroeconomics across the major economies production fell slightly in germany and spain while it increased in italy and france these data pose a bit of a conundrum for forecasters eurozone growth was just 1 8 in 2018 overall down from 2 3 the previous year and some influential forecasters are suggesting the economy could expand by as little as 0 9 in 2019 commerzbank forecasts eurozone gdp growth of 0 9 this year friday s data may have come as a shock to the market because ihs markit pmi surveys have pointed clearly to a deepening of the recession in the eurozone manufacturing sector during the first quarter although those surveys frequently overestimate the size of upward and downward changes in output based on just the january and february numbers industrial production growth is headed for a much stronger q1 headline than implied by the terrible survey data says vistesen we fear the worst but even if we assume a significant setback of about 2 5 month to month in line with the surveys industrial production would still come in flat quarter on quarter for q1 significantly better than the 1 2 decline in q4 and much stronger than predicted by the pmis above euro to dollar rate shown at daily intervals the european central bank ecb said wednesday the eurozone economy is likely to have slowed further in the new year and warned that inflation could fall even more than it already has over the coming months in part because of the economic slowdown that kind of outlook is why the bank also confirmed it will launch another round of targeted long term refinancing operations tltros in september as part of an effort to stimulate demand in the hope of lifting inflation back toward the target of close to but below 2 february s industrial production data suggest that output in the sector performed a little better in q1 than at the end of last year but the sector is still struggling and with global economic growth set to remain weak this year and next euro zone industrial production is likely to continue to be sluggish too says jack allen an economist at capital economics this weak economic pulse is undermining the outlook for eurozone inflation which is key to the european central bank interest rate outlook the ecb is targeting inflation that is sustainably close to but below 2 but both headline and core measures of inflation have spent much of the time since the 2012 debt crisis well below that level after reaching 2 2 in 2018 amid a steep climb in oil prices the consumer price index fell from 1 5 to 1 4 in march 2019 core inflation which most economists say is a better measure of true price pressures in an economy fell from 1 to 0 8 that month its lowest level since march 2017 core inflation has not been above the 1 2 ever since the eurozone debt crisis but until the target can be achieved in a sustainable manner markets will have little chance of seeing a european central bank interest rate hike if data stabilises the ecb will be keen on hiking at the end of this year but our conviction level is low and declining similar to the ecb s the alternative we argued would be no hike this year a long extension of forward guidance beyond market pricing and tiering the debate is shifting from base or risk scenario to the details what to do and sequencing how quickly to do it in the risk scenario says ruben segura cayuela an economist at bank of america

and helping offset weaker imports and reports of another cut in german growth forecasts investors are looking for signs of a chinese economic recovery to temper global growth worries especially after the international monetary fund this week downgraded its 2019 world economic outlook for the third time china s trade results as well as credit data have helped boost risk appetite and reinforce the

over the past 15 years the economies in central america and the caribbean cac recorded an average annual gdp growth of around 4 percent higher than the growth rates achieved by the latin american average and most developed economies but well below most other developing regions regions such as south asia and sub saharan africaâ and countries such as china or indiaâ exhibited average annual growth of more than 5 percent during this period however growth has not been sustained by all cac countries in fact only three countries costa rica the dominican republic and panama have grown above the regional average over the last 30 years and only the former two exhibited higher than average growth rates in both analyzed periods indeed most nations have presented high volatility in economic growth since 1987 exhibit 1 1 section 1 factors that drive the dynamism of central america and the caribbean what has enabled the cac region to have achieved faster growth than the rest of the latin american countries one of the distinctive factors has been rapid productivity growth in the last 15 years productivity has grown at more than 2 percent per year representing more than half 56 percent of the growth of the regionâ s gdpâ substantially above the average for latin america but still lagging far behind global champions such as asiaâ s booming economies in addition the relative macroeconomic stability of cac countries reflects sound monetary and public finance policies exhibit 2 2 thereâ s also a clear trend among cac countries to develop an increasingly service focused economy the importance of the services sector in the region is widely recognized by institutions such as the development bank of latin america economic commission for latin america and the caribbean inter american development bank and organisation for economic cooperation and development although this approach has shown good results most countries across the region have shown a premature drop in their levels of industrialization the dynamics of industrial growth have recently changed due to the automation of processes significantly reducing the labor intensity of typical manufacturing occupationsâ however it remains an important lever of growth in several high growth developing economies growth in cac has also been driven by high levels of investment and household consumption when compared with the rest of latin america and the global average household consumption is partly explained by the high value of remittances received in a majority of cac countries except for costa rica panama and trinidad and tobago remittances represent on average 11 percent of gdp compared with the global average of less than 1 percent on the other hand a high trade balance deficit remains a main factor of lag both regionally and in the fastest growing countries section 2 four growth archetypes we classified the cac countries into four archetypes according to their current income level and economic growth over the last 30 years stars emerging falling behind and laggards exhibit 3 3 what have been the key success factors of the â starâ countries countries classified as â starsâ have benefited from a rapid increase in productivity high levels of investment and a model of growth focused on service sectors productivity represented more than 60 percent of gdp growth since 2002 versus 18 percent in other cac countries growing at more than 3 percent per year in 2017 investment represented 30 percent of gdp registering an annual growth of more than 7 percent between 2002 and 2017 the average annual growth achieved by the service sector was more than 5 percent over the past 15 years representing nearly two thirds of the economyâ allowing star countries to avoid the effects of falling commodity prices and overall volatility the challenges of the â falling behindâ and â laggardâ archetypes the nations that fall within the â falling behindâ and â laggardâ archetypes face important challenges stagnant productivity growth 0 5 percent average growth since 2002 high dependence on commodities natural resource rents in countries such as guyana and suriname represent 20 to 30 percent of gdp and agriculture accounts for 10 to 15 percent of gdp in countries like guatemala honduras and nicaragua low levels of investment 18 percent of gdp in 2017 down from 21 percent in 2002 section 3 seven trends affecting the region as discussed cac has grown at a faster rate than the regional average mainly driven by rapid productivity growth a strong service sector high levels of investment and household consumption and macroeconomic stability however this growth could be affected by global and regional changes we have identified seven key trends that are changing the supply and demand dynamics declining fertility rates the digital revolution sophistication of global demand looming insecurity rising public debt rapid urbanization and market diversification see sidebar â migration in central america and the caribbeanâ 1 declining fertility rates declining fertility rates could negatively affect the economy of the region given its growth structure according to the latest un forecasts cacâ s demographic pyramid will be flattened by 2050 and it is therefore expected that the working age population will see growth rates decrease to only about 1 percent per year by 2030 this will hinder the regionâ s capacity to grow given several economiesâ heavy dependence on the demographic dividend and will require further efforts to boost productivity 2 digital revolution according to the mckinsey global instituteâ s january 2017 report harnessing automation for a future that works the rising automation of work activities despite having the potential to boost global productivity by 0 8 to 1 4 percent per year by 2065 also generates a latent risk of labor displacement however the benefits of new technologies for users and businesses would contribute to further economic growth and job creation allowing society to promote inclusive growth policies apart from this the digital revolution also presents a key opportunity to transform government productivityâ from enabling data driven decisions to the digitization of end to end processes and the reinvention of government interactions with citizens and businesses 3 sophistication of global demand most of the regionâ s economies have an export sector based on low value added products and services while the larger and more dynamic sectors of cac countries are being affected by a global shift in demand toward more sophisticated goods and services based on current export portfolios most countries should strive to find opportunities for diversification including an important transformation of the quality of education which would enable building the human capital required to meet the needs of the new demand 4 concerns about safety crime and feelings of being unsafe have reached epidemic levels in the region some countries such as el salvador and honduras experience homicide rates similar to that of war zones behind this is the development of organized crime including â maras â or gangs as a main figureâ a consequence of the geographical fatality of the region as a natural drug corridor between producer countries and consumer markets however there is some good news for most cac countries where homicide rates have dropped dramatically since 2015 for example in el salvador rates have fallen by almost 50 percent from 103 to 60 homicides per 100 000 inhabitants and in honduras by about 30 percent from 60 to 43 migration in central america and the caribbean an increase in migration flows is a particularly important aspect in regard to central america and the caribbean cac with more than 400 000 new immigrants since 2000 the flows have been inward and outward flows into cac have been mostly from within the region from south america and from the united states to the three star economies in cac which accounted for 45 percent of all immigrants to cac in 2017 for outward flows in 2017 92 percent of all emigrants from nicaragua and the countries of the northern triangle had costa rica mexico or the united states as a final destination the effects of migration will depend on governments across the regionâ whether they can turn the challenge into an opportunity it is important that recipient countries design effective integration policies and that emitting countries develop strategies to mitigate the risk of talent drain and to create opportunities for a vulnerable population 5 rising public debt the growing pressure on public spending and high levels of government debt are tightening the resources of governments around the world with some exceptions such as costa rica and trinidad and tobago most countries in the region seem to have learned from the mistakes of the past and have increased their fiscal disciplineâ but the vulnerability of public debt remains a priority 6 rapid urbanization cac will be the fifth most urbanized region in the world by 2030 77 percent of the population will live in cities similar to europe but the infrastructure hasnâ t accompanied this rapid process according to the world bank rapid urbanization in the region has posed several challenges including â inadequate housing vulnerability to natural disasters and low economic growth in urban centers â the swiftly changing urban landscape has also contributed to the development of organized crime cac has an opportunity to learn from more urbanized regions and plan for appropriate social and economic development of its main cities as urban migration continues to accelerate closing the infrastructure gap will be one of the key challenges 7 market diversification although international trade has expanded to emerging mostly asian markets in recent years cac economies are still highly dependent on trade with the united states in addition to their export industries depending on a few commodities and low value added products however the region has about 40 percent of all the free trade agreements signed in latin america making it a region with a high potential for commercial integration with global fast growing markets section 4 how to foster sustainable growth the seven trends present both challenges and opportunities for tackling development needs across cac we believe three key factors could present a path forward to promote inclusive and sustainable growth in the region incorporating lessons learned from regional success stories boosting competitiveness to capture the value at stake and strengthening connectivity and cooperation between the public and private sectors in the region incorporating lessons learned from regional success stories most countries in the region have success stories in terms of sector development among them six stories were studied in detail costa rica as the main destination for foreign direct investment in business support services in latin america the fast growing medical device manufacturing sector in costa rica that accounted for more than 4 billion in exports in 2018 strongly driven by the countryâ s long standing investment in education and technical skills distinctive investment promotion capabilities and attraction of anchor investors the booming tourism sector in the dominican republic the second largest tourist destination in latin america boosted by investor driven infrastructure investments and attractive anchor products and incentives the logistics industry in panama that accounts for 19 percent of the world total in dead weight tonnage capitalizing on the panama canal to develop a world class diversified and strategic sector for the country apparel manufacturing in honduras the leading exporter of t shirts to the united states propelled by deep specialization and publicâ private coordination to create competitive clusters wire harness manufacturing in nicaragua taking advantage of competitive labor costs and an attractive legal framework to boost exports by five times within five years see sidebar â the recent crisis in nicaraguaâ for information about political instability affecting the country to estimate the economic potential of incorporating regional lessons learned we analyzed the level of exports per capita in each success story the feasibility of developing similar sectors in each cac country and the potential impact of achieving best in class regional levels we estimate that learning from regional success stories could boost exports of goods and services excluding commodities across cac by more than 140 billion by 2030 exhibit 4 4 the recent crisis in nicaragua the recent political crisis in nicaragua threatens to hinder the strong growth that the economy had been achieving in recent years the latest forecasts from the international monetary fund point to a 4 percent contraction in the nicaraguan economy in 2018 this forecast allows us to distill an important lesson for the region apart from designing and implementing strategies aimed at fulfilling the economic growth potential of each country political and social stability is a necessary condition to achieve sustainable development in the long term apart from strengthening its export portfolio the region should focus on expanding its access to the main markets in asia as well as increasing its penetration to the european union it should be noted that no cac country has free trade agreements with japan and very few have signed a trade agreement with china or other main countries across the asiaâ pacific regionâ high growth markets that would offer new opportunities for diversification and foster competition and innovation in the region boosting competitiveness to capture the value at stake to remain competitive there are five key factors that the region must strengthen to respond to global trends human capital infrastructure access to credit innovation and technology and the government and business climate to understand how prepared the cac is in each of the five dimensions we conducted a diagnostic based on figures from the global innovation index world bank and world economic forum a comparative analysis relative to averages in latin america and globally shows a lag in all areas with respect to the global average but with key gaps on two human capital and innovation and technology exhibit 5 5 in order to boost human capital the region should broaden the talent base and prepare for the jobs of the future by promoting science technology engineering and mathematics stem education improving technical and vocational education systems to become more agile and connected to the current demands of the labor market by following an education to employment programs lens and addressing gender parity particularly in stem areas regarding infrastructure cac could enable growth by strategically prioritizing and executing key projects in transportation and trade related infrastructure and in basic infrastructure and by strengthening urban planning to improve access to credit economies should facilitate investment by allowing capital to flow where it can be used most profitably by incorporating capital into the banking system and thus increasing average saving rates and extending financial services to firms especially small and medium size enterprises smes innovation and technology can be strengthened with the improvement of digital readiness particularly by boosting digital infrastructure and regulations digitizing government processes and developing digital government strategies as well as promoting innovation clusters and ecosystems and developing an innovation pipeline regarding the government and business climate efforts should focus on facilitating business development particularly focused on smes and modernizing public institutionsâ by tackling high informality levels addressing security and corruption outbursts eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy pursuing fiscal customs and labor reforms and modernizing and strengthening government capability building strengthening connectivity and cooperation between the public and private sectors the success of a new economic and social development model requires both commitment from the public sector and the perspective of the private sector regarding the public sector the region should adjust the legal and regulatory framework to improve the business environment link budgets with the development strategy provide support and focus on eliminating obstacles to implementation the private sector should bring its perspective to develop and deploy market driven initiatives and investments focus strategic priorities and generate productive and sustainable jobs by promoting vocational education programs and with publicâ private training that leverages the capacities of formal training the region could address human capital and thus benefit from greater cooperation technical on the job training via the private sector would help to close the gap between supply and demand of talent boosting intraregional connectivityâ improving transportation infrastructure enhancing trade facilitation and strengthening commercial agreements among different countriesâ and intergovernmental coordination would allow cac to leverage its economic and demographic potential in 2017 cac countries had a cumulative gdp of close to 400 billion and comprised more than 65 million people making the region the 19th largest economy in the world and 23rd most populated in 2017 cac countries had a cumulative gdp of close to 400 billion making the region the 19th largest economy in the world cac has an enormous potential to boost its growth in the medium and long term this potential must be translated into a tangible impact for families and businesses across the region this means ensuring that the growth model is inclusive creating job opportunities that match labor supply characteristics formalizing large sectors such as construction trade and agriculture promoting sme growth and entrepreneurship and fostering stronger linkages between multinationals and the local value chain these are among the key initiatives required to ensure that economic growth trickles down to the entire population governments should design and effectively implement public policies and regulations that enhance competitiveness and capture trade synergies between countries ensuring that the potential translates into inclusive growth for the entire population of the region they can also coordinate key stakeholders to align demand and supply in labor markets companies should promote greater collaboration within the region to strengthen local value chains work with governments to define national and regional economic development strategies and in general adopt a longer term vision of policies and growth initiatives business leaders can also act as spokespersons for the private sector expressing their concerns and interests in conversations with external stakeholders individuals also have responsibilities citizens must actively participate in development efforts and demand accountability students need to be informed about the needs and changes of the labor market to pursue training in areasâ that can lead to employment workers must be proactive in acquiring new skills to stay relevant in the digital revolution we do not underestimate the scope of the changes needed to fulfill this potential cac economies have a difficult task ahead that can only be achieved through leadership and cooperation among all stakeholders shaping a new inclusive and sustainable growth agenda that leverages and strengthens ties can enable the rise of the region in upcoming years
gold isn t just back central banks are on a buying spree like it s wwii and the biggest names in mining say we re running out of physical gold china and russia are staking enormously on the precious yellow metal by the end of 2018 central banks had bought up 74 more gold than the year before and they re still going strong russia is hedging against the dollar heavily china too the world gold council says it hasn t seen anything like this since 1967 it s a combination of global events that could send gold prices soaring abruptly all the biggest names in gold agree one thing we re running out of physical gold ian telfer ceo of goldcorp the biggest mining company in the world says we re right at peak gold franco nevada chairman pierre lassonde says the coming years will see a significant dip in gold production and seabridge gold chairman rudy frink says gold reserves are shrinking noticeably these fears are real discoveries in the past decade have paled in comparison to earlier times when a little known company suddenly manages to do the impossible and secure a license for one of the biggest gold and copper mines in the world the finance world sits up and takes note now watch what s happening in romania one of the richest gold venues in europe romania s historical ro ia montana mine is the stuff of lore and legend not just because it s in the land of dracula but because it s home to legendary gold and copper resources that the government hasn t let anyone touch until now as one little known company just became the first non state owned entity to receive a ratified mining license to get at what could become one of the biggest gold discoveries of the century the little known company is a mining tech genius called euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff and it s done what no one else could do using cutting edge exploration and production techniques such as drone surveying and 3d geo mapping the company is aiming to dig up some 13 billion in gold and copper reserves and this year the massive resources near the ro ia montana mines could be resurrected at exactly the same time that the world is running out of gold and as gold is staging its biggest comeback ever welcome to the world class rovina valley copper gold project now fully owned by a company that analysts say could be worth 180x its current value where investors are zeroing in on a clean tech shale style revolution for gold this is gold 2 0 and it s all about clean tech zero cyanide and getting more gold for every exploration buck euro sun isn t only sitting on massive acreage in one of europe s most pre eminent venues but it s also right next door to another hugely profitable mining estate in europe and better yet we re already running out of gold here are 5 reasons to look at euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff right now 1 ridiculously undervalued stock euro sun mining currently has a market cap of 40 million a ridiculously low valuation for a company that just made an unprecedented jump in europe s second largest gold mine and one of the biggest in the world compare it to timok a very similar asset located in neighboring serbia that recently sold for 1 4 billion euro sun mining s rovina valley project contains significantly more gold and copper resources than timok and is located just four hours away by car indeed rovina valley contains 40 percent more reserves than timok and features 36 percent lower capex it s interesting to note that a chinese firm recently bid 1 4 billion for timok that would make rovina worth 90x more rovina s low aisc all in sustaining costs of 752 an ounce leaves a healthy profit margin of 550 an ounce at current gold prices and a 60 70 million free cash flow every year a preliminary economic assessment estimated euro sun mining s average gold production of 196 000 ounces and 49 4 million pounds of copper each year over a 19 year lifetime this implies that rovina and consequently euro sun mining should be valued at no less than 3 billion to put a finer point on things that would make rovina worth 180x more than its current value the sizeable valuation disparity can almost entirely be chalked up to the constant comparisons with gabriel resources and ro ia montana yet to associate euro sun mining with gabriel resources is unequivocally incorrect and absolutely misses the point none of the many issues that have plagued gabriel resources apply to euro sun mining the company s clean technologies have a much smaller environmental footprint something that has endeared it to the government as evidenced by the mining license ratification process euro sun mining is well in the process of getting all the necessary permits while gabriel resources is basically doomed it s important for investors to bear in mind that the company will re rate materially higher when the mining license ratification is complete 2 the gold rally source cnn money since 2011 gold traders have endured a torrid period amid one of the longest economic expansions in history low levels of financial market stress asset purchases by global banks on a massive scale and extreme bullishness in equity markets led to a cooling off for gold stocks but now the exact opposite is beginning to happen we ve just witnessed a shift from extreme optimism to deep pessimism trade wars brexit bloody political upheaval in venezuela and countless other global events have caused tectonic cracks in the global economy the u s is not immune either growth was only 2 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 4 percent in the previous quarter suddenly the fed has changed its tune canceling interest rate hikes and expressing concern about slowing growth in china the situation is even worse the economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and china s biggest trading partner the european union has just cut its near term growth projections by an astounding 40 percent the eu economy is expected to grow at only 1 3 percent everywhere you look signs that a global recession looms large abound with the imf recently cutting its 2019 outlook that is exactly the kind of backdrop that favors safe haven investing gold is considered the ultimate fear hedge that outperforms other asset classes during times of economic stress and gold charts are a clear testament to this fact undervalued junior mining stocks like euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff offer the best chance for solid returns as investors turn to gold to hedge their bets especially when they re suddenly sitting on one of the most alluring gold mines in the world keep this in mind there is an explosive upside to gold stocks when gold starts climbing even modestly that s what happened in 2016 when gold prices jumped 26 in only 6 months leading to outsized returns for miners endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months iamgold gained 256 even the juniors skyrocketed argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 increase in gold production even a 1 move in gold can send junior miners soaring 10 or more with analysts already putting a price target of 80 higher on euro sun imagine what even a small jump in gold prices could do 3 world class gold mine euro sun mining is developing a world class gold and copper mine that would put much bigger companies to shame the company now has 100 percent ownership for roughly 400 million tons of ore in three discreet bodies consisting of about 7 1 million ounces of gold and a billion and a half pounds of copper working out to about 10 1 million ounces of gold equivalent at a current gold price of 1320 per ounce that s more than 13 3 billion in potential revenue and that for a company that s currently valued at 30 million and it gets even better extraction costs at the rovina valley project are much lower than that of neighboring mining districts the rovina valley mine is frequently compared to timok a legendary mining district in serbia yet it is much bigger and provides superior mining economics rovina valley not only contains much more extensive gold and copper reserves they are also cheaper to mine in november the country s national agency for mineral resources namr officially endorsed the project and initiated the ratification process for the mining license this is a short process that can be completed in a few months the license de risks this play which is already fully licensed by the romanian government that s why a 40 million market cap company is starting to look a lot like a 3 billion company and analysts seem to agree the rovina valley project rvp is located in prime mining estate the plant location is about 3km away from a small town of 13 000 people the town was home to a large mine for 80 years and has a well developed infrastructure network of rail power water they literally have it all 4 the clincher clean technology combined with high productivity all other natural resource sectors have had to move forward with revolutionary new technology to enhance recovery and to spare the environment gold is no different and euro sun is proving that in the ancient tunnels of romania not only is it safe and environmentally friendly but it s also a boon to gold recovery euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff has put a lot of money into its research labs it s tried dozens of different chemicals and processes and now it s discovered the secret that makes those types of yields possible the company is now able to extract 20 percent extra gold at zero extra cost the process is dry stacking which virtually eliminates contamination though seepage of groundwater when gold is separated from the hard rock gold recovery was formerly 68 percent now it s 82 percent the concentrate was 9 or 10 percent previously and now its 22 percent with about 100 grams of gold in other words the kind of grades that smelters would kill for that makes the term undervaluation itself undervalued 5 first government backed private entity euro sun mining is the only government endorsed private mining firm operating in romania thanks to its dedication to using clean mining technologies the company has already embarked on an environmental and social impact assessment esia and continue its work on a feasibility study on the rovina valley project romania has an incredibly rich mining culture which means that the government is keen to get everything restarted but it s got to be clean euro sun mining is devoted to using the latest technology with no environmental risks and that speaks to esg which is all about environmentally and socially responsible investments euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff has officially become the first non state owned mining project with the full endorsement of the romanian government euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff represents a highly asymmetrical risk reward with little downside but very high upside the shares shot up 50 percent when the company received a ratified mining license by the romanian government in november and now it s hoping to get production underway within 12 to 18 months for the first non state owned company to be issues a mining permit since 2003 and the first company to be able to cleanly cut the vampires out of this transylvanian gold this is a discovery on multiple levels it s got serious legs that are running at breakneck speed here are 5 more companies analysts are watching as precious metals gain speed first majestic silver tsx fr there s a lot of bullishness around this stock with earnings growth expected to be high over the next 3 5 years the optimism is absolutely justified as this canadian mining company has been operating in mexico for nearly a decade and has over 770 million in assets including 5 of the most promising locations in the country apart from its strong resource base in a proven jurisdiction first majestic silver could see its share price go up significantly in the next 2 years as a majority of world renowned economists are now expecting a recession before the end of 2020 in the short term investors can look forward to a share repurchasing program the company board has already approved an extension of the current share buyback which allows the company to buy back up to 5 000 000 of its own shares wheaton precious metals corp tsx wpm wheaton is a company with its hands in operations all around the world as one of the largest streaming companies on the planet wheaton has

construction of the constancia mine in peru the hudbay team has proven themselves to be strong and responsible mine developers and we are excited about the same team moving this project into

production profile agnico eagle mines ltd tsx aem canadian based gold producer agnico eagle mines is an especially noteworthy company for investors why between 1991 2010 the company paid out dividends every year with operations in quebec mexico and finland the company also is taking place in exploration activities in europe latin america and the united states agnico is a company with a lot of exposure to gold letting investors take advantage of long term price movements though the company joins a long list of gold majors that reported losses in 2018 but its cash flow deficit is largely attributed to its growth in production and new projects coming online yamana gold tsx yri yamana has recently completed its cerro moro project in argentina giving its investors something major to look out for the company plans to ramp up its gold production by 20 through 2019 and its silver production by a whopping 200 investors can expect a serious increase in free cash flow if precious metal prices remain stable recently yamana signed an agreement with glencore and goldcorp to develop and operate another argentinian project the agua rica initial analysis suggests the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the

overview the consolidative week in the capital markets is drawing to a close equity markets are narrowly mixed in asia most indices outside of the greater china china taiwan and hong kong edged higher leaving the msci asia pacific index slightly lower on the week the snapped a ten day rally yesterday and is little changed so far today europe s dow jones is off about 0 25 in late morning turnover and about a 0 5 loss for the week the is nursing a margin loss this week coming into today s session it has moved higher in 10 of the last 11 sessions but is continuing to knock on 2900 bank earnings are in focus today bond yields in asia were mostly higher and china s yield rose a couple of basis points to nose above 3 30 a new high for the year european yields are a little softer while the us is hovering just below 2 50 the is mostly lower with the japanese yen the notable exception on the week the dollar has risen against only the yen and swiss franc asia pacific china reported its lending and data for march the lending data is flattered by the expected rebounded after the lunar new year distortions in february but also the shift in policy from de leveraging to stimulating the economy aggregate lending jumped cny2 86 trillion the median estimate in the bloomberg survey was for an increase of cny1 85 trillion after a cny703 bln increase in february the aggregate lending includes the state banking system and shadow banking state dominated bank lending is seen in the new yuan loans they rose cny1 69 trillion well above the forecast for cny1 25 trillion after a roughly cny886 bln increase in february the difference between the aggregate lending and the new yuan loans is a proxy for the shadow banking its lending jumped to cny1 17 trillion from contracting in february china s trade surplus surged to 32 65 bln in march it averaged nearly 33 7 bln last year month to month swings can be notoriously volatile after the lunar new year the q1 trade surplus stood at 76 5 bln compared with nearly 45 bln in q1 18 exports jumped 14 2 from a year ago after a 20 8 drop in february imports continued to fall the 7 6 year over year pace in march follows a 5 2 contraction in february in australia the economy has conflicting impulses the labor market remains strong but housing s weak the central bank is neutral but the market continues to anticipate that a rate cut late this year news today that the largest lender in australia is considering cutting 10k jobs and closing as many as 300 branches may be the shock to the labor market that pushes the rba out of its neutral stance it appears that the ois curve is discounting about an 80 chance of a cut this year compared with a little more than a 15 chance at the start of the year the dollar is building on yesterday s gains against the and is testing the jpy112 00 area in the european morning there is an option there for 1 1 bln that expires today the year s high was set a month ago near jpy112 15 this is the third consecutive week that the dollar has risen against the yen we remain bullish the dollar against the yen and target jpy114 00 in the coming weeks it is the third consecutive week that the australian dollar has gained against the greenback it was turned back from the 0 7170 area in the last two sessions but found new bids near 0 7120 it is currently straddling the 0 7150 level where an a 600 mln option expires today the appreciated by 0 14 against the dollar in the mainland session earlier today it does not sound likely much but it is the biggest move of the week for six weeks now it has been alternating between small gains and declines and net net is fractionally changed over this period europe the has jumped up in early asia and follow through gains in europe have pushed it above 1 13 for the first time since march 26 some reports linked the euro demand in asia to a japanese bank s purchase of the aviation finance arm of a german bank it apparently helped trigger a short squeeze of the euro where as we have noted speculators have their largest net and gross short position in the futures market since late 2016 sentiment in europe judging from the pmis is weaker than the hard data february industrial output in the eurozone fell 0 2 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 0 5 decline the january series was revised to show a 1 9 increase rather than 1 4 from a year ago it is 0 3 lower this is the smallest year over year decline since last october the flash april pmi will be reported toward the end of next week in march the french manufacturing and services were both below the 50 boom bust level as was german manufacturing even though we suspect the worst is past for the eurozone on this soft patch many headwinds still threaten a robust recovery the ecb is committed to a new long term loan facility there is a debate over the terms of the new loans some suggest that it ought to be conducted closer to the deposit rate minus 40 bp rather than the repo rate zero the other element that is being debated is whether some measures need to be taken to help mitigate the impact of negative rates for longer this usually takes the form of tiering often seen as exempting some deposits at the central bank from the negative rate or subjecting some deposits to a less negative rate we conceive of it within the context of a segmented market banks in the periphery are the largest users of the tltro facility banks in the north have the surplus of reserves and hence more exposed to the negative yields it seemed that uk prime minister may s overture to labour had stalled however now may appears to be renewing her willingness to consider a customs union type of arrangement she will alienate her own party where some have already tried to dump her but this seems like a path forward this is where to look though for a deal over the next month which would allow the uk to avoid participating in the late may eu parliament election the euro has firmed to test a retracement objective 38 2 of the decline since the march fomc meeting that is found near 1 1315 above there the next target is closer to 1 1350 the euro bears may make another stand and if they can push it back below 1 13 on a closing basis they may feel more confident next week there is a 1 1 bln euro option struck at 1 13 that expires today we anticipated this upside correction in the euro and recognize that there could be follow through early next week but our longer term bearish outlook remains intact sterling is flat it remains within the range seen tuesday against the dollar 1 3030 1 3120 america the economic calendar is light the us reports import export prices and the university of michigan s to the extent that there is a focus it is on the bank earnings that will be reported today and the uber nyse ipo announcement the us 10 year yield has moved back above 2 50 and is at its highest level in three days it is up about three basis points this week the two year yield is up a little more but remains below the effective average fed funds rates 2 41 meanwhile the price of wti is set to post its sixth consecutive week of advances the may contract is up 2 this week and continues to knock on the 65 level our technical target since the end of january is near 67 similarly the s p 500 is pushing at 2900 it has fallen only once since march 27 however coming into today s session it is slightly lower on the week last week after the employment data it closed at almost 2893 the us dollar chopped between cad1 33 and cad1 34 this week it is trading with a weaker bias today but there is a large 1 3 bln option at cad1 33 that expires today the two year rate differential edged a few basis points in the us favor this week the greenback is about 0 4 lower against the this week cad1 3330 but has lost 1 5 against the the attractive yield and risk on sentiment have buoyed the peso which is trading near the best levels of the year the dollar has risen against the peso in only one session this week and one session last week which illustrates the persistence of the peso buying a break of mxn18 70 would target mxn18 50

sun mining s average gold production of 196 000 ounces and 49 4 million pounds of copper each year over a 19 year lifetime this implies that rovina and consequently euro sun mining should be valued at no less than 3 billion to put a finer point on things that would make rovina worth 180x more than its current value the sizeable valuation disparity can almost entirely be chalked up to the constant comparisons with gabriel resources and ro ia montana yet to associate euro sun mining with gabriel resources is unequivocally incorrect and absolutely misses the point none of the many issues that have plagued gabriel resources apply to euro sun mining the company s clean technologies have a much smaller environmental footprint something that has endeared it to the government as evidenced by the mining license ratification process euro sun mining is well in the process of getting all the necessary permits while gabriel resources is basically doomed it s important for investors to bear in mind that the company will re rate materially higher when the mining license ratification is complete 2 the gold rally source cnn money since 2011 gold traders have endured a torrid period amid one of the longest economic expansions in history low levels of financial market stress asset purchases by global banks on a massive scale and extreme bullishness in equity markets led to a cooling off for gold stocks but now the exact opposite is beginning to happen we ve just witnessed a shift from extreme optimism to deep pessimism trade wars brexit bloody political upheaval in venezuela and countless other global events have caused tectonic cracks in the global economy the u s is not immune either growth was only 2 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 4 percent in the previous quarter suddenly the fed has changed its tune canceling interest rate hikes and expressing concern about slowing growth in china the situation is even worse the economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and china s biggest trading partner the european union has just cut its near term growth projections by an astounding 40 percent the eu economy is expected to grow at only 1 3 percent everywhere you look signs that a global recession looms large abound with the imf recently cutting its 2019 outlook that is exactly the kind of backdrop that favors safe haven investing gold is considered the ultimate fear hedge that outperforms other asset classes during times of economic stress and gold charts are a clear testament to this fact undervalued junior mining stocks like euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff offer the best chance for solid returns as investors turn to gold to hedge their bets especially when they re suddenly sitting on one of the most alluring gold mines in the world keep this in mind there is an explosive upside to gold stocks when gold starts climbing even modestly that s what happened in 2016 when gold prices jumped 26 in only 6 months leading to outsized returns for miners endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months iamgold gained 256 even the juniors skyrocketed argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 increase in gold production even a 1 move in gold can send junior miners soaring 10 or more with analysts already putting a price target of 80 higher on euro sun imagine what even a small jump in gold prices could do 3 world class gold mine euro sun mining is developing a world class gold and copper mine that would put much bigger companies to shame the company now has 100 percent ownership for roughly 400 million tons of ore in three discreet bodies consisting of about 7 1 million ounces of gold and a billion and a half pounds of copper working out to about 10 1 million ounces of gold equivalent at a current gold price of 1320 per ounce that s more than 13 3 billion in potential revenue and that for a company that s currently valued at 30 million and it gets even better extraction costs at the rovina valley project are much lower than that of neighboring mining districts the rovina valley mine is frequently compared to timok a legendary mining district in serbia yet it is much bigger and provides superior mining economics rovina valley not only contains much more extensive gold and copper reserves they are also cheaper to mine in november the country s national agency for mineral resources namr officially endorsed the project and initiated the ratification process for the mining license this is a short process that can be completed in a few months the license de risks this play which is already fully licensed by the romanian government that s why a 40 million market cap company is starting to look a lot like a 3 billion company and analysts seem to agree the rovina valley project rvp is located in prime mining estate the plant location is about 3km away from a small town of 13 000 people the town was home to a large mine for 80 years and has a well developed infrastructure network of rail power water they literally have it all 4 the clincher clean technology combined with high productivity all other natural resource sectors have had to move forward with revolutionary new technology to enhance recovery and to spare the environment gold is no different and euro sun is proving that in the ancient tunnels of romania not only is it safe and environmentally friendly but it s also a boon to gold recovery euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff has put a lot of money into its research labs it s tried dozens of different chemicals and processes and now it s discovered the secret that makes those types of yields possible the company is now able to extract 20 percent extra gold at zero extra cost the process is dry stacking which virtually eliminates contamination though seepage of groundwater when gold is separated from the hard rock gold recovery was formerly 68 percent now it s 82 percent the concentrate was 9 or 10 percent previously and now its 22 percent with about 100 grams of gold in other words the kind of grades that smelters would kill for that makes the term undervaluation itself undervalued 5 first government backed private entity euro sun mining is the only government endorsed private mining firm operating in romania thanks to its dedication to using clean mining technologies the company has already embarked on an environmental and social impact assessment esia and continue its work on a feasibility study on the rovina valley project romania has an incredibly rich mining culture which means that the government is keen to get everything restarted but it s got to be clean euro sun mining is devoted to using the latest technology with no environmental risks and that speaks to esg which is all about environmentally and socially responsible investments euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff has officially become the first non state owned mining project with the full endorsement of the romanian government euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff represents a highly asymmetrical risk reward with little downside but very high upside the shares shot up 50 percent when the company received a ratified mining license by the romanian government in november and now it s hoping to get production underway within 12 to 18 months for the first non state owned company to be issues a mining permit since 2003 and the first company to be able to cleanly cut the vampires out of this transylvanian

exposure to gold letting investors take advantage of long term price movements though the company joins a long list of gold majors that reported losses in 2018 but its cash flow deficit is largely attributed to its growth in production and new projects coming online yamana gold tsx yri yamana has recently completed its cerro moro project in argentina giving its investors something major to look

week beginning 15 april 2019 the aud the rba the fomc and commodities australia westpac mi leading index employment rba minutes good friday nz cpi china gdp retail sales industrial production fixed asset investment europe trade balance zew survey us retail sales industrial production flash pmi s for japan the euro area and the us key economic financial forecasts information contained in this report current as at 12 april 2019 the aud the rba the fomc and commodities the australian dollar has held within a narrow range of usd0 704 to usd0 716 over the month key commodity prices particularly iron ore have been stable over the month with spot at around us 90 t general expectations have been for this price to adjust downwards for example the government s forecast for the iron ore price fob by march 2020 is us 55 t westpac expects us 74 t spot supporting the iron ore price has been ongoing reports from vale of likely decommissioning of supply following the collapse of the tailings dam in brumadinho general expectation is that vale will decommission around 40t of production lowering overall annual production from 400mt to 360mt however markets are expecting even larger production cuts to eventuate another major producer rio tinto has also recently been impacted by a supply shock on the demand side confidence is rising in response to china s commitment to stabilising growth through lifting credit easing restrictions on the shadow banking sector supporting bond issues by local governments to finance new infrastructure investment tax cuts and some support to housing in selective regions this stability at high levels for key commodity prices is providing solid support to the australian dollar indeed the fair value of the aud as measured by commodity prices is currently holding well in excess of current spot on the other hand interest rate differentials continue to weigh on the aud when on february 21 westpac moved to forecast the rba would cut the cash rate by 25bps in august and november this year markets were not anticipating a cut until april next year that pricing has now moved forward to august september with 75 of a second cut priced by mid next year pricing cob wednesday however in a q a follow up to a speech on wednesday to the american chamber of commerce in australia deputy governor debelle is reported to have noted our expectation is that we will see decent growth in the economy so we won t have to get to that point a test of that assertion will be when the rba releases its revised growth inflation and employment forecasts in the may statement on monetary policy on 10 may currently the rba is forecasting gdp growth of 3 in 2019 and 2 75 in 2020 the lower growth rate in 2020 is largely explained by a reduced contribution from resource exports particularly lng those forecasts were released for the february statement on monetary policy when the rba was forecasting growth of 2 75 for 2018 subsequently growth printed at 2 3 for 2018 it would be very surprising if the rba did not lower its growth forecasts at the time of the may update westpac expects growth of 2 2 in both 2019 and 2020 with our view on the economy we would expect rba forecasts of 2 5 and 2 25 respectively given dr debelle s remarks it is more likely that the rba will choose 2 75 and 2 5 but even those forecasts point to below potential growth in 2020 by may the 2020 forecast is the most important one from a policy perspective given monetary policy acts with a lag the expected trigger for the rate cut would be a further downward revision in the growth forecasts at the august statement on monetary policy to possibly 2 5 2019 and 2 25 2020 any central bank forecasting below potential growth should adopt an easing bias the recent change in the governor s statement following the april board meeting at least shifted the dial to a more flexible approach to policy rather than the sentiment which this governor had maintained since his first statement back in october 2016 despite the firming of the probabilities of a rate cut the aud has remained quite stable that probably reflects the commodity environment and the limits to the forward expectations of currency markets the outlook for us interest rates is also important in march markets had been pricing in a 70 probability of a rate cut from the fomc by year s end that pricing has now moved back to a more reasonable 45 although pricing is around 80 for two cuts by september 2020 westpac has revised its outlook for the federal funds rate we no longer expect a late cycle rate hike at the december meeting of the fomc my visit to the us in february gave me little confidence that the fomc was likely to see the need to raise rates again in this cycle tailwinds in 2018 including those from global growth fiscal policy and financial conditions have turned into headwinds in 2019 confidence around the stickiness of the core pce inflation measure was also clear indeed there was a general view that the fomc needed to be seen to be symmetric around the 2 target for core pce inflation a period in which it ran above 2 would be welcomed in confirming that symmetric policy stance my concern has always been with the likely persistent lift in growth in hourly earnings up from a 2 5 to a 3 2 annual growth rate over the last year as the labour market remains buoyant however there was a view that statistical research had failed to find a link between wages growth and core pce inflation the concept of neutral rates had also been adapted there was no longer a sense of long term short term neutral policy depended on potential growth around 2 and core pce inflation around 2 westpac s and the fomc s forecast for gdp growth in 2019 is around 2 providing further comfort that rates could stay at current levels since they are now at neutral equally we do not subscribe to the view that rates will be cut by the fomc over the 2019 and 2020 time horizon with lower mortgage rates solid income growth some expected upward pressure on inflation and fiscal policy likely to be supportive especially in the election year of 2020 a steady rate profile seems most likely with markets expecting rate cuts in the us and under pricing rate cuts in australia some further downward pressure on the aud can be expected from the current usd0 715 but with an improving commodity price outlook we have not moved our target of usd0 68 for aud over the course of 2019 despite the flatter profile for the federal funds rate the week that was the federal election campaign officially kicked off in australia this week shortly after the westpac mi consumer sentiment indicated the budget was well received overseas central banks reiterated a cautious tone while the brexit deadline was extended again wednesday s westpac mi consumer sentiment survey was eagerly anticipated after last week s release of the 2019 20 federal budget which included a further 19 5bn in income tax relief while the month to month rise in sentiment was fairly muted at 100 7 compared to 98 8 in march sentiment clearly caught an uplift from the budget indeed among those surveyed postbudget sentiment was 7 7 higher than those surveyed prebudget the most positive turnaround since we began tracking pre and post budget responses in 2011 yet it is important to take a step back from the near term lift in overall sentiment persistent weak wages growth falling house prices and the perceived rising cost of living are all still weighing on consumers this is reflected in the survey component family finances compared to a year ago which declined 4 9 in april showing little movement between pre and post budget responses and is down 9 6 on a year ago in that respect disappointing consumption growth was a key theme in rba deputy governor debelle s speech on the state of the economy ultimately unexpectedly weak consumption had been the main surprise in recent growth outturns with other parts of gdp evolving broadly as expected here debelle related some part of the slowdown to declines in housing prices but was sceptical of a direct wealth effect instead he believes lower housing turnover is the main factor as consumers spend less on household furnishings as well as vehicles with more supply coming on to the melbourne and sydney housing markets this year debelle sees further weight on prices while some comfort can be found in the stable read in feb housing finance on tuesday today s release of the biannual financial stability review is still likely to emphasise that the rba is cautious and watching housing however of greater concern to debelle in regards to the consumption outlook is low household income growth and the consumer s increasing expectation that it is likely to remain low the rba remain of the view that household income is likely to pick up over the next few years but this is conditioned on strength in the labour market persisting indeed the key takeout from debelle s speech is that the rba are still assessing conflicting signals provided by the labour market the gdp data and the business surveys see page 2 for further detail turning to offshore matters the major thematic this week relates to central banks remaining in a cautious watch and wait mode which coincides with the imf downgrading their 2019 growth forecast to 3 3 from 3 5 in the us the fomc minutes largely reflected communication from committee members over the past month while some members noted it could be appropriate to raise rates in 2019 and several noted their view on rates could move up or down and were not on a pre set course a majority see rates on hold this year as per the dot plot further emphasising the capacity for the fomc to maintain their patient approach was the release of mar cpi that same morning headline inflation overshot expectations but the core indicator underwhelmed with annual core cpi inflation declining to 2 0 from 2 1 a lack of inflationary pressure means the fomc can maintain a steady hand while the outcomes of various global uncertainties unfold across the atlantic the april ecb meeting confirmed the policy stance after the dovish shift in march new information has been consistent with slower growth momentum extending into the current year and while idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are fading global headwinds continue to weigh accordingly the ecb continues to believe risks are tilted to the downside discussion on the pricing of new tltro was scarce an announcement to be made in forthcoming meetings but the ecb did note in april that they are analysing possible side effects of negative interest rates on the back of the recent discussion on the ecb potentially moving to a tiered deposit rate the analysis is still in its early stages and we do not expect a change to tiering any time soon but if anything the opening of the debate underscores the ecb s awareness of rates likely being low for longer in a general sense to the uk the outcome of this week s eu summit is that the brexit deadline has been extended to 31 october with the option to leave sooner if the uk parliament can agree on a path forward this is longer than the 30 june delay uk pm may had hoped for and will mean the uk will have to take part in european parliament elections on 23 may if they have not found an agreement by then chart of the week xt our april market outlook was released this week and contains a comprehensive update on the westpac view while global and local growth prospects are unchanged since our march report we have made several key changes to our market outlook this month on official rates the fomc is no longer expected to deliver one last late cycle rate hike and the rbnz now looks poised to make a 25bp cut in may australia s commodity prices are expected to hold up better than previously expected leaving our forecast for the aud unchanged despite the revised federal funds rate profile new zealand week ahead data wrap close call the outlook for monetary policy is delicately poised following the reserve bank s change of tone in its march ocr review we shifted our call to a rate cut as early as the may monetary policy statement but we emphasised that this was subject to upcoming data and developments we expect next week s inflation print to be subdued but we re sensitive to any surprises meanwhile a trifecta of soft data releases this week will add to the rbnz s concerns about whether the local economy has the momentum needed to generate a sustained lift in inflation the rbnz governor s comments in a media interview this week were in line with our initial read of the march ocr review governor orr noted that the march statement was meant to reflect that the balance of risks has shifted to the downside but he emphasised that the decision in may is by no means settled on balance we still think that the odds are in favour of a rate cut in may the rbnz has highlighted concerns about the slowing global economy in particular a point that was underscored this week when the imf further downgraded its world growth forecasts we re more optimistic on global growth than the market appears to be but we don t think that gloomy sentiment will dissipate within the space of a few weeks in terms of local developments the march quarter cpi release next week presents the most immediate risk to our view we re expecting a subdued 0 2 increase for the quarter which would take annual inflation down from 1 9 to 1 6 the expected slowdown is entirely due to fuel prices petrol prices fell sharply at the end of 2018 and though they ve started to tick up again recently the average level over the quarter was down by more than 6 compared to a year ago petrol prices are close to flat which in turn will act as a drag on the overall inflation rate we expect that core inflation excluding food and fuel will hold steady at 1 7 similarly we estimate that the rbnz s sectoral factor model of core inflation will remain at 1 7 that would keep these measures firmly within the rbnz s target range of 1 3 albeit on the lower side of the midpoint our cpi forecast is in line with what the rbnz forecast in its february monetary policy statement if it turns out as expected or lower it s likely that inflation will remain below 2 for the remainder of this year as well that in itself wouldn t warrant an ocr cut but it wouldn t stand in the way of one either however if annual inflation prints at 1 8 or higher next week a may ocr cut would become more difficult to envisage in the outlook for inflation there is a tension between gradually increasing domestic price pressures and persistent softness in tradables prices outside of the occasional surge in oil prices the latter has been a global phenomenon and probably reflects a combination of the modest cyclical upturn since the global financial crisis and new technology that has helped to liberate consumers compared to the past in contrast non tradables inflation has been gradually picking up we expect it to rise to 2 9 in march compared to 2 3 a year ago we and the rbnz had been anticipating such a move as the economy has moved closer to full capacity but given the ongoing softness in tradables prices that s still somewhat short of what would consistent with a sustained return to 2 overall inflation a further pickup in non tradables inflation will depend on the strength of the economy growth slowed in the second half of 2018 and so far the march quarter of this year is shaping up as equally subdued we still expect a pickup in growth over the rest of this year supported by rising government spending a strong pipeline of building work and rising household incomes but there are clearly risks to the downside on that note there was a trio of activity indicators this week that were distinctly on the soft side house sales fell further in march and were down 13 on a year ago turnover was already dropping earlier this year but back then the weakness was concentrated in auckland in march it seems that there was a sharp drop in turnover in almost every region a decline in market turnover along with a rising inventory of unsold properties in auckland and waikato is a reliable signal of price weakness ahead concerns about changes to the tax treatment of property and reduced foreign buyer activity are likely to be weighing on the housing market in the near term we expect the recent sharp falls in mortgage rates to give some support to house prices but tax changes are likely to win out in the long run electronic card spending in retail stores fell 0 3 in march which was weaker than we expected annual spending growth has also taken a step down over the past year slowing to just 0 7 this slowdown is consistent with the recent easing in consumer confidence as well as the cooling in the housing market spending on durables which includes home furnishings was particularly soft in march finally the manufacturing pmi fell to an eight month low of 51 9 in march the pmi is a useful leading indicator of gdp and while it remains at a level consistent with expansion it has clearly taken a step lower in the last year data previews aus mar westpac mi leading index apr 17 last 0 56 the six month annualised growth rate in the westpac melbourne institute leading index which indicates the likely pace of economic activity relative to trend three to nine months into the future fell from 0 37 in january to 0 56 in february despite choppy reads in recent months the signal is consistent with weak momentum in the second half of 2018 carrying into 2019 the march read is likely to be more positive with several components recording strong rises this month including the westpac mi consumer expectations index up 5 4 vs 6 1 last month and dwelling approvals up 19 1 vs 2 3 last month other components have been more mixed but have mostly seen modest improvements aus mar labour force survey employment 000 apr 18 last 4 6k wbc f c 8k mkt f c 15k range 8k to 33k employment lifted 4 6k in feb less than market expectations median 15k for a three month average gain of 21 1k per month through 2018 employment grew 274 5k 2 2 yr with solid momentum into year end with a six month annualised pace of 2 3 yr in the year to feb employment grew 284k 2 3 yr but the six month annualised pace moderated from 2 9 yr in jan to 2 3 yr leading indicators have softened annual growth in job ads is now down through the year but this reflects the structural shift to other recruitment methods rather than falling employment opportunities abs job vacancies growth has slowed from 24 yr in 2018 to 10 yr in 2019 and our own westpac jobs index suggest firms may be less confident on lifting employment but it remains consistent with growth around 2 3 yr our forecast 8k gain in employment holds the annual pace at 2 3 yr aus mar labour force survey unemployment apr 18 last 4 9 wbc f c 5 1 mkt f c 5 0 range 4 8 to 5 1 despite the soft print on employment in feb the unemployment rate fell to 4 9 market median was 5 0 as a 0 1ppt decline in the participation rate to 65 6 resulted in a 7 1k decline in the labour force at this stage it appears that both male and female participation is levelling out in a trend sense and we are closely watching where they go next we do expect both to edge lower though 2019 as employment growth stalls but not by enough to prevent a rise in unemployment holding the participation rate flat at 65 6 generates a 31k rise in the labour force and given our forecast for a soft 8k rise in employment this should see the unemployment rate lift to 5 1 nz q1 cpi apr 17 last 0 1 westpac f c 0 2 mkt f c 0 3 we expect a 0 2 rise in the consumer price index in the march quarter that would see annual inflation slow from 1 9 to 1 6 such a result would be in line with the rbnz s forecasts from february the sharp drop in fuel prices at the end of last year is entirely responsible for the slowdown in inflation we expect the various core inflation measures to hold steady at close to but just below the 2 midpoint of the reserve bank s target range the cpi release will be crucial ahead of the reserve bank s next monetary policy statement a result in line with or below expectations would support our forecast of an ocr cut in may however a substantial upside surprise would make a may ocr cut a more marginal prospect china q1 gdp apr 17 last 6 4 wbc 6 4 china gdp decelerated slowly through 2018 from 6 8 yr at march to 6 4 yr at december this trend decline was the consequence of softening global momentum and authorities hard line on the quality of investment in both the public and private sector with the economy s focus on quality now set authorities have materially increased liquidity with flow on benefits for the cost of credit a quick acceleration in growth is however not anticipated in 2019 the reason being that while investment will accelerate through the year the contribution from consumption is expected to throttle back in 2018 employment growth slowed based on the pmi detail and this will weigh on consumption hence for 2019 overall we look for a 6 1 year average gain
gold isn t just back central banks are on a buying spree like it s wwii and the biggest names in mining say we re running out of physical gold china and russia are staking enormously on the precious yellow metal by the end of 2018 central banks had bought up 74 more gold than the year before and they re still going strong russia is hedging against the dollar heavily china too the world gold council says it hasn t seen anything like this since 1967 it s a combination of global events that could send gold prices soaring abruptly all the biggest names in gold agree one thing we re running out of physical gold ian telfer ceo of goldcorp the biggest mining company in the world says we re right at peak gold franco nevada chairman pierre lassonde says the coming years will see a significant dip in gold production and seabridge gold chairman rudy frink says gold reserves are shrinking noticeably these fears are real discoveries in the past decade have paled in comparison to earlier times when a little known company suddenly manages to do the impossible and secure a license for one of the biggest gold and copper mines in the world the finance world sits up and takes note now watch what s happening in romania one of the richest gold venues in europe romania s historical ro ia montana mine is the stuff of lore and legend not just because it s in the land of dracula but because it s home to legendary gold and copper resources that the government hasn t let anyone touch until now as one little known company just became the first non state owned entity to receive a ratified mining license to get at what could become one of the biggest gold discoveries of the century the little known company is a mining tech genius called euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff and it s done what no one else could do using cutting edge exploration and production techniques such as drone surveying and 3d geo mapping the company is aiming to dig up some 13 billion in gold and copper reserves and this year the massive resources near the ro ia montana mines could be resurrected at exactly the same time that the world is running out of gold and as gold is staging its biggest comeback ever welcome to the world class rovina valley copper gold project now fully owned by a company that analysts say could be worth 180x its current value where investors are zeroing in on a clean tech shale style revolution for gold this is gold 2 0 and it s all about clean tech zero cyanide and getting more gold for every exploration buck euro sun isn t only sitting on massive acreage in one of europe s most pre eminent venues but it s also right next door to another hugely profitable mining estate in europe and better yet we re already running out of gold here are 5 reasons to look at euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff right now 1 ridiculously undervalued stock euro sun mining currently has a market cap of 40 million a ridiculously low valuation for a company that just made an unprecedented jump in europe s second largest gold mine and one of the biggest in the world compare it to timok a very similar asset located in neighboring serbia that recently sold for 1 4 billion euro sun mining s rovina valley project contains significantly more gold and copper resources than timok and is located just four hours away by car indeed rovina valley contains 40 percent more reserves than timok and features 36 percent lower capex it s interesting to note that a chinese firm recently bid 1 4 billion for timok that would make rovina worth 90x more rovina s low aisc all in sustaining costs of 752 an ounce leaves a healthy profit margin of 550 an ounce at current gold prices and a 60 70 million free cash flow every year a preliminary economic assessment estimated euro sun mining s average gold production of 196 000 ounces and 49 4 million pounds of copper each year over a 19 year lifetime this implies that rovina and consequently euro sun mining should be valued at no less than 3 billion to put a finer point on things that would make rovina worth 180x more than its current value the sizeable valuation disparity can almost entirely be chalked up to the constant comparisons with gabriel resources and ro ia montana yet to associate euro sun mining with gabriel resources is unequivocally incorrect and absolutely misses the point none of the many issues that have plagued gabriel resources apply to euro sun mining the company s clean technologies have a much smaller environmental footprint something that has endeared it to the government as evidenced by the mining license ratification process euro sun mining is well in the process of getting all the necessary permits while gabriel resources is basically doomed it s important for investors to bear in mind that the company will re rate materially higher when the mining license ratification is complete 2 the gold rally source cnn money since 2011 gold traders have endured a torrid period amid one of the longest economic expansions in history low levels of financial market stress asset purchases by global banks on a massive scale and extreme bullishness in equity markets led to a cooling off for gold stocks but now the exact opposite is beginning to happen we ve just witnessed a shift from extreme optimism to deep pessimism trade wars brexit bloody political upheaval in venezuela and countless other global events have caused tectonic cracks in the global economy the u s is not immune either growth was only 2 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 4 percent in the previous quarter suddenly the fed has changed its tune canceling interest rate hikes and expressing concern about slowing growth in china the situation is even worse the economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and china s biggest trading partner the european union has just cut its near term growth projections by an astounding 40 percent the eu economy is expected to grow at only 1 3 percent everywhere you look signs that a global recession looms large abound with the imf recently cutting its 2019 outlook that is exactly the kind of backdrop that favors safe haven investing gold is considered the ultimate fear hedge that outperforms other asset classes during times of economic stress and gold charts are a clear testament to this fact undervalued junior mining stocks like euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff offer the best chance for solid returns as investors turn to gold to hedge their bets especially when they re suddenly sitting on one of the most alluring gold mines in the world keep this in mind there is an explosive upside to gold stocks when gold starts climbing even modestly that s what happened in 2016 when gold prices jumped 26 in only 6 months leading to outsized returns for miners endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months iamgold gained 256 even the juniors skyrocketed argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 increase in gold production even a 1 move in gold can send junior miners soaring 10 or more with analysts already putting a price target of 80 higher on euro sun imagine what even a small jump in gold prices could do 3 world class gold mine euro sun mining is developing a world class gold and copper mine that would put much bigger companies to shame the company now has 100 percent ownership for roughly 400 million tons of ore in three discreet bodies consisting of about 7 1 million ounces of gold and a billion and a half pounds of copper working out to about 10 1 million ounces of gold equivalent at a current gold price of 1320 per ounce that s more than 13 3 billion in potential revenue and that for a company that s currently valued at 30 million and it gets even better extraction costs at the rovina valley project are much lower than that of neighboring mining districts the rovina valley mine is frequently compared to timok a legendary mining district in serbia yet it is much bigger and provides superior mining economics rovina valley not only contains much more extensive gold and copper reserves they are also cheaper to mine in november the country s national agency for mineral resources namr officially endorsed the project and initiated the ratification process for the mining license this is a short process that can be completed in a few months the license de risks this play which is already fully licensed by the romanian government that s why a 40 million market cap company is starting to look a lot like a 3 billion company and analysts seem to agree the rovina valley project rvp is located in prime mining estate the plant location is about 3km away from a small town of 13 000 people the town was home to a large mine for 80 years and has a well developed infrastructure network of rail power water they literally have it all 4 the clincher clean technology combined with high productivity all other natural resource sectors have had to move forward with revolutionary new technology to enhance recovery and to spare the environment gold is no different and euro sun is proving that in the ancient tunnels of romania not only is it safe and environmentally friendly but it s also a boon to gold recovery euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff has put a lot of money into its research labs it s tried dozens of different chemicals and processes and now it s discovered the secret that makes those types of yields possible the company is now able to extract 20 percent extra gold at zero extra cost the process is dry stacking which virtually eliminates contamination though seepage of groundwater when gold is separated from the hard rock gold recovery was formerly 68 percent now it s 82 percent the concentrate was 9 or 10 percent previously and now its 22 percent with about 100 grams of gold in other words the kind of grades that smelters would kill for that makes the term undervaluation itself undervalued 5 first government backed private entity euro sun mining is the only government endorsed private mining firm operating in romania thanks to its dedication to using clean mining technologies the company has already embarked on an environmental and social impact assessment esia and continue its work on a feasibility study on the rovina valley project romania has an incredibly rich mining culture which means that the government is keen to get everything restarted but it s got to be clean euro sun mining is devoted to using the latest technology with no environmental risks and that speaks to esg which is all about environmentally and socially responsible investments euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff has officially become the first non state owned mining project with the full endorsement of the romanian government euro sun mining tsx esm otcpk cpnff represents a highly asymmetrical risk reward with little downside but very high upside the shares shot up 50 percent when the company received a ratified mining license by the romanian government in november and now it s hoping to get production underway within 12 to 18 months for the first non state owned company to be issues a mining permit since 2003 and the first company to be able to cleanly cut the vampires out of this transylvanian gold this is a discovery on multiple levels it s got serious legs that are running at breakneck speed here are 5 more companies analysts are watching as precious metals gain speed first majestic silver tsx fr there s a lot of bullishness around this stock with earnings growth expected to be high over the next 3 5 years the optimism is absolutely justified as this canadian mining company has been operating in mexico for nearly a decade and has over 770 million in assets including 5 of the most promising locations in the country apart from its strong resource base in a proven jurisdiction first majestic silver could see its share price go up significantly in the next 2 years as a majority of world renowned economists are now expecting a recession before the end of 2020 in the short

every year with operations in quebec mexico and finland the company also is taking place in exploration activities in europe latin america and the united states agnico is a company with a lot of exposure to gold letting investors take advantage of long term price movements though the company joins a long list of gold majors that reported losses in 2018 but its cash flow deficit is largely attributed to its growth in production and new projects coming online yamana gold tsx yri yamana has recently completed its cerro moro project in argentina giving its investors something major to look out for the company plans to ramp up its gold production by 20 through 2019 and its silver production by a whopping 200 investors can expect a serious increase in free cash flow if precious metal

life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the

by john kountouris for vt and before you read about how the imf recently approved 4 2 billion in funding to build up ecuador which in the light of the arrest of assange sounds pretty suspicious if you tell me consider first the following about julian assange which cannot be ignored wikileaks is a rothschild operation rothschilds use wikileaks to wound rival bank julian assange s bail posted by rothschilds sister in law many other links after being made famous julian assange s first task is to wound a rival bank of the rothschild bank in switzerland the rival is bank julius baer the top swiss bank for centuries the competing rothschild bank ag opened in switzerland in 1968 on january 17 2011 assange held a press conference at the frontline club where rudolf elmer a former employee of bank julius baer gave assange private files from the bank s cayman islands operation elmer said he wanted to expose mass tax evasion before he flies back to switzerland to stand trial for stealing information from a bank although elmer has not named the tax evaders he claims the cd files contain information about 40 politicians many business people multinational conglomerates and people who have made their living in the arts rothschilds swiss bank battles assange s press conference was actually a public threat to bank julius baer wikileaks first disclosed some of elmer s julius baer material in 2008 naming ten clients at the time julius baer sued and got a court injunction to effectively shut down wikileaks org at its web host in california subsequently the law firm fox rothschild represented wikileaks got the injunction overturned and got wikileaks org back on line immediately wl commenced leaking more of elmer s documents which was damaging to bank julius baer bank jb got a lot of negative publicity from its attempt to censor the internet when jb lost the suit their super elite clients became fearful of being exposed and prosecuted for tax evasion and money laundering julius baer shares dropped 60 during the next ten months on dec 4 2008 the 52 year old ceo of julius baer alex widmer was unexpectedly found dead he was the most important person in private banking said a zurich based trader this is a setback for the bank julius baer a swiss trading analyst said reports of the cause of death were contradictory and vague and an autopsy was never released wikileaks julian assange filmed a video for the economist a rothschild publication which gave him its new media award wikileaks many other links to rothschilds the recent imprisonment of wikileaks julian assange strains credulity his arrest by interpol his incarceration under draconian conditions for breaking a condom are in themselves highly unlikely events but the timing of his imprisonment with the release of classified us cables and the campaign against wikileaks funding and website host bear the trademarks of a covert operation the puppetworld post has uncovered many links between wikileaks and the international rothschild network a sister in law and second cousin of the rothschilds posted bail for julian assange puppetworld post exclusive the economist a rothschild magazine gave assange its new media award in 2008 wikileaks used the law firm fox rothschild to overturn a judge s ruling to order a web host to shut down the wikileaks site the guardian and the new york times two of assange s media partners are linked to the rothschilds pwp exclusive the owner of the mansion where assange was eventually put under house arrest has links to rothschilds assange s lawyer is also rothschilds lawyer us senator joe lieberman who was ultimately responsible for making assange the largest media personality of the decade is a member of the council on foreign relations a rothschild organization socialite heiress jemima khan nee goldsmith posted 20 000 pounds 32 000 for the bail of wikileaks leader julian assange she s genetically related to the rothschilds and she is a sister in law daily mail online 10 may 2010 her father the late james goldsmith british banker publisher is a cousin to the rothschilds james grandfather adolphe goldschmidt came to london as a multi millionaire in 1895 and changed the family name from the german goldschmidt to the english goldsmith the goldschmidts like their neighbors and relatives the rothschilds had been prosperous merchant bankers in frankfurt germany since the 16th century wikipedia following the rothschild s centuries old edict to interbreed jemima khan s brother ben wed kate rothschild in 2003 and recently her other brother zac a new mp in british parliament had been having an affair with his brother s sister in law alice rothschild kate s sister up until he divorced his wife four days after he was elected mp zac and alice are presently living together khan s brothers are marrying into rothschild wealth the rothschilds began grooming julian assange in 2008 when wikileaks was awarded the economist s new media award the economist is the voice of britain s establishment led by the british rothschilds which has for example on balance supported britain s involvement in the iraq war sir evelyn robert adrian de rothschild was chairman of the economist from 1972 to 1989 his wife lynn forester de rothschild currently sits on the economist s board the rothschild family also has a large shareholder interest in the economist at first blush it is incredulous that the the economist the pinnacle of the establishment would give their award to assange knowing full well that he was releasing classified government documents and being overly aware of the havoc this will create in the world the rothschilds oft stated goal over the centuries is for a one world government i e the new world order to this end they engineer conflict between nations to create crises that will then be utilized to increase the power of international entities the un world bank imf etc for example they and other closely related families like the schiffs financed the bolsheviks in the past the rothschild empire have profited by bankrolling both sides of war us senator joe lieberman is the rothschild s point man in america during the last presidential election he took his friend republican candidate john mccain to jacob rothschild s house for a fund raiser for mccain lieberman is a member of the council on foreign relations a rothschild cabal which is essentially the shadow government of the us lieberman s recent actions resulted in cutting off the money supply of wikileaks paypal mastercard visa stopped accepting donations for wikileaks lieberman publicly took credit for censoring wikileaks website by pressuring amazon to stop hosting the website the result was that anonymous hactivists launched attacks on the websites of companies above which had discontinued service to wikileaks lieberman s campaign against wikileaks had the effect of increasing the martyrdom and hence the popularity of assange and wikileaks lieberman made assange a star nearly becoming time magazine s man of the year julian assange s lawyer is mark stephens of finers stephens innocent a major london elite law firm they are the legal adviser to the rothschild s prestigious waddesdon trust assange s main media partner is the guardian the guardian has been infiltrated by rothschilds the guardian is controlled by guardian media group whose chairman is paul myners a past employee of n m rothschild limited sons limited guardian media group is owned by scott trust which became a limited private

sulzberger and grandson of arthur hays sulzberger who served as a trustee for the rockefeller foundation in cahoots with rothschilds for one world government after a time in a real prison assange was imprisoned in a countryside mansion at the home of vaughan smith the owner of frontline trust a news organization that seeks to influence tv journalists frontline is funded by george soros organization open society institute and george soros is intimately intertwined with the rothschilds george soros has been a frequent business partner with james goldsmith father of jemima khan and cousin of the rothschilds the director of soros open society institute richard katz was director of n m rothschild sons for 16 years other board members like nils taube also hold positions in rothschild banks etcetera on october 25 and july 27 this year assange was a speaker at vaughan smith s frontline trust most people seem to believe that current events just happen that events in the news are chain reactions of accidents and that people with money and power sit idly by watching events unfold however the rothschilds thrive on manipulating the markets by having insider information while propagating contrary misinformation in this way they make huge profits assange has already said that damaging information on one us bank will be released in this fragile recovery the crisis could be pivotal the guardian and the new york times have this information so it is available to rothschilds in order to short the bank before the information is released wikileaks is an invaluable tool for the rothschilds to manipulate the financial markets the whole monetary system the future of nations and the public the information or misinformation from wikileaks also serves the rothschild s aim to increase conflict among nations in order to further their goal of one world government source see also the wiki israel leaks this past weekend the whistle blowing website wikileaks released

and sdr 3 035 billion arrangement under the imf s extended fund facility eff for ecuador the board s decision enables the immediate disbursement of us 652 million equivalent to sdr 469 7 million or 67 3 percent of ecuador s quota this arrangement provides support for the ecuadorean government s economic policies over the next three years the ecuadorian authorities plan aims to create a more dynamic sustainable and inclusive economy for the benefit of all ecuadorians it is centered around four major priorities boosting competitiveness and job creation strengthening fiscal sustainability and the institutional foundations of ecuador s dollarization protecting the poor and most vulnerable and improving transparency and bolstering the fight against corruption following the executive board discussion ms christine lagarde managing director and chair summarized the board s findings the ecuadorian authorities are implementing a comprehensive reform program aimed at modernizing the economy and paving the way for strong sustained and equitable growth the authorities measures are geared towards strengthening the fiscal position and improving competitiveness and by so doing help lessen vulnerabilities put dollarization on a stronger footing and over time encourage growth and job creation achieving a robust fiscal position is at the core of the authorities program which will be supported by a three year extended arrangement from the imf the aim is to reduce debt to gdp ratio through a combination of a wage bill realignment a careful and gradual optimization of fuel subsidies a reprioritization of capital and goods and services spending and a tax reform the savings generated by these measures will allow for an increase in social assistance spending over the course of the program the authorities will continue their efforts to strengthen the medium term fiscal policy framework and more rigorous fiscal controls and better public financial management will help to enhance the effectiveness of fiscal policy the authorities are committed to supporting job creation restoring competitiveness and catalyzing private sector led growth while increasing transparency and forcefully countering corruption a more efficient tax system public wage restraint facilitating the hiring process and a more efficient energy sector are important components of the authorities plan in this area building crisis preparedness capabilities and strengthening the oversight of banks and cooperatives will help to strengthen financial sector resilience the institutional foundations of dollarization will be supported by the authorities efforts already underway to increase the operational autonomy of the central bank and to build reserve buffers protecting the poor and most vulnerable segments in society is a key objective of the authorities program in this context the authorities plan to extend the coverage of and increase the nominal level of benefits under the

sometimes we get an opportunity to both take some perspective and also to observe what is considered by some to be cutting edge so let us open with the perspective of the general manager of the bank for international settlements growth cannot depend on monetary policy agustín carstens tells cnbc i am sure that many of you are thinking that it is a bit late like a decade or so to tell us now interestingly if you watch the video he says in reference to the euro area that monetary policy cannot be the only solution for growth this reminds me of the statement by ecb president mario draghi that it qe was responsible for the better euro area growth phrase in 2016 to 17 it also brings me to my first official denial of the day some analysts said a tiered rate would make room for the ecb to cut its deposit rate farther a prospect that one source said was nowhere near being discussed reuters you know what usually happens next asset markets this is an area that central banks have increasing moved into with sovereign and corporate bond buying but in the same reuters article i spotted something that looked rather familiar tltro iii a new series of cheap two year loans aimed at banks was unveiled in march as a tool to help lenders finance themselves particularly in countries such as italy and portugal but policymakers now increasingly see it as a stimulus tool for a weakening economy the sources said with the growth outlook fading faster than feared even hawkish policymakers have given up pricing the loans at the private market rate some are even discussing offering the tltros at minus 0 4 percent which is currently the ecb s deposit rate the sources said that looks rather like the funding for lending scheme which i mentioned yesterday as the way the bank of england fired up the uk housing market from 2012 onwards essentially if you give banks plenty of cheap funding you get a lot of rhetoric about lending to business small ones in particular but the uk experience was that it declined and mortgage lending rose this was because mortgage rates fell quite quickly by around 1 and according to the bank of england the total impact rose as high as 2 thus in my opinion the ecb is considering singing along to the more more more of andrea true connection in relation to this house prices as measured by the house price index rose by 4 2 in both the euro area and the eu in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the same quarter of the previous year this is one area where the ecb has managed to create some inflation and may even think that the lack of growth in italy 0 6 is a sign of its economic malaise although you do not have to know much history to mull the 6 7 in spain and 7 2 in ireland equities regular readers will be aware that the swiss national bank and the bank of japan started buying equities some time ago now there are differences in that the snb is doing so to diversify its foreign exchange reserves which became so large they were influencing the bond markets mostly european they were investing in so it has bought foreign equities of which the most publicly noted it the holding in apple because if you invest passively then the larger the company the larger the holding if we note the apple watch this must provide food for thought for the swiss watchmaking industry japan has taken a different route in two respects in that it buys funds exchange traded funds or etfs rather than individual equities and that it buys japanese ones also it is still regularly buying as it bought 70 500 000 000 yen s worth on tuesday wednesday and thursday this week whereas buying by the snb in future will be more ad hoc should it feel the need to intervene to weaken the swiss franc again now let us move to federal reserve policymaker neel kashkari so an official denial also you may note that he has left some weasel room as he has not rejected the japanese route of indirectly buying them this is common amongst central bankers as they leave themselves an out and if they fear they might need to introduce a policy that will attract criticism they first deny they intend to do it to give the impression they have been somehow forced for a lighter touch qtrresearch translated it into trumpese so that the man who many think is really running the us federal reserve gets the picture kashkari we re not buying stocks who said anything about buying stocks we re definitely not buying stocks we d never buy stocks it was of course only last week that ended with the cio of blackrock suggesting that the ecb should purchase equities and no doubt he had a list ready i suppose it would sort of solve this problem ecb will ask deutsche bank to raise fresh funds for merger source reuters although of course that would not open just one can of worms but a whole cupboard full of them but when faced with a problem the ecb regularly finds itself singing along with donald fagen let s pretend that it s the real thing and stay together all night long and when i really get to know you we ll open up the doors and climb into the dawn confess your passion your secret fear prepare to meet the challenge of the new frontier comment now let us switch to markets as we remind ourselves that they have developed a habit of front running or anticipating central bank action sometimes by thinking ahead but sometimes sadly via private briefings i hope the ecb has stopped them however you spin it sunchartist made me think with this softbank group prices japan s biggest ever yen corporate bond 500 billion 1 64 aramco softbank lyft pinterest uber the gravy train or as hipster on twitter put it so uber and lyft will have a combined market cap of 150bn with a combined net loss of 3bn next there is the issue of something that is really rather uncomfortable it s official this is an all time record year for corporate stock buybacks announced buybacks for 2018 are now at 1 1 trillion and companies are using their authorizations about 800 billion of stock has already been bought back leaving about 300 billion yet to be purchased we ve seen buyback announcements recently from lowes s pfizer and facebook but in the last few days as stocks have moved to new lows companies are picking up the pace of activity cnbc this makes me uncomfortable on several counts it is the job of a board of directors to run a business not to be punters in its shares this is especially uncomfortable if their bonuses depend on the share price frankly i would look to make that illegal as to them knowing the future how has that worked out for boeing to be fair to cnbc they did highlight a problem so the critics of corporate buybacks and dividend raises are correct it is a form of financial engineering that does not do anything to improve business operations or fundamentals obsessing over ways to boost stock prices helps the investing class but not the average american perhaps nothing has been done about this because it suits the establishment after all think of the wealth effects but that brings inequality and the 0 01 back into focus

china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year a reuters poll showed on friday as sluggish demand at home and abroad weigh on activity despite a flurry of policy support measures the median forecast was slightly lower than the 6 3 percent economists had predicted in the last poll in january while the world s second largest economy has shown some signs of steadying recently analysts caution it is too early to tell if the newfound momentum can be sustained policy stimulus thus far has also been more restrained by chinese standards than in past downturns which could mean a more gradual recovery most of the 88 institutions covered in the survey do not expect growth to bottom out until later in the year as looser monetary condition and fiscal stimulus take time to percolate through the economy and revive domestic demand we expect the economy will slow further in second quarter as exports likely remain under pressure as global demand deteriorates and the property market stays in a downward cycle while stubbornly weak consumption for durable goods caps demand said ting lu chief china economist at nomura the full year forecast of 6 2 percent would still fall within the government s target of 6 0 6 5 percent but it would mark the weakest pace of growth china has seen in 29 years and spell a further deceleration from 6 6 percent in 2018 and 6 8 percent in 2017 growth next year will likely cool further to 6 0 percent the poll showed multi year regulatory campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution have deterred fresh investment while a year long trade war with the united states has hurt china s exporters first quarter growth was seen cooling to 6 3 percent from a year earlier the same as in the previous poll from 6 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 the weakest pace since the global financial crisis story continues china will post its first quarter gross domestic product gdp and march activity data on april 17 support measures beijing has stepped up fiscal stimulus this year announcing more spending on roads railways and ports along with trillions of yuan of tax cuts to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets it has also pressed banks to keep lending to struggling smaller private companies and on more affordable terms even though they are considered higher credit risks than state backed firms investors are hoping for more signs of economic recovery in china to cushion worries about slowing global growth after the imf this week downgraded its 2019 world outlook for the third time citing u s china trade tensions optimism has increased that washington could reach a deal with beijing soon the two sides have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach including establishing new enforcement offices u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on wednesday president donald trump said last week that a deal could be ready around the end of april but economists warn that even if a trade deal is reached and tit for tat tariffs are removed chinese exporters will still have to contend with weakening demand globally policy easing seen on cards analysts expect the central bank will ease policy further this year to spur lending and reduce the risk off a sharper slowdown but they do not expect a cut in the benchmark lending rate which would risk adding to a mountain of debt left over from past stimulus campaigns the people s bank of china has slashed bank s reserve requirement ratio rrr five times over the past year and analysts forecast three more cuts of 50 basis points each in this quarter and the next two the finding was the same as in january china will step up its policy of targeted cuts to banks reserve ratios to encourage financing for small and medium sized businesses that play a key role in economic growth the cabinet said on sunday the economists expect the pboc to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 4 35 percent through at least the end of 2020 the reuters poll showed the central bank has been guiding money market rates lower in various ways since last year which is reducing corporate financing costs while banks have been lowering mortgage rates in some areas the poll also predicted annual consumer inflation to be more muted at 2 1 percent in 2019 cooling from the 2 3 percent estimated in the january survey data this week showed china s producer prices in march picked up for the first time in nine months while consumer inflation also quickened despite the rise in inflation we believe it will not change the

european institute at columbia university america s turn to economic nationalism has rocked the world u s president donald trump promised america first he has delivered within days of taking office he cancelled the laboriously negotiated trans pacific partnership and put trade talks with the european union on ice he then shook up nafta he bullied the south koreans into revising the trade treaty they had agreed to with the obama administration he slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum triggering retaliation from the eu and announced an investigation into the import of motor vehicles under section 301 authority and to cap it all the united states launched a trade war with china faced with this rampage global markets are swinging up and down as fears of a global trade war ebb and flow every deal it seems is merely the prelude to another provocation facing a situation of new and profound insecurity it is natural to seek orientation from the past if we look back over the history it can easily seem as though periods of globalization are followed by periods of backlash we saw something similar in the early 20th century when the free movement of people goods and capital that knitted the world together in the victorian age was replaced in the 1920s and 1930s by protectionism and nativism the problem with this historical comparison illuminating though it may be is that the past may be too simple to contrast with our current situation mr trump s trade policy is a strange mélange it represents not one single coherent response to globalization but a series of reactions superimposed one on top of the other it is as though in its 45th president the united states is reliving all the shocks and stresses of half a century of globalization and postindustrial economic change in a single scrambled mess open this photo in gallery march 20 2019 u s president donald trump speaks to workers in front of tanks at the lima army tank plant joint systems manufacturing center

states the trump administration seems rooted in the bygone era of the mid 20th century mr trump appeals to the white working class man who in the 1950s made up the core of the work force and promises to protect them from the demands of minorities the competition of migrants feminists and the threat of unfair foreign competition the actual working class of the united states is now mostly minority and female at the same time the trump administration advocates an energy policy based on coal and tariffs that protect steel mills and aluminum smelters while in the united states today only 140 000 people are employed making steel in comparison with the 6 3 million who are employed in using it high tech manufacturing not primary metals is the core of u s industry in the 21st century the decline of industrial employment has transformed american society for many communities it has been traumatic and in very visible ways americans consume more and more imported and foreign badged consumer goods but to put two and two together and conclude that globalization killed the american working man is profoundly misleading the vast majority of the decline in industrial labour was driven by the same powerful logic of technological change that previously transformed agriculture it wasn t imports of food or cotton that reduced the need for farm labour the united states is still today one of the world s largest commodity exporters it was u s made combined harvesters and tractors that same basic logic also applies to factory work this is not to say that the successive waves of japanese mexican and then chinese imports have not cost jobs in manufacturing particularly in sectors such as textiles but those were shocks superimposed on a declining trend and the last of those really big shocks the china shock hit the u s economy more than 15 years ago since then both chinese wages and the exchange rate have appreciated in relative terms restoring a good measure of u s competitiveness mr trump s rhetoric however admits of no such distinctions american jobs have been robbed by unfair foreign competition enabled by the weak leadership of his predecessors both republicans and democrats alike he first joined the protectionist camp in the late 1970s and 1980s the era of japan bashing he then made himself into one of the most outspoken critics of nafta pandering to anti mexican prejudice it is only logical that he has now added china to his rogues gallery canada and south korea countries about which it is safe to assume that mr trump has few settled views were unfortunate to

presidential announcement in the first 100 days of his administration what stopped him was backlash from mainstream administration officials and a massive wave of business lobbying whatever impact globalization has had on working people in the united states as far as american business is concerned it has been a boon instead of repudiating nafta the trump administration was forced to renegotiate the most significant change has been in the title nafta is dead long live the usmca if mr trump s protectionism were to find its limit in the united states mexico canada agreement the no less undramatic renegotiation of the u s korea free trade agreement and the aluminum and steel tariffs one would have to say that it was much ado about nothing but that is not all in the spring of 2018 mr trump made clear his impatience bring me tariffs he ordered and his staff have set themselves to doing so the most ominous initiative was the section 301 inquiry into motor vehicle imports to the united states which puts europe in the crosshairs of all mr trump s trade obsessions picking a fight over european car imports is perhaps the most anachronistic it was in the 1950s that europe began

be economic competitors but they are also subordinate partners in the u s alliance system china is not its communist party may no longer espouse world revolution but it represents the ambition of nationalist sovereignty and self determination that first erupted in china 100 years ago in may 1919 and as china s economic weight grows so do its ambitions the risk is that confronted with this genuinely novel situation the american leadership will fall back into another anachronistic history the history that the american intelligence services and national security apparatus are tempted to replay is the narrative of their victory in the cold war like the soviets in the 1980s they believe that china may be vulnerable to pressure the willingness of beijing to come to the bargaining table over trade is seen as a vindication of the hard line position the united states must continue to probe both in economic and geopolitical terms carrying this off will clearly take nerve and may involve some risk but the advocates of lighthizerism insist that it is not unreasonable to require beijing to play fair to respect intellectual property and abandon ruinous subsidies for industries with huge overcapacity this may be true but one can just as well turn the argument on its head much as americans may hope for a fairer trading system with china none of the united states serious domestic problems can actually be solved through a deal with china meanwhile engaging in brinksmanship on trade only tends to endorse and empower a security policy discourse in which china is an inescapable rival that must be contained or brought to heel it is a zero sum conception that forecloses options for both sides above all it will make it far more difficult to find co operative solutions on issues such as climate change that are truly decisive for the next generation given the timeline on global action against climate change we cannot afford decades of new cold war and perhaps salvation may arrive from an unlikely direction the worry among the supporters of the hard line position is that mr lighthizer and his ilk will be undercut from within mr trump is not a strategist despite his bluster he plays for small stakes rather than push home a true shift in the strategic balance the president will settle for a short term stitch up with beijing that allows him to present himself as the dealmaker in chief in time for the 2020 elections in so doing he will snatch triviality from the jaws of what might be a truly consequential strategic shift those of us who do not share the agenda of the new hawks in washington may count ourselves lucky if he does adam tooze s crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world is this year s winner of the lionel gelber prize a literary

the rebounding chinese economy coupled with indications that the us federal reserve will not raise interest rates for the rest of 2019 is welcome relief for emerging economies photo epa efe wu hong capital flows to emerging market economies dried up in the second half of last year as the us federal reserve raised its policy rate for five consecutive quarters and shrank its balance sheet but in january the fed announced a pause which now looks to be extended the dot plots of federal open market committee members currently indicate no rate rises for the remainder of the year moreover the fed has signalled that quantitative tightening the process of allowing treasuries and mortgage backed securities to roll off its balance sheet will continue only through september advertisement don t want to see this remove ads this means merciful relief for emerging economies which have been buoyed by the resumption of capital inflows a replay of the second half of last year much less of the 2013 taper tantrum now seems unlikely in addition there is a rebound in the chinese economy other emerging markets linked to china through global supply chains and raw material exports are highly leveraged on its growth thus they had good reason to worry when chinese manufacturing activity shrank in february for the third straight month chinese exports are down car sales are down as recently as two weeks ago all was doom and gloom we now know that this pessimism was overdone manufacturing activity recovered in march reflecting measures taken by the chinese authorities policymakers are relying more on fiscal stimulus and less on liquidity creation to offset weak demand my view contrary to that of others is that this is something china can well afford government debt is still low by emerging market standards more important the differential between the interest rate and the growth rate which shapes debt dynamics is lower than virtually anywhere else in the world consequently the central government was able to raise the threshold below which no income tax is paid and to add a tax deduction for parental elder care it had room to cut taxes for small businesses it can cut the value added tax vat and spend upward of 1 5 of gdp on railways roads and other projects as announced in march advertisement don t want to see this remove ads to be sure china s corporate debt load is heavy total social financing is still expected to grow by 10 this year faster than nominal gdp much of this new liquidity is destined for relatively inefficient state owned enterprises already saddled with bad loans that said china remains enough of a controlled economy that the authorities can mitigate its deceleration as last month s manufacturing rebound indicates relief may also be coming on the tariff front us president donald trump may have hardened his anti china rhetoric at the behest of his trade representative robert lighthizer who sees threats as necessary to extract concessions from the chinese government on intellectual property and technology transfer there is also the danger of additional us tariffs on other products and sources such as motor vehicles manufactured in europe and mexico but trump s tariff talk is consistently worse than his bite when other countries refuse to roll over and accept his demands he has a history of accepting limited concessions and declaring victory as with the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement there is every sign now that a similar cosmetic agreement is in the offing with china advertisement don t want to see this remove ads at the same time trump never entirely abandons the tariff threat trade conflicts are useful background noise that diverts attention from ongoing political investigations and embarrassments they make it appear to the uninitiated and uninformed that the administration is doing something about slowing us growth as a result trump s tariff threats will continue to roil global markets and international relations but they will not culminate in a full blown tariff war and complete collapse of the multilateral system but there remains one significant and serious risk to emerging markets a us recession the inversion of the yield curve late last month suggests that investors are now taking this possibility seriously some sages at institutions like jpmorgan which make their living forecasting such events think there is a significant chance of a recession this year or next advertisement don t want to see this remove ads if a recession does occur it will be severe because there will be relatively little us policymakers can and will do about it us interest rates remain low giving the fed little room to cut and because the budget deficit has already blown up there will be less appetite for fiscal stimulus moreover a us recession would interact with other risks trump would look for someone to blame so the trade war could be back on in that case china would find it harder to outgrow its corporate debt problem which in turn would weaken the world s principal engine of economic expansion for this reason the recent respite for emerging market economies could be short lived given the uncertainties about us policy and chinese growth prospects it is too early to conclude that these countries are out of the woods dm barry eichengreen is a professor at the university of

by shaun richards sometimes we get an opportunity to both take some perspective and also to observe what is considered by some to be cutting edge so let us open with the perspective of the general manager of the bank for international settlements growth cannot depend on monetary policy agustín carstens tells cnbc i am sure that many of you are thinking that it is a bit late like a decade or so to tell us now interestingly if you watch the video he says in reference to the euro area that monetary policy cannot be the only solution for growth this reminds me of the statement by ecb president mario draghi that it qe was responsible for the better euro area growth phrase in 2016 to 17 it also brings me to my first official denial of the day some analysts said a tiered rate would make room for the ecb to cut its deposit rate farther a prospect that one source said was nowhere near being discussed reuters you know what usually happens next asset markets this is an area that central banks have increasing moved into with sovereign and corporate bond buying but in the same reuters article i spotted something that looked rather familiar tltro iii a new series of cheap two year loans aimed at banks was unveiled in march as a tool to help lenders finance themselves particularly in countries such as italy and portugal but policymakers now increasingly see it as a stimulus tool for a weakening economy the sources said with the growth outlook fading faster than feared even hawkish policymakers have given up pricing the loans at the private market rate some are even discussing offering the tltros at minus 0 4 percent which is currently the ecb s deposit rate the sources said that looks rather like the funding for lending scheme which i mentioned yesterday as the way the bank of england fired up the uk housing market from 2012 onwards essentially if you give banks plenty of cheap funding you get a lot of rhetoric about lending to business small ones in particular but the uk experience was that it declined and mortgage lending rose this was because mortgage rates fell quite quickly by around 1 and according to the bank of england the total impact rose as high as 2 thus in my opinion the ecb is considering singing along to the more more more of andrea true connection in relation to this house prices as measured by the house price index rose by 4 2 in both the euro area and the eu in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the same quarter of the previous year this is one area where the ecb has managed to create some inflation and may even think that the lack of growth in italy 0 6 is a sign of its economic malaise although you do not have to know much history to mull the 6 7 in spain and 7 2 in ireland equities regular readers will be aware that the swiss national bank and the bank of japan started buying equities some time ago now there are differences in that the snb is doing so to diversify its foreign exchange reserves which became so large they were influencing the bond markets mostly european they were investing in so it has bought foreign equities of which the most publicly noted it the holding in apple because if you invest passively then the larger the company the larger the holding if we note the apple watch this must provide food for thought for the swiss watchmaking industry japan has taken a different route in two respects in that it buys funds exchange traded funds or etfs rather than individual equities and that it buys japanese ones also it is still regularly buying as it bought 70 500 000 000 yen s worth on tuesday wednesday and thursday this week whereas buying by the snb in future will be more ad hoc should it feel the need to intervene to weaken the swiss franc again we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us now let us move to federal reserve policymaker neel kashkari so an official denial also you may note that he has left some weasel room as he has not rejected the japanese route of indirectly buying them this is common amongst central bankers as they leave themselves an out and if they fear they might need to introduce a policy that will attract criticism they first deny they intend to do it to give the impression they have been somehow forced for a lighter touch qtrresearch translated it into trumpese so that the man who many think is really running the us federal reserve gets the picture kashkari we re not buying stocks who said anything about buying stocks we re definitely not buying stocks we d never buy stocks it was of course only last week that ended with the cio of blackrock suggesting that the ecb should purchase equities and no doubt he had a list ready i suppose it would sort of solve this problem ecb will ask deutsche bank to raise fresh funds for merger source reuters although of course that would not open just one can of worms but a whole cupboard full of them but when faced with a problem the ecb regularly finds itself singing along with donald fagen let s pretend that it s the real thing and stay together all night long and when i really get to know you we ll open up the doors and climb into the dawn confess your passion your secret fear prepare to meet the challenge of the new frontier comment now let us switch to markets as we remind ourselves that they have developed a habit of front running or anticipating central bank action sometimes by thinking ahead but sometimes sadly via private briefings i hope the ecb has stopped them however you spin it sunchartist made me think with this softbank group prices japan s biggest ever yen corporate bond 500 billion 1 64 aramco softbank lyft pinterest uber the gravy train or as hipster on twitter put it so uber and lyft will have a combined market cap of 150bn with a combined net loss of 3bn next there is the issue of something that is really rather uncomfortable it s official this is an all time record year for corporate stock buybacks announced buybacks for 2018 are now at 1 1 trillion and companies are using their authorizations about 800 billion of stock has already been bought back leaving about 300 billion yet to be purchased we ve seen buyback announcements recently from lowes s pfizer and facebook but in the last few days as stocks have moved to new lows companies are picking up the pace of activity cnbc this makes me uncomfortable on several counts it is the job of a board of directors to run a business not to be punters in its shares this is especially uncomfortable if their bonuses depend on the share price frankly i would look to make that illegal as to them knowing the future how has that worked out for boeing to be fair to cnbc they did highlight a problem so the critics of corporate buybacks and dividend raises are correct it is a form of financial engineering that does not do anything to improve business operations or fundamentals obsessing over ways to boost stock prices helps the investing class but not the

post written by tyler gallagher getty it s been more than a decade since the federal reserve launched its first quantitative easing qe program in 2008 instilled after the disastrous global recession which caused many u s businesses to bite the dust and people to watch their savings dwindle since then some have credited qe and its subsequent phases qe2 and qe3 with accelerating the u s recovery qe has purportedly done the same for the u k where it started in 2009 and it also helped the eurozone through a period of economic crisis before formally ending at the end of 2018 in japan banks started monetary easing by writing off more than 50 8 trillion in yen in bad loans from 1995 through 1998 although it was not yet called qe the bank of japan also procured trillions of yen in commercial paper between october 1997 and october 1998 since japan formally introduced qe as part of prime minister shinzo abe s economic reform in 2012 it has helped create approximately 2 5 million jobs many u s traders love the qes because the fed poured extra money into the economy they also love massive stock buybacks by corporations which support their stock prices and in fact stock buybacks could hit record levels in 2019 however financial traditionalists are less enthusiastic because of concerns about the sources of the additional funds and the economic turmoil qes can trigger qe stimulates the economy by making it easier for businesses to borrow money in the united states the fed buys securities from its member banks to add resources to capital markets as qe increases the u s money supply the fed issues credit to the banks reserves to buy the securities the rationale behind qe is to lower interest rates and thereby stimulate economic growth and allow banks to make more consumer loans by increasing the money supply qe keeps the value of u s currency low exports become cheaper and the nation s stocks get more foreign consideration some economists and traders see other positive economic effects in qe in the united states the fed buys treasurys which increases their demand and keeps their yields low since treasurys are the source of long term interest rates it also supposedly keeps auto furniture and other consumer debt rates reasonable this is true for corporate bonds as well so businesses can expand with less worry then there are the risks of relying on qe some economists believe that qe only benefits wealthy borrowers by using qe to inundate the economy with more money governments maintain artificially low interest rates while providing consumers with extra money to spend this also can lead to inflation economists quibble as to whether inflation now exists but worldwide food prices have been going up gas prices are again on the rise and various other goods and services cost more qe can also have the reverse effect on economies central banks can simply decide to use the extra funds to increase their capital reserves in their loan portfolio not passing on the reduced rates to consumers in the united states the fed cannot force banks to lend to anyone qe can therefore possibly lead to social unrest if the rich and large corporations can borrow at the lower rates leaving average citizens in their wake qe also increases the deficit which impacts all taxpayers but has less effect on the wealthy in sum qe has accomplished some of its objectives but dropped the ball on others lethal subprime mortgages were removed from banks balance sheets it has helped stabilize the u s economy for the moment and it has kept interest rates low enough to temporarily revive the housing market but if for example qe has run its course it leaves behind low interest rates that give central banks little ammo to battle the next economic downturn the question remains as to whether qe has gone too far worldwide can the united states afford a 30 trillion debt even with low interest rates is the current worldwide social unrest with food inflation and a wealth gap an unintended byproduct of qe lending practices in other words are the massive corporate stock buybacks by cheap money from qe and low interest rates from the fed that have fueled the decade long stock market rally a success or a failure time of course will tell
china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year a reuters poll showed on april 12 as sluggish demand at home and abroad weigh on activity despite a flurry of policy support measures the median forecast was slightly lower than the 6 3 percent economists had predicted in the last poll in january story continues below advertisement remove ad while the world s second largest economy has shown some signs of steadying recently analysts caution it is too early to tell if the newfound momentum can be sustained policy stimulus thus far has also been more restrained by chinese standards than in past downturns which could mean a more gradual recovery most of the 88 institutions covered in the survey do not expect growth to bottom out until later in the year as looser monetary condition and fiscal stimulus take time to percolate through the economy and revive domestic demand we expect the economy will slow further in second quarter as exports likely remain under pressure as global demand deteriorates and the property market stays in a downward cycle while stubbornly weak consumption for durable goods caps demand said ting lu chief china economist at nomura the full year forecast of 6 2 percent would still fall within the government s target of 6 0 6 5 percent but it would mark the weakest pace of growth china has seen in 29 years and spell a further deceleration from 6 6 percent in 2018 and 6 8 percent in 2017 growth next year will likely cool further to 6 0 percent the poll showed story continues below advertisement remove ad multi year regulatory campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution have deterred fresh investment while a year long trade war with the united states has hurt china s exporters first quarter growth was seen cooling to 6 3 percent from a year earlier the same as in the previous poll from 6 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 the weakest pace since the global financial crisis china will post its first quarter gross domestic product gdp and march activity data on april 17 support measures beijing has stepped up fiscal stimulus this year announcing more spending on roads railways and ports along with trillions of yuan of tax cuts to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets it has also pressed banks to keep lending to struggling smaller private companies and on more affordable terms even though they are considered higher credit risks than state backed firms investors are hoping for more signs of economic recovery in china to cushion worries about slowing global growth after the imf this week downgraded its 2019 world outlook for the third time citing u s china trade tensions optimism has increased that washington could reach a deal with beijing soon the two sides have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach including establishing new enforcement offices us treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on april 10 president donald trump said last week that a deal could be ready around the end of april but economists warn that even if a trade deal is reached and tit for tat tariffs are removed chinese exporters will still have to contend with weakening demand globally policy easing seen on cards analysts expect the central bank will ease policy further this year to spur lending and reduce the risk off a sharper slowdown but they do not expect a cut in the benchmark lending rate which would risk adding to a mountain of debt left over from past stimulus campaigns the people s bank of china has slashed bank s reserve requirement ratio rrr five times over the past year and analysts forecast three more cuts of 50 basis points each in this quarter and the next two the finding was the same as in january china will step up its policy of targeted cuts to banks reserve ratios to encourage financing for small and medium sized businesses that play a key role in economic growth the cabinet said on sunday the economists expect the pboc to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 4 35 percent through at least the end of 2020 the reuters poll showed the central bank has been guiding money market rates lower in various ways since last year which is reducing corporate financing costs while banks have been lowering mortgage rates in some areas the poll also predicted annual consumer inflation to be more muted at 2 1 percent in 2019 cooling from the 2 3 percent estimated in the january survey data this week showed china s producer prices in march picked up for the first time in nine months while consumer inflation also quickened despite the rise in inflation we believe it will not change the easing bias of the people s bank of china as the cpi inflation comes mainly from pork prices rather than a general rise in prices lu said

in external demand this was compounded by some country and sector specific factors that are turning out to have somewhat longer lasting effects than previously expected our monetary policy measures continue to support domestic demand which remains the backbone of the euro area s economic growth private consumption is driven by employment gains and rising wages although business investment has lost some momentum economic fundamentals remain supportive high levels of capacity utilisation together with favourable financing conditions and robust demand are expected to continue to further support investment in addition the expansion in global activity is expected to continue although at a slower pace since the annual meetings short term economic projections have been revised downwards the latest ecb staff projections put annual real gdp growth at 1 1 in 2019 1 6 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 at the same time the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets poses downside risks to the euro area growth outlook headline inflation in the euro area has lately been hovering around 1 5 somewhat lower than in the summer of last year when it was around 2 0 this largely reflects the volatility in the annual rate of change in energy prices measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term supported by our monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth the latest ecb staff projections foresee annual euro area headline inflation of 1 2 in 2019 1 5 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 at its last monetary policy meeting on 10 april the ecb governing council confirmed that it continues to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term the governing council also intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the governing council also reiterated its readiness to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner in march the governing council had decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years with a view to helping to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy the governing council will communicate the precise terms of the tltro iii at one of the forthcoming meetings in particular the pricing of the new tltro iii operations will take into account a thorough assessment of the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy as well as further developments in the economic outlook in the context of the governing council s regular assessment it will also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy requires the mitigation of their possible side effects if any on bank intermediation overall an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion and thus to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term significant monetary policy stimulus is being provided by the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of tltros in the euro area in order to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy measures other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity at the same time countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers all countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances the transparent and consistent implementation of the eu s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential continued domestic economic growth last year together with micro and macroprudential actions also helped support the resilience of the euro area financial sector the aggregate common equity tier 1 ratio of significant institutions reached 14 2 at the end of the third quarter of 2018 outstanding non performing loans npls declined by 94 billion in the first three quarters of 2018 and euro area significant institutions aggregate npl ratio stood at 4 2 down from 5 2 a year earlier however banks profitability in the euro area as in some other jurisdictions remains low risk taking in parts of the financial and real estate markets contributed to mild signs of overstretched valuations in some areas with marked cross country differences while risks continued to grow in the non bank financial sector in view of the current conditions it is particularly important to continue improving the resilience of the financial sector and to ensure that it has sufficient buffers in place that can be released in times of stress the euro area is now more robust than before the crisis the economic and monetary union emu needs to be strengthened first and foremost by implementing what has already been agreed and finishing the common projects we have started completing the banking union strengthening the operational capacity of the european stability mechanism in full compliance with union law and making ambitious progress on the capital markets union in particular the agreement on establishing a backstop to the single resolution fund which demonstrates the euro area s commitment to completing the banking union now needs to be operationalised to ensure that it works swiftly and effectively we should also rekindle trust in our economic and fiscal framework by making it more effective in ensuring sound policymaking at national level these actions are also further supported at the european level by the recent decision to launch a euro area budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness a more complete emu will be a better foundation for a stable and resilient euro area economy that contributes to global economic growth and financial stability we take note of the fact that the european council has agreed on an extension of the united kingdom s membership of the eu until 31 october 2019 provided the uk participates in the forthcoming european parliament elections in accordance with union law while this means that the risk of a cliff edge has likely been avoided in the short term the financial sector should continue to prepare for all possible contingencies including a disorderly brexit the outlook for the euro area fundamentally depends on global growth momentum the escalation of trade tensions the downturn in global manufacturing and a turn in the tech cycle have increased the euro area s external headwinds multilateral cooperation is needed to reduce trade frictions and mitigate risks of major disruptions to global economic activity and financial stability preserving openness is crucial if the global economy is to thrive and secure its growth potential the key elements of the post crisis regulatory reforms have been agreed we must remain committed to implementing them and evaluating their effects to ensure they are working as intended at the same time while progress has been made towards more resilient market based finance it is important to continue monitoring emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system and to address them if necessary the ecb sees a need for the global financial safety net gfsn to be further strengthened with a strong quota based and adequately resourced imf at its centre in the absence of an agreement on an increase in imf quotas the ecb would strongly welcome a substantial increase in the new arrangements to borrow as a second best outcome towards ensuring that the fund has adequate resources while the first line of defence for national and international stability is to have sound domestic policies in place the imf s role at the centre of the gfsn strongly supports global financial stability the ecb welcomes the start the g20 has made in addressing some of the proposals from its eminent persons group we look forward to further proposals on the finance track being taken up in the second half of the year finally as regards the forthcoming financial sector assessment program review the ecb would welcome an agreement for holding a regular euro area review along the same frequency as for other major currency areas in the future
g24 press conference ms elnagar welcome to the imf spring meetings this is the g 24 press conference i am randa elnagar with the imf communications department let me present our speakers first chair of the g 24 governor of the central reserve bank of peru mr julio velarde first vice chair who is going to be joining us soon for the g 24 dr maxwell opoku afari first deputy governor of the bank of ghana second vice chair mr peyman ghorbani vice governor of the central bank of iran director of the g 24 ms marilou uy the chair is going to give some opening remarks and then we are going to take your questions thank you mr velarde thank you very much let me welcome you to this press conference thank you for coming as you know there has been significant slowdown in the world economy the tailwinds of the tax reduction in the united states are less strong than last year and we have china also growing somewhat less than last year and europe is facing a much bigger slowdown in part because of trade tensions and uncertainty of trade and concerns about brexit germany who had a strong performance last year their numbers have been corrected this year and is pulling the rest of europe to a slower growth most analysts do not predict a recession but uncertainty has increased we hope that the trade tensions will be solved as these trade tensions have been affecting the world growth and also we are convinced of the need of a better capitalized safety net which includes resources by the imf now we have less space than the previous crisis so as to react so we have to focus the g 24 has been focused on the imf lending toolkit and that is important you have the communique issued before in your hands so i do not have to comment about that if there is any question i am willing to answer and i believe there is a conviction in the emerging markets of the g 24 that we need stronger multilateral institutions to address the problems that we are facing in a lot fronts not only climate change trade tensions the bigger financial flows and bigger possibility of imbalances high indebtedness in many emerging market countries you have nine countries that are pretty well affected now and 20 that are almost on the brink of having problems with their debt in the near future that will be all i am ready for your questions please ms elnagar please identify yourself and organization before you ask your question please thank you question my question is that we have been meeting for the last 70 years as far as world bank and imf is concerned now 70th anniversary as far as corruption is concerned where the rest of the world the global economy is concerned because people are getting poorer and poorer as far as corruption is concerned in many countries still today existing and corrupt politicians and business people are putting their money in swiss banks where no accounting is so far even today so billions of dollars even from the indian corrupt ministers or corrupt politicians are still sitting in the swiss banks so what is the future as far as the economy goes together with corruption and how much do you think you have tackled down as far as the world bank and imf is concerned because you are the ones who are giving for a number of projects to the governments around the globe but most of the money is not reaching to the people finally sir where do we stand as far as the economy of india is concerned or india today financially thank you mr velarde thank you very much for the questions first i am not from the imf nor the world bank i am from the central bank of peru so i cannot be responsible for actually the recent count of the imf for this year is that corruption is costing one trillion dollars for the world economy and of course a good part of the resources has been deviated into fiscal paradise i will not say any particular country and that sharing of that information is becoming more and more knowing that find the beneficiary of the accounts in these places is essential also to fight corruption not only government corruption but illegal money tax avoidance et cetera et cetera no and i believe there is a stronger push in that direction you have had many cases where they have discovered some corrupt politicians with their money in andorra and in some of the caribbean islands and a pressure for bigger collaboration is there has been there already for some years and it is hoped that in the near future that can be leveraged no i will not talk about india particularly because it is a special country ms elnagar sir question thank you very much i want to find out one day fiscal monitor was launched this week one of the things they talked about was increased debt distress for some low income countries in terms of borrowing non concessional taking non concessional loans i want to find out from you we have seen a development in africa where growth has stalled although a number of countries have gone to the market to take non concessional loans in the light of all these what would be the strategy for these countries to be able to get out of the debt distress they are getting themselves into i do not know if you get my question because increasingly they are becoming exposed to these eurobonds and you look at growth growth is still not picking up like it is supposed to be and then there is pressure on them as far as debt is concerned how do they get out of debt distress mr velarde it is not only the case of africa it is in many other parts of the world we have seen it in parts of asia venezuela one of the more famous buy in they put the reduced price the new government has said that they will not pay them if that is the case but that is another issue i believe that lenders and borrowers have to be more careful in the search for yield mainly portfolio managers have been looking for high yield and going into bonds that even when they are perceived there might be some risk they are willing to buy those bonds because in the short run they believe they will obtain a yield and their bonus will be associated with the performance of the portfolios but of course that is only part of the picture you need two to tango the governments have to be more careful in what conditions do they borrow and for what do they borrow no but it is a problem i am not going to talk about my country but we set for hyperinflation in the 90s and we were a basket case now we are paying a ten year debt in domestic currency as much as the treasury was paying before 2007 we are paying 5 percent for a 10 year bond in domestic currency we have increased our credit rating six notches in seven years which has been the fastest increase in credit rating of any country philippines have increased five notches in ten years so we can do it it is hard but many times when conditions are harder the search for yield and the bonus that you can obtain because your portfolio in the short run is having higher yields is an incentive to continue lending many times but also the borrower has to be more careful i have not answered completely but it is being prudent the answer being prudent for the investor the one buying the paper and also for the government issuing the debt no question thank you venezuela is a g 24 member and it is not clear who the representative is right now have you discussed who should that representative be is there any plan for calling for a vote a member wide vote to see who that person will be and if so what is the g 24 position on who the representative should be mr velarde there has been no position there has been no vote venezuela has not attended a meeting it has not been discussed so there is no position of the group i suppose different countries may have different positions but it has not been discussed in the group question i want to follow up the question of my colleague why is not possible to discuss is it because you do not have any common view or because you are not in position to do it could you elaborate a little bit just to make us understand what the problem is at the moment because we listen to both world bank and imf saying for weeks that they are ready to help venezuela but they are not in position to do it because of absence of recognition among the membership so when could they have any view on which is the legitimate government in venezuela and then the institution would be able to provide the help the population needs over there mr velarde we are the group that does not make decisions giving money et cetera it is different from the world bank idb that you know that the meeting that was going to take place in china was suspended and in the case of the world bank or other financial institutions where venezuela has a vote and they can receive resources this is not the case here there has been no discussion at all because venezuela was not present many countries they recognize the government of mr maduro others recognize the government of mr guaido in the case of my country we recognize the government of mr guaido not the one of mr maduro but that is the case of my government in the case of the g 24 it has not been discussed in that forum they have not attended maybe if they were present somebody would have said you do not represent a legitimate government that was not the case so there was no discussion at all and there will not be any discussion at least until the meeting in october because we meet every six months so it is different from other institutions question i have a question regarding belt and road initiative there have been some critics that some of the projects have risen the debt for some of the developing countries and i was wondering what is your comment or response to that and also what do you think is the future prospect in terms of how china and the g 24 countries should cooperate or cooperation under the initiative mr velarde there has been no discussion of the issue this time last time there was a conference where first in october in bali and the points were there should be more information more transparency second as china is a government lender at the end they should go also into the group of lenders as other governments third this transparency is needed not only to know the amount of debt but also to know many times where the resources have gone there is suspicions that in many cases they have gone to corruption in some governments what can be the future i believe the chinese taking a more active role in helping infrastructure of many countries so actually that point is pretty important in many countries it has not been so important this lending because the lending conditions are too expensive in the case for example of peru yes going to the market we can obtain better lending conditions than what the chinese government usually charges in latin america chinese lending has been important to countries facing problems that were paying high interest for the debt that was the case so venezuela that was the case of ecuador that was the case of argentina before the current government but otherwise you see most of the countries they can go to the financial markets at a better rate of interest have not been taking loans of china we have had the first investment of chinese investment since the early 90s we have a lot of chinese investment but very little loans actually if there is a quantity it will be less than 10 million probably no question i just want to know what was your evaluation of the global nonperforming debt situation and do you think that the fiscal and monetary policy taking place right now is sufficient to meet this problem this is my first question the second one is do you think that the egyptian monetary and fiscal policies are ok for the percentage of growth we are looking for mr velarde two particular questions about that particular economy which i am not so familiar so i cannot answer your questions if it was monetary policy and fiscal policy around the world i believe probably this patient policy this communication by chairman powell of the fed that the conditions are to wait and see and be more patient and that has come to america as appropriate policy he has not ruled out any hikes but for the moment he has said they do not seem to be needed in the case of the ecb you have seen they have postponed the adjustment for some time because of the slowdown of the economy there is still a lot of uncertainty fiscal policy you have some countries that have some fiscal space i will mention i will mention since we were talking about china in the previous question that fiscal policy in china is looking to have been pretty useful in out this of recovery that we are seeing now in china it depends on some particular country question a couple of questions the first one is related to what my colleagues asked as for debt forgiveness for more than is actually many years are you concerned that debt servicing is reducing the fiscal space for capital expenditure in some of these developed countries and considering the great appetite for eurobonds my second question has to do with ghana we recently just exited from an external credit facility arrangement with the imf and i want to know if there are some advice lessons you think that we should take so that we do not go into that arrangement again and my last question has to do with the communique you issued and i want a clarity on that communique the sixth paragraph says on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the reform that included the special drawing rights sdr in the imf articles of agreement we reiterate our call for a more active use of sdrs as a reserve asset and i want some elaboration on that thank you mr velarde for the part of indebtedness the imf now it has raised in the world economic outlook the problem of many countries with high level of indebtedness how we have reduced the fiscal space for the question of the sdr it is like a currency the countries that have less problems especially in monetary policy are those countries that have their currency of reserve that we cannot follow accurately like the states oecd because our currency is not a reserve currency in the case of the states the fed or the ecb they can issue more of the currency without causing too much problems because it is a reserve currency and they have deeper markets in the case of ghana peru can not print a lot of money we have the no reserve currency and this will cause inflation what we are talking here is a greater use of sdr as a reserve currency by itself and that will help to have more resources for the imf and even a reduced weight of the dollar as a real currency it is a basket of currencies if there are to be no reserve currency no it was in that sense for the question on ghana i have the deputy governor of the central bank of ghana who is going to answer you mr opoku afari thank you very much on the question of ghana including the imf ecf program the ecf program was introduced to address specific macroeconomic imbalances the program was concluded last month and there were a lot of gains that have been made in terms of addressing some of these macroeconomic imbalances going forward what ghana has to do to ensure that we do not go back to that is to make sure that these gains that have been made through the ecf program are consolidated going forward we have to work to consolidate gains and the government of ghana has an objective of introducing a lot of transformative programs and what we have to make sure we do is to ensure that those transformative programs are built on the macroeconomic stability that has been achieved so far so the two have to go together we have to continue to make sure that stability is maintained whilst we continue to have the transformative program with that we are sure that you will continue to grow without losing macroeconomic stability or reintroducing the imbalances that we had in the past ms elnagar further questions mr velarde thank you very much for your presence i hope we have answered some of your questions thank you very much
the gold market right after super wednesday super wednesday is behind us the masters of monetary policy have revealed their cards the fed released the fresh minutes the ecb held its monetary policy meeting while the brexit was postponed again how will all these play out in the gold market minutes show patience among the fomc members the minutes from the pivotal fomc meeting show that the fed saw the first quarter economic slowdown as transitory and that the real gdp growth would bounce back solidly in the second quarter although the yield curve inverted for a while the central bankers noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in longer term interest rates has made the yield curve a less reliable economic indicator however although the policymakers do not see recession for the united states in the near future they are not going to hike interest rates this year indeed the key paragraph of the march minutes is as follows with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year hence the fed stressed again that it will remain patient for now a more dovish fed implies lower real interest rates and thus weaker tailwind for the us dollar to appreciate from the fundamental point of view these factors should support the gold prices however investors should remember that one of the reasons why the us central bank softened its stance on monetary policy is subdued inflation we are of course aware that the cpi rose 0 4 percent on march but the core inflation rate declined from 2 1 to 2 0 percent on an annual basis gold bulls would definitely prefer a much stronger price pressure the ecb confirms economic slowdown but does not change its policy as expected the ecb kept the monetary policy parameters unchanged on wednesday however draghi noted that the recent data confirms slower growth momentum extending into the current year indeed the imf sharply downgraded growth in the euro zone one day earlier it now expects the bloc to grow at 1 3 percent in 2019 compared to 1 6 percent forecasted six months ago moreover the balance of risks remained negative as the ecb president pointed out that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside hence the ecb has been recently forced to backtrack its monetary tightening plans amid the global economic slowdown it s likely now that draghi will not deliver a single interest rate hike before his presidency ends later this year a less hawkish ecb makes for a weaker euro against the us dollar which should undermine gold s appeal however mr draghi did not say anything revolutionary so the impact on the precious metals market would be likely limited indeed the eur usd fell yesterday but then it quickly rebounded as the chart below shows chart 1 eur usd exchange rate from april 9 to april 11 2019 implications for gold what does it all imply for the gold market well the price of the yellow metal rose yesterday as one can see in the chart below chart 2 gold prices from april 9 to april 11 2019 major central banks being dovish the fed in particular combined with the uptick in the american cpi provided some support for the gold prices but gold investors should be aware of headwinds later this year we refer here to the fact that the markets see a more than 50 percent chance of a fed rate cut this year but there is little in the minutes that warrants a rate cut by december if the market expectations adjust gold may struggle another issue is that the european union leaders agreed yesterday to grant the british prime minister theresa may a new brexit deadline of october 31 2019 as the brexit has been postponed the risk appetite may strengthen among the market participants affecting negatively the safe haven assets thank you if you enjoyed the above

opinion and commentary editorials and other opinion content offer perspectives on issues important to our community and are independent from the work of our newsroom reporters op ed here s how the feds use your tax dollars opinion getty images it s nice to have more money in your pocket and thanks to the 2017 tax cuts the typical american is now paying less in taxes but that s not to say we re not still sending a hefty sum of money to washington tally up all the payroll and other taxes on earnings and income and you ll find that the average american household forks over more than 26 000 to the feds each year last year washington collected more than 3 3 trillion in taxes so where exactly does all that money go some believe most of it goes to foreign aid and defense others think corporate subsidies dominate the budget in reality health entitlements medicare medicaid obamacare and social security are the largest and fastest growing programs unless congress fixes these four programs they and the ever growing interest payments on the national debt will consume every dollar of taxes paid by 2041 that leaves no money for anything else uncle sam couldn t spend a penny on defense food assistance highways or education without driving the country further into debt right now medicare medicaid and obamacare subsidies account for more than a quarter 28 8 percent of all federal spending ten years from now it s projected to gobble up more than a third of the budget meanwhile social security the single largest federal program accounts for roughly a quarter of all federal spending all by itself its trust funds already pay out more than they take in and its finances will only deteriorate faster as more and more boomers retire the social security trustees project that unless congress implements much needed reforms the program will run out of reserve funds by 2034 potentially triggering a 23 percent cut in benefits other income security programs veterans benefits food and housing assistance federal employee retirement and disability account for 16 percent of the budget that s more than we spend on national defense and the defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations overseas to the research development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment at 15 percent of the federal budget defense spending is the last major category of federal spending most of what is left goes to people and corporations who hold washington s ious currently 8 percent of the budget goes to interest payments on this debt over the coming decade u s debt held by the public is projected to balloon to nearly 93 percent of gross domestic product but don t blame that on inadequate taxation by 2024 the pro growth tax enacted in 2017 will actually raise more revenue yearly than the old system no the culprit here is runaway spending driven primarily by huge increases in health and social security outlays and the long term consequences of deficit spending are dire economic growth tends to slow in countries with debts that are as big as their economy the united states is quickly joining this group as the debt increases so does the cost of the interest we must pay to those who hold the debt china is currently the largest foreign holder of u s debt left unchecked growing government spending and historically high levels of debt ultimately will require higher taxes and just jacking up taxes on the rich won t cut it paying for big government requires high taxes on middle class americans too eventually rising debt will leave lawmakers with few options to avoid a financial crisis unless we can reverse course it is only a matter of time before every american will be forced to pay higher income and payroll taxes on tax day 2019 be thankful for the extra money the 2017 tax cuts deposited in your pocket but know that unless we insist that lawmakers suppress their seemingly insatiable appetite to spend we could all soon be paying much much more justin bogie and adam n michel are senior policy analysts in the heritage foundation s hermann center for the federal budget tribune content agency
the head of the international monetary fund panned an idea gaining currency in u s left wing circles that washington could borrow much more aggressively without harming the economy prominent politicians including senator bernie sanders a self described democratic socialist seeking the 2020 democratic presidential nomination and democratic u s representative alexandria ocasio cortez see the idea as a possible way to ramp up spending on social programmes the theory known as modern monetary theory has drawn rebukes from fiscal conservatives and many democrats as well imf managing director christine lagarde whose institution is tasked with rescuing countries stricken by economic crises appears to be aligned with critics who consider the theory naive we do not think that the modern monetary theory is actually the panacea lagarde said at a news conference during the spring meetings of the imf and world bank in washington lagarde said there might be a few situations in which vastly expanding debt would make sense such as when a country gets stuck in a deflationary spiral we do not think that any country is you know currently in a position where that theory could actually deliver good value in a sustainable way she said conventional economists across america s political spectrum argue the country is already on an unsustainable fiscal path with 22 trillion 17 trillion in outstanding federal debt and chronic deficits driven by social welfare programmes proponents of modern monetary theory hold that the u s government s monopoly over dollar issuance the printing press gives it the power to spend as much as needed to meet the full employment and inflation mandates currently tasked to the country s central bank imf chief economist gita gopinath said the u s dollar s dominant role in global finance might make it possible for washington to ramp up spending without immediately driving interest rates higher but she said america s growing spending commitments could eventually cause credit problems and that printing gobs of money to finance deficits could be disastrous very large amounts of it tend to be inflationary and they typically land countries into a crisis situation gopinath said in an interview with reuters source reuters reporting by jason lange additional reporting by david lawder editing by paul simao

president trump has announced that he may nominate herman cain to the seven person federal reserve board although cain hasn t been officially nominated yet many on the left and some on the right have voiced their objections a washington post op ed calls cain s potential nomination a reckless move is cain the best candidate for the federal reserve s board of governors i will let the u s senate decide at cain s confirmation hearing should that happen but the firestorm of condemnations of cain aren t all justified criticism of cain can be summarized into three main points i ll discuss them below 1 herman cain doesn t understand economics catherine rampell a columnist for the washington post wrote last week nein nein nein that should be the senate response if president trump actually nominates his friend herman cain while she acknowledges that trump s past fed nominees are competent well qualified professionals she clearly looks down on cain referring to him as a former pizza magnate turned failed republican presidential candidate it s true that cain is neither an economist nor a banker the two professions that traditionally have dominated federal reserve officials but cain s life is a quintessential american economic success story the kind that joe biden can only wish he could plagiarize a native of atlanta georgia cain was born into a poor family his mother worked as a maid and his father was once a chauffeur from this humble background cain went to college got a master s degree in computer science from purdue university and worked his way up from analyst to chief executive in corporate america one of his business accomplishments was the turnaround of the godfather s pizza chain in 14 months when he was its president and ceo but there is more in 1992 cain became one of the board of directors for the federal reserve bank of kansas city and was the board s chairman from 1995 to 1996 in 2012 he sought the republican presidential nomination with an 9 9 9 economic plan 9 percent business flat tax 9 percent personal flat tax 9 percent sales tax he was a long shot but he won the florida straw poll in 2011 beating seasoned politicians like mitt romney cain has a better grasp of economics and policies than paul krugman a well known economist nobel economics laureate and new york times columnist one of krugman s infamous blunders was when he predicted the day after 2016 s election that trump would bring a global recession and the u s stock market would never recover the u s stock market has risen to a record level under president trump and american workers are enjoying the best job market ever with a record low unemployment rate in a booming economy krugman has been wrong on many other significant topics including the fiscal policies in demark the trade war with china and on bitcoin of course krugman was one of the first to criticize cain s nomination in a tweet 2 the gold standard is a ridiculous idea many americans are not familiar with gold standard today so it is easier for political pundits and even some economists to dismiss the gold standard as a fringe idea but in 1800s almost all the nations in the world adopted the gold standard which guaranteed that the government would redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold the beauty of the gold standard is that because there is a limited supply of gold it serves as a natural constraint on government spending and inflation investment strategist mark luschini says the gold standard forces the u s to live within its means think of it as a person with a debit card rather than a credit card the debit card holder can only spend what he or she has in the bank clear evidence for example here and here shows that under the gold standard the u s economy was relatively healthy stable and productive the united states was on the gold standard for 179 years until august 15 1971 when president nixon ordered the fed not to redeem u s dollars with gold essentially ending the gold standard in the united states note to those who claimed that the federal reserve has always been independent since then the u s dollar has been running on a fiat money system because its value is not linked to any real asset consequently monetary disorders followed four decades after we abandoned the gold standard the u s dollar has lost more than 96 percent of its value and our national debt stands at close to 22 trillion it s true today most mainstream economists oppose restoring the gold standard but even bloomberg admits their opposition doesn t mean cain and other proponents of the gold standard are wrong the criticism against the gold standard mainly rests on the notion that it will limit the federal reserve s ability to manage the economy through manipulating the money supply and interest rates especially in times of financial crisis yet even economists who are against the gold standard acknowledge that the fed has made plenty of mistakes too the united states probably will never go back to the gold standard for other practical reasons as well we don t have enough gold reserves to pay off our debt and if we are the only country that uses the gold standard in this integrated global economy other nations that have trade surpluses with us will demand gold in payment which will drain our gold supply while all these arguments against the gold standards sound reasonable tyler cowen an economist at george mason university says it is wrong to assume someone who supports the gold standard is either crazy or ignorant many smart people favor the gold standard besides cain including steven moore another trump federal reserve nominee and former congressman ron paul in 2012 the republican party platform called for the creation of a gold commission to evaluate restoring the gold standard former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan whom even many on the left respect as a mainstream economist admitted if the gold standard were in place today we would not have reached the situation in which we now find ourselves 3 cain would politicize the federal reserve cain is an unapologetic and outspoken conservative when he was the leader of the national restaurants association he criticized hillary clinton s health care nationalization plan he frequently disagreed with former president obama one of his well known criticism was hope and change is not a solution hope and change is not a job therefore many on the left charge that should cain and moore become federal reserve board members they would ruin the independence of the fed because they are both trump loyalists who would politicize future monetary decisions the very set up of the fed from the beginning means it has always been under political influence it s a valid concern that we don t want our central bank to become an overly partisan institution our country is already very much politically divided having a central bank that can remain above the political fray and make decisions based on what s best for the country not by which direction the political wind blows is a good thing at the same time it is naive to think the fed has always been truly independent according to economist peter earle the very set up of the fed from the beginning means it has always been under political influence including the facts that fed officials are appointed by the executive branch and confirmed by congress and private meetings between the fed chairman and presidents are a long standing fixture of economic policy coordination and implementation in his piece for the american institute for economic research earle documented many instances throughout the u s history that from lyndon johnson to bill clinton and george w bush almost every president tried to exert influence on the federal reserve s monetary decisions presidents attempting to influence the fed did not start with and will not end with the current chief executive acknowledging past presidential influence on the fed doesn t mean fed officials should not strive for as much independent thinking as they can cain can help make his own case by either dissolving or at least dissociating himself from america fighting back a pro trump group he set up he also needs to tone down his political rhetoric and start demonstrating his understanding of economic policies by talking about real economic issues cain is an unconventional choice for the federal reserve but we shouldn t be surprised because president trump is nothing if not unconventional should president trump go ahead nominating cain for the top job in the fed the u s senate should give cain a fair hearing rather than being dissuaded by some of these unfair criticisms

would be its sixth straight weekly advance in a recent note stephen innes head of trading and market strategy for spi asset management points out that a reuters report this week suggested opec could raise oil output from july if venezuelan and iranian supply drops further and prices continue to rally because production cuts with russ and other allies could over tighten the markets supporting our view from earlier this week that traders were busy plugging in data to come up with a theoretical price point that may convince both shale and opec producers to increase production mr innes said well at least that s what we were doing anticipating that opec would try to pour some ice water on this sizzling rally knowing full well that president trump wants to squeeze iran crude export to zero but he also wants opec to keep the rigs pumping mr innes also said he still expects opec to come through with a six month extension of supply curbs at its meeting in june although he says it s likely the

fn media group presents oilprice com market commentary london april 12 2019 prnewswire china and russia are staking enormously on the precious yellow metal by the end of 2018 central banks had bought up 74 more gold than the year before and they re still going strong russia is hedging against the dollar heavily china too mentioned in today s commentary first majestic silver nyse ag wheaton precious metals corp nyse wpm agnico eagle mines ltd nyse aem yamana gold nyse auy eldorado gold corp nyse ego the world gold council says it hasn t seen anything like this since 1967 it s a combination of global events that could send gold prices soaring abruptly all the biggest names in gold agree one thing we re running out of physical gold and when euro sun mining inc esm cpnff suddenly managed to do the impossible and secure a key license for one of the most sought after gold and copper mines in the world the finance world sits up and takes note using cutting edge exploration and production techniques such as drone surveying and 3d geo mapping the company is aiming to dig up some 13 billion in gold and copper reserves and this year the massive resources near the ro ia montana mines could be resurrected at exactly the same time that the world is running out of gold and as gold is staging its biggest comeback ever euro sun isn t only sitting on massive acreage in one of europe s most pre eminent venues but it s also right next door to another hugely profitable mining estate in europe and better yet the world is already running out of gold here are 5 reasons to look at euro sun mining inc esm cpnff right now 1 ridiculously undervalued stock euro sun mining currently has a market cap of 40 million a ridiculously low valuation for a company that just made an unprecedented jump in europe s second largest gold mine and one of the biggest in the world compare it to timok a very similar asset located in neighboring serbia that recently sold for 1 4 billion euro sun mining s rovina valley project contains significantly more gold and copper resources than timok and is located just four hours away by car indeed rovina valley contains 40 percent more reserves than timok and features 36 percent lower capex rovina s low aisc all in sustaining costs of 752 an ounce leaves a healthy profit margin of 550 an ounce at current gold prices and a 60 70 million free cash flow every year 2 the gold rally trade wars brexit bloody political upheaval in venezuela and countless other global events have caused tectonic cracks in the global economy the u s is not immune either growth was only 2 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 4 percent in the previous quarter suddenly the fed has changed its tune canceling interest rate hikes and expressing concern about slowing growth in china the situation is even worse the economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and china s biggest trading partner the european union has just cut its near term growth projections by an astounding 40 percent the eu economy is expected to grow at only 1 3 percent that is exactly the kind of backdrop that favors safe haven investing gold is considered the ultimate fear hedge that outperforms other asset classes during times of economic stress and gold charts are a clear testament to this fact undervalued junior mining stocks like euro sun mining inc esm cpnff offer the best chance for solid returns as investors turn to gold to hedge their bets especially when they re suddenly sitting on one of the most alluring gold mines in the world keep this in mind there is an explosive upside to gold stocks when gold starts climbing even modestly that s what happened in 2016 when gold prices jumped 26 in only 6 months leading to outsized returns for miners endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months iamgold gained 256 even the juniors skyrocketed argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 increase in gold production 3 world class gold mine euro sun mining now has 100 percent ownership for roughly 400 million tons of ore in three discreet bodies consisting of about 7 1 million ounces of gold and a billion and a half pounds of copper working out to about 10 1 million ounces of gold equivalent at a current gold price of 1320 per ounce that s more than 13 3 billion in potential revenue and that for a company that s currently valued at 30 million and it gets even better extraction costs at the rovina valley project are much lower than that of neighboring mining districts the rovina valley mine is frequently compared to timok a legendary mining district in serbia yet it is much bigger and provides superior mining economics rovina valley not only contains much more extensive gold and copper reserves they are also cheaper to mine in november the country s national agency for mineral resources namr officially endorsed the project and initiated the ratification process for the mining license this is a short process that can be completed in a few months the license de risks this play which is already fully licensed by the romanian government 4 clean technology combined with high productivity euro sun mining esm cpnff has put a lot of money into its research labs it s tried dozens of different chemicals and processes and now it s discovered the secret that makes those types of yields possible the company is now able to extract 20 percent extra gold at zero extra cost the process is dry stacking which virtually eliminates contamination though seepage of groundwater when gold is separated from the hard rock gold recovery was formerly 68 percent now it s 82 percent the concentrate was 9 or 10 percent previously and now its 22 percent with about 100 grams of gold in other words the kind of grades that smelters would kill for 5 first government backed private entity euro sun mining is the only government endorsed private mining firm operating in romania thanks to its dedication to using clean mining technologies the company has already embarked on an environmental and social impact assessment esia and continue its work on a feasibility study on the rovina valley project euro sun mining is devoted to using the latest technology with no environmental risks and that speaks to esg which is all about environmentally and socially responsible investments euro sun mining esm cpnff has officially become the first non state owned mining project with the full endorsement of the romanian government euro sun mining esm cpnff represents a highly asymmetrical risk reward with little downside but very high upside for the first non state owned company to be issues a mining permit since 2003 and the first company to be able to cleanly cut the vampires out of this transylvanian gold this is a discovery on multiple levels it s got serious legs that are running at breakneck speed here are 5 more companies analysts are watching as precious metals gain speed first majestic silver nyse ag there s a lot of bullishness around this stock with earnings growth expected to be high over the next 3 5 years the optimism is absolutely justified as this canadian mining company has been operating in mexico for nearly a decade and has

themselves to be strong and responsible mine developers and we are excited about the same team moving this project into production rosemont is an ideal fit for wheaton s portfolio of high quality

taking place in exploration activities in europe latin america and the united states though the company joins a long list of gold majors that reported losses in 2018 but its cash flow deficit is

hoon file photo reuters by kevin yao beijing reuters china s new bank loans rebounded in march rising far more than expected as policymakers pushed lenders to support struggling smaller companies and shore up the slowing economy analysts say china needs to turn around weak credit growth to head off a sharper economic slowdown but there are concerns that may fuel a further rise in bad loans as banks loosen lending standards chinese banks extended 1 69 trillion yuan 251 59 billion in net new yuan loans in march compared with analysts expectations of 1 2 trillion yuan in a reuters poll new lending had pulled back in february due to seasonal factors after a record credit pulse in january the latest data suggest that credit growth may now be bottoming out due to the pboc s efforts to loosen monetary conditions however a rapid economic turnaround is unlikely capital economics said in a report total bank lending in the first three months of 2019 hit a record quarterly tally of 5 81 trillion yuan broad m2 money supply in march grew 8 6 percent on year the highest in 13 months data released by the people s bank of china showed on friday also well above estimates analysts had expected a rise to 8 2 percent from 8 0 percent in february outstanding yuan loans grew 13 7 percent from a year earlier the fastest pace in nearly 3 years analysts had expected it to hold steady from february at 13 4 percent growth of outstanding total social financing tsf a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy quickened to 10 7 percent in march from 10 1 percent pulling further away from a record low of 9 8 percent in december in march tsf quadrupled to 2 86 trillion yuan from 703 billion yuan in february gradual policy easing likely the central bank has already slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs especially for small and private firms vital for growth and job creation story continues but policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus campaigns in past downturns while the pboc has been guiding money market rates lower in various ways most analysts do not expect china to cut its benchmark lending rate unless conditions sharply deteriorate a new reuters poll forecast three more cuts to rrr of 50 basis points each in this quarter and the next two many analysts believe the next cut is imminent but china may be in no rush after the solid march readings said tommy xie china economist at ocbc bank in singapore though the data could be distorted by short term lending the mild increase in medium to long term loans shows that there is no urgency for china to roll out more measures at the current stage xie said in a note we think the chance of an rrr cut in april is much smaller the next window could be june he added noting four tranches of 1 35 trillion yuan in pboc medium term loans will expire in june and july fiscal stimulus with an eye on debt levels beijing is leaning more on fiscal stimulus to support growth this year with more spending on roads railways and ports and nearly 2 trillion yuan in tax cuts but leverage has to go up in order for stimulus to work economists at bank of america merrill lynch baml said in a recent report they believe a moderate increase in public debt is manageable as long as it prevents a slump in growth china s top four state controlled banks warned last month that bad loans could rise beijing is pushing them to boost lending to smaller businesses by at least 30 percent this year though they are seen as higher credit risks smaller regional banks may be more vulnerable to a new round of sour loans the national audit office reported this month that some banks in the central province of henan had recorded 40 percent of their loan books as bad debt by the end of 2018 signs of steadying optimism over the outlook for the economy has improved recently strong bank lending is setting the stage for a possible bounce in investment in coming months while business surveys showed factory activity returned to growth in march washington and beijing also have accelerated high level talks to resolve their year long trade dispute though a deal is by no means certain still many analysts say china is not out of the woods yet while a weak credit cycle has bottomed out the economic slowdown may not end until the summer said chen long china economist at gavekal dragonomics in beijing credit growth is a leading indicator it could be a few months before other activities start to bottom out he said economic growth is expected to cool to around 6 2 percent this year a 29 year low according to a reuters poll the economy grew 6 6 percent last year additional reporting by stella qiu editing by jacqueline wong

london april 12 2019 prnewswire china and russia are staking enormously on the precious yellow metal by the end of 2018 central banks had bought up 74 more gold than the year before and they re still going strong russia is hedging against the dollar heavily china too mentioned in today s commentary first majestic silver nyse ag wheaton precious metals corp nyse wpm agnico eagle mines ltd nyse aem yamana gold nyse auy eldorado gold corp nyse ego the world gold council says it hasn t seen anything like this since 1967 it s a combination of global events that could send gold prices soaring abruptly all the biggest names in gold agree one thing we re running out of physical gold and when euro sun mining inc esm cpnff suddenly managed to do the impossible and secure a key license for one of the most sought after gold and copper mines in the world the finance world sits up and takes note using cutting edge exploration and production techniques such as drone surveying and 3d geo mapping the company is aiming to dig up some 13 billion in gold and copper reserves and this year the massive resources near the roșia montană mines could be resurrected at exactly the same time that the world is running out of gold and as gold is staging its biggest comeback ever euro sun isn t only sitting on massive acreage in one of europe s most pre eminent venues but it s also right next door to another hugely profitable mining estate in europe and better yet the world is already running out of gold here are 5 reasons to look at euro sun mining inc esm cpnff right now 1 ridiculously undervalued stock euro sun mining currently has a market cap of 40 million a ridiculously low valuation for a company that just made an unprecedented jump in europe s second largest gold mine and one of the biggest in the world compare it to timok a very similar asset located in neighboring serbia that recently sold for 1 4 billion euro sun mining s rovina valley project contains significantly more gold and copper resources than timok and is located just four hours away by car indeed rovina valley contains 40 percent more reserves than timok and features 36 percent lower capex rovina s low aisc all in sustaining costs of 752 an ounce leaves a healthy profit margin of 550 an ounce at current gold prices and a 60 70 million free cash flow every year 2 the gold rally trade wars brexit bloody political upheaval in venezuela and countless other global events have caused tectonic cracks in the global economy the u s is not immune either growth was only 2 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 4 percent in the previous quarter suddenly the fed has changed its tune canceling interest rate hikes and expressing concern about slowing growth in china the situation is even worse the economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and china s biggest trading partner the european union has just cut its near term growth projections by an astounding 40 percent the eu economy is expected to grow at only 1 3 percent that is exactly the kind of backdrop that favors safe haven investing gold is considered the ultimate fear hedge that outperforms other asset classes during times of economic stress and gold charts are a clear testament to this fact undervalued junior mining stocks like euro sun mining inc esm cpnff offer the best chance for solid returns as investors turn to gold to hedge their bets especially when they re suddenly sitting on one of the most alluring gold mines in the world keep this in mind there is an explosive upside to gold stocks when gold starts climbing even modestly that s what happened in 2016 when gold prices jumped 26 in only 6 months leading to outsized returns for miners endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months iamgold gained 256 even the juniors skyrocketed argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 increase in gold production 3 world class gold mine euro sun mining now has 100 percent ownership for roughly 400 million tons of ore in three discreet bodies consisting

by karin strohecker london reuters in the hazy world of distressed debt trading the fall of sudan s autocratic ruler of 30 years omar al bashir has sparked fresh interest among traders and holders of the country s long defaulted debt following weeks of demonstrations kindled by soaring food costs high unemployment and increasing repression 75 year old bashir was overthrown on thursday by the military three decades after himself seizing power in a coup the newly ruling military council on friday promised a transition to an elected civilian government frozen for the best part of four decades sudan s debt is part of a highly opaque market of legacy debts of countries isolated from the rest of the international community such as pre castro cuban debt or loans issued by north korea apart from defaulting on payments from the early 1980s onwards sudan was also subject to u s sanctions linked to the conflict in darfur for nearly two decades until 2017 this is a big moment for the country now we need to see what happens next what sort of a government or leader they will get and how the situation will develop said one holder of the defaulted loans speaking on condition of anonymity there s a potential for real change but change isn t always for the better and it could take a very long time for things to improve much of sudan s distressed debt trading centers around a state guaranteed loan issued in 1981 as part of a debt restructuring agreement with a principal of 1 64 billion swiss franc 1 64 billion shortly after the sudanese government defaulted again on its obligations on the loan by now analysts estimate the amount due including nearly four decades of unpaid interest amounts to around 8 billion swiss francs 7 99 billion loans are rarely changing hands though distressed debt traders say they last priced between 7 9 cents in the dollar isolated from markets sudan has been cut off from international markets for years the u s government lifted most of its sanctions on sudan in february 2017 but kept the country on its list of state sponsors of terrorism this keeps the economy in a stranglehold making it next to impossible for businesses to operate in dollar transactions and cutting off any access to international capital markets and many other funding sources for the government apart from somalia sudan is now the only country in the world with arrears to the international monetary fund imf accounting for more than 80 percent of money overdue to the multilateral lender the impoverished northeastern african country is buckling under its debt with defaulted loans owed to the private sector making up just a small part of the burden public external debt is around 51 billion said stuart culverhouse head of sovereign fixed income research at exotix citing 2016 imf data this is 88 percent of gdp the ratio is likely to be higher now because of a weaker currency the imf stated in its december 2017 report that sudan was eligible for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries hipc plan an imf and world bank initiative launched in 1996 to help poor countries struggling with external debt obtain debt relief economic conditions in sudan have been challenging since the secession of south sudan in 2011 and the loss of the bulk of oil production and exports which have compounded the difficult external environment the imf report said rethink once a country has overhauled its debt burden with bilateral and multilateral lenders it must come to an agreement with private sector lenders before being able to access international capital markets again taking a punt on major regime changes distressed debt investors in general are happy to slog it out though the latest market developments have seen some rethink their position one debt trader reported a seller had withdrawn a sudan position wanting to see what happened first yet others were gauging if a possible spike in price could be an opportunity to sell excitement over investment in cuba for instance has gone tepid after u s president donald trump reversed his predecessor barack obama s rapprochement with havana north korean debt moved further into the twilight zone after washington imposed fresh sanctions on pyongyang in 2017 we ve had a few setbacks lately some may well think a spike in prices now could be a good time to get out said the holder of defaulted sudan debt reporting by karin strohecker editing by mark heinrich view comments
london april 12 2019 prnewswire china and russia are staking enormously on the precious yellow metal by the end of 2018 central banks had bought up 74 more gold than the year before and they re still going strong russia is hedging against the dollar heavily china too mentioned in today s commentary first majestic silver nyse ag wheaton precious metals corp nyse wpm agnico eagle mines ltd nyse aem yamana gold nyse auy eldorado gold corp nyse ego the world gold council says it hasn t seen anything like this since 1967 it s a combination of global events that could send gold prices soaring abruptly all the biggest names in gold agree one thing we re running out of physical gold and when euro sun mining inc esm cpnff suddenly managed to do the impossible and secure a key license for one of the most sought after gold and copper mines in the world the finance world sits up and takes note using cutting edge exploration and production techniques such as drone surveying and 3d geo mapping the company is aiming to dig up some 13 billion in gold and copper reserves and this year the massive resources near the roșia montană mines could be resurrected at exactly the same time that the world is running out of gold and as gold is staging its biggest comeback ever euro sun isn t only sitting on massive acreage in one of europe s most pre eminent venues but it s also right next door to another hugely profitable mining estate in europe and better yet the world is already running out of gold here are 5 reasons to look at euro sun mining inc esm cpnff right now 1 ridiculously undervalued stock euro sun mining currently has a market cap of 40 million a ridiculously low valuation for a company that just made an unprecedented jump in europe s second largest gold mine and one of the biggest in the world compare it to timok a very similar asset located in neighboring serbia that recently sold for 1 4 billion euro sun mining s rovina valley project contains significantly more gold and copper resources than timok and is located just four hours away by car indeed rovina valley contains 40 percent more reserves than timok and features 36 percent lower capex rovina s low aisc all in sustaining costs of 752 an ounce leaves a healthy profit margin of 550 an ounce at current gold prices and a 60 70 million free cash flow every year 2 the gold rally trade wars brexit bloody political upheaval in venezuela and countless other global events have caused tectonic cracks in the global economy the u s is not immune either growth was only 2 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 4 percent in the previous quarter suddenly the fed has changed its tune canceling interest rate hikes and expressing concern about slowing growth in china the situation is even worse the economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and china s biggest trading partner the european union has just cut its near term growth projections by an astounding 40 percent the eu economy is expected to grow at only 1 3 percent that is exactly the kind of backdrop that favors safe haven investing gold is considered the ultimate fear hedge that outperforms other asset classes during times of economic stress and gold charts are a clear testament to this fact undervalued junior mining stocks like euro sun mining inc esm cpnff offer the best chance for solid returns as investors turn to gold to hedge their bets especially when they re suddenly sitting on one of the most alluring gold mines in the world keep this in mind there is an explosive upside to gold stocks when gold starts climbing even modestly that s what happened in 2016 when gold prices jumped 26 in only 6 months leading to outsized returns for miners endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months iamgold gained 256 even the juniors skyrocketed argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 increase in gold production 3 world class gold mine euro sun mining now has 100 percent ownership for roughly 400 million tons of ore in three discreet bodies consisting of about 7 1 million ounces of gold and a billion and a half pounds of copper working out to about 10 1 million ounces of gold equivalent at a current gold price of 1320 per ounce that s more than 13

neighboring mining districts the rovina valley mine is frequently compared to timok a legendary mining district in serbia yet it is much bigger and provides superior mining economics rovina valley not

government 4 clean technology combined with high productivity euro sun mining esm cpnff has put a lot of money into its research labs it s tried dozens of different chemicals and processes and now it s discovered the secret that makes those types of yields possible the company is now able to extract 20 percent extra gold at zero extra cost the process is dry stacking which virtually eliminates contamination though seepage of groundwater when gold is separated from the hard rock gold recovery was formerly 68 percent now it s 82 percent the concentrate was 9 or 10 percent previously and now

in the pharmacy services segment was driven by an increase in medicare part d membership this top line growth is important because it validates the key elements of our strategy are gaining traction heading forward we are focused on three strategic priorities serving as the trusted advisor to our pharmacy customers providing our customers with a convenient and personalized shopping experience and building a winning value proposition for payers and providers these strategic priorities are designed to capitalize on rite aid s valuable store base and pbm businesses to grow revenues improve efficiency and drive profitability to achieve these priorities we are implementing a number of key initiatives including improving payer relationships to stabilize reimbursement rate pressures working to expand access to limited and preferred networks enhancing our pharmacy clinical capabilities to improve outcomes leveraging our valuable wellness brand refining our merchandising expanding our omni channel capabilities and expanding our pbm envisionrxoptions medicare part d business finally we re also focused on obtaining efficient drug pricing and continuing to control and right size costs through a leaner more efficient structure in terms of improving payer relations and managing reimbursement rate pressure these efforts are already benefiting fiscal 2019 with improvements in reimbursement rate trends advertisement advertisement and we ve made some early progress for fiscal 2020 by gaining increased medicare part d preferred network access in terms of leveraging our valuable wellness brand we have successfully reestablished wellness rewards at an independent loyalty offering while significantly enhancing the program by introducing bonuscash which have been very well received by our customers we ve also continued to build new stores and convert additional locations to our innovative wellness store format which we believe is the best format in the chain drug industry these combined efforts have generated the top line momentum that is reflected in our results in the second quarter we delivered our strongest front end comps in six quarters and our strongest same store prescription count in nine quarters and as we ve said for some time we expect same store prescription count to be stronger in the second half of the fiscal year as we cycle significant plan exclusions from last year at the same time we re making progress growing envisionrxoptions we ve made some important strategic decisions with envision most notably transitioning our medicare part d portfolio to include a higher percentage of chooser members with this transition well under way we continue to expect to gain over 200 000 net new part d lives to begin in 2019 as compared to january 2018 we are also excited to be reentering the california market with our part d chooser product at a very competitive price point as well as minimal premium increases in our existing chooser geographies we expect this will continue to drive significant part d membership growth in 2019 next we have a very important opportunity as we continue our efforts to manage our drug costs in the most efficient way possible as we ve discussed we re exploring all potential options including the option to enter into the wbad consortium and purchase drugs at walgreens price for up to 10 years this option is very significant for helping us drive short term growth because even with our smaller footprint at a minimum we ll be able to purchase generic drugs at the same rate as a key large scale competitor we expect to make our decision this fall and finally we re going to continue our efforts to implement cost savings advertisement advertisement we already have made some significant progress managing sg a expense and have plans to reduce sg a as stores roll off to tsa with wba our goal is to take out 96 million of cost as we better align our organization to our new store footprint and we have a plan to achieve this on a parallel path we plan to make investments in new technology to further strengthen our omni channel capabilities operate more efficiently and enhance the customer experience in our stores and as we generate the momentum in these key areas of our business we have seamlessly executed the tsa with walgreens which is continuing to generate income so as you can see we ve made some important progress during the first half of fiscal year and this progress gives us important momentum as we look to accelerate our near term strategy while heading into our busiest time of year separately we are ramping up our efforts to evaluate our longer term strategy to identify the best approach to further evolving our business in the broader retail and healthcare marketplace as a company we have a strong foundation for future growth we have a trusted and well known brand an award winning loyalty program a unique and differentiated wellness store format and an expanding offering of health and wellness services we have also significantly reduced our debt and improved our balance sheet and we re seeing positive trends in our top line performance in script count while we have a tremendous amount of work ahead of us we have full confidence in our strategy our team and our company to succeed as we build significant momentum for the future we re very excited to continue capitalizing on the key opportunities we have as we enter our critical time of the year at this time i d like to turn it over to our president and chief operating officer kermit crawford who will share additional details about the operational progress that is helping to drive our near term strategy kermit advertisement advertisement kermit crawford president and chief operating officer thank you john and thanks to everyone for joining us today our near term strategy focuses on the most critical areas for driving increased value throughout our organization over the next couple of years today i d like to spend time providing an operational update for each of these areas and further explaining the key initiatives that will be the driving force behind our near term growth one of our most important areas of focus is to continue expanding our access to preferred and limited networks to build on john s comments in addition to envision s medicare part d preferred network we will also participate in one national and two regional preferred networks in calendar 2019 we also continue to have discussions on opportunities to increase both our medicare part d and commercial preferred network access for calendar 2020 maintaining network access will help us to ensure that we successfully capitalized on our current script growth momentum our prescription count has increased ahead of plan as we cycle certain network exclusions and continue enhancing our clinical pharmacy capabilities which drive script growth count while also improving patient health outcomes heading forward we will continue to enhance our clinical capabilities by expanding efforts around medication adherence medication therapy management and immunization in the second quarter our focus on improving medication adherence helped drive an increase in 90 day prescriptions which also contributed to our script growth for the quarter as we look to deliver a higher level of care by providing medication therapy management services to additional patients we also see a tremendous opportunity to grow our highly successful immunization program which is already delivering strong results this year the number of ancillary non flu immunization given by our certified pharmacists nearly doubled during the quarter with the new shingrix vaccine continuing to perform well advertisement advertisement in addition we re entering our busiest time of year for flu shots which are conveniently available with no appointment necessary and at no cost through most insurance plans this year we are prepared to administer another record number of ancillary and flu immunizations while continuing to grow this important part of our business to further support script growth we re also ramping up our efforts surrounding prescription file buys with an eye toward completing a higher number of transactions as market conditions allow year to date we ve completed 20 5 million in file buys and we ve allocated a total of 60 million for fiscal year 19 as we aggressively pursue this growing opportunity to increase prescription count we also have a great opportunity to drive growth by leveraging our valuable wellness brand our highly popular wellness rewards loyalty program remains an important part of our unique brand and it continues to make significant contributions to our business as john mentioned we have successfully introduced bonuscash as our primary savings vehicle for this program bonuscash has significantly increased customer engagement and is now redeemed in one out of every five transactions to further strengthen our brand we have partnered with a top tier marketing and advertising agency in havas north america which helped us develop a comprehensive marketing campaign that is supporting our annual flu immunization program we are supplementing this partnership with four additional agencies with specific areas of focus including t3 for social strategy and content purered for circular design and production elite sem for digital media planning and jpl for email and direct mail another key part of enhancing our brand awareness is through our wellness store format which we believe is the best store format in our industry remodeled and newly opened wellness stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of same store front end sales and script count and by the end of the fiscal year they will represent more than 70 of our entire store base this innovative format will also serve as a showcase for innovation as we continue efforts to refine our merchandising we re really excited to be developing more customized local assortments expanded ethnic and bilingual merchandising and additional healthy options to support our customers in their health and wellness journey and as we optimize the offerings inside of the store we ll also be highly focused on enhancing this customer experience at all touch points as we look to expand our omnichannel capabilities advertisement advertisement we ve already made significant progress with our newly redesigned mobile app which has a 4 7 star rating and is driving increased engagement and prescription refills in addition we are leveraging wellness rewards data to continue our successful shift from print to digital advertising with leading loyalty management platforms being integrated to enhance personalization in all direct channels whether our customers are shopping with us in store or online or using our mobile app or drive through we are highly focused on making sure they have a great rite aid experience another key part of our strategy focuses on growing envisionrxoptions specifically its medicare part d business to date our record growth from medicare part d has continued we have now enrolled over 575 000 part d members and anticipate steady growth for the remainder of the year and meeting our goal of over 600 000 enrolled lives by the end of calendar 2018 all told we would have gained over 200 000 net new part d lives to begin 2019 when compared to january 2018 finally as we move toward the end of the commercial selling season for calendar 2019 while we have experienced a number of wins in terms of lives gained those gains have been offset by the loss of a larger client at the same time we ve been able to secure renewals from the vast majority of our clients with client retention rate expected to be approximately 95 two of our most critical areas of focus will be stabilizing reimbursement rate pressure and obtaining efficient generic drug pricing in terms of reimbursement rate we have made important progress by securing multi year commercial contracts with generic effective rate protection for over 80 of our business to add even greater predictability in reimbursement rates going forward in addition we all understand the significance of delivering the most efficient way possible to manage our drug purchasing costs as john said we are exploring all avenues including the attractive wbad option our current wholesale contract expires in march of 2019 and we are in the process of evaluating pricing to ensure we maximize our profitability going forward and finally in terms of sg a we continue to see significant opportunities to deliver cost savings and improve expense controls this includes evaluating and optimizing our store base we have closed 41 of an identified 100 underperforming locations this fiscal year and continue to evaluate the rightsizing of our organization as we wind down the tsa with wba before i turn it over to darren i d just like to say that i appreciate the many efforts of our team and the operational progress we re making as we execute our near term strategy as john mentioned in the second quarter we delivered our best front end sales performance in six quarters and our best same store script count performance in nine quarters as we look to build on this momentum we continue to assess key opportunities and strategic partnerships that will accelerate the evolution of our long term strategy thank you for your time now i will turn it over to darren karst for more information on our financial results darren darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer thanks kermit and thanks to everyone for joining us today i ll walk through our second quarter financial results and provide an update on the use of proceeds and bond redemptions related to the wba asset sale i ll also touch on some minor changes that we have made to our non gaap performance measures but before i begin that discussion i d like to address the intangible asset impairment charge we took on our envisionrx business we would typically perform an annual assessment of our long live intangible assets including a goodwill impairment test during our fourth quarter however when there are indicators of impairment during the year we are required to test for impairment during interim periods as a result of the changes in our guidance which were primarily driven by industrywide pressures impacting our retail business we were required to perform impairment testing of all of our intangible assets including those at envision during our second quarter after taking into consideration our current growth rate expectations for envision we concluded that there was an impairment of our intangible assets of approximately 283 million net of tax in spite of that accounting adjustment we continue to see tremendous opportunities for growth in our business but the projected ramp up of ebitda growth has been delayed somewhat from our earlier expectations due primarily to slower than expected growth in our commercial business and to a lesser extent the loss of excess to a fertility drug for a direct to consumer program that we administered so as a result the value determined by the discounted cash flow portion of the valuation analysis was lower than when we performed our annual impairment assessment at the end of fiscal 2018 that said we continue to see robust growth opportunities in our med d business and we also expect our commercial business to experience growth over time so despite this non cash charge we remain confident in our ability to grow envision over the long term and continue to view envision as a very valuable asset now let me turn to a review of our asset sale proceeds from wba and our current capital structure as we discussed on our previous calls as of march 27th we had completed the sale and transfer of all 1 932 stores to wba and received cash proceeds totaling nearly 4 2 billion after the end of the second quarter on september 13th we completed the sale of our dayville distribution center to wba and received an additional 60 million of proceeds that were used to further reduce debt these amounts do not include about 160 million that will be received after we sell the two remaining distribution centers to wba which is required before the end of the tsa agreement as we discussed on our last call the proceeds we have received to date have been used to pay off all of our 970 million of term loans our 9 25 notes which we redeemed on april 12th our 6 75 notes which we redeemed on june 25th and we reduced our 6 8 notes by 46 million we ve also reduced our revolving credit commitments from 3 7 billion to 2 7 billion to reflect our reduced borrowing requirements the result of all this debt reduction is that we now have a very manageable capital structure with none of our debt maturing prior to 2023 other than our revolving credit facility we are currently planning to refinance our revolver before the end of fiscal 2019 and expect that maturity to be pushed out to at least 2023 the receipt of proceeds and pay down of debt to date has given us a debt balance net of cash of about 3 4 billion as of quarter end and a leverage ratio of approximately 5 4 times trailing pro forma ebitda or 5 1 times trailing pro forma ebitda when adjusted for the effect of the sale of the distribution centers to wba our liquidity today is strong at over 1 3 billion i ll now turn to a review of our second quarter results note that all of the data that i reference will be for our continuing operations revenues for the quarter were 5 4 billion which was an increase of 76 million from the prior year quarter or 1 4 net loss from continuing operations was 352 million or 0 33 per share versus a net income of 188 million or 0 18 per share in the prior year the net loss in the current quarter was due primarily to the intangible asset impairment charge of 283 million which i previously mentioned net income from the prior year quarter was impacted favorably by the receipt of a one time 325 million merger termination fee from wba other factors driving the increased loss were higher lease termination and impairment charges merger and acquisition related costs and a non recurring litigation settlement charge partially offset by an increase in adjusted ebitda the litigation charge during quarter was related to a settlement of a class action lawsuit whereby rite aid was charged with not providing suitable seating for store associates in the state of california this litigation has impacted and will continue to impact many retailers in california adjusted net loss in the current quarter was 7 9 million or 0 01 loss per share versus adjusted net income of 17 4 million or 0 02 per share in the prior year quarter the increase in lease termination and impairment charges drove most of this difference during the second quarter we did a more extensive assessment of store impairment than we typically do in an interim quarter which was triggered by our guidance change that we announced in august we normally do this more extensive analysis during our annual testing in our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 148 6 million in the current quarter compared to 136 9 million in the prior year quarter fiscal 2018 quarterly results from continuing operations do not include 24 million of fees that would have been earned if all 1 932 stores sold to wba were being supported under the tsa for the entire prior year period if you take into account these potential fees pro forma adjusted ebitda would have been 160 9 in the prior year quarter retail pharmacy segment revenue for the quarter was 3 9 billion which was 10 million or 0 2 higher than last year s second quarter due to an increase in same store sales partially offset by the impact of store closures same store sales increased 1 in the quarter front end same store sales were effectively flat with a slight decline of 0 1 and pharmacy same store sales increased by 1 6 with same store script count up 1 1 on a 30 day adjusted basis the increase in script count reflects the cycling of the impact of being excluded from certain pharmacy networks in the prior year and improved adherence as a result of our clinical initiatives as kermit referenced in his remarks we expect to expand our preferred network access in calendar 2019 total retail pharmacy segment gross profit dollars in the quarter declined 6 8 million compared to last year s second quarter and gross margin was 24 basis points lower as a percent of revenues adjusted ebitda gross profit was unfavorable to last year s second quarter by 7 6 million and 26 basis points worse as a percent of revenues the decline in gross margin was driven by a reduction in reimbursement rates that we were unable to offset with generic drug purchasing efficiencies and script growth while we are experiencing generic drug deflation our generic cost savings in fiscal 2019 have been less than our historical trends and have not met our expectations retail pharmacy segment sg a expenses for the quarter were higher by 2 5 million compared to last year s second quarter while sg a rate as a percent of revenues was flat adjusted ebitda sg a was 23 5 million better than the prior year and 66 basis points better as a percent of revenue our sg a reflects the inclusion of 23 million of tsa fee income from wba in the current quarter adjusted ebitda in our retail pharmacy segment increased by 16 million versus our prior year actual results that decreased 8 million versus prior year pro forma adjusted ebitda which gives effect to the impact of tsa fees our pharmacy services segment had revenues of 1 6 billion which was an increase of 69 million or 4 6 primarily due to an increase in our medicare part d membership as kermit mentioned earlier we had a very successful 2018 medicare part d bid and continue to see strong enrollments this year we are now covering over 575 000 lives and expect to grow covered lives throughout the remainder of the year as we add enrollments through the course of calendar 2018 adjusted ebitda for the pharmacy services segment of 45 million was 4 3 million lower than last year s second quarter adjusted ebitda of 49 3 million the operating results for the quarter were impacted by margin compression in our commercial business and other operating investments as we invest for current year and future growth our cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net use of cash from operating activities of 284 million which was driven mostly by working capital timing more specifically we had higher receivables resulting primarily from a build in our cms receivable at envision and increased receivables from several retail segment payers as well as a typical seasonal inventory build and various other working capital timing differences we expect our cash flow from operations to improve in the second half of the year as these working capital timing items turn around last year s cash flow statement was positively impacted by the 325 million merger termination fee received from wba net cash used in investing activities for the quarter was 45 6 million versus 34 7 million last year during the second quarter we remodeled 33 stores and spent 6 9 million on file buys at the end of the quarter we operated 1 726 wellness stores within our continuing operations and by the end of the fiscal year our wellness stores are expected to make up over 70 of the store base we continue to be pleased with the performance of our wellness stores for the second quarter front end same store sales in our wellness stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 93 basis points higher than our non wellness stores and same store script growth in these stores was 113 basis points higher turning now to our outlook we are confirming our full year fiscal 2019 guidance for revenue same store sales adjusted ebitda and capital expenditures which we had previously updated on august 6th we expect revenues to be between 21 7 billion and 22 1 billion for the full year and same store sales are expected to range from flat to an increase of 1 adjusted ebitda is expected to be between 540 million and 590 million our net loss for the full year is now expected to be between 440 million and 485 million the increase from our previous net loss guidance is due primarily to the non cash intangible asset impairment charge that we recorded this quarter adjusted net income or loss per share is now expected to be in a range between a loss of 0 03 per share to income of 0 01 per share before i turn the call back over to john i want to touch upon a couple of changes that we made to our definitions of adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income we have historically included changes in deferred revenue related to our wellness loyalty program as a reconciling item from net income to adjusted ebitda going forward we have elected to no longer include this item as a reconciling item the impact of this change has relatively minor impact on our annual adjusted ebitda but does sometimes have modest impact to the quarters due to the timing of how the rewards under the program are earned and used by our customers during the loyalty program year the change we ve made to adjusted net income is to include all amortization expense as a reconciling item from net income instead of just including amortization expense related to envision all periods presented in our release have been revised to conform to this revised presentation and with that let me now turn it back over to john to wrap up our prepared comments john john standley chairman and chief executive officer thanks darren before we begin taking questions i d like to thank our rite aid team for all the great work they re doing we ve made some important progress during the first half of the year by transforming our loyalty program converting additional stores to the wellness format expanding our pharmacy service offerings and executing the tsa and as we ve accelerated our strategy in all these areas our team has done an outstanding job of staying focused on delivering a great experience to our customers in fact just like the first quarter our overall customer satisfaction rating reached the new all time high in the second quarter i think that says a lot about the extraordinary team we have here at rite aid and gives us yet another reason to have full confidence in our strategy to grow our business heading forward that concludes our prepared remarks for the call we will now open the phone lines for your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities please go ahead your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst thanks so john let me start with i think in some of your past long term projections you guys had thought that the pbm could grow in the teens long term do you still think that given where we sit today and how much of that would be driven by med d growth off of the 600 000 numbers john standley chairman and chief executive officer so we still believe that firmly today i think if we look at where we are with envision there s no question that some of the strategic activity and m a stuff that we ve been attempting to do here at rite aid has had some impact on this business over the last couple of years i think we had john actually a pretty decent commercial selling season we had a legacy a larger legacy customer that had a different form of agreement than probably what we have with all of our other customers and so it was a legacy issue that we ve kind of worked on here a little bit but ultimately we kind of landed where we landed so i think we ve really been battling through some temporary headwinds on the commercial side our transparent business our transparent offering resonates in the marketplace there s a ton of interest in it and i think as we get some of the noise here kind of past us we re really excited about the growth opportunities of envision medicare part d is an important part of the business we plan to continue to invest there and to focus on growing that business but there is a lot of opportunity for us on the commercial side as well john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst do you think looking out three years med d lives getting to 1 million is that sort of a slam dunk or a stretch goal john standley chairman and chief executive officer i think it s had some rapid growth here but it s a very competitive marketplace it s an annual bid process we have to win every year or be very competitive in the bid every year to grow and lwe ve got some pretty substantial folks that we re competing against in that space so i m not going to give you a long term projection for the lives there but we like where we are in space we re making good progress here i think again we have a product that resonates and so i do think we can grow quite a bit here over the next few years in the part d space john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst all right and then just lastly we haven t heard a lot about wellness kind of where that sits and how that s progressing so maybe just quick update when you look at growth in members growth in gold silver their spending patterns is that the growth in all have we seen a moderation or is there a potential for reacceleration john standley chairman and chief executive officer i think i ll give you an overall comment and bryan got some data there but i think bonuscash has actually gotten some good traction in the marketplace enrollment has picked up since we got bonuscash out there so i think we re making some progress with the program i really think there is a great opportunity to continue to develop and accelerate the spending over time so i think we re in a pretty good place with it right now i mean bryan bryan everett chief operating officer yes john it s bryan here i agree with what john said it s about 7 of our total cardholder base currently that accounts for about 25 of our total funded sales and the great news is that we re at about 96 retention rate on our gold customers so it s a very sticky group for us john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst ok thank you operator your next question comes from the line of charles rhyee from cowen please go ahead your line is open james auh cowen and company analyst hi it s james on for charles about 70 of your stores are expected to be wellness stores by the end of the year i know in the past it s been said that not all non wellness stores will become wellness stores so how much of the remaining 70 i m sorry remaining 30 non wellness stores you expect to transition to wellness format also you ve stated that older wellness stores will be refreshed to some of the newer formats so about how much of the current wellness stores will be getting this makeover and maybe can you help us quantify the difference in terms of performance between newer and older wellness stores in terms of sales or profitability darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer yes this is darren i m not sure we necessarily have a specific number or where the 70 will go there certainly is a group of those stores that may not end up being wellness stores our process really is to continue to kind of take those kinds of stores and probably relocate them to a new location and then they become wellness stores so i would say there would be a lot of that kind of activity in that remaining 30 i don t know if you have john standley chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean i guess the way i think about it is we re 70 of the way there there s still a good chunk of stores to renovate that we have to work with here for the next couple years and as darren mentioned we have some relocation opportunities in this group as well so we re working as we have been and continue to do we re working those real estate locations to see what we can do to get to the right place in the market we even have some opportunities and probably relocate a few of those original wellness stores as we look at the portfolio of stores also so we ve got some great places to invest in the store base at least for the next few years it should help us continue to drive some good growth here and we re seeing a pretty good return i think on the refreshes some of those early wellness stores they had some of the merchandising concepts and things in them but it s really evolved quite a bit since then so when you think about the cadence of this thing we have a good group of stores that are now seven eight years into the wellness program that we can go back to at this point so there s plenty of good spots here to invest continue to invest capital into the store base matt schroeder chief accounting officer and jim this is matt i think on your question on performance if you go out to the slides we put out on a page 10 we ve got some data on how the stores have done from a front end sales and script count perspective but the wellness stores have outperformed the rest of the chain by roughly 100 basis points in both front end and script count and i would say from an roi perspective they are over time generating the returns that we would expect in order to justify the investment john standley chairman and chief executive officer but the reinvestment gets another pretty good pop right matt schroeder chief accounting officer it does it does and the good news is the reinvestment is kind of a fresh up type of capital spend as opposed to a full blown model john standley chairman and chief executive officer yes james auh cowen and company analyst ok great and the current generic bid activity and your current expectation in the generic drug market for the rest of the year led to an 80 million downward revision to adjusted ebitda in early august can you elaborate on what s changed in the generic market relative to your previous expectations that resulted in this revision and what steps are you taking to make sure your expectations in the future are more in line with the market john standley chairman and chief executive officer the second half of that question is a great question actually so yes i think and probably kermit and darren can kind of jump in here clearly we have to kind of estimate what we think we can achieve in savings as we re negotiating our third party contracts on the pharmacy side so we have contracts that are as long as three years into the future so we re constantly kind of looking at the generic drug market trying to understand what the potential savings are there that can help us digest the reimbursement rate pressures that will occur as we enter into those longer term contracts so in this particular instance here looking at our historical trends i think based on information that we had available to us as we built our plan for this current year we had an expectation that generic savings would be more consistent with what we ve seen over the last couple of years as we came through our bid here in the second quarter and it s a pretty substantial bid for us we just weren t at that level of savings that we expected so that s really what drove the change in our guidance we re working carefully with our purchasing partner trying to get the best information they can in terms of the marketplace our team here because we used to buy our drugs directly in the marketplace ourselves we have a team here that has remained very connected to the marketplace so i felt like we had pretty good information there but clearly we didn t get that right so to your point yes we re trying to make sure we re driving the best information we can from the marketplace but it s just not always clear to us as we build these plans how a manufacturer will necessarily behave in the coming year that s the challenge that we have do you guys want to add kermit crawford president and chief operating officer yes i mean the only thing i would add is i mean we certainly did have savings and so we saw generic deflation it just wasn t as significant as it has been in the last couple of years darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer and the only thing i would add is that a lot of times the profitability on these generics will depend on how these new generics come to market the number of manufacturers that actually come to market with these products we don t always have that exact information and those things can change john standley chairman and chief executive officer and i think the number of manufacturers and this is part of our issue on existing drugs can change so we can enter into a year where there s several manufacturers for a drug but if a large manufacturer rationalizes their drug portfolio or takes other actions like that or there s disruption on the regulatory side of drugs that can cause the cost not to land in line with our expectations james auh cowen and company analyst ok and just a follow up to the question on generics theoretically how much of that 80 million could have been offset with this wbad option like what kind of savings would that john standley chairman and chief executive officer so what we ve said on the wbad option is that as we did our work back at the time of the asset sale approximately a year ago that we did identify value in a clean room process associated with the wbad option where we are right now is we re in the process right now of evaluating that option again today as per the agreement so we re in a process a pretty robust process looking at a number of different options in terms of how we go forward including the wbad option and we ll have further comments on that as that process comes to a conclusion kermit i mean do you have anything kermit crawford president and chief operating officer i think you covered it john we re in evaluation process and we expect to complete it this fall james auh cowen and company analyst ok great thank you kermit crawford president and chief operating officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst this is kevin on for bob this morning so you guys said you noted some early progress in getting preferred access to part d networks in 2020 could you guys maybe just specify have your conversations been going after the national plans or have they been more focused regionally and then how does the margin profile on these plans compare to your existing books kermit crawford president and chief operating officer so kevin i would tell you that we re focused on both both national plans as well as a regional plan there s not as much conversation that takes place on these regional plans but these are actually very good plans for us and we ll be in two preferred regional plans one within our express scripts book of business and one within our prime therapeutics book of business so we re continuing to work with our pbm partners and getting into these networks many of these part d preferred networks have multiple year contracts and that s why we re really focused on the 2020 and the margin is it depends on the network we re looking at every one of these networks and we re strategically determining which ones we should and shouldn t get in because we ll have to reprice our business in many cases so we re working to protect our margin we ve continued to stabilize our reimbursement rates we ll continue to do that we ve gotten multi year contracts with our commercial providers we ve got generic effective rate protection in 80 of those networks so we have better predictability of our rate so we re looking at our complete book of business both commercial and part d business to try to maximize the profitability of our entire network kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst great thanks and then i just have one quick housekeeping question so you guys noted you re expecting to push out the revolver maturity into i think 2023 do you guys have any early idea on what interest rate this might get refinanced at darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer i think it s i mean it would probably be somewhat comparable to our existing rate kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst ok great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ross muken from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open suzie yoon evercore isi analyst hey guys it s suzie yoon on for ross just had two quick questions around envisionrx and then maybe another one on the wellness format the vertical deals of two of your largest peers seems to be getting closer to closing is there anything that you re starting to see maybe as a reaction to these deals perhaps around the selling season or your pipeline and then another one on the wellness store format it s nice to see comp results at these stores what do you think are some of the biggest changes within these stores that s driving this uptick in productivity john standley chairman and chief executive officer so in terms of the last selling season i think we are a great option for a lot of regional health plans and we continue to have interest on that front and we have growing relationships with a couple of really important customers today in that space as well and i do think some of the vertical integration that s going on will cause some additional interest as those transactions come to fruition so it s a pretty exciting opportunity for us and we re focused on trying to be out in that marketplace and making people aware that we are kind of an independent option for them if that s of a concern to them so i think that s a pretty exciting opportunity for us what was the second part of the envision question suzie yoon evercore isi analyst oh what do you think are some of the biggest changes within these stores that s driving the performance improvement john standley chairman and chief executive officer on the wellness stores yes it s a pretty dramatic makeover of a store to move to the wellness format there s a number of things that we do both from a merchandising perspective there s some staffing changes i don t know bryan do you want to touch on some of that bryan everett chief operating officer yes i mean expanded assortment for merchandising full new layout of the store the center the pharmacy is repositioned in the store new wellness ambassador position staffing model in the store so it s a complete new redesign of the old format john standley chairman and chief executive officer i think a lot of the merchandising does a couple of things in many instances you can kind of touch and work with product it s organized differently in that it s i think easier to shop we ve done some really important things in the over the counter categories cosmetics and other things just to make the store easier for our customers to work with so it s a pretty different model in terms of what we deliver in the store consultation rooms that are really thoughtfully put into these stores so we can provide additional pharmacy services including immunizations so it s a pretty substantial makeover of the store suzie yoon evercore isi analyst got it appreciate the color john standley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of glen santangelo from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open glen santangelo deutsche bank analyst oh yes thanks and good morning hey john i just want to follow up on a couple of points you ve already discussed but i had some follow up questions first was on the comments you were making about what changed in the generic market in 2q are you making the case that the biggest part of the delta was driven by generic deflation that maybe wasn t as high as maybe what you thought i mean could you elaborate on that a little bit more john standley chairman and chief executive officer that s exactly what it is that s exactly what happened i mean we have gotten pretty substantial generic savings every year for as far back as i can remember so that s really what we have to do in order to offset the reimbursement rate pressure that we have every year and that happens for a couple of different reasons i mean one is as drugs mature generally more and more manufacturers get into them they can come out as single and dual source but then over time you get more and more manufacturers which tends to drive cost down over time on those drugs what we re seeing right now in the marketplace is in some instances some drugs may have too many manufacturers and there s not enough profitability in them and some manufacturers will back away and so the cost on that individual drug may go up instead of down or not go down at all and so those kinds of things kind of offsets some of the savings we get in other places so net net as darren mentioned overall we will have generic drug deflation for the year but not at the level we expect it to offset what we have in terms of reimbursement rate pressure does that make sense glen santangelo deutsche bank analyst yes yes it does could you maybe put some numbers around what you re expecting in terms of branded inflation and generic deflation and how that s impacting your gross margins john standley chairman and chief executive officer we generally don t do that for competitive reasons i would just say on the brand inflation side that slowed down quite substantially over the last couple of years this year is probably just off the top of my head close to where we were last year but it s down a lot from kind of traditional brand inflation levels i would say on the generic side it s quite a bit less the savings that we re getting this year you can see from the magnitude of the guidance change it s a pretty big number glen santangelo deutsche bank analyst maybe if i just ask one last follow up on envision could you maybe discuss the strategic value of envision and the impact it s having on your store operations i mean when you look within envision sort of covered lives are you seeing a material uptick in ride aid scripts within that population because obviously there has been a lot of noise around the administration s blueprint the concern around rebates and in your prepared remarks you even suggested you re ramping up your efforts to evaluate your strategy a little bit more so if you could just sort of elaborate a little bit how that fits into the whole pie and are these businesses maybe as synergistic as you originally thought when you bought it john standley chairman and chief executive officer yes so i mean i think there were a couple of things about our acquisition of them one is it does make us a little less dependent on the retail drug business it diversifies the business a little bit second thing is yes particularly in the medicare part d space it gives us access to a preferred plan that we re in and that s important to us and that has allowed us to drive some script count to our stores but realistically envision is not as big as the big three right it is subscaled to those other assets so it has some synergistic value to it and drives some script count into our stores and we ve made some progress there and i think our opportunity is as we continue to grow it to get more of that kind of going forward so that s really to your point how it kind of fits together with what we re doing today kermit crawford president and chief operating officer it s going to i d just add that this medicare part d customer is our most valuable customer and as you know we have not been in preferred networks around medicare part d one of our strategic initiatives is to get into more of those part d networks we have a significantly higher market share within our envision medicare part d lives versus other of our pbm competitors so the envision network and our role that we play in that network and the market share that we re gaining within the envision network is important to us glen santangelo deutsche bank analyst ok thanks for the comments john standley chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america please go ahead your line is open william reuter bank of america analyst good morning it s a little bit of a follow up on the last question but there s obviously press from time to time that suggests that the pbm could be separated from the rest of the retail business i know that you ve felt that they were relatively synergistic but i guess would you be open to discussing if interested parties reached out to you john standley chairman and chief executive officer i think we really like envisionrx obviously it s a great business it s a very unique asset today in the marketplace in that it is a fully capable freestanding pbm it has its own adjudication platform it has its own formula it provides its own clinical services it has a specialty pharmacy it has a makeover facility so it s a pretty unique animal in the marketplace today and we ve been able i think to as kermit said use those capabilities to help us on a synergistic basis with our business so we think it s a great company and we think it has a ton of growth potential and we think just some of the noise coming from here has probably not helped them over the last couple years but we really believe in it having said all of that we re always going to do what makes the most sense to create value for our shareholders that s our view of the world william reuter bank of america analyst ok and then just one follow up obviously brick and mortar has been the center of the pharmacy industry for such an extended period of time i know that there are articles from time to time that talk about how e commerce might be changing this mail order i guess is there anything you can provide in terms of some commentary about big picture how you think these different sub segments of kind of the pharmacy retail network is going to evolve over the next three to four years john standley chairman and chief executive officer i think as kermit mentioned it digital interaction is increasing quite a bit the tools that we can bring to bear to provide better clinical action clinical interaction and adherence through these tools i think are going to be really important but the pharmacist in our store kind of remains the center of the universe if you will and i think a lot of these things will be supplemental to that mail order it s a little bit different about pharmacy and i m not saying we re not going to be impacted because i m sure we will be so don t take this as we don t think it s an opportunity or an issue but mail order is pretty mature in our industry it s got 18 19 share or something like that today but it s been around for forever and there are issues around ownership of lives and the services that can be provided to those that also impact the way that e commerce will come to bear in our marketplace but from our viewpoint that interaction with the pharmacist is a differentiator in our model that access and availability and what we can do with our pharmacy team as it relates to the relationship that we have with those customers so we think that s an important cornerstone of what we re doing as we go forward kermit i don t know if you want to kermit crawford president and chief operating officer the only thing i would add this pharmacy customer is an omnichannel customer and our goal is to meet that customer s needs wherever whenever however they would want to do that whether it s our convenient locations we drive through whether it s using mobile or our online app whether it s home delivery or mailing i mean we have all of those capabilities and if by chance you need clinical services our new wellness stores are built with consultation rooms to provide those services so we re going to meet that customer where when and how she wants us to provide service william reuter bank of america analyst that makes sense all right that s all for me thank you operator your next question comes from the line of george hill from rbc please go ahead your line is open george hill rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys and thanks for taking the question i guess john i would ask kind of now that we re past the albertsons process and we touched on the pbm a little bit i guess what are you thinking is the big strategic opportunities for the company over the next handful of years to create shareholder value we know that vertical integration is going on with some of the other competitors in the space as a way to move channels near term but i guess as you think about the growth drivers strategically in the business over the next call it two to four years i guess kind of talk about the big opportunities that the company can pursue john standley chairman and chief executive officer well and i think we ve touched on a lot of them here in the content of what we ve gone through but i think that some of this vertical integration is actually going to help us a little bit here i think i ve said this before but i think there s a growing recognition and a couple of these vertical integrations are really going to bring it to bear in the marketplace but i think there s a growing recognition of what we re doing with retail pharmacy is critically important to outcomes with patients and in terms of probably building some relationships here where we can really work with some partners to help them realize the kind of values that are being achieved through these vertical integrations without probably getting that joined at the hip is a real opportunity for us it s clear there s hundreds of billions of dollars of avoidable costs that s incurred because people are either compliant with medication adherence or because things happen after treatment that cause additional cost so we re in a great position to work with an aging demographic to really help drive down overall healthcare costs over the next couple of years and what we have to focus on is bringing the resources that we have in our portfolio here and additional capabilities that we re working on to bear to drive down those costs if we can do that i think we can really have an impact on the quality of life of our patients and we can drive a lot of value for our shareholders george hill rbc capital markets analyst ok i appreciate that maybe a quick follow up on envision in the last reporting cycle the two of the larger publicly traded pbms kind of detailed their rebate retention levels i know envision has much more of a pass through process but would we be safe in assuming that you guys have a similar level or even a lower level of kind of rebate retention earnings risk should we get a change in the lot of lmb compared to the large pbms john standley chairman and chief executive officer yes kermit crawford president and chief operating officer yes john standley chairman and chief executive officer yes george hill rbc capital markets analyst ok all right thank you operator our final question comes from the line of carla casella from j p morgan please go ahead your line is open carla casella j p morgan analyst hi just a few follow ups on the dcs that you re selling to walgreens you mentioned that you ve sold one what was the timing and the amount of proceeds for that darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer it was after the end of the quarter i think it was september something like that and it was 60 million carla casella j p morgan analyst ok and then the other two should happen would that be something that could be this year or is it another year or two darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer well it s really kind of controlled as to when wba wants to purchase them but they must purchase them by the end of the tsa period so that could go out i mean right now the tsa i guess ends before any kind of extensions in october of 2019 yes carla casella j p morgan analyst ok so the tsa ends october 19 and then by then that s when the other dcs would need to be sold kermit crawford president and chief operating officer correct but they could exercise an extension under the tsa for two to six month periods carla casella j p morgan analyst ok great and then you commented that you ll be in one national network and two regional preferred networks in 19 aren t you currently in two national networks and did you lose one or did one switch to regional or something like that kermit crawford president and chief operating officer no the only national network that we re in in this calendar is our envision medicare part d preferred as a preferred now we re in all open medicare part d networks so we participate in all networks medicare part d just one preferred network and that s our envisionrx medicare part d network carla casella j p morgan analyst ok great and then the cms receivable that you talked about which was a big adjustment to your working capital this quarter why didn t you finance it like you normally do and is there just a timing issue there or we should see that working capital reverse darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer i think carla we ve talked this last call we had historically in past years used reinsurance as a tool to finance a portion of that it comes at a cost as well for this year we re not using the reinsurance so it s kind of a one time working capital use if we opt to not to use reinsurance in future years it won t have a significant impact carla casella j p morgan analyst ok and then on the pbm writedown have you said what the value of it is now in the books john standley chairman and chief executive officer we have not we have not said what the value is now on the books darren karst chief financial and chief administrative officer but we can i mean it s a 1 850 billion i think is what the value is on the books carla casella j p morgan analyst ok that s it thank you john standley chairman and chief executive officer ok well i think that wraps up i misquoted a number here i think i gave the mail order script count instead of the market share so the mail order market share is 4 5 or so so just a correction there but otherwise i think we re done for today so i think that wraps up today s call thanks everybody for joining us duration 69 minutes call participants matt schroeder chief accounting officer john standley chairman and chief executive officer kermit crawford

global markets is the robot in control by victor hill 12 april 2019 12 mins to read there are multiple red lights flashing on the global investment flight deck console but the flight controls aren t working anymore victor hill is having a recurring nightmare eurozone blues i ve been having nightmares about being on the flight deck of a boeing 737 max 8 as the anti stall robot takes control and points the nose down in steep descent as the manic crew struggles to regain control then i wake up in a cold sweat and think about european bourses the magi of the european central banking confraternity assembled this week for the ambrosetti forum at the villa d este on the shores of the beautiful lago di como they dined sumptuously despite the harrowing screams emanating from certain eurozone government bond markets the italian debt to gdp ratio is set to rise from 132 1 percent in 2018 to 134 4 percent next year and spreads are widening again over late night drinks they shared their deepest fears italy is very close to default with potentially dire consequences for europe s flagging banking system master investor magazine never miss an issue of master investor magazine sign up now for free read the latest master investor magazine some fear that the eurozone is slipping back into a japan style deflationary trap in which economic growth will go backwards even die hard supporters of the european currency union fear that the single currency may not survive another prolonged recession in europe if the uk has a productivity problem though i have argued that gdp per hour worked the oecd metric is misleading the eurozone particularly its southern belt has a growth problem the ecb s programme of qe over 2012 18 did nothing to address this what it did was to inflate asset prices property stocks and bonds who owns such assets the well off and the rich precisely those who do not use their increased paper wealth to boost consumption further european manufacturing has experienced a precipitous decline over the last six months new orders in germany slumped by 8 4 percent in february year on year this was mainly for three reasons firstly china s economy is slowing growth is at around 6 percent rather than the historically typical 8 percent and is therefore pulling in fewer european principally german manufactures second the automotive industry which is the backbone of manufacturing not just in germany but in france and italy too is being fundamentally disrupted by the animus against diesel and the now inevitable triumph of electrification third european corporate managers especially in germany are becoming more pessimistic and brexit does not help the ecb with catechistic dogmatism shut down its programme of quantitative easing qe in january having committed the purgatorial sin of greed though not the infernal one of lust and now there are no fiscal tools available to amongst others the italian government thanks to the stability pact the rumpus the european commission made over the italian populist government s budget over the winter means that fiscally and monetarily italy has nowhere to go people can vote for what they like populists or not i shall be following the european elections closely this may in which the uk will now almost certainly participate what a laugh but in states in which politicians have been deprived of all control of economic policy the real question is what is the point of voting at all that is the main theme of a book i am writing the splendid ambrose evans pritchard reported in the daily telegraph on tuesday 09 april that germany s former european commissioner günter verheugen had lashed out against the eu for putting britain into an impossible position over brexit herr verheugen told a german tv interviewer that the eu s negotiating team had made a strategic misjudgement and had misunderstood the larger issues at stake he said the british should be offered some input into eu decision making mitsprache on trade policy as any policy to try to subordinate the uk without voting rights is likely medium term to collapse acrimoniously herr verheugen voiced the fear in germany that a bad brexit will only accelerate a european recession and could drive britain into the arms of those the usa who do not hold german interests dear indeed it was the fear of a no deal brexit which would impose 10 percent tariffs on german cars exported to the uk that had the germans twisting arms at the brussels summit in the wee hours of 11 april resulting in the halloween flextension gabriel felbermeyr head of the kiel institute for the world economy told the ambrosetti forum that the eu s brexit strategy should be stopped before it does any more harm to the long term relationship with britain he said that a new form of relationship should be found with nations which reject the principle of ever closer union alas this pragmatic vein of thinking does not impress the french who regard brexit as an opportunity to grab a slice of britain s massive financial service sector and to say au revoir to a stroppy neighbour who always pooh poohed their grandiose plans even though the french statistical agency insee has come up for air saying a no deal brexit would cost the french 1 7 percent of their gdp stick that up your yellow vest monsieur macron i did not want to get into an analysis of the current brexit imbroglio today but i will just observe that even if the may barnier withdrawal agreement were by some miracle to pass through the house of commons between now and halloween the brexiteers would regard it as german nationalists regarded the treaty of versailles 1919 a hated imposition that must be torn up page by page at almost any price even yanis varoufakis has described it as the kind of treaty signed by nations conclusively defeated in war in short it can never be a viable blueprint for britain s future relationship with europe american bottle the federal reserve under chairman jerome jay powell was supposed to put the fear of god into the markets this year with a prolonged spell of quantitative tightening qt those of you who were at the master investor show last saturday 06 april will know that i asked our chairman jim mellon what happened jim s reply was crisp as ever they bottled us interest rates have now probably peaked at 2 5 percent while the european central bank ecb is still lending overnight money to eurozone banks at minus0 4 percent meanwhile the yield on 10 year german bunds has plunged into negative territory as conservative european investors mainly pension funds shift out of corporate bonds in a flight to quality master investor magazine never miss an issue of master investor magazine sign up now for free read the latest master investor magazine while the us economy has been purring along in the second half of mr trump s first term there are two major concerns one is that the fiscal stimulus driven through in january last year may prove as evanescent as plum blossom the other is that the us china trade war might yet end badly for the global economy a recession in europe driven by the inherent deflationary character of the single currency would be one thing but a recession in the usa at the same time would be quite another if there were to be a recession in europe and the us at the same time the central banks would have nowhere to go as there is little scope to cut rates further it might be possible to carry out additional qe where central banks buy government and corporate bonds but most analysts think that there are diminishing marginal returns to qe that means that the more you do it the less stimulus it generates as jim said at the show the central banks have behaved like druggies who need a bigger and bigger fix to get the same high moreover the dodd frank act 2009 has restricted the ability of the fed to lend to whomsoever it likes the new regulatory framework reduces the ability of the fed to lend directly to individual banks that could prove a restriction too far in any future financial crisis my friend john stepek of moneyweek thinks that investors shouldn t worry too much about a recession in the us he thinks that if the american consumer is still spending then that s good news for the global economy good jobs data out on monday suggested that the us economy is still sound with 200 000 new jobs being created in march and wages rising at 3 percent the us treasury yield curve has actually steepened slightly a negative slope being ominous john

curve is still modestly negative and some commodities such as palladium are spiking something which often happens at the end of the business cycle australian woes australian home prices have been falling since late 2017 and that fall is now accelerating i have to admit to some embarrassment here last april i described the australian residential property market as a one way bet yes my judgment was undone by visiting some fabulous australian homes while down under and listening to the confident assertions of my hosts their affluent owners i got that wrong a salutary lesson at least for me sorry business insider australia suspects the downswing will last for quite a while yet the current downturn is now one of the largest on record only surpassed by a handful of periods in the late 1800s and the first half of the 20th century it has even exceeded the decline further to the financial crisis of 2008 09 which australia largely survived unscathed the family home is the largest store of wealth for most australian families combined with weak household income growth falling house prices are likely to impact household spending negatively potentially putting a drag on economic growth as a result many analysts believe the royal bank of australia will cut rates again but there is light at the end of the tunnel expectations about house prices rose to a four year high in april

jpm earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 jpmorgan chase co jpm 0 92 q1 2019 earnings call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chase s first quarter 2019 earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chase s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake ms lake please go ahead marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator good morning everybody i m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page 1 the firm reported record net income of 9 2 billion an eps of 2 65 on record revenue of nearly 30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19 the results this quarter were strong and broad based highlights include core loan growth ex cib of 5 with loan trends continuing to progress as expected credit performance remained strong across businesses we saw record client investment assets in consumer of over 300 billion and record new money flows this quarter and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes up 10 and 13 respectively inaudible number one in global ib fees and gained meaningful share with share well above 9 this quarter in the commercial bank we had record gross ib revenue in asset wealth management record aum and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage turning to page 2 and talking into more detail about the first quarter revenue of 29 9 billion was up 1 3 billion or 5 year on year driven by net interest income which was up 1 1 billion or 8 on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix non interest revenue was up slightly as reported but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year nii would have been up 5 reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while markets revenue was lower there were other items more than offsetting expense of 16 4 billion was up 2 relating to continued investments we re making in technology real estate marketing and front office partially offset by a reduction in fdic charges of a little over 200 million credit remains favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit costs of 1 5 billion were up 330 million year on year driven by changes in wholesale reserves in consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserve this quarter in wholesale we had about 180 million of credit costs driven by reserve builds on select c i client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy once again these downgrades were idiosyncratic it was a handful of names and across sectors net reserve builds to this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolios and we are not seeing signs of deterioration moving on to page 3 and balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 1 up modestly from last quarter with the benefit of strong earnings and aoci gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk weighted assets rwa is up primarily due to higher counterparty credit on trading activity but most of these this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis quarter on quarter loans were down in home lending as a result of a loan sale transaction and the cib as a result of the large syndication and in card and asset wealth management seasonally also on the page total assets are up over 100 billion quarter on quarter principally driven by higher cib trading assets in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions lower end of period loans are partially offset by treasury balances including higher securities in the quarter the firm distributed 7 4 billion of capital to shareholders including 4 7 billion of share repurchases inaudible we submitted our 2019 ccar capital plans to the federal reserve moving to consumer community banking on page 4 ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 with consumers remaining strong and confident core loans were up 4 here year on year driven by home lending and cards both up 6 and business banking up 3 deposits grew 3 in line with our expectations and we believe we continue to outperform client investment assets were up 13 driven by record new money flows reflecting growth across physical and digital channels including you invest we also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets revenue of 13 8 billion was up 9 consumer business banking revenue up 15 on higher deposit nii driven by continued margin expansion home lending revenue was down 11 driven by net servicing revenue on both lower operating revenue and msr but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year on year on disciplined pricing and cards merchant services and auto revenues was up 9 driven by higher card nii on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes expense of 7 2 billion was up 4 driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower fdic charges on credit net charge offs were flat as lower charge offs in home lending and auto were offset by higher charge offs in card on loan growth charge off rates were down year on year across lending portfolios now turning to page 5 and the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 3 3 billion and an roe of 16 on strong revenue performance of nearly 10 billion for the quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 10 year on year and outside of an accounting nuance all of advisory dcm and total ib fees would have been record for a first quarter advisory fees were up 12 in a market that was down benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter we ranked number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share debt underwriting fees were up 21 also outperforming a market that was down driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead left positions in leverage finance we maintained our number one rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share and equity underwriting fees were down 23 but in a market down more as the combination of the government shutdown uncertainty around brexit and the digital ph impacts from the december volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter but already in the second quarter we ve seen a major recovery in us ipo volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and healthcare sectors which again dominate the calendar moving to markets total revenue was 5 5 billion down 17 reported or down 10 adjusted for the impact of the accounting standard last year that i referred to big picture on a year on year basis we are challenged by a tough comparison backdrop in the first quarter of 2018 was supportive clients were active and we saw broad based strength in performance with a clear record in equities last year in contrast this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept clients on the sidelines despite a recovered and more stable environment so with that in mind i would categorize the results as solid and a little better than we thought at investor day just a few weeks ago largely due to a better second half of march and for what it s worth so far the environment in april feels generally constructive but it s too early to draw any conclusions in terms of p l fixed income markets revenue was down 8 adjusted driven by lower activity particularly in rates and in currencies and emerging markets which normalized following a strong prior year however we did see relative strengths in credit trading on strong flows as well as in commodities equities revenue was down 13 adjusted speaking more to the record prior year quarter inaudible performance which was still generally strong across products although derivatives got off to a somewhat slower start cash in particular nearly matched last year s exceptional results treasury services revenue was 1 1 billion up 3 year on year benefiting from higher balances and payments volume being partially offset by deposit margin compression securities services revenue was 1 billion down 4 as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression lower market levels and the impact of a business exit of note deposit margin in both treasury services and securities services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis and at the firmwide level there s an offset finally expense of 5 5 billion was down 4 driven by lower performance based compensation and lower fdic charges partially offset by continued investments in the business the cost to revenue ratio for the quarter was 30 moving to commercial banking on page 6 a strong quarter for the commercial bank with net income of 1 1 billion and an roe of 19 revenue of 2 3 billion was up 8 year on year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit nii record gross ib revenue of over 800 million was up more than 40 year on year due to several large transactions and the pipeline continues to feel robust and active deposit balances were down 5 year on year and 1 sequentially as migration of non operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives have decelerated and we believe is largely behind us from here we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook expense of 873 million was up 3 year on year as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and in technology loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 2 or up 5 adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax exempt portfolio we continue to see solid growth across expansion markets and specialized industries cre loans were up 1 as competition remains elevated and we continue to maintain discipline given where we are in the cycle finally credit costs of 90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance before we move on i want to address the perceived gap between our reported c i growth statistics and those that we will see in the fed weekly data if we look across all of our wholesale businesses we also show strong growth year on year at about 8 but there are three comments i would make the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data second cib is a big contributor for us and cib loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans and third as previously noted the definition of c i for the fed does not include our tax exempt portfolio which has seen significant year on year declines given tax reform so while it s true that the fed data is showing strong growth year on year and apples to apples inaudible mainstream middle market lending space we re seeing good mid single digit demand in line with our expectations moving on to asset wealth management on page 7 asset wealth management reported net income of 661 million with a pre tax margin of 24 and an roe of 25 revenue of 3 5 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as lower management fees on average market levels as well as lower brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains expense of 2 6 billion was up 3 year on year as continued investments in our business as well as other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees for the quarter we saw net long term inflows of 10 billion with strength in fixed income partially offset by outflows from other asset classes additionally we had net liquidity outflows of 5 billion aum of 2 1 trillion and overall client assets of 2 9 trillion were both record up 4 driven by cumulative net inflows in the liquidity and long term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines deposits were up 4 sequentially on seasonality and down 4 year on year reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows finally we had record loan balances up 10 with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page 8 and corporate corporate reported net income of 251 million with net revenue of 425 million compared to a net loss of over 200 million last year the improvement was driven by higher nii on higher rates as well as cash deployment opportunities in treasury and recall last year we had nearly 250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter expense of 211 million is up year on year and includes a contribution to the foundation of 100 million this quarter completing on page 9 to wrap up this is inaudible that really showcases the strength of the firm s operating model benefiting from diversification and scale and our consistent investment agenda we delivered record revenue and net income and a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter underlying drivers across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in march and coming into april the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructive client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum investor day is only six weeks behind us so our guidance for the full year hasn t changed we do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm s performance with that operator we ll take questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous john mcdonald bernstein analyst hi good morning marianne you had good expense control this quarter and your jamie s letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio in each of the main business units for the next few years just kind of wondering what s driving that is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that s going to occur in 2020 or is this kind of positive operating leverage carrying through marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah hey john so i would say just big picture it s a combination of both obviously we talked at investor day about the fact that we re always going to make the net investment the net incremental investment decision based on its own merit but in total with the amount we re spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investments we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years and so that is obviously a lot of the investments that we ve been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation but they are also to do with operating efficiency so we do would also expect to start to see some of that drive operating leverage but it s also in the case that we re looking for revenue growth too so it s a combination of both john mcdonald bernstein analyst okay and then just on the nii outlook it s reassuring to be able to hold the investor day outlook of 58 billion for this year even though the curve s flattened there were some concerns there what are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we ve seen marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i mean the first thing i would say is that we ve said this before and we ve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that it s a bit dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so and so in the big picture we said 58 billion plus yes it s true that a persistent flatter curve would have us more net drag on carry and we re not immune to that so there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that if it is persistent at this level throughout the year but we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that there s a mixed bag of lower for longer so while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on bases necessarily and while lower long end rates may be a net small drag in the short term on earnings there s the credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient fed and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle so net net there are pluses and minuses i would say there may be some pressure as a result of that as it s persistent but it s modest operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo wells fargo analyst hi you mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over 20 billion year over year so those are the numbers i was hoping for a little bit more on the why and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches how is that deposit growth growing how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength i know that came up during the ceo hearings the imf study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so look i would say there s lots of different opportunity for people to get insured deposit so come back to the third point but all of that plays a piece so you ll recall that we ve built a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets in california and florida and nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we re definitely seeing some growth in deposits there i also firmly believe and we ve talked about it many many times that we ve been investing consistently over the last decade in customer experience customer satisfaction in our consumer banking is at an all time high and continues to increase consecutively digital products new products and services value propositions to our customers convenience new markets all of which i think are increasingly important to our customers as well as obviously a number of other factors so to me it s a combination of all of the above and less so at this point a perception of flight to quality the people have a lot of choices year over year i would say we re seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate seeking alternatives so customers are voting with their business they re bringing deposits to us and i think it speaks to a combination of the investments we re making and also including branches mike mayo wells fargo analyst so how much of the deposit growth is due to digital banking can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer well i can tell you that i m sorry it s not just deposit growth as far as i remember it s also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwinds there so i don t have a breakout for you we can follow up it s decent but our branch growth the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence both are important but we can get back to you operator the next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks very much on sec services i heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on revs down could you talk about the business exit i wasn t aware of that how big that is and then flip to the better side you also did mention about organic growth we haven t heard too much since the big trillion dollar win but i know there is stuff going on underneath the covers talk about what type of business you are winning there marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes so on the business exit this is it s the sort of feature of always talking about year over year to me this feels like really old news it was a us broker dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago but obviously we re still on a year over year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues it s about just over 20 million year on year revenue negative impact but it s relatively speaking old news in terms of the exit took place last year lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on revenues and then we are seeing solid underlying growth but this is a very competitive environment and as we are growing our custody assets and as we re growing and winning new mandates fees are under competitive pressures and it also depends on mix so there s a bunch of factors going on what we are focused on is for both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well and even with these revenue pressures we re focused on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good roe businesses above mid teens glenn schorr evercore isi analyst appreciate marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer i m sorry i ll just make one more comment mike i didn t say this on the digital space but i think it s important as we think going forward that as we think not just about our digital assets but digital account opening and that has been a feature of how we are attracting new account 25 of checking production 40 of savings production now able to be open digitally so increasingly digital will be a driver but we will get back to you with the mix all right glenn schorr evercore isi analyst marianne just one quick qualifier on the seven hour marathon the other day in dc besides finding out jamie is a capitalist that s shocking news one of risks that i think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non bank lending and i just wanted to marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah glenn schorr evercore isi analyst get a little qualifier of that i m pretty sure you didn t mean the exposure jpmorgan has to those it s just more risk being taken but if you can just expand on that that would be helpful marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so for sure the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risks to those sectors and our risks are that all the things that we ve always told you about which are relatively modest relatively senior well secured well diversified we look at losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable the comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market and while we wouldn t say necessarily that s systemic being not systemic and suggesting that there won t be problems are two different things not all non banks are situated similarly so there are some healthy fighting well capitalized well and responsibly run companies and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn so the real question for all of this business that is migrated outside of banks is how much of it will be unable to be rolled over refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now so it s not about us but it s about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate within these markets going forward but for a variety of reasons whether it s structured whether it s capital liquidity pricing that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah can i just take the big numbers put on rolling so obviously regulators keep an eye on it and we re not particularly worried about it just to give you some facts the banks there s a 2 3 trillion the banks have generally the senior piece the a piece of about 800 billion or 900 billion then institutional investors some of them are quite right these are life insurance companies funds etcetera owned bps about 900 billion and there s 500 billion what they call direct and think of these as large funds for the most part large funds some are very capable very bright they have long term capital in the institutional piece that i mentioned a lot of them are clos and i know that people are worried about that but if you actually look at the clos they are more equity in those clos they are more funded and both the direct piece and the clo piece is more capital permanent capital so this system is ok it s just getting bigger as more outside regulated sentiment it should be something that should be watched but it s not a systemic issue at this point operator the next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst i had a question for jamie jamie in the shareholder letter you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you re thinking about there jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah so if you look at the business i mean it is just costly you have 3 000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements it is litigious you just look at history you can see that and it s becoming a huge non banks are becoming competitors and they don t have the same regulations the same requirements in the servicing or production so you re having that issue of servicing itself is a hard asset and so we just want to we know it s an important thing for a bank we also want and also we standardize capital since lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital it s just a capital pod far more than it should be if you look at it relative to the real risk embedded in holding mortgages so we just want to have our eyes open look at that go through every piece and structure it in a way that we re very happy going forward we don t mind the volatility we don t mind staying in the business you got to look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay and then separate topic but just a question i wanted to ask because i got a couple of questions on it yesterday the whole group of ceos was asked who do you think could succeed you would a woman or would a person of color succeed you and i don t think you raised your hand and just wanted to understand why and just hear from you why you answered the question that way jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah so what i should have said is that we don t comment on or speculation on succession plan that s a board level issue it s not something you do in congress where you play your hand out in congress but also i was confused by a question likely without a timetable so we have exceptional women and my succession may very well be a woman and it may not and it really depends on the circumstance of the time and it might be different if it s one year from now versus five years from now so that s all of that was i think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what you would likely mean was stuff like that so i inaudible several people on the operating committee who can succeed me betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst thanks i appreciate that that s the answer i expected you we re going to give we wanted to hear from you so appreciate that thanks jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi i just wanted to follow up on the remarks on the mortgage business we did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans and marianne i know you spoke at investor day of the balance sheet optimization strategy which could drive more growth in securities versus loans i m wondering if that what s really driving the slowdown that we saw in resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or a sustainable pace of core loan growth in 2019 marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so mortgages in 2018 2019 are the epicenter of the mortgage so the market itself is more year on year it s about 15 smaller because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates are still higher year on year than they were this time last year so that obviously is having an impact and as we ve been and we re down similarly so we ve added about 6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolio but against that as you saw last year we did a number of loan sales and a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet we re trying to take loans off of our balance sheet core loans of our balance sheet and sell them if we can reinvest in agency mbs and non resi assets that has better capital liquidity characteristics so it s going to be a little bit harder to look at the trend you re going to need to look at things grow so we are originating high quality loans we are adding a number of loans to our portfolio we re distributing based on better execution as that would go but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet steven chubak wolfe research analyst very helpful and just a follow up for me on ccar the fed released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year including some higher card and auto losses in the upcoming exam i m just wondering how does that inform the way you re thinking about capital return capacity and are you still confident in that sustainability of 75 to 100 net payout as well as the 11 to 12 cet1 target marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i didn t hear the second part of the question on losses which losses were up this year that you were mentioning but here is what i would say steven chubak wolfe research analyst the card and auto losses marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the fed model losses for our portfolios and we ve been observing that over time necessarily it s the case that the federal reserve models are typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily because they are industry wide net net it doesn t change our point of view that as we re at 12 1 cet1 right now so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings but we always invest in our businesses first so we are growing our businesses responsibly every time we re adding branches we re adding customers we re adding advisors across our businesses but to the degree that we have excess earnings we ll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of february nothing changed operator next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi good morning marianne quick question i know you mentioned that the increase in npls within wholesale was again idiosyncratic but last quarter there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter is there a way you can give more color as to specific drivers in there i know you said in the past that you expect to normalize that you re off a low base i got that but i mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so the color is there is really no color which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil gas energy releases out you would ve seen quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where there are 100 million inaudible so there s always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades the thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have whether we re seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow and whether we re seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we re banking in and we re just not so it s not to say that we aren t playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle it s not to say we re playing close attention to retail but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter and even if you look quarter over quarter over quarter there s no trend to call out and we have a large wholesale lending portfolio these are extremely modest in the context of that and remember every quarter like we talk about a few because it s non zero but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter and it s not just downgrades it s upgrades and they re approximately of equal measure so we re looking very carefully i think we understand why people are questioning concerned and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle return but we re not seeing it yet brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then a separate question in the mortgage banking it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point over the last five years this quarter was that something in the market something with the rates or was there a one off impacting that number this quarter marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized and there s geography in the home lending business when we do these mortgage loan sales because we re match funded net net there s very little p l but last quarter there was a loss in nir and an offset in rate funding in nir this quarter there s a gain so you ve got a loss quarter gain this quarter both small but nevertheless that s driving the majority of the production margin going up but in addition if you just strip all that noise out which is not material but nevertheless significant quarter over quarter we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning marianne marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you share with us obviously you ve got your de novo branching strategy moving forward and what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so we re really really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the united states but when you talk about branches you are talking about investment for the long term and when i say long term multiple years decades so with respect to the new markets that we re entering these are extremely nascent investments the branches in many cases we haven t even broken ground on however that said early indication these very very early indications are strongly positive we re seeing a lot of excitement in the market we re seeing new accounts in production a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage on the whole you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then following up on some comments you made at investor day and i believe touched on today about technology spending if i recall correctly next year technology spending should be self funding and stabilized at just about where you are today when you compare it to the past five years what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so i just want to reiterate something that i want to make sure you guys completely internalize which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we re getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit that said we ve been growing our technology spend and in particular we ve been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank and that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital r d and the whole lot it s a large number and each year a lot of the dollars that we ve been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them so this is not that we re going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very very heavily in the agenda and in particular in the technology agenda it s just that each year technical difficulty and we ll continue to make the right decisions and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer and we re getting more efficient so in the past the way the technology was delivered was very different and the more that we re in our modern virtualized cloud ready way with new technology each dollar of technology is more productive gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of al alevizakos with hsbc alevizos alevizakos hsbc analyst hi i ve got a quick question and a follow up basically my question is on the treasury services year on year the growth going from double digit you just grow to 3 where apparently the volumes remained healthy but the margins started to deteriorate i wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019 especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double digit growth year on year for the remaining quarters and my follow up question is we talked about change the bank versus run the bank for it budget can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you re spending on innovation thank you marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes okay so first point on treasury services obviously revenue growth was in double digits you re right this quarter inaudible year on year i mentioned earlier that for both of our wholesale businesses we happen to have basis compression between the funding spreads that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines and so that just given where rates have moved headwind this year as the segment results are reported but for the company it s obviously net zero the more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue so you will see margins really compressed on that it s not speaking to deposit flows it s not speaking to volumes and it s not speaking to escalating payouts at this point so we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business with respect to technology spend you ll recall last year we were kind of 60 40 run the bank change the bank and it s more 50 50 this year so 11 5 billion of spend about half and half alevizos alevizakos hsbc analyst thank you very much marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer remember in the change of the bank it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience digital data r d so it s the whole spectrum operator your next question is from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i just wanted to follow up on the net interest income and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter is there anything that s lumpy or one time that you d flag because if you annualize it you re already above the full year target at 58 billion plus and obviously there s day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you re at right now marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer okay so we did slightly better in the first quarter two things driving it one is small but nevertheless is arguably non recurring which is we ve talked about the fact that overall in the company when we do these loan sales that net net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in nii call it 50 million ph approximately and then in addition we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were high yielding than ioer that continued into the first quarter so we did benefit from that and it may or may not continue but we re not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through and so i would say that day count was a drag as we look forward with some opportunities honestly obviously the risk associated with the flat yield curve not big but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure its long end rates stay lower for longer as we don t have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the december rate hike you could see more rates paid to a little bit more into second quarter so there are risks and opportunities we still think it s a decent outlook but i don t think it s conservative i think its 58 billion is straight down the middle at this point the trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short term and we shouldn t over interpret or over chase it at this point i think it s a decent estimate and we ll continue to update you matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago you clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently given may be more positive macro outlook marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer well so i mean we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago so the sort of overall answer is no not really we expected at that point that we would have a patient fed it turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish which we couldn t generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk for the balance sheet obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration but there s natural risk in our balance sheet so overall very little we feel good about the credit the curve is flat and we ll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian bank of america analyst yes hi good morning i just wanted to follow up marianne on the comments in the backdrop for lower rates for longer could you give us a sense on how you re thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale in other words i know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so i ll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing it is 100 driven by what we re observing in our consumer behavior than what we re seeing in deposit flows and so that s the environment that we look at to determine what s happening and you ve seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we ve seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives whether it s investments or whether it s more recently in cds and that may continue we ll continue to watch that it is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end and it s the short end that predominantly drives the sort of deposit pricing agenda so even if the curve is flatter as long as it s because the front end is stable i don t necessarily see deposit costs going down but we re going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly erika najarian bank of america analyst thank you and my follow up question is we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non accruals was idiosyncratic and i m wondering as we look at a tick up in non accrual loans in the corporate investment bank for the past two quarters are we just in the part of the cycle where we re just growing from a low base or should we expect a step down in the second quarter in non accruals similar to how we saw last year marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer there are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter but i would say it s a feature more of extremely low base and so from that any movement whether they are up or down it s somewhat exaggerated but we would continue to call the credit environment benign erika najarian bank of america analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks marianne just if i could ask you you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening and i wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you re seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of the spend numbers are obviously still double digit year over year some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown you are just still saying quite good and then there is this unevenness about just capex and spending and corporate side so just could you just kind of walk us through just where you re seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean i think that as it relates to us and in particular looking at the us consumer you ve got all of jobs more recently auto housing spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it s double digits or whether it s not we re continuing to see that and consumer confidence by the way which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters so for us us consumer has always been strong and confident and even if we re not all time high and confidence is still very high and generally the beta is and even some like housing and also that hasn t necessarily been super strong is looking encouraging and then on the global front it is a little harder but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit and europe would be a good example we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics in brexit and they seem to be fading a little business confidence has recovered a little businesses are still spending on labor so generally a good side of the underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers and even there there s job growth there s wage growth helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having increase and eased so i think generally we feel optimistic across the consumer and the rest of the sector albeit it s sort of green shoots on the wholesale buy so it s early but it s what we were expecting to see and so it may continue ken usdin jefferies analyst yeah and one follow up just on investment banking business you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we ve seen the reopening of the ecm market your general outlook just again on that global point about the a bit unevenness between us and global just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today but had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter but how is that side of the business you re feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i would say that a couple of things obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018 and so we did benefit from that but just as a general market matter m a is still attractive in a low growth environment albeit a growth environment investors are still constructive north america which is by far the biggest market for m a is still healthy and so europe was a big driver last year and europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue although we have a pretty good position there so i would say that the pipeline is down but still m a is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth ken usdin jefferies analyst that makes sense thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe just a follow up on the nii outlook i mean i think we ve talked about a flat curve what kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating it doesn t sound like you re in that camp but if you were to get a rate cut how do you manage that how do you think the balance sheet reacts and nii reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer right so the market which is usually more i would say pessimistic but more in that camp inaudible expecting and ease at the end of the year so we are not by the way as you point out so i think for 2019 s nii outlook it s not a clear and present danger and there will be any obviously we have on the way up on rates been over indexed to total end rates and so clearly if we were to have an ease it would have an impact on our nii if we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet but right now the fed is on course right now that s constructive for corporate deposit margins constructive for credit and generally constructive for how we re positioned on the balance sheet jim mitchell buckingham research analyst it s still you like you have room to i guess extend duration to kind of protect nii and nim if that would happen marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes yes we do jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hi good morning i wanted to follow up on matt s question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness this is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus especially in ccb but there weren t a lot of obvious non core items really called out so marianne can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there is some idiosyncratic things that weren t necessarily called out during the call you mentioned corporate cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there so are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call into question how sustainable the results are marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so first of all just sort of big pic first of all really high i think is a bit of an overstatement higher i think is fair no not really if there were you know we would have called them out there are a few little things so i m just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned we contributed 100 million to the foundation this quarter net net even with a very very small but nevertheless positive this quarter so there s a few little bits and pieces like that but if you look at revenue performance we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting we did better in ibcs and we gained a lot of share we did a little better in markets we did a little better in nii so we just got a little bit of a wind on our backs sort of phenomenon my probably my best answer to you is as happy as we are with the performance and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we got in our businesses we are not making material changes to our full year outlook so we ll still see how market performed for the year we do still expect as dimon mentioned at investor day that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5 and 10 year on year so we do expect to gain share to help offset that but last year was a record so we haven t changed our full year guidance at all yet we ll take this as a very good down payment to that and if markets are constructive and wallet expands we will benefit from that but saul martinez ubs analyst okay no that s marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer we re not leading across and changing everything saul martinez ubs analyst that s helpful i ll change gears a little bit any update on distressed capital buffer what the fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so the best i know there is a chance but not necessarily a probability that there could be an scb proposal for 2020 ccar so there s a set of meetings or a meeting coming out sometime in the summer that i think might be an important moment but we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand the better way to bridge growth capital together with point in time capital but it s complicated so as we said the most important thing is not to issue an scb proposal it doesn t deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively so we re talking about gsib we re talking about minimums we re talking about basel we re talking about scb it s complicated i d say there s a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 ccar saul martinez ubs analyst got it thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of marty mosby of vining sparks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning marty marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks for taking the question hey good morning first i want to ask as going to ccar now we re getting into that season again one of the things that i think has an impact is that what we had was a significant 30 plus growth in earnings last year so if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward and you think of holding payout ratios so to say they were just constant doesn t that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sales just to increase fairly significantly just off the increase in earnings last year marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer i think yes yes if you look at payout ratios obviously it s sort of described as a percentage then we said over the longer term we d expect to payout in a benign environment between 75 and 100 and analysts have estimates of 90 plus and obviously as earnings grow that would be a bigger dollar number but again we ll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise so we ll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds but you re right as earnings continue to grow a strong payout ratio we re above the top end of our capital range so we are starting at a robust level would be a higher dollar number yes marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then jamie i was just curious i think one of the issues facing the industry and just we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time and so if we look at it i think there s things that you re seeing or marianne that you see inside the company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon so just wanted to get your comment on that as well that s my follow up question thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i guess i sorry go jamie jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yes some sort of number that s out that australia had growth for 28 years and just so i m saying in notional but you have to have a recession they ve had a lot of back winds there s growth in asia and stuff like that but if you look at the american economy the consumer s in good shape the balance sheet s in good shape people are going back to the workforce companies have plenty of capital and capital expenditure is still up year over year little bit less this quarter than last quarter capital is being retained in the united states business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high and not all time peaks rather high so you can just easily it can go on for years there s no law that says it has to stop we do make a list and look at all the other things geopolitical issues lower liquidity so there maybe a confluence of events that somehow cause the recession but it may not be in 2019 2020 2021 obviously at one point though there will probably be something and yeah i think the bigger short term risk would be something to go wrong in china the trade issues in china so i just wouldn t account on there having to be a recession in the short run kind of years marty mosby vining sparks analyst i agree thanks operator question comes from the line of andrew lim with societe generale andrew lim societe generale analyst hi morning thanks for taking my questions so my first question is on the end of period loans so if we look across the board it looks like there are some contraction there on a quarter to quarter basis of about 3 of 4 and i was just wondering if you saw that as a one quarter issue relating to what happened in 4q 18 and if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies ceos inaudible emerging again marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes so quarter on quarter and i think i mentioned a couple of these things but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end of period basis loans are down so like stepping through them the first one i would point out is mortgage and we just talked about that i think earlier in the call which is we continue to originate mortgage loans we continue to distribute them on portfolio we did do a loan sale which is part of the discussion that we ve been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet we did a sale at the end of the quarter so that s impacting mortgage loans in the cib and one of the reasons why we call out core loan growth ex cib is because we don t consider cib loans core because they are just by their nature oftentimes more episodic and lumpy and so we did see a see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter and then in our other businesses in asset wealth management a bit of seasonality a few pay downs in card seasonality so it s just sort of combination of factors but i would say two drivers cib and home lending cib on sort of a large syndication home lending on a loan sale ph going forward we ll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes but just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending i look at the middle market space and say we re still seeing solid demand it is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries that we re still growing that portion of our loans in the mid single digits year on year andrew lim societe generale analyst yes great thanks so my following question is on marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer before you go into that there are going to be other areas where we just won t inaudible i mean in commercial real estate you see loan growth is much lower it s very competitive its prices have come down we continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans but we re not going to chase it down and similarly auto andrew lim societe generale analyst sure okay thanks so my follow on question is on clos so as some japanese institutions are big buyers of us highly rated clos but a few weeks ago the japanese fsa introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5 risk retention by us issuers in order for the japanese institutions to buy them so i m just wondering if you re seeing yet any change in demand from japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there is any change in behavior from us clo issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5 risk retention marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so that is a great question the answer i m going to give you is not that i m aware of at this point but i ll have to follow up with you jamie are you aware no so andrew we ll come back to you not that i m aware of but it is a good but nevertheless quite detailed question andrew lim societe generale analyst okay thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thanks operator there are no further questions at this time marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thank you everyone operator thank you for

thank you and good morning everyone we welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings conference call on the call with me today are john standley chief executive officer bryan everett chief operating officer and ben bulkley chief executive officer envisionrxoptions and matt schroeder chief financial officer on today s call john bryan and ben will provide an update on the business matt will provide an update on our fourth quarter results and provide guidance for fiscal 2020 and then we will take questions as we mentioned in our release we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today these slides are provided on our website www riteaid com under the investor relations information tab we will not be referring to them in our remarks but hope you ll find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call before we start i d like to remind you that today s conference call includes certain forward looking statements these forward looking statements are presented in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ these risks and uncertainties are described in our press release in item 1a of our most recent annual report on form 10 k and in other documents that we file or furnish to the securities and exchange commission also we ll be using certain non gaap measures in our release and in the accompanying slides the definition of the non gaap measures along with the reconciliation to the related gaap measure are described in our press release and slides with these remarks i d like to now turn it over to john john standley chief executive officer thanks byron and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today during the fourth quarter we continued generating critical momentum in key areas of our business while also taking important steps to position rite aid for future success to help us build on this momentum we have also developed a comprehensive business strategy that specifically defines our top priorities and provides rite aid with a clear path to the future for long term sustainable growth i ll be discussing the strategy in more detail later in today s call as you know operational efficiency has been one of our top priorities to that end we recently took an important step forward by announcing a restructuring to right size our organization as the tsa with wba winds down as announced we re reducing managerial layers and consolidating roles throughout our organization to align current operations with our new footprint we expect annual cost savings of about 55 million from the restructuring with approximately 42 million to be realized in fiscal year 20 this is important because we expect tsa revenue to be lower by approximately 40 million this year as we complete this restructuring we re also implementing a leadership transition the board has initiated a search for a new ceo and i will stay throughout that process to ensure a smooth transition while changes like these are never easy this restructuring represents a critical step in becoming a more efficient company that is better positioned to deliver value in addition as previously announced rite aid stockholders have approved a reverse stock split of the company s outstanding shares of common stock our board of directors has now approved the implementation of the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1 for 20 rite s common stock will begin trading on a split adjusted basis on the new york stock exchange as the market open on april 22 2019 implementation of the reverse stock split should enable us to regain compliance with the new york stock exchange listing requirements in terms of our results for the quarter while adjusted ebitda met our expectations we re still not where we want to be in terms of performance there s no doubt that we re dealing with a very challenging environment for retail and pharmacy reimbursement rates and that these trends affected our results at the same time we also generated positive results in critical areas of our business in the retail pharmacy segment in addition to our success with our various script growth initiatives over the past few quarters we also administered a record number of flu shots and drove strong growth in ancillary immunizations and despite a mild cough cold and flu season we increased same store pharmacy sales and prescription count for the third consecutive quarter in our pharmacy services segment increased medicare part d enrollment helped drive a 1 2 increase in revenue for the quarter and a 4 5 million increase in adjusted ebitda as you know we recently announced the addition of ben bulkley to our team as ceo of envisionrxoptions ben is an outstanding leader with a proven track record for driving results through innovation and operational excellence we re excited to have him as part of our team and he will be joining us later in the call to provide additional details on envisionrxoptions business while we know there are opportunities for organic growth in our business we also know the dynamics of retail and healthcare are changing rapidly and that it s critical to develop a strong plan for our long term future as i alluded to earlier we spent significant time over the past several months taking a close look at our go forward strategy we ve analyzed all aspects of our business including engaging with outside consultants to ensure that rite aid has the best possible strategy for achieving long term sustainable growth this included a thorough analysis of the marketplace so that we can better understand the needs of pharmacy customers and tailor our mix of services and products to deliver an even higher level of convenience and care as a result we have developed a clear path to the future that will position rite aid to capitalize on its strongest capabilities and core competencies to help improve health outcomes for more patients our strategy focuses on three top priorities first we will leverage and more clearly align our unique capabilities like the expertise of our pharmacists health dialog rediclinic and envisionrxoptions to help payers in delivering a higher level of care to patients specifically we know there s more that we can do to work with payers to drive positive health outcomes for chronic and poly chronic patients we already have related experience in this area following our pilot of rite aid health alliance which saw us partner with local physicians and hospitals our health alliance pilot provided us with some key learnings that we can now apply as we look to make a stronger play in the value based care market second we are reimagining our front end offer we have the right selection of products and services to meet the needs of our target consumers this will include executing a full sku optimization program the continued migration of our product mix to have a greater emphasis on health and wellness and the identification of new services we can offer at the store level third we are continuing our efforts to fundamentally transform our processes and procedures to ensure strong cost discipline unlock capacity and achieve peak operational efficiency in addition to the organizational restructuring i mentioned earlier we ve identified specific expense reduction initiatives in areas such as store operating expenses advertising and non headcount backoffice expenses while we have always been focused on these areas our thorough review process identified further opportunities to reduce complexity in our business and drive efficiency we have also identified opportunities to improve working capital these efforts will drive additional savings that we will use to make critical strategic investments for future growth with our strategy in place we re excited to be fully focused on building momentum for our business going forward we re also excited to have a number of dynamic and talented leaders taking on new roles within our organization to help us execute and strengthen our go forward strategy matt schroeder who you ll hear from later in this call is our new chief financial

everett chief operating officer thank you john and good morning everyone i ll start by saying that i m very excited for the opportunity to take on additional responsibilities and lead in this new role as a team we have made some good progress in improving our business and while we still have work to do heading forward i m confident in our rite aid team and strategy and optimistic about our future as an organization in terms of our key initiatives as john said we ve driven same store pharmacy sales and prescription count growth for three consecutive quarters a key factor has been our success with immunizations as we delivered a record of more than 2 3 million flu shots and growth of 78 in ancillary immunizations in fy 19 we also ramped up our investment in prescription file buys by spending a total of 45 million compared to 29 million in the prior year for this year we have allocated 60 million for prescription file buy opportunities also during the year we completed 134 wellness remodels and this highly successful format now represents nearly 72 of our chain the wellness stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of both same store front end sales and prescription count and they will continue to play a key role as we aggressively test innovation to drive even better customer experiences our wellness rewards program also continues to play a key role in delivering value to our customers we have over 13 million active wellness rewards members and we will continue leveraging this very popular program to provide a higher level of personalized marketing that drive sales and customer loyalty the key initiatives i ve mentioned provide a strong foundation from which to build as we focus on accelerating our transformation in fy 20 to support these efforts we have identified several key areas of opportunity we understand that providing best in class clinical pharmacy services represents a critical opportunity to deliver a higher level of care to our customers while also positioning rite aid for sustainable growth in the emerging value based healthcare marketplace a great example is our launch of rite care in fy 19 rite care is a state of the art tool that provides our pharmacists with real time alerts for clinical service opportunities without having to access a separate application to position us in delivering a higher level of care we must continue finding ways to operate more efficiently so that we can free up additional time for our pharmacists to provide personalized services to our patients this includes a continued focus on increasing predictive refills through programs like automated courtesy refills and one trip refills and other workflow improvements to reduce our cost to fill we will also expand on our central fill capabilities throughout the year tools like these will help us continue to execute our aim strategy aim stands for adherence immunization and medication therapy management or mtm and these services represent our gateway into value based care and in recent years we ve made significant progress in expanding these offerings by gaining efficiencies in the pharmacy and providing best in class services through aim we will be in an even better position to further expand our offering and begin working with key payer partners to close gaps in care we must also deliver on our priority to be a low cost provider that s why it was so critical to lock in the best possible drug cost which we have accomplished through our recent 10 year agreement with mckesson we will also continue working with payer partners to manage reimbursement rate pressure with a focus on gaining access to additional limited networks heading forward in the front end we are completing a comprehensive evaluation of our business to better support our target consumer this includes completing a sku optimization and remerchandising key categories to better meet the needs of our customers it also includes introducing additional better for you items especially in consumables and beauty one of our biggest areas of focus will be growing our own brand penetration over the next few years we believe this area presents enormous potential and our go forward plan includes introducing new items enhancing our product mix and additional consideration to how we market and promote these items early this fiscal year we ll be relaunching our best selling own brand of otc products rite aid pharmacy and we re also in the final stages of repositioning the thrifty ice cream brand and expanding sales to additional states in addition we ve heard from many customers about their interest in purchasing cbd products in response to this interest this month we will begin piloting the sale of cbd creams lotions and lip balms at rite aid stores in oregon and washington to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers in those communities as we analyze and evolve our front end business we ll also be examining our marketing to make sure that we are targeting the right opportunities to grow our business at the same time we know that today s retail consumer is looking to shop and engage with brands in a number of different ways and as a team we re highly focused on meeting these needs and are exploring various options to further enhance our omni channel capabilities including making key strategic investments we will significantly grow our e commerce business again this year we will continue developing our mobile capabilities and further expand our self checkout pilot expect to see more self checkouts at rite aid stores in the coming year additionally we are also exploring mobile checkout solutions we continue to offer same day prescription home delivery in the majority of our markets at no charge for our wellness gold and silver members this service has been very well received and continues to grow we see further expanding home delivery as a key opportunity which is why we re also partnering with instacart a technology driven on demand service to pilot another convenient option for home delivery we will continue to refine and enhance our home delivery capability in the months to come we are also excited to be partnering with amazon to introduce amazon lockers to more than 900 rite aid stores over the next few months to give customers another option to pickup or return their amazon packages this effort will bring additional traffic into our rite aid stores heading forward we ll continue to look for new ways to engage with customers both in store and online to create a seamlessly connected customer experience finally it s really important that we continue to thoroughly understand current trends and how they relate to the products that we sell to that end we are concerned about some of the alarming statistics regarding the use of e cigarettes and vaping products by children and teens according to the centers for disease control and prevention tobacco use among our nation s youth grew nearly 38 between 2017 and 2018 this has been driven largely by an increase of e cigarette use which over the past year has increased 78 in the high school demographic and 48 for middle school age children while many feel these products are beneficial to those of legal age who are trying to quit the use of tobacco we have made the decision to remove all electronic cigarettes and vaping products from our offering at all rite aid stores we will remove this product over the next 90 days in addition we will continue to rigorously enforce our chainwide id all policy that requires identification to purchase any age restricted item we will also continue evaluating our entire front end offering to ensure that we are meeting both the needs and the expectations of our customers before i conclude i wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank our rite aid store associates our field leaders our distribution center partners and corporate team members for all they ve done this year i can t say enough about how our team has been able to stay focused on providing great service to our customers as we ve navigated through some significant challenges it s truly an honor to be taking on a new leadership role as part of this extraordinary team as i said earlier our team recognizes that we have important work ahead of us in order to continue positioning our company for sustainable long term growth at the same time we re ready to do this important work and to continue delivering great experiences to our valued customers i believe in our team i believe in our brand and i m excited about our company s future i m also looking forward to working with the other leaders who are taking on new roles within our organization and this includes ben bulkley our

bulkley chief executive officer thank you bryan i m pleased to be part of the envision and rite aid teams and feel strongly about our opportunity to grow in a market increasingly hungry for our mix of solutions the transparent pbm model is an important option right now and no organization has more experience with it then envision this was a big draw for me to join the team and since i ve started i

motivated to do the important work of supporting clients and their members it s also a team that has the grit to grow in a competitive market i ve been impressed by the team s talent and enthusiasm

well as being easy to work with our growth will always be based on providing better and better levels of service delivering innovative products and of course disciplined execution i would like to provide some additional details to the results on the quarter which included 4 5 million increase in adjusted ebitda primarily driven by continued growth in medicare part d enrollment we are very pleased with the growth of our med d business and all told we now have roughly 635 000 enrolled part d members for plan year 2019 in terms of open enrollment for the plan year 2019 we added 95 000 new lives with our larger than expected dis enrollment in geographies or rite aid divested stores resulting in approximately 22 000 net new med d members we expect med d membership to grow over 10 for the plan year 2019 the strategic decisions over the last few years are beginning to pay off most notably our number of chooser ph members in our plans has increased from 77 000 in calendar 2016 to 352 000 today we re also excited about the progress in the current year 2020 commercial selling season with several regional and health plan rfps in house a number of finalist opportunities and a new regional health plan alliance already in place all told we ve won new commercial clients during the 2020 selling season that add over 220 000 lives and have several exciting prospects in the pipeline envision is well positioned to take advantage of the consolidation that is occurring in the marketplace in addition we re also excited about how envision can play a key role in defining an integrated value proposition for payers as rite aid positions its unique assets to drive the greatest value to the enterprise we look forward in working together and bringing this vision to life by driving positive patient health outcomes and creating even greater value in today s healthcare marketplace thank you for your time now i ll turn it over to matt schroeder for more information on our financial results matt matt schroeder chief financial officer thanks ben and thanks to everyone for joining us today on this morning s call i ll provide a recap of the refinancing of our credit facility that we completed in december walk through our fourth quarter results and review our fiscal 2020 guidance on december 20 2018 we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility as a result of this refinancing we replaced our 2 7 billion revolving credit facility with the new facility that includes a 2 7 billion revolving credit facility and a 450 million term loan these new credit facilities are scheduled to mature in december of 2023 with a springing maturity at december 31 2022 if we have not repaid or refinanced our 6 125 notes due in april of 2023 before that date the interest rate on the revolver has improved by 25 basis points over the old revolving credit facility our covenants under the new senior secured credit facility remains substantially unchanged this refinancing pushes out our debt maturities until 2023 and increases our current liquidity to 1 7 billion this important refinancing strengthens our balance sheet and gives us the flexibility to make investments necessary to execute our growth plan as well as provide the time needed to execute on our strategy now i ll turn to a review of our fourth quarter results revenues for the quarter were 5 4 billion which were essentially flat to the prior year s results net loss from continuing operations was 255 6 million or 0 24 per share versus a net loss of 483 7 million or 0 46 per share in the prior year s quarter current year net loss was impacted by a charged income tax expense to record a 197 million increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets i ll point out that our current federal tax affected nol carry forward is 225 million and with none of our federal nols expiring until fiscal 2029 this represents a valuable shield against future federal cash taxes adjusted net loss in the current quarter was 13 3 million or 0 01 per share versus adjusted net loss of 7 8 million or 0 01 per share in the prior year quarter our decline in adjusted net loss was primarily due to a decline in adjusted ebitda which was 134 1 million in the current quarter compared to 154 8 million in the prior year quarter retail pharmacy segment revenue for the quarter was 3 97 billion which was 28 million lower than last year s fourth quarter our increase in comparable store sales was more than offset by the impact of the 82 underperforming stores that we have closed since the end of last year same store sales increased 70 basis points in the quarter front end same store sales were down 1 9 but pharmacy same store sales increased 2 1 with same store script count up 80 basis points on a 30 day adjusted basis the increase in script count reflects the continuing impact of our pharmacy initiatives including our immunization program and our focus on improving clinical capabilities we are pleased that we were able to grow scripts this quarter despite cycling a very strong flu season in the prior year s fourth quarter front end sales were negatively impacted by soft performance in tobacco due to regulation changes that prohibited the sale of tobacco in certain new york stores beginning january 1 and in over the counter cough cold and flu products due to cycling last year s strong flu season total retail pharmacy segment gross profit dollars in the quarter were 111 million lower than last year s fourth quarter and gross margin was 259 basis points lower as a percent of revenues lifo expense increased 53 2 million due to higher levels of pharmacy inflation in the current year adjusted ebitda gross profit was unfavorable to last year s fourth quarter by 54 5 million and a 117 basis points worse as a percent of revenues pharmacy gross profit was worse than prior year s fourth quarter on a dollar and rate basis due to reimbursement rate pressure that we were not able to offset with generic drug purchasing efficiencies and comparable store prescription growth distribution expenses were unfavorable due partially to the realignment of stores within our distribution network front end gross profit was worse than the prior year s fourth quarter due to decreases in front end sales but front end margin improved due to good markdown management and favorable shrink results retail pharmacy segment sg a expenses for the quarter were 37 8 million lower than last year s fourth quarter while sg a rate as a percent of revenues improved by 76 basis points adjusted ebitda sg a was 29 1 million better than the prior year fourth quarter and 55 basis points better as a percent of revenue our sg a improvement was driven by an increase in tsa fee income from wba and lower payroll and advertising expense our pharmacy services segment had revenues of 1 5 billion which was an increase of 18 million or 1 2 primarily due to an increase in our medicare part d membership adjusted ebitda for the pharmacy services segment of 37 8 million was 4 5 million higher than last year s fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 33 3 million the increase in revenue was partially offset by increases in sg a expense as we invest for current year and future growth our cash flow statement for the quarter shows a use of cash from operating activities of 216 million during the fourth quarter we remitted 180 million of the payment for our 2017 plan year cms receivable to the reinsurer which had a negative impact on our working capital we did not utilize reinsurance for the cms receivable in 2018 we also saw a decrease in accrued interest due to the payoff of several of our debt instruments with proceeds from the wba asset sale during the year other differences were due to timing in receivables and payables our debt balance net of cash was approximately 3 3 billion at year end and our leverage ratio was 5 7 times adjusted ebitda which takes into account the pro forma impact of the sale of the remaining distribution centers to wba now let s turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance similar to others in the retail pharmacy space we are facing significant pharmacy margin headwinds as the lack of new generics in the break open period and market conditions with regards to generic supply are expected to negatively impact our ability to offset reimbursement rate pressures with drug cost savings these industry headwinds will more than offset the benefits we received from the extension of our supply agreement with mckesson we expect total sales to be between 21 5 billion and 21 9 billion and same store sales to be in a range of flat to an increase of 1 we expect to have positive script comp growth through a continued focus on our clinical capabilities and prescription file buys and we ll be looking to expand into additional preferred networks in calendar 2020 at envision we expect additional commercial med d business to offset some client losses that we will be cycling during fiscal 2020 as we turn our focus to the 2020 selling season we expect adjusted ebitda to be between 500 million and 560 million in addition to the pharmacy headwinds noted above we expect to offset the loss of tsa income in fiscal 2020 with the impact of the headcount reductions that we announced last month we also expect rent expense to increase by 11 million as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard we have identified further cost reduction opportunities that we will be aggressively pursuing which we expect to offset the impact of wage and benefit inflation our net loss guidance includes an estimate of 55 million for restructuring expenses related to the rightsizing of our organization that we announced last month and the initiatives that john and bryan discussed earlier on the call i expect the restructuring expense estimate to be refined in future quarters as we further develop these initiatives keep in mind that this restructuring expense is not part of adjusted ebitda or adjusted net income we expect adjusted net income to be in a range of a loss of 7 million to income of 36 million or a range of a loss of 0 01 per share to income of 0 04 per share our fiscal 2020 capital expenditure plan is to spend 250 million which includes 60 million for script file buys and investments in technology designed to accelerate our digital and omni channel offering we are planning to open or relocate eight stores and remodel 70 stores in fiscal 2020 this completes my portion of the presentation and now i ll turn it back to john john standley chief executive officer thank you matt and before we open the lines for questions i d just like to state that despite a challenging environment for pharmacy reimbursement rates we are well positioned to build on our strengths and capitalize on our best opportunities for future growth we have important momentum in key areas such as same store pharmacy sales and script count cost control in our pharmacy services segment based upon our analysis of the marketplace and a thorough understanding of our target customers needs we also have a clear strategy for our path to the future that will leverage our core competencies and unique capabilities in delivering improved patient care see us ph reimagining our front end business and drive further efficiency to fuel strategic investment and finally we also have ample liquidity and a stronger balance sheet which gives us the time and flexibility we need to execute our strategy for growth while we have some critical work ahead of us we also have full confidence in our team our strategy and our company to succeed as we build momentum for the future that concludes our prepared remarks for the call we will now open up the phone lines for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst hey john two things number one if we think about the decline in adjusted ebitda in 2020 that is entirely concentrated in the retail segment is that fair and then secondly it sounds like you still believe the retail business can grow ebitda long term what does it take what s the most important prerequisite to get there is it to have a significant improvement in reimbursement pressure is that the most important thing john standley chief executive officer well i guess to the first part of the question yeah it s the decline in adjusted ebitda is focused on the retail side of the business i m a believer in the retail business john i really do think this thing can grow over time i mean i think if you i know we re a little negative here on the comps but if you kind of look at what we ve been through the last few years i think we re still in a really great position here and we ve done a lot of work here on this business over the last several months while it s not obviously a huge impact on fiscal year 20 i think we ve built a plan here with a lot of great initiatives and activities in it that we think is going to really reinvigorate this business and move it forward and so while maybe there s a little bit upside to what we ve got in the guidance here we think there s a big impact for us in fiscal year 21 so we ve got a lot of good things kind of working behind the scenes here reimbursement rate obviously is a little bit of the limiter on our results it s going to depend on how that kind of plays out over time from where reimbursement rates were honestly two years ago to where they are today it has gotten a little bit better for us but obviously we ve seen some tightening on the generic market as well so we continue to work with payer partners to try and find solutions that work for both of us that allow them to be competitive in the marketplace but also allow us to make appropriate returns in our investments to do to deliver the services that we re delivering the other thing i would just say on the reimbursement rate side john is that we i think have a lot of core capabilities here to really drive better outcomes health outcomes in the marketplace and i think a key part of where we re going is to really leverage those capabilities that should make us a better partner a more valued partner as we go forward and so i think it all sort of fits together for us we think it all comes together in a singular way that takes us forward so we re going to fight the reimbursement rates it s going to be a challenge but there s a lot of there s enough opportunity here with improvements to the business and we think additional revenue streams that we can access that we can actually grow this business over time john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst and then two quick things if i think about the cost inflation on the retail side of the business right labor rent et cetera is that in the 2 2 5 range is that about right and then secondly when you think about your vision for the front end in sku optimization so i take it that is not otc hba that is more food and consumables what do you think when you think about revitalizing the front end and i still think wellness is a key part of that but is it assortment is it the value proposition has gotten stale how do you assess that john standley chief executive officer i think i would just say and i ll kick it over to bryan i think assortment is a piece of the puzzle for us we ve got to continue evolve the merchandising inside the store we made a lot of progress when we went to the wellness format but i think we have another opportunity another kind of turn of the wheel here to take the merchandising forward own brand is a huge opportunity for us there s so much more that we can do in that space as we push forward here and kind of getting the noise of the past behind us i think is opening some doors for us to gain additional access to things that really i think help us kind of push forward there and i do think there are some additional services that we can do inside the box you talked about wellness but tying that in with the wellness ambassadors and other things we can do with pharmacists those are all going to be big parts of how this kind of plays out i know bryan you want add something bryan everett chief operating officer john it s bryan to answer the first question i think that s probably a fair range although we work to offset these additional expense challenges just through operating efficiencies and technology so we feel pretty good about that just to build on john s comments we ve really identified beauty health vitamins and consumables as the four categories in the front of the store that we will continue to invest in in terms of differentiation and we will edit the assortment but it s also an introduction of cleaner products more better for you products as john mentioned a huge effort around own brand we have a lot of opportunity there and it s actually pretty exciting and then we re also looking at our marketing as we shift some of these dollars to more personalized more digital more relevant offers that we have access to through our again our loyalty program and just moving away a little bit from the mass message to a more personalized message lot of work john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is open michael minchak jpmorgan analyst thanks it s actually michael minchak in for lisa this morning first question you guys talked about the focus on gaining access to limited networks going forward we ve seen significant traction in the part d market but what are you seeing in the commercial market has there been increased uptake of preferred in our networks there and then you also highlighted the emerging value based care marketplace so you re starting to see interest from payers or pbms around high performance networks or outcomes based reimbursements and if so is that discussions that you re having for calendar 2020 or is that sort of more of a longer term opportunity at this point john standley chief executive officer i think it s probably both in terms of the commercial marketplace it s still i d say kind of a gradual uptake in terms of narrow preferred networks there there s interest in it but it s not moving at the speed that part d has we think there s a unique opportunity for us we ve built some care models in the past we were kind of connected more at the provider level where we really drove some improved health outcomes we think there s a real opportunity for us to connect deeper at the payer level particularly in working with envisionrxoptions here there s a lot of interest that we we ve kind of been out and surveyed the market place a little bit there s a lot of interest particularly in the regional health plan space folks are really looking in terms of how they re going to compete with these bigger vertically integrated sort of healthcare models we think there s some exciting opportunities for us potentially in that space and others as we kind of dig in here with the kinds of things that we can do with the core competencies that we have so that s where we think a lot of the opportunity is there s been a lot of action over obviously in the part d space and even some in the commercial space with some of our reimbursement being tied to outcomes in terms of what we deliver on various key metrics in the pharmacy so that s kind of an ongoing trend i d say michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it and then you ve talked about opportunities around prescription file buys can you talk about what that pipeline looks like at this point with the ongoing reimbursement pressure that you and your larger competitors have been discussing are you seeing an increase in the number of opportunities for file buys and can you talk about whether there s been any changes in terms sort of the relative historical valuations on script files matt schroeder chief financial officer yeah mike it s matt i ll jump in and tackle this one i think from the standpoint of there s always been kind of a pretty robust pipeline there s a surprising level of churn in this business when you get past kind of some of the get down into the independent level there s quite a few independence there s a lot of churn in the business and the other thing is i think you are seeing some competitors probably more on the big box and grocery level who are looking to scale back their pharmacy have looked to scale back their pharmacy offer and that s put some stuff in the pipeline as well it s competitive it s competitive on a kind of deal by deal basis it all depends on who s in the marketplace as far as valuations i think in the past we ve used a range of 10 to 20 per script and i d say that range still holds michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then if i could squeeze one more john standley chief executive officer hey mike i would just throw one more thing on to that we talk about buying files we talk about preferred networks and things i mean a big opportunity for us is really about the capacity we have in this business today i mean we have the ability to add a lot of script volume here there s a high component of fixed cost in operating our retail pharmacies so between those kinds of opportunities and again trying to build relationships with payer partners on outcomes and using that to bring more foot traffic into the stores as well we think there s a lot of value we can create here and those file buys and preferred networks have a low incremental cost to fill so we can afford to make some investments there michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and if i could squeeze one more on the pbm side as we think about the hhs rebate rule on rebates at the point of sale as it relates to your pbm can you talk about the potential impact to your business if that were to go in place as proposed and if we were ultimately to see a shift away from rebates in the commercial market can you talk about how much of your profit is driven by retained rebates and sort of what the impact would be on your business going forward if rebates were to go away ben bulkley chief executive officer so right now mike this is ben we retain no rebates in our medicare medicaid lines to our commercial clients we pass all your rebates in our transparent model so the key question with the proposed ruling is one of timing given as we move into our bids coming up and having a stable set of rules our expectation is we ll be bidding off of the rules that are in place at the time and we hope to do well with that michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it appreciate the comments operator our next question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst hi this is kevin on for bob this morning thanks for taking the question so first obviously reimbursement pressure seems to be having a meaningful impact on you guys and your competitors this upcoming year i was just wondering if there is any detail you can give around expectations or cadence for the retail gross margin through fiscal 20 and whether you expect we should see any improvement in margins off of the fiscal 4q levels thanks john standley chief executive officer sure i think that s a great question again i think for us when you look at just overall the cadence of reimbursement rate i think this last year and this coming year fiscal year 20 they are at reduced levels from where they were just the two years prior to that we actually saw much deeper declines and the issue for us this coming year is a little bit probably more on the purchasing side having said that we re actually not quite yet buttoned down for fiscal year 2020 we still have an open contract that we re working through so our guidance is based on the best information we have right now based on where we think rates are going to land in terms of cadence i think you re right generally the fourth quarter even into the first quarter here it takes us a little bit of time to get the generic savings through our various bids and also little bit of timing on how some loes are coming to market in the year so a little bit more pressure early and then as those savings and some of the loes kick in the back half that really pushes us along kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks and then one quick one on cash flow so if i look at the fiscal 20 guidance for ebitda and kind of factor out interest capex and some of the restructuring it s getting me to roughly break even for cash flow for next year so one is that like roughly correct and would you expect net working capital to be a meaningful swing factor one way or other next year john standley chief executive officer yeah first of all your math is correct you kind of walked the ebitda down to the cash interest and debt rent and capex you get to a flat cash flow i would say some of these initiatives we re focusing on could have a working capital impact and we re going to be pushing hard on those i don t want to meaningful is probably a big numbers but i think my expectation would be we d have some positive working capital benefit coming through this year kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks guys john standley chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning in your guidance you talked about reimbursement rate pressure and 20 being similar to 19 can you tell us what the reimbursement rate pressure would have been on a dollar basis in 2019 and i think there s a lot of commentary in the industry that these reimbursement rate pressures are accelerating so i guess it was a little surprising that you said it was similar so if you could comment on that as well john standley chief executive officer well i mean i think we all have different contract renewal dates and cadences we ve never i don t think it s appropriate for us to give that out because it starts to get what our actual rates are so don t think that s the right thing to do but because of the timing of renewals and we took a lot of rate declines a couple years ago when we were working through some of our merger activity so it does show up different times in different places i think i don t think we all have to be at exactly the same spot at any given moment we do still have an open contract to work through for the current year so we got to get that finalized but our comments are accurate our rate pressure is probably where it s going to be we think based on what we know so far it s going to be pretty similar for our fiscal year 20 as it was for our fiscal year 19 bryan everett chief operating officer and i think i would add is i think the commentary around the generic market between the kind of introductions that are single source and the supplier things that some of our competitors have been saying as well that s a pretty big factor on pharmacy margin for sure william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst that makes sense and then i don t think if i remember that you have ever quantified the new mckesson agreement in terms of the tailwind there is there anything you can provide there because i think it becomes effective in march or i guess a month ago john standley chief executive officer no it s actually is back in the fourth quarter bryan everett chief operating officer it s already effective we ve never given kind of a number it s in the guidance we don t break out all the various components of pharmacy margins william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then just lastly from me it would seem to me that given the transparency of envisionrx business model it would be a little better position given a lot of these i guess headlines that are coming out in the market i guess do you think that that is the case and do you think that this is going to allow you to win additional medicare part d in those 2020 negotiations for bidding ben bulkley chief executive officer yes this is ben we do we re seeing a really nice uptick in the health of our funnel we re off to a great start already this year so we re very positive on the progress we re making and clients are indicating a real hunger for this option as they consider their buying decision william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay i ll pass it to others thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ross muken from evercore your line is open suzie yoon evercore analyst hey guys this is suzie yoon on for ross i think most of my questions have been asked but you mentioned you ve initiated the search for a new ceo could you just provide us with an update on management plans and what the timeline looks like for the ceo cfo and coo hiring john standley chief executive officer well we ve got a cfo matt schroeder is here and he is our cfo so that s good news we have a coo bryan everett s here i m the guy on the bubble and i know the board is actively working on the search so did i answer that question i m not sure suzie yoon evercore analyst got you thank you john standley chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of karru martinson from jefferies your line is open karru martinson jefferies analyst good morning guys in terms of tsa wind down you talked about 42 million of savings coming through this year being realized what s the cadence of those savings and what s your level of confidence on offsetting that full 96 million matt schroeder chief financial officer first of all the cadence of the savings is pretty much starting right away and going through the year i mean with the restructuring we announced last month is being in action very quickly so i would say that s pretty evenly spread through the year john standley chief executive officer i mean probably a little bit less in the first quarter and more in the back matt schroeder chief financial officer yes on the 96 million karru i think as we ve moved along here through the tsa wind down i think we ve done actually a pretty good job of not leaving stranded costs in the business for that we talked about how this 40 millions is going to almost directly offset the reduction in tsa fees that we re expecting for this year i think between the other initiatives we have out there plus kind of the rest of the run rate impact of the restructuring we ve already announced i m very confident we ll offset that 96 million karru martinson jefferies analyst okay and then in terms of the pro forma leverage here that s assuming the that 160 million ph or so comes in from walgreens as excess proceeds and those would go to the 2023 notes correct matt schroeder chief financial officer it assumes that the 160 million is a reduction in our debt i think we still have some limited excess proceeds offer we need to make on the 2023 notes i don t know if it winds up dollar for dollar but there s a little bit more we need to do there karru martinson jefferies analyst okay and then lastly you guys talked about looking at your front end and aligning it with your customer needs we ve seen some talk about looking at the card section bringing in the cbd oils and things of that nature how do you look at transforming and what parts of your business do you feel are lagging and what parts have traction with the consumer today bryan everett chief operating officer karru it s bryan i ll just kind of reiterate the overall sku optimization project to really try to identify skus that are unproductive get those out reallocate that space for more better for you cleaner products natural organic and then the own brand it s probably the one to answer the last part of the question it s probably the one where we have the most opportunity to make up ground on karru martinson jefferies analyst all right thanks very much guys operator and we have time for one more question our final question today will come from the line of bryan hunt from wells fargo securities your line is open bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst thank you just sticking with karru s questioning have you all done any initial reset testing on the front end and what type of reactions are you getting from sales and margin improvements on those resets bryan everett chief operating officer bryan it s bryan we have experimented with a number of different we call them innovation sets both in grocery healthcare but we ve got a lot more work to do so the new wellness remodel we still believe is a very shoppable and easy to navigate experience we believe the layout in that format is still very good but when you start digging into the item selection within the departments we again think there s some opportunity to sort of edit what we have at shelf the new grocery innovation that we worked on that we talked about a little bit last quarter i think we have this in about 150 stores we re getting very good feedback from consumers about the expanded assortment of healthy offerings the easier to navigate aisles etcetera so i guess the short answer is yes we have quite a few of these different tests out there in the field and we will continue to do so john standley chief executive officer and i would just add that we re working through a process it ll go through a good part of this fiscal year that again as we think about the pharmacy side of the business and really some core customers that drive both the pharmacy and the front end and how we can better meet their needs we re also looking at what kind of disease states are we talking about we re looking a little bit more locally and regionally about how these stores should be merchandised and trying to get all those pieces of puzzle really to fit together as we go forward bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst and when you look at all these test alerts on the pharmacy side and the additional services you may add are in the front end in terms of merchandising do you all expect to have some type of more formalized plan that can be rolled out next year or do you feel like john standley chief executive officer that s exactly right we got a ton of work going on behind the scenes here so i ve got parts out being tested and what not but it s going to come together in a more formal way for fiscal year 21 and we d be talking about it each quarter as it develops here bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst great just a couple more questions one you look at the amazon lockers can you talk about which stores where you have amazon lockers today and maybe how the performance of those front ends may differ relative to stores that don t john standley chief executive officer bryan we have these lockers in a few stores and i would say just generally we see some traffic generated from these lockers we will be expanding this over the next few months to an additional 900 stores we re actually 900 in total so we are excited to move forward with that partnership bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst if you look at the at the cbd opportunity i know you re rolling it out in a few states it seems like there s a lot of noise in that category in terms of product purity is there any way you can communicate to us which brand or brands you re rolling out john standley chief executive officer what i can say bryan is we have two vendors that we have been working with for several months actually and like any product we put in the store there s a pretty rigorous vetting process to make sure we have the best offering available the other comment i would make is at this point in time we are only offering the topical solutions of creams lip balms lotions we won t be carrying any of the injectables at any of our stores as part of the pilot bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst and then my last question there s a measles scare in various parts of the country you have stores in those areas are those vaccinations that you all could provide and are you seeing any difference in performance i guess in certain parts of the country given the various scares on measles and maybe other viruses currently thank you that s it i appreciate your time john standley chief executive officer okay it s a short answer the answer is yes we do provide these vaccinations and yes we are seeing an increase in the administration of these immunizations and we have supply to do so bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst well thank you for your time and best of luck john standley chief executive officer thank you bryan operator and we have no further questions john standley chief executive officer okay great we appreciate everybody s time today and look forward to talking to you in the future operator thanks to all of our

participants prepared remarks operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chase s first quarter 2019 earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chase s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake ms lake please go ahead marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator good morning everybody i m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page 1 the firm reported record net income of 9 2 billion an eps of 2 65 on record revenue of nearly 30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19 the results this quarter were strong and broad based highlights include core loan growth ex cib of 5 with loan trends continuing to progress as expected credit performance remained strong across businesses we saw record client investment assets in consumer of over 300 billion and record new money flows this quarter and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes up 10 and 13 respectively inaudible number one in global ib fees and gained meaningful share with share well above 9 this quarter in the commercial bank we had record gross ib revenue in asset wealth management record aum and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage turning to page 2 and talking into more detail about the first quarter revenue of 29 9 billion was up 1 3 billion or 5 year on year driven by net interest income which was up 1 1 billion or 8 on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix non interest revenue was up slightly as reported but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year nii would have been up 5 reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while markets revenue was lower there were other items more than offsetting expense of 16 4 billion was up 2 relating to continued investments we re making in technology real estate marketing and front office partially offset by a reduction in fdic charges of a little over 200 million credit remains favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit costs of 1 5 billion were up 330 million year on year driven by changes in wholesale reserves in consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserve this quarter in wholesale we had about 180 million of credit costs driven by reserve builds on select c i client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy once again these downgrades were idiosyncratic it was a handful of names and across sectors net reserve builds to this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolios and we are not seeing signs of deterioration moving on to page 3 and balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 1 up modestly from last quarter with the benefit of strong earnings and aoci gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk weighted assets rwa is up primarily due to higher counterparty credit on trading activity but most of these this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis quarter on quarter loans were down in home lending as a result of a loan sale transaction and the cib as a result of the large syndication and in card and asset wealth management seasonally also on the page total assets are up over 100 billion quarter on quarter principally driven by higher cib trading assets in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions lower end of period loans are partially offset by treasury balances including higher securities in the quarter the firm distributed 7 4 billion of capital to shareholders including 4 7 billion of share repurchases inaudible we submitted our 2019 ccar capital plans to the federal reserve moving to consumer community banking on page 4 ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 with consumers remaining strong and confident core loans were up 4 here year on year driven by home lending and cards both up 6 and business banking up 3 deposits grew 3 in line with our expectations and we believe we continue to outperform client investment assets were up 13 driven by record new money flows reflecting growth across physical and digital channels including you invest we also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets revenue of 13 8 billion was up 9 consumer business banking revenue up 15 on higher deposit nii driven by continued margin expansion home lending revenue was down 11 driven by net servicing revenue on both lower operating revenue and msr but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year on year on disciplined pricing and cards merchant services and auto revenues was up 9 driven by higher card nii on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes expense of 7 2 billion was up 4 driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower fdic charges on credit net charge offs were flat as lower charge offs in home lending and auto were offset by higher charge offs in card on loan growth charge off rates were down year on year across lending portfolios now turning to page 5 and the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 3 3 billion and an roe of 16 on strong revenue performance of nearly 10 billion for the quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 10 year on year and outside of an accounting nuance all of advisory dcm and total ib fees would have been record for a first quarter advisory fees were up 12 in a market that was down benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter we ranked number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share debt underwriting fees were up 21 also outperforming a market that was down driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead left positions in leverage finance we maintained our number one rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share and equity underwriting fees were down 23 but in a market down more as the combination of the government shutdown uncertainty around brexit and the digital ph impacts from the december volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter but already in the second quarter we ve seen a major recovery in us ipo volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and healthcare sectors which again dominate the calendar moving to markets total revenue was 5 5 billion down 17 reported or down 10 adjusted for the impact of the accounting standard last year that i referred to big picture on a year on year basis we are challenged by a tough comparison backdrop in the first quarter of 2018 was supportive clients were active and we saw broad based strength in performance with a clear record in equities last year in contrast this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept clients on the sidelines despite a recovered and more stable environment so with that in mind i would categorize the results as solid and a little better than we thought at investor day just a few weeks ago largely due to a better second half of march and for what it s worth so far the environment in april feels generally constructive but it s too early to draw any conclusions in terms of p l fixed income markets revenue was down 8 adjusted driven by lower activity particularly in rates and in currencies and emerging markets which normalized following a strong prior year however we did see relative strengths in credit trading on strong flows as well as in commodities equities revenue was down 13 adjusted speaking more to the record prior year quarter inaudible performance which was still generally strong across products although derivatives got off to a somewhat slower start cash in particular nearly matched last year s exceptional results treasury services revenue was 1 1 billion up 3 year on year benefiting from higher balances and payments volume being partially offset by deposit margin compression securities services revenue was 1 billion down 4 as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression lower market levels and the impact of a business exit of note deposit margin in both treasury services and securities services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis and at the firmwide level there s an offset finally expense of 5 5 billion was down 4 driven by lower performance based compensation and lower fdic charges partially offset by continued investments in the business the cost to revenue ratio for the quarter was 30 moving to commercial banking on page 6 a strong quarter for the commercial bank with net income of 1 1 billion and an roe of 19 revenue of 2 3 billion was up 8 year on year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit nii record gross ib revenue of over 800 million was up more than 40 year on year due to several large transactions and the pipeline continues to feel robust and active deposit balances were down 5 year on year and 1 sequentially as migration of non operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives have decelerated and we believe is largely behind us from here we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook expense of 873 million was up 3 year on year as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and in technology loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 2 or up 5 adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax exempt portfolio we continue to see solid growth across expansion markets and specialized industries cre loans were up 1 as competition remains elevated and we continue to maintain discipline given where we are in the cycle finally credit costs of 90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance before we move on i want to address the perceived gap between our reported c i growth statistics and those that we will see in the fed weekly data if we look across all of our wholesale businesses we also show strong growth year on year at about 8 but there are three comments i would make the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data second cib is a big contributor for us and cib loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans and third as previously noted the definition of c i for the fed does not include our tax exempt portfolio which has seen significant year on year declines given tax reform so while it s true that the fed data is showing strong growth year on year and apples to apples inaudible mainstream middle market lending space we re seeing good mid single digit demand in line with our expectations moving on to asset wealth management on page 7 asset wealth management reported net income of 661 million with a pre tax margin of 24 and an roe of 25 revenue of 3 5 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as lower management fees on average market levels as well as lower brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains expense of 2 6 billion was up 3 year on year as continued investments in our business as well as other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees for the quarter we saw net long term inflows of 10 billion with strength in fixed income partially offset by outflows from other asset classes additionally we had net liquidity outflows of 5 billion aum of 2 1 trillion and overall client assets of 2 9 trillion were both record up 4 driven by cumulative net inflows in the liquidity and long term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines deposits were up 4 sequentially on seasonality and down 4 year on year reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows finally we had record loan balances up 10 with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page 8 and corporate corporate reported net income of 251 million with net revenue of 425 million compared to a net loss of over 200 million last year the improvement was driven by higher nii on higher rates as well as cash deployment opportunities in treasury and recall last year we had nearly 250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter expense of 211 million is up year on year and includes a contribution to the foundation of 100 million this quarter completing on page 9 to wrap up this is inaudible that really showcases the strength of the firm s operating model benefiting from diversification and scale and our consistent investment agenda we delivered record revenue and net income and a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter underlying drivers across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in march and coming into april the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructive client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum investor day is only six weeks behind us so our guidance for the full year hasn t changed we do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm s performance with that operator we ll take questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous john mcdonald bernstein analyst hi good morning marianne you had good expense control this quarter and your jamie s letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio in each of the main business units for the next few years just kind of wondering what s driving that is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that s going to occur in 2020 or is this kind of positive operating leverage carrying through marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah hey john so i would say just big picture it s a combination of both obviously we talked at investor day about the fact that we re always going to make the net investment the net incremental investment decision based on its own merit but in total with the amount we re spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investments we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years and so that is obviously a lot of the investments that we ve been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation but they are also to do with operating efficiency so we do would also expect to start to see some of that drive operating leverage but it s also in the case that we re looking for revenue growth too so it s a combination of both john mcdonald bernstein analyst okay and then just on the nii outlook it s reassuring to be able to hold the investor day outlook of 58 billion for this year even though the curve s flattened there were some concerns there what are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we ve seen marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i mean the first thing i would say is that we ve said this before and we ve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that it s a bit dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so and so in the big picture we said 58 billion plus yes it s true that a persistent flatter curve would have us more net drag on carry and we re not immune to that so there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that if it is persistent at this level throughout the year but we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that there s a mixed bag of lower for longer so while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on bases necessarily and while lower long end rates may be a net small drag in the short term on earnings there s the credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient fed and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle so net net there are pluses and minuses i would say there may be some pressure as a result of that as it s persistent but it s modest operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo wells fargo analyst hi you mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over 20 billion year over year so those are the numbers i was hoping for a little bit more on the why and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches how is that deposit growth growing how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength i know that came up during the ceo hearings the imf study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so look i would say there s lots of different opportunity for people to get insured deposit so come back to the third point but all of that plays a piece so you ll recall that we ve built a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets in california and florida and nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we re definitely seeing some growth in deposits there i also firmly believe and we ve talked about it many many times that we ve been investing consistently over the last decade in customer experience customer satisfaction in our consumer banking is at an all time high and continues to increase consecutively digital products new products and services value propositions to our customers convenience new markets all of which i think are increasingly important to our customers as well as obviously a number of other factors so to me it s a combination of all of the above and less so at this point a perception of flight to quality the people have a lot of choices year over year i would say we re seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate seeking alternatives so customers are voting with their business they re bringing deposits to us and i think it speaks to a combination of the investments we re making and also including branches mike mayo wells fargo analyst so how much of the deposit growth is due to digital banking can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer well i can tell you that i m sorry it s not just deposit growth as far as i remember it s also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwinds there so i don t have a breakout for you we can follow up it s decent but our branch growth the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence both are important but we can get back to you operator the next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks very much on sec services i heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on revs down could you talk about the business exit i wasn t aware of that how big that is and then flip to the better side you also did mention about organic growth we haven t heard too much since the big trillion dollar win but i know there is stuff going on underneath the covers talk about what type of business you are winning there marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes so on the business exit this is it s the sort of feature of always talking about year over year to me this feels like really old news it was a us broker dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago but obviously we re still on a year over year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues it s about just over 20 million year on year revenue negative impact but it s relatively speaking old news in terms of the exit took place last year lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on revenues and then we are seeing solid underlying growth but this is a very competitive environment and as we are growing our custody assets and as we re growing and winning new mandates fees are under competitive pressures and it also depends on mix so there s a bunch of factors going on what we are focused on is for both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well and even with these revenue pressures we re focused on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good roe businesses above mid teens glenn schorr evercore isi analyst appreciate marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer i m sorry i ll just make one more comment mike i didn t say this on the digital space but i think it s important as we think going forward that as we think not just about our digital assets but digital account opening and that has been a feature of how we are attracting new account 25 of checking production 40 of savings production now able to be open digitally so increasingly digital will be a driver but we will get back to you with the mix all right glenn schorr evercore isi analyst marianne just one quick qualifier on the seven hour marathon the other day in dc besides finding out jamie is a capitalist that s shocking news one of risks that i think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non bank lending and i just wanted to marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah glenn schorr evercore isi analyst get a little qualifier of that i m pretty sure you didn t mean the exposure jpmorgan has to those it s just more risk being taken but if you can just expand on that that would be helpful marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so for sure the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risks to those sectors and our risks are that all the things that we ve always told you about which are relatively modest relatively senior well secured well diversified we look at losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable the comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market and while we wouldn t say necessarily that s systemic being not systemic and suggesting that there won t be problems are two different things not all non banks are situated similarly so there are some healthy fighting well capitalized well and responsibly run companies and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn so the real question for all of this business that is migrated outside of banks is how much of it will be unable to be rolled over refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now so it s not about us but it s about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate within these markets going forward but for a variety of reasons whether it s structured whether it s capital liquidity pricing that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah can i just take the big numbers put on rolling so obviously regulators keep an eye on it and we re not particularly worried about it just to give you some facts the banks there s a 2 3 trillion the banks have generally the senior piece the a piece of about 800 billion or 900 billion then institutional investors some of them are quite right these are life insurance companies funds etcetera owned bps about 900 billion and there s 500 billion what they call direct and think of these as large funds for the most part large funds some are very capable very bright they have long term capital in the institutional piece that i mentioned a lot of them are clos and i know that people are worried about that but if you actually look at the clos they are more equity in those clos they are more funded and both the direct piece and the clo piece is more capital permanent capital so this system is ok it s just getting bigger as more outside regulated sentiment it should be something that should be watched but it s not a systemic issue at this point operator the next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst i had a question for jamie jamie in the shareholder letter you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you re thinking about there jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah so if you look at the business i mean it is just costly you have 3 000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements it is litigious you just look at history you can see that and it s becoming a huge non banks are becoming competitors and they don t have the same regulations the same requirements in the servicing or production so you re having that issue of servicing itself is a hard asset and so we just want to we know it s an important thing for a bank we also want and also we standardize capital since lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital it s just a capital pod far more than it should be if you look at it relative to the real risk embedded in holding mortgages so we just want to have our eyes open look at that go through every piece and structure it in a way that we re very happy going forward we don t mind the volatility we don t mind staying in the business you got to look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay and then separate topic but just a question i wanted to ask because i got a couple of questions on it yesterday the whole group of ceos was asked who do you think could succeed you would a woman or would a person of color succeed you and i don t think you raised your hand and just wanted to understand why and just hear from you why you answered the question that way jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah so what i should have said is that we don t comment on or speculation on succession plan that s a board level issue it s not something you do in congress where you play your hand out in congress but also i was confused by a question likely without a timetable so we have exceptional women and my succession may very well be a woman and it may not and it really depends on the circumstance of the time and it might be different if it s one year from now versus five years from now so that s all of that was i think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what you would likely mean was stuff like that so i inaudible several people on the operating committee who can succeed me betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst thanks i appreciate that that s the answer i expected you we re going to give we wanted to hear from you so appreciate that thanks jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi i just wanted to follow up on the remarks on the mortgage business we did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans and marianne i know you spoke at investor day of the balance sheet optimization strategy which could drive more growth in securities versus loans i m wondering if that what s really driving the slowdown that we saw in resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or a sustainable pace of core loan growth in 2019 marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so mortgages in 2018 2019 are the epicenter of the mortgage so the market itself is more year on year it s about 15 smaller because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates are still higher year on year than they were this time last year so that obviously is having an impact and as we ve been and we re down similarly so we ve added about 6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolio but against that as you saw last year we did a number of loan sales and a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet we re trying to take loans off of our balance sheet core loans of our balance sheet and sell them if we can reinvest in agency mbs and non resi assets that has better capital liquidity characteristics so it s going to be a little bit harder to look at the trend you re going to need to look at things grow so we are originating high quality loans we are adding a number of loans to our portfolio we re distributing based on better execution as that would go but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet steven chubak wolfe research analyst very helpful and just a follow up for me on ccar the fed released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year including some higher card and auto losses in the upcoming exam i m just wondering how does that inform the way you re thinking about capital return capacity and are you still confident in that sustainability of 75 to 100 net payout as well as the 11 to 12 cet1 target marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i didn t hear the second part of the question on losses which losses were up this year that you were mentioning but here is what i would say steven chubak wolfe research analyst the card and auto losses marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the fed model losses for our portfolios and we ve been observing that over time necessarily it s the case that the federal reserve models are typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily because they are industry wide net net it doesn t change our point of view that as we re at 12 1 cet1 right now so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings but we always invest in our businesses first so we are growing our businesses responsibly every time we re adding branches we re adding customers we re adding advisors across our businesses but to the degree that we have excess earnings we ll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of february nothing changed operator next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi good morning marianne quick question i know you mentioned that the increase in npls within wholesale was again idiosyncratic but last quarter there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter is there a way you can give more color as to specific drivers in there i know you said in the past that you expect to normalize that you re off a low base i got that but i mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so the color is there is really no color which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil gas energy releases out you would ve seen quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where there are 100 million inaudible so there s always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades the thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have whether we re seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow and whether we re seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we re banking in and we re just not so it s not to say that we aren t playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle it s not to say we re playing close attention to retail but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter and even if you look quarter over quarter over quarter there s no trend to call out and we have a large wholesale lending portfolio these are extremely modest in the context of that and remember every quarter like we talk about a few because it s non zero but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter and it s not just downgrades it s upgrades and they re approximately of equal measure so we re looking very carefully i think we understand why people are questioning concerned and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle return but we re not seeing it yet brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then a separate question in the mortgage banking it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point over the last five years this quarter was that something in the market something with the rates or was there a one off impacting that number this quarter marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized and there s geography in the home lending business when we do these mortgage loan sales because we re match funded net net there s very little p l but last quarter there was a loss in nir and an offset in rate funding in nir this quarter there s a gain so you ve got a loss quarter gain this quarter both small but nevertheless that s driving the majority of the production margin going up but in addition if you just strip all that noise out which is not material but nevertheless significant quarter over quarter we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning marianne marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you share with us obviously you ve got your de novo branching strategy moving forward and what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so we re really really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the united states but when you talk about branches you are talking about investment for the long term and when i say long term multiple years decades so with respect to the new markets that we re entering these are extremely nascent investments the branches in many cases we haven t even broken ground on however that said early indication these very very early indications are strongly positive we re seeing a lot of excitement in the market we re seeing new accounts in production a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage on the whole you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then following up on some comments you made at investor day and i believe touched on today about technology spending if i recall correctly next year technology spending should be self funding and stabilized at just about where you are today when you compare it to the past five years what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so i just want to reiterate something that i want to make sure you guys completely internalize which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we re getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit that said we ve been growing our technology spend and in particular we ve been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank and that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital r d and the whole lot it s a large number and each year a lot of the dollars that we ve been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them so this is not that we re going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very very heavily in the agenda and in particular in the technology agenda it s just that each year technical difficulty and we ll continue to make the right decisions and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer and we re getting more efficient so in the past the way the technology was delivered was very different and the more that we re in our modern virtualized cloud ready way with new technology each dollar of technology is more productive gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of al alevizakos with hsbc alevizos alevizakos hsbc analyst hi i ve got a quick question and a follow up basically my question is on the treasury services year on year the growth going from double digit you just grow to 3 where apparently the volumes remained healthy but the margins started to deteriorate i wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019 especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double digit growth year on year for the remaining quarters and my follow up question is we talked about change the bank versus run the bank for it budget can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you re spending on innovation thank you marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes okay so first point on treasury services obviously revenue growth was in double digits you re right this quarter inaudible year on year i mentioned earlier that for both of our wholesale businesses we happen to have basis compression between the funding spreads that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines and so that just given where rates have moved headwind this year as the segment results are reported but for the company it s obviously net zero the more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue so you will see margins really compressed on that it s not speaking to deposit flows it s not speaking to volumes and it s not speaking to escalating payouts at this point so we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business with respect to technology spend you ll recall last year we were kind of 60 40 run the bank change the bank and it s more 50 50 this year so 11 5 billion of spend about half and half alevizos alevizakos hsbc analyst thank you very much marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer remember in the change of the bank it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience digital data r d so it s the whole spectrum operator your next question is from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i just wanted to follow up on the net interest income and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter is there anything that s lumpy or one time that you d flag because if you annualize it you re already above the full year target at 58 billion plus and obviously there s day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you re at right now marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer okay so we did slightly better in the first quarter two things driving it one is small but nevertheless is arguably non recurring which is we ve talked about the fact that overall in the company when we do these loan sales that net net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in nii call it 50 million ph approximately and then in addition we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were high yielding than ioer that continued into the first quarter so we did benefit from that and it may or may not continue but we re not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through and so i would say that day count was a drag as we look forward with some opportunities honestly obviously the risk associated with the flat yield curve not big but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure its long end rates stay lower for longer as we don t have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the december rate hike you could see more rates paid to a little bit more into second quarter so there are risks and opportunities we still think it s a decent outlook but i don t think it s conservative i think its 58 billion is straight down the middle at this point the trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short term and we shouldn t over interpret or over chase it at this point i think it s a decent estimate and we ll continue to update you matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago you clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently given may be more positive macro outlook marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer well so i mean we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago so the sort of overall answer is no not really we expected at that point that we would have a patient fed it turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish which we couldn t generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk for the balance sheet obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration but there s natural risk in our balance sheet so overall very little we feel good about the credit the curve is flat and we ll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian bank of america analyst yes hi good morning i just wanted to follow up marianne on the comments in the backdrop for lower rates for longer could you give us a sense on how you re thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale in other words i know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so i ll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing it is 100 driven by what we re observing in our consumer behavior than what we re seeing in deposit flows and so that s the environment that we look at to determine what s happening and you ve seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we ve seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives whether it s investments or whether it s more recently in cds and that may continue we ll continue to watch that it is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end and it s the short end that predominantly drives the sort of deposit pricing agenda so even if the curve is flatter as long as it s because the front end is stable i don t necessarily see deposit costs going down but we re going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly erika najarian bank of america analyst thank you and my follow up question is we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non accruals was idiosyncratic and i m wondering as we look at a tick up in non accrual loans in the corporate investment bank for the past two quarters are we just in the part of the cycle where we re just growing from a low base or should we expect a step down in the second quarter in non accruals similar to how we saw last year marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer there are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter but i would say it s a feature more of extremely low base and so from that any movement whether they are up or down it s somewhat exaggerated but we would continue to call the credit environment benign erika najarian bank of america analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks marianne just if i could ask you you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening and i wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you re seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of the spend numbers are obviously still double digit year over year some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown you are just still saying quite good and then there is this unevenness about just capex and spending and corporate side so just could you just kind of walk us through just where you re seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean i think that as it relates to us and in particular looking at the us consumer you ve got all of jobs more recently auto housing spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it s double digits or whether it s not we re continuing to see that and consumer confidence by the way which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters so for us us consumer has always been strong and confident and even if we re not all time high and confidence is still very high and generally the beta is and even some like housing and also that hasn t necessarily been super strong is looking encouraging and then on the global front it is a little harder but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit and europe would be a good example we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics in brexit and they seem to be fading a little business confidence has recovered a little businesses are still spending on labor so generally a good side of the underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers and even there there s job growth there s wage growth helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having increase and eased so i think generally we feel optimistic across the consumer and the rest of the sector albeit it s sort of green shoots on the wholesale buy so it s early but it s what we were expecting to see and so it may continue ken usdin jefferies analyst yeah and one follow up just on investment banking business you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we ve seen the reopening of the ecm market your general outlook just again on that global point about the a bit unevenness between us and global just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today but had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter but how is that side of the business you re feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i would say that a couple of things obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018 and so we did benefit from that but just as a general market matter m a is still attractive in a low growth environment albeit a growth environment investors are still constructive north america which is by far the biggest market for m a is still healthy and so europe was a big driver last year and europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue although we have a pretty good position there so i would say that the pipeline is down but still m a is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth ken usdin jefferies analyst that makes sense thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe just a follow up on the nii outlook i mean i think we ve talked about a flat curve what kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating it doesn t sound like you re in that camp but if you were to get a rate cut how do you manage that how do you think the balance sheet reacts and nii reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer right so the market which is usually more i would say pessimistic but more in that camp inaudible expecting and ease at the end of the year so we are not by the way as you point out so i think for 2019 s nii outlook it s not a clear and present danger and there will be any obviously we have on the way up on rates been over indexed to total end rates and so clearly if we were to have an ease it would have an impact on our nii if we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet but right now the fed is on course right now that s constructive for corporate deposit margins constructive for credit and generally constructive for how we re positioned on the balance sheet jim mitchell buckingham research analyst it s still you like you have room to i guess extend duration to kind of protect nii and nim if that would happen marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes yes we do jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hi good morning i wanted to follow up on matt s question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness this is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus especially in ccb but there weren t a lot of obvious non core items really called out so marianne can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there is some idiosyncratic things that weren t necessarily called out during the call you mentioned corporate cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there so are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call into question how sustainable the results are marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so first of all just sort of big pic first of all really high i think is a bit of an overstatement higher i think is fair no not really if there were you know we would have called them out there are a few little things so i m just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned we contributed 100 million to the foundation this quarter net net even with a very very small but nevertheless positive this quarter so there s a few little bits and pieces like that but if you look at revenue performance we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting we did better in ibcs and we gained a lot of share we did a little better in markets we did a little better in nii so we just got a little bit of a wind on our backs sort of phenomenon my probably my best answer to you is as happy as we are with the performance and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we got in our businesses we are not making material changes to our full year outlook so we ll still see how market performed for the year we do still expect as dimon mentioned at investor day that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5 and 10 year on year so we do expect to gain share to help offset that but last year was a record so we haven t changed our full year guidance at all yet we ll take this as a very good down payment to that and if markets are constructive and wallet expands we will benefit from that but saul martinez ubs analyst okay no that s marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer we re not leading across and changing everything saul martinez ubs analyst that s helpful i ll change gears a little bit any update on distressed capital buffer what the fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so the best i know there is a chance but not necessarily a probability that there could be an scb proposal for 2020 ccar so there s a set of meetings or a meeting coming out sometime in the summer that i think might be an important moment but we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand the better way to bridge growth capital together with point in time capital but it s complicated so as we said the most important thing is not to issue an scb proposal it doesn t deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively so we re talking about gsib we re talking about minimums we re talking about basel we re talking about scb it s complicated i d say there s a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 ccar saul martinez ubs analyst got it thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of marty mosby of vining sparks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning marty marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks for taking the question hey good morning first i want to ask as going to ccar now we re getting into that season again one of the things that i think has an impact is that what we had was a significant 30 plus growth in earnings last year so if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward and you think of holding payout ratios so to say they were just constant doesn t that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sales just to increase fairly significantly just off the increase in earnings last year marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer i think yes yes if you look at payout ratios obviously it s sort of described as a percentage then we said over the longer term we d expect to payout in a benign environment between 75 and 100 and analysts have estimates of 90 plus and obviously as earnings grow that would be a bigger dollar number but again we ll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise so we ll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds but you re right as earnings continue to grow a strong payout ratio we re above the top end of our capital range so we are starting at a robust level would be a higher dollar number yes marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then jamie i was just curious i think one of the issues facing the industry and just we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time and so if we look at it i think there s things that you re seeing or marianne that you see inside the company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon so just wanted to get your comment on that as well that s my follow up question thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i guess i sorry go jamie jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yes some sort of number that s out that australia had growth for 28 years and just so i m saying in notional but you have to have a recession they ve had a lot of back winds there s growth in asia and stuff like that but if you look at the american economy the consumer s in good shape the balance sheet s in good shape people are going back to the workforce companies have plenty of capital and capital expenditure is still up year over year little bit less this quarter than last quarter capital is being retained in the united states business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high and not all time peaks rather high so you can just easily it can go on for years there s no law that says it has to stop we do make a list and look at all the other things geopolitical issues lower liquidity so there maybe a confluence of events that somehow cause the recession but it may not be in 2019 2020 2021 obviously at one point though there will probably be something and yeah i think the bigger short term risk would be something to go wrong in china the trade issues in china so i just wouldn t account on there having to be a recession in the short run kind of years marty mosby vining sparks analyst i agree thanks operator question comes from the line of andrew lim with societe generale andrew lim societe generale analyst hi morning thanks for taking my questions so my first question is on the end of period loans so if we look across the board it looks like there are some contraction there on a quarter to quarter basis of about 3 of 4 and i was just wondering if you saw that as a one quarter issue relating to what happened in 4q 18 and if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies ceos inaudible emerging again marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes so quarter on quarter and i think i mentioned a couple of these things but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end of period basis loans are down so like stepping through them the first one i would point out is mortgage and we just talked about that i think earlier in the call which is we continue to originate mortgage loans we continue to distribute them on portfolio we did do a loan sale which is part of the discussion that we ve been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet we did a sale at the end of the quarter so that s impacting mortgage loans in the cib and one of the reasons why we call out core loan growth ex cib is because we don t consider cib loans core because they are just by their nature oftentimes more episodic and lumpy and so we did see a see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter and then in our other businesses in asset wealth management a bit of seasonality a few pay downs in card seasonality so it s just sort of combination of factors but i would say two drivers cib and home lending cib on sort of a large syndication home lending on a loan sale ph going forward we ll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes but just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending i look at the middle market space and say we re still seeing solid demand it is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries that we re still growing that portion of our loans in the mid single digits year on year andrew lim societe generale analyst yes great thanks so my following question is on marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer before you go into that there are going to be other areas where we just won t inaudible i mean in commercial real estate you see loan growth is much lower it s very competitive its prices have come down we continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans but we re not going to chase it down and similarly auto andrew lim societe generale analyst sure okay thanks so my follow on question is on clos so as some japanese institutions are big buyers of us highly rated clos but a few weeks ago the japanese fsa introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5 risk retention by us issuers in order for the japanese institutions to buy them so i m just wondering if you re seeing yet any change in demand from japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there is any change in behavior from us clo issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5 risk retention marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so that is a great question the answer i m going to give you is not that i m aware of at this point but i ll have to follow up with you jamie are you aware no so andrew we ll come back to you not that i m aware of but it is a good but nevertheless quite detailed question andrew lim societe generale analyst okay thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thanks operator there are no further questions at this time marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thank you everyone operator thank you for

april 11 2019 information clearing house exit nato was the glaring title on a huge screen greeting the several hundred participants of the anti nato conference in florence italy on 7 april 2019 officially it was called the international conference on the 70th anniversary of nato sponsored by global research of canada and the international coalition to ban uranium weapons icbuw i had the privilege to attend this important forum following the exit nato poster was another huge slide decorating the conference wall proclaiming that nato as a reward for all their work for peace should be rewarded with the peace nobel prize no doubt nuclear armament and eventually nuclear wars to be fought by nato by whom else will make the world a safer place wars are actually good for peace they are also good for economics but they are particularly good for peace i m not kidding you these are declarations one can read and has been able to read since practically 9 11 in such prominent truth news papers like the washington post and the nyt so why not the peace prize to nato it wouldn t make much difference considering the track record of the nobel prize committee it would fall right into place other than that the conference basically outlined the atrocities committed by nato its associate and crony terrorist armies isis al qada al nusra and so on changing names for revolving terrorists recruited and trained by the cia and funded by saudi arabia and other gulf countries and of course the us directly or through her many state department funded and subsidiary ngos like the national endowment for democracy ned and many others and of course not to forget a prominent funder of terrorism turkey who is now trying to make a smiling face to russia and the east even flirting with the idea of entering the club of the shanghai cooperation organization sco on the one hand purchasing russian military defense systems the s 400 and at the same time us fighter planes f35 dancing on as many weddings simultaneously as they can who would trust turkey under erdogan turkey also still hosts one of the most strategic and most dangerous nuclear equipped nato bases literally between east and west tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get our free daily newsletter the conference recalled the cold war by now everybody knows really well for those who don t that the so called cold war was one of the best propagated and fakest news of the 20th century it s a brilliant idea that sprung out of the mccarthy nazi era like nato itself to arm the us to the teeth maximizing profits of the military industrial complex under the pretext of halting the advancement of the soviet union into just liberated western europe just liberated from hitler s nazi germany never mind that western europe has been saved by the soviet union who lost 25 30 million people and basically their transport and production infrastructure yes it was not the so called allies us uk and france they came in last when the bulk of the job was already done by what is today russia but of course no western history book would tell you the truth in fact it must be said here too that the us funded hitler s war against the soviet union with money channeled from the fed through wall street banks and eventually through the rothschild dominated bank for international settlement bis located in basel switzerland right at the border to germany from where it was easy to pass the money on to the reichsbank hitler s central bank yes that s how the us was already then dancing on various fiestas at the same time on the one hand bombing germany and on the other financing germany s war against what the us already then perceived as an archenemy the red scare the soviet union well these acts of treason then were the precursors of nato today anything socialist is evil for the us still today trump himself and his minion clowns pompeo bolton and pence are lambasting venezuela and cuba for being evil and destructive socialist countries and that socialism will not be tolerated anywhere by the falling empire sorry falling it is of the united states of america the other purpose of the cold war farce was to make the europeans believe that they were under a constant threat of a soviet invasion that they had to arm themselves also to the teeth imagine war recovering europe having to spend their money on arms for no use and of course most of these weapons had to be bought yes you guessed it from the us military industrial complex meaning more profit for the war oligarchs the anglo media giants even created a virtual barrier between western free europe and the bad bad red scare the soviet union the iron curtain yes the iron curtain children in school were indoctrinated to be aware that the enemy is hiding behind the iron curtain and that the enemy always comes from the east hilarious when you think back at that time almost everybody believed it and the third or perhaps first objective of the cold war was to block the soviet union from developing a viable and autonomous economy with which they could thrive as most socialist countries do until they are boycotted punished and financially sanctioned into suffocation by the west these illegal financial manipulations with and within sovereign countries economies are of course illegal by any standards of international laws laws that have become meaningless in the light of us nato power scary nuclear power these acts of financial and human rights high crimes are only possible because of the all dominating fraudulent us imposed and nato protected western monetary system the nato driven cold war a constant nuclear threat towards the soviet union was intended to force russia also to arm for their defense instead of being able to use their economy s added value to rebuild their devastated country the ussr was never a threat to europe there was never an intention of the soviet union to invade western europe the same today we are being made believe that russia wants to invade europe that s why nato needs to build all these military bases at the door step to russia russia is by far the largest country territory wise in the world they don t need to add more land historically neither russia or china have a record of expansionism in the end the nato led cold war managed to dismantle the soviet union by buying some corrupt soviet leaders so that the new russia whose socialist system just was made to collapse unprepared with legislation for what was to come privatization by fire sale of their entire economy like vultures the financial institutions imf world bank agents of the fed descended on moscow to literally steel by indebting whatever had any value this misery still has not entirely abetted as the russian central bank was restructured following the image of the fed today under president putin much has changed and was reformed however the financial sector is still heavily invaded by the atlantists or what you may also call the fifth columnists and of course even those are protected by nato as nato issues threats nobody knows from where they come but you know who executes them in case of the florence anti nato conference also recalled some of the most abject killing sprees of nato in its 70 years of existence the wars in afghanistan iraq libya syria sudan yemen ukraine the maidan massacre followed by the so called ukrainian civil war and the crowning of sorts the ten year war on yugoslavia the total destruction of yugoslavia with the final blow 1999 the merciless bombing of bosnia herzegovina and kosovo why yugoslavia let s dwell just a moment on this war of cruel destruction and killing because it is so typical for pentagon driven wars of annihilation yugoslavia a socialist country in the 1970s and 80s under maoist president tito had a prosperous economy much more so than the rest of europe the us dominated west cannot let a socialist economy flourish other countries especially stagnating western europe could get ideas remember socialism is evil so with what is today called the balkanization cut into pieces of yugoslavia was the old old tactic of divide to conquer as well as by creating internal chaos the western powers kept control of the people and eventually nato was able to advance closer and ever closer to the russian border by occupying former yugoslav republics with nato bases albania croatia montenegro slovakia slovenia and kosovo is waiting in the wings in addition to the further expansion east to romania bulgaria czech republic hungary poland not to mention the former soviet republics of estonia latvia and lithuania this expansion east ever closer to moscow is a flagrant breach of a promise made by the allied forces in 1991 then german foreign minister genscher promised russian president gorbachev that nato would not move one inch further east than germany in fact he assured gorbachev that nato would not move into what before the german unification was eastern germany this promise was unfortunately never recorded in writing and gorbachev was miserably betrayed as we know by now a betrayal by the west is very normal in the meantime 12 more nato bases east of germany including in former east germany were built in their 70 years of existence us nato allied and proxy forces as well as mercenaries have killed between 20 and 25 million people around the globe in wars and conflicts in the eternal war against terror that was justified by self inflicted 9 11 the start to the final phase of the pnac plan for a new american century to reach full spectrum dominance wars have a cost a financial economic and a social cost the us official military budget for fiscal year fy 2018 is us 700 billion for fy 2019 trump proposes us 750 if approved it would be a 40 increase in the last 9 years but that s not all this is just the officially published figure the real cost for the war defense and security apparatus to which also the opaque cia and associated secret services count is well over a trillion dollars perhaps as much as us 1 5 trillion per year the us has currently about one million military personnel stationed in 175 countries around the globe the pentagon maintains about a thousand military bases in more than 100 countries the war cost in currently seven war theatres is prohibitive medical costs for veterans for social services to returning veterans and we are not talking about the cost of off battle ground lives i e by ever mounting suicide rates the veteran administration released a study that covered suicides from 1999 to 2010 showing that roughly 22 veterans were dying by suicide per day or one every 65 minutes the reality is most likely a much higher figure and the despair and human depression from anxieties related to the never ending wars has increased exponentially in the last 9 years more suicides more desperation more broken families entire generations of kids with fathers at war this cost cannot be put in figures of dollars and cents it s a social cost that bears its toll in years perhaps generations from now the us spends per capita ten times more than the rest of the world together on military war expenses president trump requests european nato countries to increase their military budget by contributing more to nato first up to 2 of gdp threatening he may decide to withdraw nato from europe if europe does not comply with his request still making believe that nato is a defensive force protecting europe from what and from whom good bye nato this is the moment to call trump s bluff but nato the trans atlantic treaty organization has also gone overseas to latin america nato has since 2013 a cooperation agreement with colombia where the us has 5 military bases which will automatically convert into nato bases nato is also negotiating with brazil s new nazi leader bolsonaro to enter brazil and as such being a threat and a potential attack force to topple the venezuelan democratically elected socialist government washington makes no secret they want venezuela s hydrocarbon resources the world s largest reserves gold and other minerals of which venezuela is rich nato is perfect to do the dirty job but it gets worse this trump clown or the masters behind him had recently the audacity to ask for a european military budget increase to 4 of gdp or else yes let s decide for else good riddens nato the overall nato budget is well over a trillion dollars per year yes per year and that is people of europe people of the world that is to finance a killing machine that bulldozes countries into the ground with bombs and tanks that kill indiscriminately civilians and other countries defensive military countries that have never done any harm to the united states nor to europe which follows the washington mandate like a bunch of vassals what europe has become imagine what could be done with more than a trillion dollars or euros per year in terms of building up education health services public infrastructure and other social services and expand these services to developing countries to those very countries that are now bombarded mercilessly by nato this dear people of europe is your tax money do you want it to be spent killing people around the world for washington s world hegemony nato does not protect you nato has been designed as an aggressive force you were just never told but look out of the window the window of your safe space and you will see the squandering of your tax money nato is invading the space of russia and china countries that are seeking friendly relations with the rest of the world they are seeking a multi polar world but encounter instead a response of aggression nato is preventing the natural namely friendly relations and trading as equals within the huge continent eurasia of which europe has been artificially separated as a continent this tremendous landmass eurasia includes also the entire middle east and connects to africa this enormous mass of land and people and resources does not need the west the west called america wouldn t it be wise for countries and people of eurasia to just live sovereign lives with friendly interactions trading as equals not with a one upmanship as is currently the norm for trading between the rich oecd nations dominating the world trade organization wto with the rest of the world which depends on trade but is always on the losing end one more point that needs to be understood europe the european union as it was conceived and is limping along today has never been the idea of europeans but was born during wwii in the heads of the cia then transplanted into some willing european heads and then defended by nato the unifying force europe has no constitution only a number of non binding accords like maastricht and lisbon but no constitution that holds it together that outlines a common vision in defense in economic development in monetary policy the european union results in a bunch of countries some even hostile to each other they have a common currency the euro without even having a common economic base and development objective this currency forged as the little brother of the us dollar equally is nothing but fiat money no backing whatsoever this currency is not sustainable so the currency barely 20 years old will eventually collapse or fade and so will the european union it hasn t happened yet because nato is holding it together because brussels is nothing but a puppet of the pentagon it is washington through the pentagon and through nato that is running europe people of europe is it that what you want your tax money spent killing people and destroying countries around the globe and having lost all independence autonomy as a country as well as monetary sovereignty by being run by a military killing machine called nato it s time to kill nato rather than being killed by nato exit nato now it s time for nexit peter koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst he is also a former world bank staff and worked extensively around the world in the fields of environment and water resources he

as they summarize some of the key points made on the call before we start i d like to remind you that today s conference call includes certain forward looking statements these forward looking statements are presented in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ these risks and uncertainties are described in our press release in item 1a of our most recent annual report on form 10 k and in other documents that we file or furnish to the securities and exchange commission also we ll be using certain non gaap measures in our release and in the

turn it over to john john standley chief executive officer thanks byron and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today during the fourth quarter we continued generating critical momentum in key areas of our business while also taking important steps to position rite aid for future success to help us build on this momentum we have also developed a comprehensive business strategy that specifically defines our top priorities and provides rite aid with a clear path to the future for long term sustainable growth i ll be discussing the strategy in more detail later in today s call as you know operational efficiency has been one of our top priorities to that end we recently took an important step forward by announcing a restructuring to right size our organization as the tsa with wba winds down as announced we re reducing managerial layers and consolidating roles throughout our organization to align current operations with our new footprint we expect annual cost savings of about 55 million from the restructuring with approximately 42 million to be realized in fiscal year 20 this is important because we expect tsa revenue to be lower by approximately 40 million this year as we complete this restructuring we re also implementing a leadership transition the board has initiated a search for a new ceo and i will stay throughout that process to ensure a smooth transition while changes like these are never easy this restructuring represents a critical step in becoming a more efficient company that is better positioned to deliver value in addition as previously announced rite aid stockholders have approved a reverse stock split of the company s outstanding shares of common stock our board of directors has now approved the implementation of the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1 for 20 rite s common stock will begin trading on a split adjusted basis on the new york stock exchange as the market open on april 22 2019 implementation of the reverse stock split should enable us to regain compliance with the new york stock exchange listing requirements in terms of our results for the quarter while adjusted ebitda met our expectations we re still not where we want to be in terms of performance there s no doubt that we re dealing with a very challenging environment for retail and pharmacy reimbursement rates and that these trends affected our results at the same time we also generated positive results in critical areas of our business in the retail pharmacy segment in addition to our success with our various script growth initiatives over the past few quarters we also administered a record number of flu shots and drove strong growth in ancillary immunizations and despite a mild cough cold and flu season we increased same store pharmacy sales and prescription count for the third consecutive quarter in our pharmacy services segment increased medicare part d enrollment helped drive a 1 2 increase in revenue for the quarter and a 4 5 million increase in adjusted ebitda as you know we recently announced the addition of ben bulkley to our team as ceo of envisionrxoptions ben is an outstanding leader with a proven track record for driving results through innovation and operational excellence we re excited to have him as part of our team and he will be joining us later in the call to provide additional details on envisionrxoptions business while we know there are opportunities for organic growth in our business we also know the dynamics of retail and healthcare are changing rapidly and that it s critical to develop a strong plan for our long term future as i alluded to earlier we spent significant time over the past several months taking a close look at our go forward strategy we ve analyzed all aspects of our business including engaging with outside consultants to ensure that rite aid has the best possible strategy for achieving long term sustainable growth this included a thorough analysis of the marketplace so that we can better understand the needs of pharmacy customers and tailor our mix of services and products to deliver an even higher level of convenience and care as a result we have developed a clear path to the future that will position rite aid to capitalize on its strongest capabilities and core competencies to help improve health outcomes for more patients our strategy focuses on three top priorities first we will leverage and more clearly align our unique capabilities like the expertise of our pharmacists health dialog rediclinic and envisionrxoptions to help payers in delivering a higher level of care to patients specifically we know there s more that we can do to work with payers to drive positive health outcomes for chronic and poly chronic patients we already have related experience in this area following our pilot of rite aid health alliance which saw us partner with local physicians and hospitals our health alliance pilot provided us with some key learnings that we can now apply as we look to make a stronger play in the value based care market second we are reimagining our front end offer we have the right selection of products and services to meet the needs of our target consumers this will include executing a full sku optimization program the continued migration of our product mix to have a greater emphasis on health and wellness and the identification of new services we can offer at the store level third we are continuing our efforts to fundamentally transform our processes and procedures to ensure strong cost discipline unlock capacity and achieve peak operational efficiency in addition to the organizational restructuring i mentioned earlier we ve identified specific expense reduction initiatives in areas such as store operating expenses advertising and non headcount backoffice expenses while we have always been focused on these areas our thorough review process identified further opportunities to reduce complexity in our business and drive efficiency we have also identified opportunities to improve working capital these efforts will drive additional savings that we will use to make critical strategic investments for future growth with our strategy in place we re excited to be fully focused on building momentum for our business going forward we re also excited to have a number of dynamic and talented leaders taking on new roles within our organization to help us execute and strengthen our go forward strategy matt schroeder who you ll hear from later in this call is our new chief financial officer he s an experienced member of our team who knows our business and will do a great job of putting rite aid in the best possible financial position to succeed jocelyn konrad is our new executive vice president of pharmacy and retail operations jocelyn is a licensed pharmacist with a significant experience in clinical service and value based care initiatives with her additional front end responsibilities jocelyn will be an excellent leader to further strengthen our one store one team culture in the field and stores and finally bryan everett has been named rite aid s new chief operating officer bryan s leadership has been critical in keeping our team focused on operational priorities over the past several years his passion for our business and vision for our future have earned him the trust and respect of our rite aid team i m excited to see him take on additional responsibilities in his new role and look forward to working with him as we focus on positioning rite aid to deliver value over the long term with that at this time i d like to introduce bryan to provide an update on our key initiatives and further details about our go forward initiatives bryan bryan everett chief operating officer thank you john and good morning everyone i ll start by saying that i m very excited for the opportunity to take on additional responsibilities and lead in this new role as a team we have made some good progress in improving our business and while we still have work to do heading forward i m confident in our rite aid team and strategy and optimistic about our future as an organization in terms of our key initiatives as john said we ve driven same store pharmacy sales and prescription count growth for three consecutive quarters a key factor has been our success with immunizations as we delivered a record of more than 2 3 million flu shots and growth of 78 in ancillary immunizations in fy 19 we also ramped up our investment in prescription file buys by spending a total of 45 million compared to 29 million in the prior year for this year we have allocated 60 million for prescription file buy opportunities also during the year we completed 134 wellness remodels and this highly successful format now represents nearly 72 of our chain the wellness stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of both same store front end sales and prescription count and they will continue to play a key role as we aggressively test innovation to drive even better customer experiences our wellness rewards program also continues to play a key role in delivering value to our customers we have over 13 million active wellness rewards members and we will continue leveraging this very popular program to provide a higher level of personalized marketing that drive sales and customer loyalty the key initiatives i ve mentioned provide a strong foundation from which to build as we focus on accelerating our transformation in fy 20 to support these efforts we have identified several key areas of opportunity we understand that providing best in class clinical pharmacy services represents a critical opportunity to deliver a higher level of care to our customers while also positioning rite aid for sustainable growth in the emerging value based healthcare marketplace a great example is our launch of rite care in fy 19 rite care is a state of the art tool that provides our pharmacists with real time alerts for clinical service opportunities without having to access a separate application to position us in delivering a higher level of care we must continue finding ways to operate more efficiently so that we can free up additional time for our pharmacists to provide personalized services to our patients this includes a continued focus on increasing predictive refills through programs like automated courtesy refills and one trip refills and other workflow improvements to reduce our cost to fill we will also expand on our central fill capabilities throughout the year tools like these will help us continue to execute our aim strategy aim stands for adherence immunization and medication therapy management or mtm and these services represent our gateway into value based care and in recent years we ve made significant progress in expanding these offerings by gaining efficiencies in the pharmacy and providing best in class services through aim we will be in an even better position to further expand our offering and begin working with key payer partners to close gaps in care we must also deliver on our priority to be a low cost provider that s why it was so critical to lock in the best possible drug cost which we have accomplished through our recent 10 year agreement with mckesson we will also continue working with payer partners to manage reimbursement rate pressure with a focus on gaining access to additional limited networks heading forward in the front end we are completing a comprehensive evaluation of our business to better support our target consumer this includes completing a sku optimization and remerchandising key categories to better meet the needs of our customers it also includes introducing additional better for you items especially in consumables and beauty one of our biggest areas of focus will be growing our own brand penetration over the next few years we believe this area presents enormous potential and our go forward plan includes introducing new items enhancing our product mix and additional consideration to how we market and promote these items early this fiscal year we ll be relaunching our best selling own brand of otc products rite aid pharmacy and we re also in the final stages of repositioning the thrifty ice cream brand and expanding sales to additional states in addition we ve heard from many customers about their interest in purchasing cbd products in response to this interest this month we will begin piloting the sale of cbd creams lotions and lip balms at rite aid stores in oregon and washington to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers in those communities as we analyze and evolve our front end business we ll also be examining our marketing to make sure that we are targeting the right opportunities to grow our business at the same time we know that today s retail consumer is looking to shop and engage with brands in a number of different ways and as a team we re highly focused on meeting these needs and are exploring various options to further enhance our omni channel capabilities including making key strategic investments we will significantly grow our e commerce business again this year we will continue developing our mobile capabilities and further expand our self checkout pilot expect to see more self checkouts at rite aid stores in the coming year additionally we are also exploring mobile checkout solutions we continue to offer same day prescription home delivery in the majority of our markets at no charge for our wellness gold and silver members this service has been very well received and continues to grow we see further expanding home delivery as a key opportunity which is why we re also partnering with instacart a technology driven on demand service to pilot another convenient option for home delivery we will continue to refine and enhance our home delivery capability in the months to come we are also excited to be partnering with amazon to introduce amazon lockers to more than 900 rite aid stores over the next few months to give customers another option to pickup or return their amazon packages this effort will bring additional traffic into our rite aid stores heading forward we ll continue to look for new ways to engage with customers both in store and online to create a seamlessly connected customer experience finally it s really important that we continue to thoroughly understand current trends and how they relate to the products that we sell to that end we are concerned about some of the alarming statistics regarding the use of e cigarettes and vaping products by children and teens according to the centers for disease control and prevention tobacco use among our nation s youth grew nearly 38 between 2017 and 2018 this has been driven largely by an increase of e cigarette use which over the past year has increased 78 in the high school demographic and 48 for middle school age children while many feel these products are beneficial to those of legal age who are trying to quit the use of tobacco we have made the decision to remove all electronic cigarettes and vaping products from our offering at all rite aid stores we will remove this product over the next 90 days in addition we will continue to rigorously enforce our chainwide id all policy that requires identification to purchase any age restricted item we will also continue evaluating our entire front end offering to ensure that we are meeting both the needs and the expectations of our customers before i conclude i wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank our rite aid store associates our field leaders our distribution center partners and corporate team members for all they ve done this year i can t say enough about how our team has been able to stay focused on providing great service to our customers as we ve navigated through some significant challenges it s truly an honor to be taking on a new leadership role as part of this extraordinary team as i said earlier our team recognizes that we have important work ahead of us in order to continue positioning our company for sustainable long term growth at the same time we re ready to do this important work and to continue delivering great experiences to our valued customers i believe in our team i believe in our brand and i m excited about our company s future i m also looking forward to working with the other leaders who are taking on new roles within our organization and this includes ben bulkley our

pleased with the growth of our med d business and all told we now have roughly 635 000 enrolled part d members for plan year 2019 in terms of open enrollment for the plan year 2019 we added 95 000 new lives with our larger than expected dis enrollment in geographies or rite aid divested stores resulting in approximately 22 000 net new med d members we expect med d membership to grow over 10 for the plan year 2019 the strategic decisions over the last few years are beginning to pay off most notably our number of chooser ph members in our plans has increased from 77 000 in calendar 2016 to 352 000 today we re also excited about the progress in the current year 2020 commercial selling season with several regional and health plan rfps in house a number of finalist opportunities and a new regional health plan alliance already in place all told we ve won new commercial clients during the 2020 selling season that add over 220 000 lives and have several exciting prospects in the pipeline envision

proposition for payers as rite aid positions its unique assets to drive the greatest value to the enterprise we look forward in working together and bringing this vision to life by driving positive patient health outcomes and creating even greater value in today s healthcare marketplace thank you for your time now i ll turn it over to matt schroeder for more information on our financial results matt matt schroeder chief financial officer thanks ben and thanks to everyone for joining us today on this morning s call i ll provide a recap of the refinancing of our credit facility that we completed in december walk through our fourth quarter results and review our fiscal 2020 guidance on december 20 2018 we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility as a result of this refinancing we replaced our 2 7 billion revolving credit facility with the new facility that includes a 2 7 billion revolving credit facility and a 450 million term loan these new credit facilities are scheduled to mature in december of 2023 with a springing maturity at december 31 2022 if we have not repaid or refinanced our 6 125 notes due in april of 2023 before that date the interest rate on the revolver has improved by 25 basis points over the old revolving credit facility our covenants under the new senior secured credit facility remains substantially unchanged this refinancing pushes out our debt maturities until 2023 and increases our current liquidity to 1 7 billion this important refinancing strengthens our balance sheet and gives us the flexibility to make investments necessary to execute our growth plan as well as provide the time needed to execute on our strategy now i ll turn to a review of our fourth quarter results revenues for the quarter were 5 4 billion which were essentially flat to the prior year s results net loss from continuing operations was 255 6 million or 0 24 per share versus a net loss of 483 7 million or 0 46 per share in the prior year s quarter current year net loss was impacted by a charged income tax expense to record a 197 million increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets i ll point out that our current federal tax affected nol carry forward is 225 million and with none of our federal nols expiring until fiscal 2029 this represents a valuable shield against future federal cash taxes adjusted net loss in the current quarter was 13 3 million or 0 01 per share versus adjusted net loss of 7 8 million or 0 01 per share in the prior year quarter our decline in adjusted net loss was primarily due to a decline in adjusted ebitda which was 134 1 million in the current quarter compared to 154 8 million in the prior year quarter retail pharmacy segment revenue for the quarter was 3 97 billion which was 28 million lower than last year s fourth quarter our increase in comparable store sales was more than offset by the impact of the 82 underperforming stores that we have closed since the end of last year same store sales increased 70 basis points in the quarter front end same store sales were down 1 9 but pharmacy same store sales increased 2 1 with same store script count up 80 basis points on a 30 day adjusted basis the increase in script count reflects the continuing impact of our pharmacy initiatives including our immunization program and our focus on improving clinical capabilities we are pleased that we were able to grow scripts this quarter despite cycling a very strong flu season in the prior year s fourth quarter front end sales were negatively impacted by soft performance in tobacco due to regulation changes that prohibited the sale of tobacco in certain new york stores beginning january 1 and in over the counter cough cold and flu products due to cycling last year s strong flu season total retail pharmacy segment gross profit dollars in the quarter were 111 million lower than last year s fourth quarter and gross margin was 259 basis points lower as a percent of revenues lifo expense increased 53 2 million due to higher levels of pharmacy inflation in the current year adjusted ebitda gross profit was unfavorable to last year s fourth quarter by 54 5 million and a 117 basis points worse as a percent of revenues pharmacy gross profit was worse than prior year s fourth quarter on a dollar and rate basis due to reimbursement rate pressure that we were not able to offset with generic drug purchasing efficiencies and comparable store prescription growth distribution expenses were unfavorable due partially to the realignment of stores within our distribution network front end gross profit was worse than the prior year s fourth quarter due to decreases in front end sales but front end margin improved due to good markdown management and favorable shrink results retail pharmacy segment sg a expenses for the quarter were 37 8 million lower than last year s fourth quarter while sg a rate as a percent of revenues improved by 76 basis points adjusted ebitda sg a was 29 1 million better than the prior year fourth quarter and 55 basis points better as a percent of revenue our sg a improvement was driven by an increase in tsa fee income from wba and lower payroll and advertising expense our pharmacy services segment had revenues of 1 5 billion which was an increase of 18 million or 1 2 primarily due to an increase in our medicare part d membership adjusted ebitda for the pharmacy services segment of 37 8 million was 4 5 million higher than last year s fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 33 3 million the increase in revenue was partially offset by increases in sg a expense as we invest for current year and future growth our cash flow statement for the quarter shows a use of cash from operating activities of 216 million during the fourth quarter we remitted 180 million of the payment for our 2017 plan year cms receivable to the reinsurer which had a negative impact on our working capital we did not utilize reinsurance for the cms receivable in 2018 we also saw a decrease in accrued interest due to the payoff of several of our debt instruments with proceeds from the wba asset sale during the year other differences were due to timing in receivables and payables our debt balance net of cash was approximately 3 3 billion at year end and our leverage ratio was 5 7 times adjusted ebitda which takes into account the pro forma impact of the sale of the remaining distribution centers to wba now let s turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance similar to others in the retail pharmacy space we are facing significant pharmacy margin headwinds as the lack of new generics in the break open period and market conditions with regards to generic supply are expected to negatively impact our ability to offset reimbursement rate pressures with drug cost savings these industry headwinds will more than offset the benefits we received from the extension of our supply agreement with mckesson we expect total sales to be between 21 5 billion and 21 9 billion and same store sales to be in a range of flat to an increase of 1 we expect to have positive script comp growth through a continued focus on our clinical capabilities and prescription file buys and we ll be looking to expand into additional preferred networks in calendar 2020 at envision we expect additional commercial med d business to offset some client losses that we will be cycling during fiscal 2020 as we turn our focus to the 2020 selling season we expect adjusted ebitda to be between 500 million and 560 million in addition to the pharmacy headwinds noted above we expect to offset the loss of tsa income in fiscal 2020 with the impact of the headcount reductions that we announced last month we also expect rent expense to increase by 11 million as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard we have identified further cost reduction opportunities that we will be aggressively pursuing which we expect to offset the impact of wage and benefit inflation our net loss guidance includes an estimate of 55 million for restructuring expenses related to the rightsizing of our organization that we announced last month and the initiatives that john and bryan discussed earlier on the call i expect the restructuring expense estimate to be refined in future quarters as we further develop these initiatives keep in mind that this restructuring expense is not part of adjusted ebitda or adjusted net income we expect adjusted net income to be in a range of a loss of 7 million to income of 36 million or a range of a loss of 0 01 per share to income of 0 04 per share our fiscal 2020 capital expenditure plan is to spend 250 million which includes 60 million for script file buys and investments in technology designed to accelerate our digital and omni channel offering we are planning to open or relocate eight stores and remodel 70 stores in fiscal 2020 this completes my portion of the presentation and now i ll turn it back to john john standley chief executive officer thank you matt and before we open the lines for questions i d just like to state that despite a challenging environment for pharmacy reimbursement rates we are well positioned to build on our strengths and capitalize on our best opportunities for future growth we have important momentum in key areas such as same store pharmacy sales and script count cost control in our pharmacy services segment based upon our analysis of the marketplace and a thorough understanding of our target customers needs we also have a clear strategy for our path to the future that will leverage our core competencies and unique capabilities in delivering improved patient care see us ph reimagining our front end business and drive further efficiency to fuel strategic investment and finally we also have ample liquidity and a stronger balance sheet which gives us the time and flexibility we need to execute our strategy for growth while we have some critical work ahead of us we also have full confidence in our team our strategy and our company to succeed as we build momentum for the future that concludes our prepared remarks for the call we will now open up the phone lines for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst hey john two things number one if we think about the decline in adjusted ebitda in 2020 that is entirely concentrated in the retail segment is that fair and then secondly it sounds like you still believe the retail business can grow ebitda long term what does it take what s the most important prerequisite to get there is it to have a significant improvement in reimbursement pressure is that the most important thing john standley chief executive officer well i guess to the first part of the question yeah it s the decline in adjusted ebitda is focused on the retail side of the business i m a believer in the retail business john i really do think this thing can grow over time i mean i think if you i know we re a little negative here on the comps but if you kind of look at what we ve been through the last few years i think we re still in a really great position here and we ve done a lot of work here on this business over the last several months while it s not obviously a huge impact on fiscal year 20 i think we ve built a plan here with a lot of great initiatives and activities in it that we think is going to really reinvigorate this business and move it forward and so while maybe there s a little bit upside to what we ve got in the guidance here we think there s a big impact for us in fiscal year 21 so we ve got a lot of good things kind of working behind the scenes here reimbursement rate obviously is a little bit of the limiter on our results it s going to depend on how that kind of plays out over time from where reimbursement rates were honestly two years ago to where they are today it has gotten a little bit better for us but obviously we ve seen some tightening on the generic market as well so we continue to work with payer partners to try and find solutions that work for both of us that allow them to be competitive in the marketplace but also allow us to make appropriate returns in our investments to do to deliver the services that we re delivering the other thing i would just say on the reimbursement rate side john is that we i think have a lot of core capabilities here to really drive better outcomes health outcomes in the marketplace and i think a key part of where we re going is to really leverage those capabilities that should make us a better partner a more valued partner as we go forward and so i think it all sort of fits together for us we think it all comes together in a singular way that takes us forward so we re going to fight the reimbursement rates it s going to be a challenge but there s a lot of there s enough opportunity here with improvements to the business and we think additional revenue streams that we can access that we can actually grow this business over time john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst and then two quick things if i think about the cost inflation on the retail side of the business right labor rent et cetera is that in the 2 2 5 range is that about right and then secondly when you think about your vision for the front end in sku optimization so i take it that is not otc hba that is more food and consumables what do you think when you think about revitalizing the front end and i still think wellness is a key part of that but is it assortment is it the value proposition has gotten stale how do you assess that john standley chief executive officer i think i would just say and i ll kick it over to bryan i think assortment is a piece of the puzzle for us we ve got to continue evolve the merchandising inside the store we made a lot of progress when we went to the wellness format but i think we have another opportunity another kind of turn of the wheel here to take the merchandising forward own brand is a huge opportunity for us there s so much more that we can do in that space as we push forward here and kind of getting the noise of the past behind us i think is opening some doors for us to gain additional access to things that really i think help us kind of push forward there and i do think there are some additional services that we can do inside the box you talked about wellness but tying that in with the wellness ambassadors and other things we can do with pharmacists those are all going to be big parts of how this kind of plays out i know bryan you want add something bryan everett chief operating officer john it s bryan to answer the first question i think that s probably a fair range although we work to offset these additional expense challenges just through operating efficiencies and technology so we feel pretty good about that just to build on john s comments we ve really identified beauty health vitamins and consumables as the four categories in the front of the store that we will continue to invest in in terms of differentiation and we will edit the assortment but it s also an introduction of cleaner products more better for you products as john mentioned a huge effort around own brand we have a lot of opportunity there and it s actually pretty exciting and then we re also looking at our marketing as we shift some of these dollars to more personalized more digital more relevant offers that we have access to through our again our loyalty program and just moving away a little bit from the mass message to a more personalized message lot of work john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is open michael minchak jpmorgan analyst thanks it s actually michael minchak in for lisa this morning first question you guys talked about the focus on gaining access to limited networks going forward we ve seen significant traction in the part d market but what are you seeing in the commercial market has there been increased uptake of preferred in our networks there and then you also highlighted the emerging value based care marketplace so you re starting to see interest from payers or pbms around high performance networks or outcomes based reimbursements and if so is that discussions that you re having for calendar 2020 or is that sort of more of a longer term opportunity at this point john standley chief executive officer i think it s probably both in terms of the commercial marketplace it s still i d say kind of a gradual uptake in terms of narrow preferred networks there there s interest in it but it s not moving at the speed that part d has we think there s a unique opportunity for us we ve built some care models in the past we were kind of connected more at the provider level where we really drove some improved health outcomes we think there s a real opportunity for us to connect deeper at the payer level particularly in working with envisionrxoptions here there s a lot of interest that we we ve kind of been out and surveyed the market place a little bit there s a lot of interest particularly in the regional health plan space folks are really looking in terms of how they re going to compete with these bigger vertically integrated sort of healthcare models we think there s some exciting opportunities for us potentially in that space and others as we kind of dig in here with the kinds of things that we can do with the core competencies that we have so that s where we think a lot of the opportunity is there s been a lot of action over obviously in the part d space and even some in the commercial space with some of our reimbursement being tied to outcomes in terms of what we deliver on various key metrics in the pharmacy so that s kind of an ongoing trend i d say michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it and then you ve talked about opportunities around prescription file buys can you talk about what that pipeline looks like at this point with the ongoing reimbursement pressure that you and your larger competitors have been discussing are you seeing an increase in the number of opportunities for file buys and can you talk about whether there s been any changes in terms sort of the relative historical valuations on script files matt schroeder chief financial officer yeah mike it s matt i ll jump in and tackle this one i think from the standpoint of there s always been kind of a pretty robust pipeline there s a surprising level of churn in this business when you get past kind of some of the get down into the independent level there s quite a few independence there s a lot of churn in the business and the other thing is i think you are seeing some competitors probably more on the big box and grocery level who are looking to scale back their pharmacy have looked to scale back their pharmacy offer and that s put some stuff in the pipeline as well it s competitive it s competitive on a kind of deal by deal basis it all depends on who s in the marketplace as far as valuations i think in the past we ve used a range of 10 to 20 per script and i d say that range still holds michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then if i could squeeze one more john standley chief executive officer hey mike i would just throw one more thing on to that we talk about buying files we talk about preferred networks and things i mean a big opportunity for us is really about the capacity we have in this business today i mean we have the ability to add a lot of script volume here there s a high component of fixed cost in operating our retail pharmacies so between those kinds of opportunities and again trying to build relationships with payer partners on outcomes and using that to bring more foot traffic into the stores as well we think there s a lot of value we can create here and those file buys and preferred networks have a low incremental cost to fill so we can afford to make some investments there michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and if i could squeeze one more on the pbm side as we think about the hhs rebate rule on rebates at the point of sale as it relates to your pbm can you talk about the potential impact to your business if that were to go in place as proposed and if we were ultimately to see a shift away from rebates in the commercial market can you talk about how much of your profit is driven by retained rebates and sort of what the impact would be on your business going forward if rebates were to go away ben bulkley chief executive officer so right now mike this is ben we retain no rebates in our medicare medicaid lines to our commercial clients we pass all your rebates in our transparent model so the key question with the proposed ruling is one of timing given as we move into our bids coming up and having a stable set of rules our expectation is we ll be bidding off of the rules that are in place at the time and we hope to do well with that michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it appreciate the comments operator our next question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst hi this is kevin on for bob this morning thanks for taking the question so first obviously reimbursement pressure seems to be having a meaningful impact on you guys and your competitors this upcoming year i was just wondering if there is any detail you can give around expectations or cadence for the retail gross margin through fiscal 20 and whether you expect we should see any improvement in margins off of the fiscal 4q levels thanks john standley chief executive officer sure i think that s a great question again i think for us when you look at just overall the cadence of reimbursement rate i think this last year and this coming year fiscal year 20 they are at reduced levels from where they were just the two years prior to that we actually saw much deeper declines and the issue for us this coming year is a little bit probably more on the purchasing side having said that we re actually not quite yet buttoned down for fiscal year 2020 we still have an open contract that we re working through so our guidance is based on the best information we have right now based on where we think rates are going to land in terms of cadence i think you re right generally the fourth quarter even into the first quarter here it takes us a little bit of time to get the generic savings through our various bids and also little bit of timing on how some loes are coming to market in the year so a little bit more pressure early and then as those savings and some of the loes kick in the back half that really pushes us along kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks and then one quick one on cash flow so if i look at the fiscal 20 guidance for ebitda and kind of factor out interest capex and some of the restructuring it s getting me to roughly break even for cash flow for next year so one is that like roughly correct and would you expect net working capital to be a meaningful swing factor one way or other next year john standley chief executive officer yeah first of all your math is correct you kind of walked the ebitda down to the cash interest and debt rent and capex you get to a flat cash flow i would say some of these initiatives we re focusing on could have a working capital impact and we re going to be pushing hard on those i don t want to meaningful is probably a big numbers but i think my expectation would be we d have some positive working capital benefit coming through this year kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks guys john standley chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning in your guidance you talked about reimbursement rate pressure and 20 being similar to 19 can you tell us what the reimbursement rate pressure would have been on a dollar basis in 2019 and i think there s a lot of commentary in the industry that these reimbursement rate pressures are accelerating so i guess it was a little surprising that you said it was similar so if you could comment on that as well john standley chief executive officer well i mean i think we all have different contract renewal dates and cadences we ve never i don t think it s appropriate for us to give that out because it starts to get what our actual rates are so don t think that s the right thing to do but because of the timing of renewals and we took a lot of rate declines a couple years ago when we were working through some of our merger activity so it does show up different times in different places i think i don t think we all have to be at exactly the same spot at any given moment we do still have an open contract to work through for the current year so we got to get that finalized but our comments are accurate our rate pressure is probably where it s going to be we think based on what we know so far it s going to be pretty similar for our fiscal year 20 as it was for our fiscal year 19 bryan everett chief operating officer and i think i would add is i think the commentary around the generic market between the kind of introductions that are single source and the supplier things that some of our competitors have been saying as well that s a pretty big factor on pharmacy margin for sure william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst that makes sense and then i don t think if i remember that you have ever quantified the new mckesson agreement in terms of the tailwind there is there anything you can provide there because i think it becomes effective in march or i guess a month ago john standley chief executive officer no it s actually is back in the fourth quarter bryan everett chief operating officer it s already effective we ve never given kind of a number it s in the guidance we don t break out all the various components of pharmacy margins william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then just lastly from me it would seem to me that given the transparency of envisionrx business model it would be a little better position given a lot of these i guess headlines that are coming out in the market i guess do you think that that is the case and do you think that this is going to allow you to win additional medicare part d in those 2020 negotiations for bidding ben bulkley chief executive officer yes this is ben we do we re seeing a really nice uptick in the health of our funnel we re off to a great start already this year so we re very positive on the progress we re making and clients are indicating a real hunger for this option as they consider their buying decision william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay i ll pass it to others thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ross muken from evercore your line is open suzie yoon evercore analyst hey guys this is suzie yoon on for ross i think most of my questions have been asked but you mentioned you ve initiated the search for a new ceo could you just provide us with an update on management plans and what the timeline looks like for the ceo cfo and coo hiring john standley chief executive officer well we ve got a cfo matt schroeder is here and he is our cfo so that s good news we have a coo bryan everett s here i m the guy on the bubble and i know the board is actively working on the search so did i answer that question i m not sure suzie yoon evercore analyst got you thank you john standley chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of karru martinson from jefferies your line is open karru martinson jefferies analyst good morning guys in terms of tsa wind down you talked about 42 million of savings coming through this year being realized what s the cadence of those savings and what s your level of confidence on offsetting that full 96 million matt schroeder chief financial officer first of all the cadence of the savings is pretty much starting right away and going through the year i mean with the restructuring we announced last month is being in action very quickly so i would say that s pretty evenly spread through the year john standley chief executive officer i mean probably a little bit less in the first quarter and more in the back matt schroeder chief financial officer yes on the 96 million karru i think as we ve moved along here through the tsa wind down i think we ve done actually a pretty good job of not leaving stranded costs in the business for that we talked about how this 40 millions is going to almost directly offset the reduction in tsa fees that we re expecting for this year i think between the other initiatives we have out there plus kind of the rest of the run rate impact of the restructuring we ve already announced i m very confident we ll offset that 96 million karru martinson jefferies analyst okay and then in terms of the pro forma leverage here that s assuming the that 160 million ph or so comes in from walgreens as excess proceeds and those would go to the 2023 notes correct matt schroeder chief financial officer it assumes that the 160 million is a reduction in our debt i think we still have some limited excess proceeds offer we need to make on the 2023 notes i don t know if it winds up dollar for dollar but there s a little bit more we need to do there karru martinson jefferies analyst okay and then lastly you guys talked about looking at your front end and aligning it with your customer needs we ve seen some talk about looking at the card section bringing in the cbd oils and things of that nature how do you look at transforming and what parts of your business do you feel are lagging and what parts have traction with the consumer today bryan everett chief operating officer karru it s bryan i ll just kind of reiterate the overall sku optimization project to really try to identify skus that are unproductive get those out reallocate that space for more better for you cleaner products natural organic and then the own brand it s probably the one to answer the last part of the question it s probably the one where we have the most opportunity to make up ground on karru martinson jefferies analyst all right thanks very much guys operator and we have time for one more question our final question today will come from the line of bryan hunt from wells fargo securities your line is open bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst thank you just sticking with karru s questioning have you all done any initial reset testing on the front end and what type of reactions are you getting from sales and margin improvements on those resets bryan everett chief operating officer bryan it s bryan we have experimented with a number of different we call them innovation sets both in grocery healthcare but we ve got a lot more work to do so the new wellness remodel we still believe is a very shoppable and easy to navigate experience we believe the layout in that format is still very good but when you start digging into the item selection within the departments we again think there s some opportunity to sort of edit what we have at shelf the new grocery innovation that we worked on that we talked about a little bit last quarter i think we have this in about 150 stores we re getting very good feedback from consumers about the expanded assortment of healthy offerings the easier to navigate aisles etcetera so i guess the short answer is yes we have quite a few of these different tests out there in the field and we will continue to do so john standley chief executive officer and i would just add that we re working through a process it ll go through a good part of this fiscal year that again as we think about the pharmacy side of the business and really some core customers that drive both the pharmacy and the front end and how we can better meet their needs we re also looking at what kind of disease states are we talking about we re looking a little bit more locally and regionally about how these stores should be merchandised and trying to get all those pieces of puzzle really to fit together as we go forward bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst and when you look at all these test alerts on the pharmacy side and the additional services you may add are in the front end in terms of merchandising do you all expect to have some type of more formalized plan that can be rolled out next year or do you feel like john standley chief executive officer that s exactly right we got a ton of work going on behind the scenes here so i ve got parts out being tested and what not but it s going to come together in a more formal way for fiscal year 21 and we d be talking about it each quarter as it develops here bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst great just a couple more questions one you look at the amazon lockers can you talk about which stores where you have amazon lockers today and maybe how the performance of those front ends may differ relative to stores that don t john standley chief executive officer bryan we have these lockers in a few stores and i would say just generally we see some traffic generated from these lockers we will be expanding this over the next few months to an additional 900 stores we re actually 900 in total so we are excited to move forward with that partnership bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst if you look at the at the cbd opportunity i know you re rolling it out in a few states it seems like there s a lot of noise in that category in terms of product purity is there any way you can communicate to us which brand or brands you re rolling out john standley chief executive officer what i can say bryan is we have two vendors that we have been working with for several months actually and like any product we put in the store there s a pretty rigorous vetting process to make sure we have the best offering available the other comment i would make is at this point in time we are only offering the topical solutions of creams lip balms lotions we won t be carrying any of the injectables at any of our stores as part of the pilot bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst and then my last question there s a measles scare in various parts of the country you have stores in those areas are those vaccinations that you all could provide and are you seeing any difference in performance i guess in certain parts of the country given the various scares on measles and maybe other viruses currently thank you that s it i appreciate your time john standley chief executive officer okay it s a short answer the answer is yes we do provide these vaccinations and yes we are seeing an increase in the administration of these immunizations and we have supply to do so bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst well thank you for your time and best of luck john standley chief executive officer thank you bryan operator and we have no further questions john standley chief executive officer okay great we appreciate everybody s time today and look forward to talking to you in the future operator thanks to all of our

by reuters by jonathan cable london reuters global economic growth is slowing according to the international monetary fund policymakers and hundreds of economists polled by reuters but that downturn is coming at a time when central banks arsenals are running on empty on tuesday the imf cut its expectations for world growth to its lowest level since 2016 its third downgrade since october and said risks to the global financial system have grown over the past six months this is a delicate moment for the global economy imf chief economist gita gopinath told a news conference major central banks have reined in their forecasts and in recent months economists in reuters polls have repeatedly trimmed their expectations for the countries they cover last week s releases provide some reassurance that the world economy is not falling off a cliff which had seemed a plausible if relatively small risk as recently as a month or so ago this is clearly good news said neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics but we remain in the late stages of this global economic expansion springtime inevitably brings with it an air of optimism for the future but in the case of the world economy at least we expect growth to remain subdued rising trade protectionism and tighter financial conditions have been blamed for the slowdown uncertainty over how to practically implement britain s june 2016 decision to quit the european union has also played its part trade conflict with the united states and sluggish demand means china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year a reuters poll showed on friday while still waging a trade war against china that is widely regarded as harmful to global growth u s president donald trump has now threatened to slap tariffs on 11 billion 8 4 billion pounds of products from the eu those threats come as british politicians continue to struggle to agree on a way to leave the eu a messy exit would almost certainly further damage the economies of both sides in the divorce with the impact likely spreading further afield in the early hours of thursday eu leaders gave britain six more months to leave the bloc but the latest extension still offers little clarity on when how or even if brexit will happen british prime minister theresa may has so far failed to build support in the uk parliament for the withdrawal terms she agreed with the eu last year but she now has until oct 31 to do that or find an alternative course brexit was originally supposed to have occurred two weeks ago but the intractability of the problem coupled with political incompetence on the part of the uk means that it has been postponed yet again said peter dixon an economist at commerzbank the scope for lifting brexit related uncertainty is thus limited which suggests little prospect of a sustainable rebound in either the economy or sterling the cupboard was bare what appears to be a globally synchronised economic slowdown comes as central banks run out of tools for supporting growth advertisement after the 2008 financial crisis policymakers slashed interest rates sometimes below zero and also turned to more unconventional measures to boost growth such as pumping trillions of dollars into economies but as inflation has never really picked up many of them have yet to change tack and start tightening the u s federal reserve led the pack and has hiked rates nine times in the current cycle but it is probably now done with increases until at least the end of next year the bank of england has lifted bank rate twice since the june 2016 referendum but borrowing costs remain very close to record lows and expectations for a rate hike later this year are far from set in stone the european central bank already on its longest break from changing interest rates may have missed its chance to raise them this time around altogether according to a median forecast in a reuters poll the first increase won t come until after june next year advertisement on wednesday ecb president mario draghi even raised the prospect of more support for the struggling euro zone economy if its slowdown persisted saying the central bank had plenty of instruments with which to react however one problem is that after pushing borrowing costs to record lows and taking 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds out of the market the ecb s options are limited and there are fears what it has will not be enough market pricing is expressing more anxiety that the ecb is either too slow to use whatever is left in its policy toolbox or worse that it thinks the tools won t do much anyway said laurence mutkin global head of g10 rates strategy at bnp paribas reporting by jonathan cable editing by hugh lawson

w bank says poverty worsening in the country martins ifijeh funke olaode and shola oyeyipo in washington dc the managing director international monetary fund imf mrs christine lagarde has advised the nigerian government to jettison spending on fuel subsidy and expend the money on health education and infrastructural development also reviewing the sub sahara african countries situation the world bank group said the level of poverty in nigeria is getting worse despite other regions progress on shared prosperity lagarde who made the call thursday during the global policy agenda press briefing at the ongoing world bank spring meeting in washington dc said subsidy spending was infringing on other critical areas of capital development including health education and infrastructure hence the need for the government to refocus the imf chief said it was the monetary institution s general principle to discourage fossil fuel subsidies because of its consequences on other areas of life and development she said as far as nigeria is concerned with the low revenue mobilisation that exists in the country in terms of tax to gdp nigeria is amongst the lowest a real effort has to be done in order to maintain a good public finance situation for the country and in order to direct investment towards health education and infrastructural development highlighting some of the negative impacts of fuel subsidy lagarde said if you look at our numbers from 2015 it is no less than about 5 2 trillion that are spent on fuel subsidies and the consequences thereof and the fiscal affairs department has actually identified how much would have been saved fiscally but also in terms of human life if there had been the right price on carbon emission as of 2015 numbers are quite staggering if that was to happen then there would be more public spending available to build hospitals to build roads to build schools and to support education and health for the people now how this is done is the more complicated path because there has to be a social protection safety net that is in place so that the most exposed in the population do not take the brunt of those removal of subsidies principle so that is our position she explained speaking on the roles of imf in global policy agenda the imf boss stated that the global economy has entered a delicate phase growth is slowing reflecting trade and geopolitical tensions policy uncertainty and one off factors according to lagarde domestic policies need to strengthen growth enhance resilience and promote inclusion assuring the people that imf will support members in designing tailored macroeconomic policies fiscal policy should strike the right chord between supporting demand ensuring debt sustainability and safeguarding social objectives including by upgrading tax systems mobilising domestic revenue priortising expenditure and reducing public debt where needed monetary policy should ensure that inflation remains on track towards target and focus on anchoring expectations where inflationary pressures persist financial resilience must be enhanced including by continuing to buttress micro prudential supervision and strengthen micro prudential frameworks that manage risk w bank says poverty worsening in nigeria others meanwhile the world bank group has revealed that the level of poverty in nigeria and other sub saharan african countries is getting worse despite other regions progress on shared prosperity it also said illicit transfer of funds from the region to the developed world has become a huge challenge that must be tackled appropriately also speaking yesterday during the world bank press briefing at the ongoing imf world bank spring meeting in washington dc the president of the world bank mr david malpass said if the regional challenge is not tackled urgently before year 2030 it could push those countries into extreme poverty with the citizens most affected he said by 2030 nearly nine in 10 poor people will be from africa while progresses are predicted to be made in other regions this is troubling and we must collaborate to address this the world bank group is financially strong but we have started meeting member countries to ensure this is addressed we must coordinate resources to boost prosperities in africa and other parts of the world we are also talking to donors and countries involved to arrive at a sustained and workable approach malpass who has only spent three days as the president of the institution said some of the concerns in the tackling of poverty and improvement of the economy in low and middle income countries include climate change digital economy and capital flow he added climate change is one huge challenge at the moment and we believe the bank s goal in addressing it can be achieved digital economy will help boost economic development some countries have success stories that sub sahara african countries and other countries can learn from one of such nations is china which has been able to reduce poverty to a great extent he also stated that on illicit financial flows the bank would continue to work with nations to ensure such funds are tracked and that financial flows should be done legitimately he also stated that nigeria and 16 other countries were at risk of debt financial distress debt helps economies grow but if not done in a transparent way it can drag down such economies that is why we need transparent disclosures of debts as they are created he said

alan greenspan who chaired the federal reserve from 1987 to 2006 with an abiding faith in private sector bankers that cracked a bit in the ensuing financial collapse is peddling another book capitalism in america with economist writer adrian wooldridge on thursday greenspan 93 stopped by the university of pennsylvania joined briefly onstage by wife andrea mitchell of nbc news a penn trustee to plug his book and take a few questions at the invitation of penn wharton budget model chief kent smetters some highlights edited for clarity what makes america special immigration and the freedoms in our constitution both of which feed capitalism greenspan says go back 400 years in our economic history always growth came with immigrants advertisement and the constitution as updated guarantees individual rights and as a consequence property rights which give you all sorts of incentives to learn work save invest and succeed we can still learn from other nations greenspan sees sweden as a model not so much for generous social benefits but because it killed the most expensive one a guaranteed pension whose cost was a drag on investment and jobs greenspan has long argued that the united states cannot afford social security medicare and medicaid on today s terms that s because there are not enough workers and taxpayers are getting squeezed to finance retirees and patients every dollar of entitlement increase reduces gross domestic savings in the u s by 1 a claim that he says he once doubted but that he has validated from economic data sweden solved the problem of benefit costs growing faster than national production by trimming its guaranteed retirement grants and moving toward a savings plan whose value varies with market prices much like private sector 401 k plans in the u s similarly pennsylvania and philadelphia have recently limited their pension guarantees and added savings plans for new hires it s not enough to fix social security and medical costs as more citizens stop having babies and the president tells immigrants that america is full the population is aging fast the average pennsylvanian is over 40 and there are fewer workers paying into medical and retirement plans compared with the numbers retiring that s a drag on investment and growth greenspan worries that it s a self reinforcing process when from 3 5 percent to 2 percent you get populism in the white house and europe in movements like the u k attempt to leave the european union smetters who serves on a social security technical advisory committee asked how greenspan would advise extending social security so it doesn t start running low on funds for the next generation they ll have to cut benefits 24 percent or boost taxes he said smetters noted that greenspan made similar recommendations in the 1980s president ronald reagan and house speaker thomas p tip o neill agreed to boost social security contributions and delay target retirement ages so benefits could increase with inflation without bankrupting the system until baby boomers started retiring what about the fast growing federal deficit politically deficits really don t matter until trillions in debt and bank payments pile up driving interest rates and prices higher and by then it s hard to stop unless the government cuts benefits another major political problem greenspan said can socialism come back it was government assisted private capitalism that helped europe recover and asia advance greenspan argued he attributed renewed interest in socialist ideas to income inequality which he acknowledged as a significant negative in the society i m not sure i know an easy way out of it inequality is fed in part by new technologies which tend to boost profits for their providers as older sectors lag people might not be getting smarter but better tools give us higher and higher technical capabilities which are now going up faster than the capability of the average human being to handle them which results in an increasing portion of income going to smaller and smaller groups so it s important for social stability greenspan said to find ways to teach people with normal intelligence to do a job that s done by people with higher intelligence using those same technologies smetters pressed greenspan on his legacy did his years of granting americans easy money at low interest rates when he ran the fed plus reduced regulation under his admirers presidents reagan bill clinton and the bushes provoke the great recession of the late 2000s greenspan protested that the fed and its interest rate and debt buying policies have less influence than they used to given the rise of china and other foreign economies aging populations and the flood of investor capital worldwide china is our only conceivable opponent for world leadership greenspan told the packed house china has more than triple our population but per capita income in china is still only one third of ours we had china s per capita income in 1960 and at that time we produced steel aluminum and coal all the things that are essentially obsolescent today china grew fast in the 1980s and 1990s as it granted western style investment freedoms but china s current president xi jinping has instituted aggressive central control policies that have slowed that nation s growth greenspan said the political changes that have accelerated under xi whose government as greenspan didn t spell out has suppressed independent criticism mass imprisoned muslims and members of other minority groups and demanded corporate support for communist party initiatives mean that china is no longer what it was under deng xiaoping that leaves the u s as a world leader creative destruction has moved basic u s industries to cheaper countries while software medical and robotics technology thrive here that s natural for a rich country greenspan said policies dedicated to resurrecting old industries would only drive up prices and erode u s national income and living standards smetters asked if trump style tariffs and trade restrictions will push china in the right direction greenspan laughed a tariff is a tax on your own citizens who pay import fees he pointed out neither side wins a trade war both end up paying more for goods greenspan described china s lack of income security as a social benefit workers there lacking social security or medicare save a lot more of their pay than americans which banks and insurers invest in companies and other property high savings feeds higher capital investment which creates increased productivity higher standards of living he agreed it would be politically tough to get americans to agree to go back to that kind of country the real problem in a capitalist economy is it goes up and it crashes then grows again greenspan added there is no way to avoid that it s a very difficult problem
