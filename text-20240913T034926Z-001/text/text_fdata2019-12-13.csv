september 2019 were 1 12 30 september 2018 1 18 on an annualised basis chairperson s statement for the year ended 30 september 2019 the financial year started with challenging conditions for investors with largely weaker corporate earnings slower global growth expectations from the international monetary fund imf and a very hawkish october 2018 commentary from the federal reserve fed sentiment was impacted when fed chair powell raised the possibility of fed funds being tightened beyond the perceived neutral rate creating fears of a policy error as a result global stock markets had the worst month in 6 years and the benchmark 10 year us treasury yield breached the 3 25 resistance level geopolitical fears and comments from president trump reiterating his disapproval of powell and the fed s tightening bias added further to volatility at the november 2018 federal open market committee fomc meeting powell made a complete u turn and his dovish tone resulted in a sharp turnaround for the interest rates market sending the 10 year us treasury yield below 3 nevertheless the fed increased the fed funds rate to 2 25 2 50 on 19 december 2018 but the market immediately began to sense that the next move would be lower despite the dot plot charts suggesting the opposite then on the 4 january 2019 at the american economic associations aea meeting in atlanta powell emphasised that the fed were adopting a data dependant stance and that he wouldn t hesitate to adjust the balance sheet reduction if it was causing problems for the economy this supportive guidance led to a sharp rally in credit markets reversing the credit spread widening seen in q4 2018 the key event over the summer was the federal open markets committee fomc meeting on 31 july 2019 when the fed funds rate was cut for the first time in a decade powell said it was a mid cycle adjustment but that it didn t mean the fed would stop at just one cut amid this and the trade tariff uncertainty the key 2 10s yield curve briefly inverted which many investors consider a reliable end of cycle predictor over the reporting period sentiment was pulled in different directions by trade talks between usa and china and the emergence of tensions between the eu and usa over eu state subsidies added to concerns over the economic outlook in europe narratives relating to these tensions continue to impact sentiment volatility and the economic outlook and these remain unresolved volatility in european assets remained relatively high driven by a difficult political backdrop and poor economic performance germany is especially sensitive to a fall in global trade and to the ongoing trade disputes and falling factory orders were an area of concern for investors and policy makers reflecting this mario draghi struck a dovish note stating that the european central bank ecb saw risks tilted to the downside and they stood ready to adjust all instruments if necessary draghi delivered on this in september 2019 announcing a further cut in the ecb refinancing rate to 50bps further quantitative easing qe from 1 november 2019 and tiering for bank reserve deposits held at the ecb it remains to be seen if this policy will succeed in the real economy but markets responded favourably brexit news continued to dominate the headlines in the uk with paralysis in the political system adding to uncertainty and negotiating difficulties whilst the uk economy remained relatively resilient uk assets increasingly discounted high perceived risks from brexit and potential domestic political fallout these accounts will be approved on the 12 december 2019 which is election day in the uk and therefore the uncertainty remains as i write this hopefully by the time you read it that uncertainty will have been lifted the portfolio managers recognised that the weaker sentiment and heightened volatility in q4 2018 was an intra cycle dip rather than the start of an end of cycle period and took the opportunity to selectively add favoured credits at the shorter end of the credit curve however a lack of new issuance volume impaired secondary market flows limiting the availability of suitable assets despite demand for tap issues the portfolio managers declined a number of requests for new share issuance and only 3m of new shares were issued over the year portfolio performance and dividends despite considerable economic uncertainty geopolitical volatility and a very challenging period for markets in q4 2018 the fund generated a respectable return over the financial year the total return based on reinvestment of dividends for the year was 5 16 nav per share reflecting the difficult backdrop the 3 months to 31 december 2018 produced a negative return of 2 92 but the last 9 months generated a strong 7 94 return once again the key outperforming sector for the year was banking where the portfolio managers continue to be very selective the net contribution from the banking sector was 2 92 or 57 of the total return for the fund despite representing only 35 of the average allocation during the period insurance was another key performing sector generating a net contribution of 0 99 the allocation to asset backed securities abs averaged 28 through the year but contributed a net 1 17 of the return as the bonds were slow to recover from the sharp sell off in late 2018 the portfolio managers still consider the sector to represent relative value and maintain the exposure the only sectors where there were negative returns for the year were in european high yield corporates net contribution 0 17 and north american high yield corporates net contribution 0 54 these were primarily due to the underperformance in the french paper and pulp company lecta and us energy producer ep energy during the period the share price dropped 4p 2018 2 5p but dividends totalling 6 55p 2018 6 56p were paid therefore the share price return including dividends paid but not reinvested was 2 63 2018 4 08 to some extent this reflects the fall in the premium to nav which fell from 4 11 to 2 62 results are discussed further in the director s report moving forward this economic and credit cycle is now extended and whilst defaults and recover rates remain attractive an expectation that this will not remain so forever is not unreasonable although the manager does not currently anticipate a significant change to existing conditions we must be mindful that the quality of the general credit universe has fallen over the past decade favourable issuance terms have led to relaxed covenants and lower yields enabling weaker companies to refinance often with extended maturities as a credit fund we are exposed to a deterioration in the credit environment and the higher yield we generate is a reward of illiquidity and credit risks the focus of the manager is very bottom up and is built on a strong understanding of each security held and the specific drivers of credit this centres on only buying securities that satisfy strict criteria and then closely monitoring these thus helping mitigate many risks more top down strategies incur the closed ended structure for this fund was chosen to enable the manager to exploit the illiquidity premium on certain types of fixed income security this dramatically reduces any mismatch between the liquidity of the fund and that of the underlying assets held making this the most prudent way to hold such assets however recent comments by powell and carney head of the bank of england about potential illiquidity in fixed income markets is a warning that the cost and availability of liquidity is not constant high demand for fixed income products coupled with low yields and spreads has ensured robust issuance activity reducing the cost to deploy funds but secondary market liquidity can be problematic due to changes in the market eco system including regulatory reforms whilst this can generate an illiquidity premium which feeds our strategy we are very aware of the wider impact of a shift in liquidity and monitor this closely benefiting from detailed liquidity analysis by the manager and the afim the current economic expansion is the longest in modern history and hence investor sentiment is becoming more fragile geopolitical risks remain elevated and with global growth declining and economic risk growing the portfolio managers anticipate more frequent periods of volatility as the end of this cycle approaches they intend to utilise any heightened volatility to source suitable new assets and maintain the relatively attractive yield without taking increased risks as such the portfolio managers are confident that the company s income will continue to be sufficient to maintain the 0 5p dividend per month for the year ahead claire whittet chair 12 december 2019 portfolio manager s report for the year ended 30 september 2019 the first half of the financial year was defined by two very distinct quarters the first quarter began with a number of challenges for investors with disappointing earnings from a number of bellwether corporates such as amazon and caterpillar and a sobering downgrade of global growth expectations from the international monetary fund imf however market sentiment became severely impaired following a very hawkish october 2018 commentary from fed chair jerome powell raising the possibility of fed funds being tightened beyond the perceived neutral rate resulting in market fears of an impending policy error this led to global stocks having their worst month in 6 years the benchmark 10y us treasury yield breaching the 3 25 resistance level and the key 2 10s curve briefly steepen to 34bps geopolitical fears then took hold again resulting in treasury yields retreating back with volatility being further stoked by comments from president trump who reiterated his disapproval of powell and the fed s tightening bias sensing a repeat of the bernanke tantrum of 2013 powell adopted a dovish tone in his november 2018 statement which resulted in a sharp change of direction for the rates market with the 10y ust yield dipping below 3 and the 2s10s curve flatten by c 20bps over the month as expected the fed hiked fed funds to 2 25 2 50 on 19 december 2018 but the market then began to question whether the fed would be able to hike at all in 2019 despite the dot plot charts suggesting the opposite this uncertainty coupled to some forced selling by international funds resulted in a weak quarter for sentiment and asset performance at the american economic associations aea meeting in atlanta on 4 january 2019 powell who was joined by janet yellen and ben bernanke emphasised that the fed were taking a data dependant stance and that he wouldn t hesitate to adjust the balance sheet reduction if it was causing problems for the economy the market took this as confirmation of a supportive fed leading to a sharp rally in credit markets rapidly reversing the widening of q4 2018 while the dovish stance led to a weaker usd which in turn helped the em sector to also recover fresh round of talks between us and china helped market sentiment over the early spring period although president trump threatened to impose 11bn of tariffs on european goods which led the eu to formally open trade talks there was a brief reversal in sentiment in may 2019 as the us imposed restrictions on huawei corporation together with negative rhetoric from the trump administration claiming china had back tracked on previous trade agreements an agreement that the us china talks could re convene at the g20 meeting helped sentiment recover and this was supplemented by a very dovish tone from powell increasing expectations of further cuts to fed funds the key event over the summer was the fomc meeting on 31 july 2019 when fed funds were cut for the first time in a decade powell said it was a mid cycle adjustment but that it didn t mean the fed would stop at just one cut amid this and the trade tariff uncertainty the key 2s10s yield curve briefly inverted which many investors consider a reliable end of cycle predictor in the eurozone volatility continued in italian government bonds btps as a disagreement between the eu and coalition government in rome intensified over the budget deficit moody s added to the volatility by downgrading italy s rating to baa3 italy continued to underperform their eu peers despite the bank of italy predicting a deficit of over 3 in 2019 although the downside was softened by the positive tone in the wider market in germany the ruling cdu lost the key hesse elections which ultimately resulted in angela merkel announcing her resignation as head of the party although she intends to stay on as chancellor until the end of her term in 2021 in france president macron s popularity hit the low point as he caved in to demands from a populist uprising against the perceived elitist nature of the french government german factory orders began to concern investors in q2 and mario draghi struck a dovish note stating that the ecb saw risks tilted to the downside but they stood ready to adjust all instruments if necessary this was correctly interpreted by the market that further stimulus was being planned and hence the market rallied in anticipation in june the market was left in no doubt about a supportive ecb when draghi delivered a speech at the meeting in sintra where he stated additional stimulus if the outlook for europe doesn t improve meanwhile in the uk the news was dominated by the ongoing saga of brexit talks failed around the key irish border issue resulting in theresa may being ousted as prime minister and a number of resignations and sackings in the conservative party resulting in new leader and prime minister johnson losing a coalition majority in the house and being forced by parliament to take no deal off the negotiating table with the eu hopes that a deal would be struck before the eu elections in may 2019 faded along with the leaving date of 31 october 2019 and the calling of a uk general election on the 12 december 2019 merely fuelled the uncertainty portfolio commentary the portfolio managers recognised that the weaker sentiment and heightened volatility in q4 2018 was an intra cycle dip rather than the start of an end of cycle period and took the opportunity where possible to add favoured credits at the shorter end of the credit curve however a lack of new issuance volume which impaired secondary market flow did limit the availability of suitable assets and as such the portfolio managers declined a number of requests for new share issuance the sharp improvement in market sentiment following the fed pivot in january added to the challenge of sourcing suitable assets although the re financing of the original at1 additional tier 1 issues in 2013 and 2014 are now occurring in the market and is gradually creating new opportunity and alleviating any re investment risk for the fund overall the fund has performed in line with expectations this year ending 30 september 2019 generating a total return based on reinvestment of dividends of 5 16 for the year nav per share meeting its main goals of generating attractive income while protecting capital as a comparison the euro high yield index generated a total return of 5 22 over the period the sterling high yield 6 25 and dollar high yield indices 6 30 market outlook and strategy with the us economic expansion extending into record territory and geopolitical risks remaining elevated in particular fears of a hard brexit and an all out trade war between the us and china market commentary is invariably drawn to talk of when the next recession could appear as a consequence market sentiment is relative fragile nevertheless the supportive actions of central banks in 2019 including rate cuts from the federal reserve and a further rate cut and further quantitative easing from the ecb have helped risk assets to perform strongly even as risk off rates products have also generated strong returns to more cautious investors thanks mainly to central bank actions volatility remained relatively low during the period apart from q4 2018 when the portfolio managers pms were able to find very attractive investment opportunities and this is likely to continue unless geopolitical risks become elevated in this environment trading will likely remain low but with bond maturities also being relatively infrequent the pms are confident of finding attractive reinvestment opportunities and maintaining the month income of 0 50p for the year environmental social and governance introduction twentyfour believes that environmental social and governance esg considerations can have a material influence on the value of investments as such twentyfour has a formal framework which incorporates esg factors into its investment process twentyfour has a fourteen strong esg steering group representing all areas of its business including three partners and is governed by the firm s executive committee twentyfour s esg investment approach twentyfour believes that investment returns can be enhanced and protected by taking esg considerations into account in the investment process and has therefore adopted an integration approach to esg as part of the firm s integrated investment approach every member of the investment team is required to own the process as such all investment professionals at twentyfour are responsible for including esg factors in their investment decisions and this forms part of their appraisal process currently statistical evidence barclays equity gilt study 2017 shows the strongest correlation between performance and governance which is an area twentyfour has focussed on since the firm s inception another of our firm s principles is to regularly meet companies that we invest in integration an integrated approach means that we are disciplined in including esg parameters in our overall investment relative value analysis in other words esg considerations are explicitly part of our investment process as an anchor to our esg investment process we utilise a third party database in order to help provide measurement and context this data has been incorporated into our proprietary observatory relative value database the data covers a comprehensive number of esg parameters for publically listed companies this helps us in a number of ways it allows our portfolio managers to place an issuer s esg profile on a relative basis compared to its peers we are thus better placed to identify the financial implications of any specific esg risks including current controversies momentum whether the company is on an improving esg trend through time is captured and finally our analysis highlights any areas where we specifically require to think about or engage with a company just as we utilise company ratings but never rely on them as we always conduct our own research it is the same with esg in that we do not solely rely on third party output depending on our interaction with a company or our knowledge of industry trends we are able to adjust scores as appropriate there is a structural problem facing fixed income investors in that not all issuers are publically listed entities so the information set available in some instances may be sparse or just very different in such cases we have to conduct even more of our own analysis our model prompts portfolio managers with the most relevant standard questions regarding esg factors which facilitate a consistent basis for such analysis abs do not fit neatly into the model of corporates that esg databases cover while the sponsor or originator of the deal will likely be covered in the database the issuer is typically a special purpose vehicle spv set up solely for the purpose of issuing the bonds given the limited operational scope of the spv there is little opportunity for the issuer to engage in activities covering esg however that does not mean that the sponsor s business the asset pool the servicing of the underlying loans and so on are impossible to analyse through an esg lens fortunately in this strategy we build our own models for every security considered we have constructed a number of data requirements that we feel are appropriate for structured credit and which are consistent with our esg database as mentioned our level of engagement is proportionately higher for these transactions thus we have integrated esg factors into our abs investment decisions our esg investment process from a top down view which is implemented by every member of the portfolio management team can be described as numerical esg scores created esg peer assessment provided trend analysis assessed momentum controversies assessed investment and valuation implications considered engagement process when applicable in summary we have produced a framework which integrates esg into our existing relative value decision making process importantly we have really focussed on making our model flexible and easy for portfolio managers to use sometimes esg factors will be the dominant driver in an investment decision other times much less so crucially our model has the ability to evolve and is flexible enough to adapt to future regulatory or investor demands engagement and voting we believe in actively engaging on behalf of the company s investors at a company industry and regulatory level as fixed income investors our voting rights are limited thus engagement as a fixed income manager is somewhat different to that of managers in the equity space our level of engagement is relatively high when appropriate there are a number of reasons for this though central is the experience level of our partners and portfolio managers who can easily engage with companies or industry bodies at the highest level when necessary with respect to some issuers we will interact with them at multiple levels from senior to junior debt abs to whole loans our buying power also gives us the opportunity to engage this is particularly the case in our abs business where we are more often than not directly influencing the structure asset mix and terms of a transaction we also engage on behalf of the company s investors at the industry and regulatory level twentyfour asset management is an advisor to the bank of england the pra fca the uk treasury the european commission the european banking authority and a number of other eu finance ministries our firm is the only uk asset manager who are founding partners of the prime collateralised securities pcs initiative we are in our fifth term as vice chair of the association for financial markets in europe afme and a member of the bank of england residential property forum screening as mentioned above we can and do run funds which screen out investments or sectors which our risk systems and models can easily accommodate conclusion we believe that our integrated approach across our strategies achieves the main objectives of responsible investing and is in the interest of our clients we have more to do and while we do not have all the answers we will always seek to improve our process through time we will not however engage in the arms race to have the largest profile with the most badges in an attempt to impress with our esg credentials that particular trend will reduce competition and at the margin will actually be negative for the advancement of responsible investing as the industry evolves we have the platform to incorporate information and techniques where it makes sense for our investors and as such we are happy to openly engage with our clients to discuss ideas or requirements twentyfour asset management llp 12 december 2019 top twenty holdings as at 30 september 2019 credit percentage nominal security fair value of net asset shares sector value nationwide bldg

strategy the strategy for the company is to capture the illiquidity premium that is associated with off the run bond issues as part of the general search for high conviction relative value securities the portfolio manager continually came across interesting investment opportunities but too often these bonds did not offer sufficient liquidity to use in the typical daily mark to market ucits funds however they are suitable for closed ended vehicles by remaining highly selective and without conceding on underlying credit quality the strategy targets a monthly distribution of 0 5p per share with all excess income as discussed in the results section of the director s report being distributed to investors at the year end of the company internal controls the board is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining the company s system of internal financial and operating control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness the company s risk matrix continues to be the core element of the company s risk management process in establishing the company s system of internal financial and reporting control the risk matrix is prepared and maintained by the board which initially identifies the risks facing the company and then collectively assesses the likelihood of each risk the impact of those risks and the strength of the controls operating over each risk the system of internal financial and operating control is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and by their nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss these controls aim to ensure that assets of the company are safeguarded proper accounting records are maintained and the financial information for publication is reliable the board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the company this process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this annual report and audited financial statements and is reviewed by the board and is in accordance with the aic code the aic code requires directors to conduct at least annually a review of the company s system of internal financial and operating control covering all controls including financial operational compliance and risk management the board has evaluated the systems of internal controls of the company in particular it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the company and the policies by which these risks are managed the board also considers whether the appointment of an internal auditor is required and has determined that there is no requirement for a direct internal audit function the board has delegated the day to day responsibilities for the management of the company s investment portfolio the provision of depositary services and administration registrar and corporate secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the company s nav and the production of the annual report and financial statements which are independently audited formal contractual agreements have been put in place between the company and providers of these services even though the board has delegated responsibility for these functions it retains accountability for these functions and is responsible for the systems of internal control at each quarterly board meeting compliance reports are provided by the administrator company secretary portfolio manager aifm and depositary the board also receives confirmation from the administrator of its accreditation under its service organisation controls 1 report the company s risk exposure and the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the audit and risk committee at its meetings and annually by the board the board believes that the company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed principal risks and uncertainties are summerised below principal risks and uncertainties the board is responsible for the company s system of internal financial and reporting controls and for reviewing its effectiveness the board is satisfied that by using the company s risk matrix as its core element in establishing the company s system internal financial and reporting controls while monitoring the investment limits and restrictions set out in the company s investment objective and policy that the board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company the principal risks which have been identified and the steps which are taken by the board to mitigate them are as follows market risk the underlying investments comprised in the portfolio are subject to market risk the company is therefore at risk that market events may affect performance and in particular may affect the value of the company s investments which are valued on a marked to market basis market risk is the risk associated with changes in market prices including spreads economic uncertainty changes in laws and political national and international circumstances while the company through its investments in credit securities intends to hold a diversified portfolio of assets factors such as levels of sovereign debt or political events may have a material impact which could be materially detrimental to the performance of the company s investments under extreme market conditions the portfolio may not benefit from diversification for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements liquidity risk investments made by the company may be illiquid and this may limit the ability of the company to realise its investments for the purposes of cash management such as generating cash for dividend payments to shareholders or buying back ordinary shares under the quarterly tenders or in the market substantially all of the assets of the company are invested in credit securities there may be no active market in the company s interests in credit securities and the company may be required to provide liquidity to fund tender requests or repay any borrowings the company does not have redemption rights in relation to any of its investments as a consequence the value of the company s investments may be materially adversely affected for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements credit risk the company may not achieve the dividend target and investors may not get back the full value of their investment because the company invests in credit securities issued by other companies trusts or other investment vehicles which compared to bonds issued or guaranteed by governments are generally exposed to greater risk of default in the repayment of the capital provided to the issuer or interest payments due to the company the amount of credit risk is indicated by the issuer s credit rating which is assigned by one or more internationally recognised rating agencies this does not amount to a guarantee of the issuer s creditworthiness but generally provides a good indicator of the likelihood of default securities which have a lower credit rating are generally considered to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities there is a risk that an internationally recognised rating agency may assign incorrect or inappropriate credit ratings to issuers issuers often issue securities which are ranked in order of seniority which in the event of default would be reflected in the priority in which investors might be paid back the level of defaults in the portfolio and the losses suffered on such defaults may increase in the event of adverse financial or credit market conditions in the event of a default of a credit security the company s right to recover will depend on the ability of the company to exercise any rights that it has against the borrower under the insolvency legislation of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated as a creditor the company s level of protection and rights of enforcement may therefore vary significantly from one country to another may change over time and may be subject to rights and protections which the relevant borrower or its other creditors might be entitled to exercise refer to investment objective and policy within summary information for information regarding investment restrictions currently in place in order to manage credit risk for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risk through its investments denominated in currencies other than sterling the company s share capital is denominated in sterling and its expenses are incurred in sterling the company s financial statements are maintained and presented in sterling at year end of the foreign currency investments approximately 51 are in euros and 8 are in us dollars amongst other factors affecting the foreign exchange markets events in the eurozone and u s may have an impact upon the value of the euro and us dollar which in turn will impact the value of the company s euro and us dollar denominated investments the company manages its exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts which are rolled forward periodically for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements reinvestment risk quantitative easing resulted in lower yields across all fixed income products and tightening credit spreads this could pose a challenge for the portfolio manager when it comes to reinvesting any monies that result from portfolio asset redemptions and income payments the portfolio manager has recognised this potential challenge and performed ongoing cash flow analysis on the current portfolio encouragingly the redemptions and expected income payments over the coming 12 months do not pose a significant challenge trying to predict market conditions years ahead is notoriously difficult however the portfolio manager recognises there may be a requirement to be more opportunistic in terms of timing for new investments i e aim to reinvest when the market is most volatile and also to remain vigilant to requests for issuance of new shares for further information refer to note 16 to the financial statements other risks and uncertainties the board has identified the following other risks and uncertainties along with steps taken to mitigate them operational risks the company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the operations of the portfolio manager administrator aifm and the custodian and depositary amongst others the board and its audit and risk committee regularly review reports from the portfolio manager the aifm administrator and custodian and depositary on their internal controls the administrator will report to the portfolio manager any valuation issues which will be brought to the board for final approval as required accounting legal and regulatory risks the company is exposed to the risk that it may fail to maintain accurate accounting records fail to comply with requirements of its admission document and fail to meet listing obligations the accounting records prepared by the administrator are reviewed by the portfolio manager the portfolio manager administrator aifm custodian and depositary and corporate broker provide regular updates to the board on compliance with the admission document and changes in regulation changes in legal or regulatory environment can have a major impact on some classes of debt the portfolio manager and board monitor this and take appropriate action where needed income recognition risk the board considers income recognition as another risk and uncertainty of the company the portfolio manager estimates the remaining life of the security and its likely terminal value which has an impact on the effective interest rate of the credit securities which in turn impacts the calculation of interest income the board asked the audit and risk committee to consider this risk with work undertaken by the audit and risk committee as discussed within the audit and risk committee report as a result of this work the board is satisfied that income is appropriately stated in all material aspects in the financial statements cyber security risks the company is exposed to risk arising from a successful cyber attack through its service providers the company requests of its service providers that they have appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the risk of cyber attacks including minimizing the adverse consequences arising from any such attack that they provide regular updates to the board on cyber security and conduct ongoing monitoring of industry developments in this area the board is satisfied that the company s service providers have the relevant controls in place to mitigate this risk shareholder engagement the board welcomes

confirmation from all service providers that there has been no fraud bribery or corruption financial reporting and significant financial issues the audit and risk committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether the portfolio manager has made appropriate estimates and judgements the audit and risk committee reviews accounting papers prepared by the portfolio manager and administrator which provides details on the main financial reporting judgements the audit and risk committee also reviews reports by the external auditors which highlight any issues with respect to the work undertaken on the audit the significant issues considered during the year by the audit and risk committee in relation to the financial statements and how they were addressed are detailed below i valuation of investments the company s investments had a fair value of 158 334 767 as at 30 september 2019 30 september 2018 162 829 994 and represent a substantial portion of net assets of the company as such this is the largest factor in relation to the consideration of the financial statements these investments are valued in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements the audit and risk committee considered the valuation of the investments held by the company as at 30 september 2019 to be reasonable based on information provided by the portfolio manager aifm administrator custodian and depositary on their processes for the valuation of these investments ii income recognition the audit and risk committee considered the calculation of income from investments recorded in the financial statements as at 30 september 2019 as disclosed in note 3 ii b of the notes to the financial statements the estimated life of credit securities is determined by the portfolio manager impacting the effective interest rate of the credit securities which in turn impacts the calculation of income from investments the audit and risk committee reviews the portfolio manager s processes at least annually for determining the expected life of the company s investments and have found them to be reasonable based on the explanations provided and information obtained from the portfolio manager the auditor also reviews the processes and methodology supporting them the audit and risk committee was therefore satisfied that income was appropriately stated in all material aspects in the financial statements following a review of the presentations and reports from the portfolio manager and administrator and consulting where necessary with the external auditor the audit and risk committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately address the critical judgements and key estimates both in respect to the amounts reported and the disclosures the audit and risk committee is also satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining the value of assets and liabilities have been appropriately scrutinised challenged and are sufficiently robust the company s reporting currency is sterling while a significant proportion of the investments owned are denominated in foreign currencies the company operates a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency rate changes on the performance of the company the audit and risk committee has used information from the administrator and portfolio manager to satisfy itself concerning the effectiveness of the hedging process as well as to confirm that realised and unrealised foreign currency gains and losses have been correctly recorded at the audit and risk committee meeting to review the annual report and audited financial statements the audit and risk committee received and reviewed a report on the audit from the external auditors on the basis of its review of this report the audit and risk committee is satisfied that the external auditor has fulfilled its responsibilities with diligence and professional scepticism the audit and risk committee advised the board that these annual financial statements taken as a whole are fair balanced and understandable the audit and risk committee is satisfied that the judgements made by the portfolio manager and administrator are reasonable and that appropriate disclosures have been included in the financial statements external auditors the audit and risk committee has responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment re appointment and removal of the external auditors pricewaterhousecoopers ci llp pwc were appointed as the first auditors

with the audit and risk committee without the portfolio manager and other service providers being present at each audit and risk committee meeting to assess the effectiveness of the external audit process the auditors were asked to articulate the steps that they have taken to ensure objectivity and independence including where the auditor provides non audit services the audit and risk committee monitors the auditors performance behaviour and effectiveness during the exercise of their duties which informs the decision to recommend reappointment on an annual basis the company generally does not utilise external auditors for internal audit purposes secondments or valuation advice services which are in the nature of audit such as tax compliance private letter rulings accounting advice and

september 2019 were 1 12 30 september 2018 1 18 on an annualised basis chairperson s statement for the year ended 30 september 2019 the financial year started with challenging conditions for investors with largely weaker corporate earnings slower global growth expectations from the international monetary fund imf and a very hawkish october 2018 commentary from the federal reserve fed sentiment was impacted when fed chair powell raised the possibility of fed funds being tightened beyond the perceived neutral rate creating fears of a policy error as a result global stock markets had the worst month in 6 years and the benchmark 10 year us treasury yield breached the 3 25 resistance level geopolitical fears and comments from president trump reiterating his disapproval of powell and the fed s tightening bias added further to volatility at the november 2018 federal open market committee fomc meeting powell made a complete u turn and his dovish tone resulted in a sharp turnaround for the interest rates market sending the 10 year us treasury yield below 3 nevertheless the fed increased the fed funds rate to 2 25 2 50 on 19 december 2018 but the market immediately began to sense that the next move would be lower despite the dot plot charts suggesting the opposite then on the 4 january 2019 at the american economic associations aea meeting in atlanta powell emphasised that the fed were adopting a data dependant stance and that he wouldn t hesitate to adjust the balance sheet reduction if it was causing problems for the economy this supportive guidance led to a sharp rally in credit markets reversing the credit spread widening seen in q4 2018 the key event over the summer was the federal open markets committee fomc meeting on 31 july 2019 when the fed funds rate was cut for the first time in a decade powell said it was a mid cycle adjustment but that it didn t mean the fed would stop at just one cut amid this and the trade tariff uncertainty the key 2 10s yield curve briefly inverted which many investors consider a reliable end of cycle predictor over the reporting period sentiment was pulled in different directions by trade talks between usa and china and the emergence of tensions between the eu and usa over eu state subsidies added to concerns over the economic outlook in europe narratives relating to these tensions continue to impact sentiment volatility and the economic outlook and these remain unresolved volatility in european assets remained relatively high driven by a difficult political backdrop and poor economic performance germany is especially sensitive to a fall in global trade and to the ongoing trade disputes and falling factory orders were an area of concern for investors and policy makers reflecting this mario draghi struck a dovish note stating that the european central bank ecb saw risks tilted to the downside and they stood ready to adjust all instruments if necessary draghi delivered on this in september 2019 announcing a further cut in the ecb refinancing rate to 50bps further quantitative easing qe from 1 november 2019 and tiering for bank reserve deposits held at the ecb it remains to be seen if this policy will succeed in the real economy but markets responded favourably brexit news continued to dominate the headlines in the uk with paralysis in the political system adding to uncertainty and negotiating difficulties whilst the uk economy remained relatively resilient uk assets increasingly discounted high perceived risks from brexit and potential domestic political fallout these accounts will be approved on the 12 december 2019 which is election day in the uk and therefore the uncertainty remains as i write this hopefully by the time you read it that uncertainty will have been lifted the portfolio managers recognised that the weaker sentiment and heightened volatility in q4 2018 was an intra cycle dip rather than the start of an end of cycle period and took the opportunity to selectively add favoured credits at the shorter end of the credit curve however a lack of new issuance volume impaired secondary market flows limiting the availability of suitable assets despite demand for tap issues the portfolio managers declined a number of requests for new share issuance and only 3m of new shares were issued over the year portfolio performance and dividends despite considerable economic uncertainty geopolitical volatility and a very challenging period for markets in q4 2018 the fund generated a respectable return over the financial year the total return based on reinvestment of dividends for the year was 5 16 nav per share reflecting the difficult backdrop the 3 months to 31 december 2018 produced a negative return of 2 92 but the last 9 months generated a strong 7 94 return once again the key outperforming sector for the year was banking where the portfolio managers continue to be very selective the net contribution from the banking sector was 2 92 or 57 of the total return for the fund despite representing only 35 of the average allocation during the period insurance was another key performing sector generating a net contribution of 0 99 the allocation to asset backed securities abs averaged 28 through the year but contributed a net 1 17 of the return as the bonds were slow to recover from the sharp sell off in late 2018 the portfolio managers still consider the sector to represent relative value and maintain the exposure the only sectors where there were negative returns for the year were in european high yield corporates net contribution 0 17 and north american high yield corporates net contribution 0 54 these were primarily due to the underperformance in the french paper and pulp company lecta and us energy producer ep energy during the period the share price dropped 4p 2018 2 5p but dividends totalling 6 55p 2018 6 56p were paid therefore the share price return including dividends paid but not reinvested was 2 63 2018 4 08 to some extent this reflects the fall in the premium to nav which fell from 4 11 to 2 62 results are discussed further in the director s report moving forward this economic and credit cycle is now extended and whilst defaults and recover rates remain attractive an expectation that this will not remain so forever is not unreasonable although the manager does not currently anticipate a significant change to existing conditions we must be mindful that the quality of the general credit universe has fallen over the past decade favourable issuance terms have led to relaxed covenants and lower yields enabling weaker companies to refinance often with extended maturities as a credit fund we are exposed to a deterioration in the credit environment and the higher yield we generate is a reward of illiquidity and credit risks the focus of the manager is very bottom up and is built on a strong understanding of each security held and the specific drivers of credit this centres on only buying securities that satisfy strict criteria and then closely monitoring these thus helping mitigate many risks more top down strategies incur the closed ended structure for this fund was chosen to enable the manager to exploit the illiquidity premium on certain types of fixed income security this dramatically reduces any mismatch between the liquidity of the fund and that of the underlying assets held making this the most prudent way to hold such assets however recent comments by powell and carney head of the bank of england about potential illiquidity in fixed income markets is a warning that the cost and availability of liquidity is not constant high demand for fixed income products coupled with low yields and spreads has ensured robust issuance activity reducing the cost to deploy funds but secondary market liquidity can be problematic due to changes in the market eco system including regulatory reforms whilst this can generate an illiquidity premium which feeds our strategy we are very aware of the wider impact of a shift in liquidity and monitor this closely benefiting from detailed liquidity analysis by the manager and the afim the current economic expansion is the longest in modern history and hence investor sentiment is becoming more fragile geopolitical risks remain elevated and with global growth declining and economic risk growing the portfolio managers anticipate more frequent periods of volatility as the end of this cycle approaches they intend to utilise any heightened volatility to source suitable new assets and maintain the relatively attractive yield without taking increased risks as such the portfolio managers are confident that the company s income will continue to be sufficient to maintain the 0 5p dividend per month for the year ahead claire whittet chair 12 december 2019 portfolio manager s report for the year ended 30 september 2019 the first half of the financial year was defined by two very distinct quarters the first quarter began with a number of challenges for investors with disappointing earnings from a number of bellwether corporates such as amazon and caterpillar and a sobering downgrade of global growth expectations from the international monetary fund imf however market sentiment became severely impaired following a very hawkish october 2018 commentary from fed chair jerome powell raising the possibility of fed funds being tightened beyond the perceived neutral rate resulting in market fears of an impending policy error this led to global stocks having their worst month in 6 years the benchmark 10y us treasury yield breaching the 3 25 resistance level and the key 2 10s curve briefly steepen to 34bps geopolitical fears then took hold again resulting in treasury yields retreating back with volatility being further stoked by comments from president trump who reiterated his disapproval of powell and the fed s tightening bias sensing a repeat of the bernanke tantrum of 2013 powell adopted a dovish tone in his november 2018 statement which resulted in a sharp change of direction for the rates market with the 10y ust yield dipping below 3 and the 2s10s curve flatten by c 20bps over the month as expected the fed hiked fed funds to 2 25 2 50 on 19 december 2018 but the market then began to question whether the fed would be able to hike at all in 2019 despite the dot plot charts suggesting the opposite this uncertainty coupled to some forced selling by international funds resulted in a weak quarter for sentiment and asset performance at the american economic associations aea meeting in atlanta on 4 january 2019 powell who was joined by janet yellen and ben bernanke emphasised that the fed were taking a data dependant stance and that he wouldn t hesitate to adjust the balance sheet reduction if it was causing problems for the economy the market took this as confirmation of a supportive fed leading to a sharp rally in credit markets rapidly reversing the widening of q4 2018 while the dovish stance led to a weaker usd which in turn helped the em sector to also recover fresh round of talks between us and china helped market sentiment over the early spring period although president trump threatened to impose 11bn of tariffs on european goods which led the eu to formally open trade talks there was a brief reversal in sentiment in may 2019 as the us imposed restrictions on huawei corporation together with negative rhetoric from the trump administration claiming china had back tracked on previous trade agreements an agreement that the us china talks could re convene at the g20 meeting helped sentiment recover and this was supplemented by a very dovish tone from powell increasing expectations of further cuts to fed funds the key event over the summer was the fomc meeting on 31 july 2019 when fed funds were cut for the first time in a decade powell said it was a mid cycle adjustment but that it didn t mean the fed would stop at just one cut amid this and the trade tariff uncertainty the key 2s10s yield curve briefly inverted which many investors consider a reliable end of cycle predictor in the eurozone volatility continued in italian government bonds btps as a disagreement between the eu and coalition government in rome intensified over the budget deficit moody s added to the volatility by downgrading italy s rating to baa3 italy continued to underperform their eu peers despite the bank of italy predicting a deficit of over 3 in 2019 although the downside was softened by the positive tone in the wider market in germany the ruling cdu lost the key hesse elections which ultimately resulted in angela merkel announcing her resignation as head of the party although she intends to stay on as chancellor until the end of her term in 2021 in france president macron s popularity hit the low point as he caved in to demands from a populist uprising against the perceived elitist nature of the french government german factory orders began to concern investors in q2 and mario draghi struck a dovish note stating that the ecb saw risks tilted to the downside but they stood ready to adjust all instruments if necessary this was correctly interpreted by the market that further stimulus was being planned and hence the market rallied in anticipation in june the market was left in no doubt about a supportive ecb when draghi delivered a speech at the meeting in sintra where he stated additional stimulus if the outlook for europe doesn t improve meanwhile in the uk the news was dominated by the ongoing saga of brexit talks failed around the key irish border issue resulting in theresa may being ousted as prime minister and a number of resignations and sackings in the conservative party resulting in new leader and prime minister johnson losing a coalition majority in the house and being forced by parliament to take no deal off the negotiating table with the eu hopes that a deal would be struck before the eu elections in may 2019 faded along with the leaving date of 31 october 2019 and the calling of a uk general election on the 12 december 2019 merely fuelled the uncertainty portfolio commentary the portfolio managers recognised that the weaker sentiment and heightened volatility in q4 2018 was an intra cycle dip rather than the start of an end of cycle period and took the opportunity where possible to add favoured credits at the shorter end of the credit curve however a lack of new issuance volume which impaired secondary market flow did limit the availability of suitable assets and as such the portfolio managers declined a number of requests for new share issuance the sharp improvement in market sentiment following the fed pivot in january added to the challenge of sourcing suitable assets although the re financing of the original at1 additional tier 1 issues in 2013 and 2014 are now occurring in the market and is gradually creating new opportunity and alleviating any re investment risk for the fund overall the fund has performed in line with expectations this year ending 30 september 2019 generating a total return based on reinvestment of dividends of 5 16 for the year nav per share meeting its main goals of generating attractive income while protecting capital as a comparison the euro high yield index generated a total return of 5 22 over the period the sterling high yield 6 25 and dollar high yield indices 6 30 market outlook and strategy with the us economic expansion extending into record territory and geopolitical risks remaining elevated in particular fears of a hard brexit and an all out trade war between the us and china market commentary is invariably drawn to talk of when the next recession could appear as a consequence market sentiment is relative fragile nevertheless the supportive actions of central banks in 2019 including rate cuts from the federal reserve and a further rate cut and further quantitative easing from the ecb have helped risk assets to perform strongly even as risk off rates products have also generated strong returns to more cautious investors thanks mainly to central bank actions volatility remained relatively low during the period apart from q4 2018 when the portfolio managers pms were able to find very attractive investment opportunities and this is likely to continue unless geopolitical risks become elevated in this environment trading will likely remain low but with bond maturities also being relatively infrequent the pms are confident of finding attractive reinvestment opportunities and maintaining the month income of 0 50p for the year environmental social and governance introduction twentyfour believes that environmental social and governance esg considerations can have a material influence on the value of investments as such twentyfour has a formal framework which incorporates esg factors into its investment process twentyfour has a fourteen strong esg steering group representing all areas of its business including three partners and is governed by the firm s executive committee twentyfour s esg investment approach twentyfour believes that investment returns can be enhanced and protected by taking esg considerations into account in the investment process and has therefore adopted an integration approach to esg as part of the firm s integrated investment approach every member of the investment team is required to own the process as such all investment professionals at twentyfour are responsible for including esg factors in their investment decisions and this forms part of their appraisal process currently statistical evidence barclays equity gilt study 2017 shows the strongest correlation between performance and governance which is an area twentyfour has focussed on since the firm s inception another of our firm s principles is to regularly meet companies that we invest in integration an integrated approach means that we are disciplined in including esg parameters in our overall investment relative value analysis in other words esg considerations are explicitly part of our investment process as an anchor to our esg investment process we utilise a third party database in order to help provide measurement and context this data has been incorporated into our proprietary observatory relative value database the data covers a comprehensive number of esg parameters for publically listed companies this helps us in a number of ways it allows our portfolio managers to place an issuer s esg profile on a relative basis compared to its peers we are thus better placed to identify the financial implications of any specific esg risks including current controversies momentum whether the company is on an improving esg trend through time is captured and finally our analysis highlights any areas where we specifically require to think about or engage with a company just as we utilise company ratings but never rely on them as we always conduct our own research it is the same with esg in that we do not solely rely on third party output depending on our interaction with a company or our knowledge of industry trends we are able to adjust scores as appropriate there is a structural problem facing fixed income investors in that not all issuers are publically listed entities so the information set available in some instances may be sparse or just very different in such cases we have to conduct even more of our own analysis our model prompts portfolio managers with the most relevant standard questions regarding esg factors which facilitate a consistent basis for such analysis abs do not fit neatly into the model of corporates that esg databases cover while the sponsor or originator of the deal will likely be covered in the database the issuer is typically a special purpose vehicle spv set up solely for the purpose of issuing the bonds given the limited operational scope of the spv there is little opportunity for the issuer to engage in activities covering esg however that does not mean that the sponsor s business the asset pool the servicing of the underlying loans and so on are impossible to analyse through an esg lens fortunately in this strategy we build our own models for every security considered we have constructed a number of data requirements that we feel are appropriate for structured credit and which are consistent with our esg database as mentioned our level of engagement is proportionately higher for these transactions thus we have integrated esg factors into our abs investment decisions our esg investment process from a top down view which is implemented by every member of the portfolio management team can be described as numerical esg scores created esg peer assessment provided trend analysis assessed momentum controversies assessed investment and valuation implications considered engagement process when applicable in summary we have produced a framework which integrates esg into our existing relative value decision making process importantly we have really focussed on making our model flexible and easy for portfolio managers to use sometimes esg factors will be the dominant driver in an investment decision other times much less so crucially our model has the ability to evolve and is flexible enough to adapt to future regulatory or investor demands engagement and voting we believe in actively engaging on behalf of the company s investors at a company industry and regulatory level as fixed income investors our voting rights are limited thus engagement as a fixed income manager is somewhat different to that of managers in the equity space our level of engagement is relatively high when appropriate there are a number of reasons for this though central is the experience level of our partners and portfolio managers who can easily engage with companies or industry bodies at the highest level when necessary with respect to some issuers we will interact with them at multiple levels from senior to junior debt abs to whole loans our buying power also gives us the opportunity to engage this is particularly the case in our abs business where we are more often than not directly influencing the structure asset mix and terms of a transaction we also engage on behalf of the company s investors at the industry and regulatory level twentyfour asset management is an advisor to the bank of england the pra fca the uk treasury the european commission the european banking authority and a number of other eu finance ministries

have more to do and while we do not have all the answers we will always seek to improve our process through time we will not however engage in the arms race to have the largest profile with the most badges in an attempt to impress with our esg credentials that particular trend will reduce competition and at the margin will actually be negative for the advancement of responsible investing as the industry evolves we have the platform to incorporate information and techniques where it makes sense for our investors and as such we are happy to openly engage with our clients to discuss ideas or

directors to conduct at least annually a review of the company s system of internal financial and operating control covering all controls including financial operational compliance and risk management the board has evaluated the systems of internal controls of the company in particular it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the company and the policies by which these risks are managed the board also considers whether the appointment of an internal auditor is required and has determined that there is no requirement for a direct internal audit function the board has delegated the day to day responsibilities for the management of the company s investment portfolio the provision of depositary services and administration registrar and corporate secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the company s nav and the production of the annual report and financial statements which are independently audited formal

risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the audit and risk committee at its meetings and annually by the board the board believes that the company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed principal risks and uncertainties are summerised below principal risks and uncertainties the board is responsible for the company s system of internal financial and reporting controls and for reviewing its effectiveness the board is satisfied that by using the company s risk matrix as its core element in establishing the company s system internal financial and reporting controls while monitoring the investment limits and restrictions set out in the company s investment objective and policy that the board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company the principal risks which have been identified and the steps which are taken by the board to mitigate them are as follows market risk the underlying investments comprised in the portfolio are subject to market risk the company is therefore at risk that market events may affect performance and in particular may affect the value of the company s investments which are valued on a marked to market basis market risk is the risk associated with changes in market prices including spreads economic uncertainty changes in laws and political national and international circumstances while the company through its investments in credit securities intends to hold a diversified portfolio of assets factors such as levels of sovereign debt or political events may have a material impact which could be materially detrimental to the performance of the company s investments under extreme market conditions the portfolio may not benefit from diversification for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements liquidity risk investments made by the company may be illiquid and this may limit the ability of the company to realise its investments for the purposes of cash management such as generating cash for dividend payments to shareholders or buying back ordinary shares under the quarterly tenders or in the market substantially all of the assets of the company are invested in credit securities there may be no active market in the company s interests in credit securities and the company may be required to provide liquidity to fund tender requests or repay any borrowings the company does not have redemption rights in relation to any of its investments as a consequence the value of the company s investments may be materially adversely affected for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements credit risk the company may not achieve the dividend target and investors may not get back the full value of their investment because the company invests in credit securities issued by other companies trusts or other investment vehicles which compared to bonds issued or guaranteed by governments are generally exposed to greater risk of default in the repayment of the capital provided to the issuer or interest payments due to the company the amount of credit risk is indicated by the issuer s credit rating which is assigned by one or more internationally recognised rating agencies this does not amount to a guarantee of the issuer s creditworthiness but generally provides a good indicator of the likelihood of default securities which have a lower credit rating are generally considered to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities there is a risk that an internationally recognised rating agency may assign incorrect or inappropriate credit ratings to issuers issuers often issue securities which are ranked in order of seniority which in the event of default would be reflected in the priority in which investors might be paid back the level of defaults in the portfolio and the losses suffered on such defaults may increase in the event of adverse financial or credit market conditions in the event of a default of a credit security the company s right to recover will depend on the ability of the company to exercise any rights that it has against the borrower under the insolvency legislation of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated as a creditor the company s level of protection and rights of enforcement may therefore vary significantly from one country to another may change over time and may be subject to rights and protections which the relevant borrower or its other creditors might be entitled to exercise refer to investment objective and policy within summary information for information regarding investment restrictions currently in place in order to manage credit risk for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risk through its investments denominated in currencies other than sterling the company s share capital is denominated in sterling and its expenses are incurred in sterling the company s financial statements are maintained and presented in sterling at year end of the foreign currency investments approximately 51 are in euros and 8 are in us dollars amongst other factors affecting the foreign exchange markets events in the eurozone and u s may have an impact upon the value of the euro and us dollar which in turn will impact the value of the company s euro and us dollar denominated investments the company manages its exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts which are rolled forward periodically for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements reinvestment risk quantitative easing resulted in lower yields across all fixed income products and tightening credit spreads this could pose a challenge for the portfolio manager when it comes to reinvesting any monies that result from portfolio asset redemptions and income payments the portfolio manager has recognised this potential challenge and performed ongoing cash flow analysis on the current portfolio encouragingly the redemptions and expected income payments over the coming 12 months do not pose a significant challenge trying to predict market conditions years ahead is notoriously difficult however the portfolio manager recognises there may be a requirement to be more opportunistic in terms of timing for new investments i e aim to reinvest when the market is most volatile and also to remain vigilant to requests for issuance of new shares for further information refer to note 16 to the financial statements other risks and uncertainties the board has identified the following other risks and uncertainties along with steps taken to mitigate them operational risks the company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the

document and fail to meet listing obligations the accounting records prepared by the administrator are reviewed by the portfolio manager the portfolio manager administrator aifm custodian and depositary and corporate broker provide regular updates to the board on compliance with the admission document and changes in regulation changes in legal or regulatory environment can have a major impact on some classes of debt the portfolio manager and board monitor this and take appropriate action where needed income recognition risk the board considers income recognition as another risk and uncertainty of the company the portfolio manager estimates the remaining life of the security and its likely terminal value which has an impact on the effective interest rate of the credit securities which in turn impacts the calculation of interest income the board asked the audit and risk committee to consider this risk with work undertaken by the audit and risk committee as discussed within the audit and risk committee report as a result of this work the board is satisfied that income is appropriately stated in all material aspects in the financial statements cyber security risks the company is exposed to risk arising from a successful cyber attack through its service providers the company requests of its service providers that they have appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the risk of cyber attacks including minimizing the adverse consequences arising from any such attack that they provide regular updates to the board on cyber security and conduct ongoing monitoring of industry developments in this area the board is satisfied that the company s service providers have the relevant controls in place to mitigate this risk shareholder engagement the board welcomes

committee has received has been timely and clear and has enabled the committee to discharge its duties effectively the audit and risk committee is supportive of the latest uk code recommendations and other corporate governance organisations such as the aic and believes that the revised aic code when issued will allow the audit and risk committee to further strengthen its role as a key independent oversight committee a new version of the uk code was issued during 2018 and was effective from 1 january 2019 the audit and risk committee has considered the impact on its responsibilities with the company and is well placed to ensure compliance role and responsibilities the primary function of the audit and risk committee is to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities this includes reviewing the financial reports and other financial information and any significant financial judgement contained therein before publication in addition the audit and risk committee reviews

confirmation from all service providers that there has been no fraud bribery or corruption financial reporting and significant financial issues the audit and risk committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether the portfolio manager has made appropriate estimates and judgements the audit and risk committee reviews accounting papers prepared by the portfolio manager and administrator which provides details on the main financial reporting judgements the audit and risk committee also reviews reports by the external auditors which highlight any issues with respect to the work undertaken on the audit the significant issues considered during the year by the audit and risk committee in relation to the financial statements and how they were addressed are detailed below i valuation of investments the company s investments had a fair value of 158 334 767 as at 30 september 2019 30 september 2018 162 829 994 and represent a substantial portion of net assets of the company as such this is the largest factor in relation to the consideration of the financial statements these investments are valued in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements the audit and risk committee considered the valuation of the investments held by the company as at 30 september 2019 to be reasonable based on information provided by the portfolio manager aifm administrator custodian and depositary on their processes for the valuation of these investments ii income recognition the audit and risk committee considered the calculation of income from investments recorded in the financial statements as at 30 september 2019 as disclosed in note 3 ii b of the notes to the financial statements the estimated life of credit securities is determined by the portfolio manager impacting the effective interest rate of the credit securities which in turn impacts the calculation of income from investments the audit and risk committee reviews the portfolio manager s processes at least annually for determining the expected life of the company s investments and have found them to be reasonable based on the explanations provided and information obtained from the portfolio manager the auditor also reviews the processes and methodology supporting them the audit and risk committee was therefore satisfied that income was appropriately stated in all material aspects in the financial statements following a review of the presentations and reports from the portfolio manager and administrator and consulting where necessary with the external auditor the audit and risk committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately address the critical judgements and key estimates both in respect to the amounts reported and the disclosures the audit and risk committee is also satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining the value of assets and liabilities have been appropriately scrutinised challenged and are sufficiently robust the company s reporting currency is sterling while a significant proportion of the investments owned are denominated in foreign currencies the company operates a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency rate changes on the performance of the company the audit and risk committee has used information from the administrator and portfolio manager to satisfy itself concerning the effectiveness of the hedging process as well as to confirm that realised and unrealised foreign currency gains and losses have been correctly recorded at the audit and risk committee meeting to review the annual report and audited financial statements the audit and risk committee received and reviewed a report on the audit from

committee has responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment re appointment and removal of the external auditors pricewaterhousecoopers ci llp pwc were appointed as the first auditors

with the audit and risk committee without the portfolio manager and other service providers being present at each audit and risk committee meeting to assess the effectiveness of the external audit process the auditors were asked to articulate the steps that they have taken to ensure objectivity and independence including where the auditor provides non audit services the audit and risk committee monitors the auditors performance behaviour and effectiveness during the exercise of their duties which informs the decision to recommend reappointment on an annual basis the company generally does not utilise external auditors for internal audit purposes secondments or valuation advice services which are in the nature of audit such as tax compliance private letter rulings accounting advice and disclosure advice are normally permitted but all non audit services are required to be pre approved by the audit and risk committee the frc ethical standards require that the audit engagement leaders

in the decades since the soviet union collapsed america s wealth machine has been the wonder of the world our political and military dominance of the globe unprecedented but the social foundation for this prosperity and power has been beset by a growing crisis something has gone badly wrong in our domestic project yet our explainers and deciders for the most part are still at a loss to see just what this might be the dysfunction is vividly illustrated by overall trends for a particularly awful recent patch the years 2000 12 a time that spans the clinton dubya and obama presidencies over that 12 year period the country s population rose by roughly 30 million and private net worth soared by 28 trillion trillion with a t on average this meant over 300 000 in new wealth for every notional american family of four yet the number of people on means tested benefits jumped by 33 million during those same years and the increase in private sector jobs was just barely positive the net addition of less than one million such paid positions works out to fewer than 80 000 a year our new american economic reality the one currently impressed in the living memory of any man or woman under age 40 today is a system generating more wealth for the wealth holders but less work and more dependence for workers thus was the stage set for a populist storm the only wonder in retrospect was that it took until 2016 to break since 2016 dazed policy analysts from the better zip codes have been struggling to understand what has happened in the country they thought they knew and why the learning curve has been arduous and problematic not least because most of today s think tankers and academics are almost completely out of sympathy with the populist wave that upended their preferred blue and red presidential candidates in that electoral cycle to make matters even more confusing thanks to the famous bubble charles murray details in his book coming apart 2012 these same analysts tend to be separated from direct contact with the mysterious creatures also known as voters who brought politics as usual to an end in 2016 the best of this cadre however recognize that the grievances which brought a sort of populism to power in america were not imaginary and have been asking the right questions how and why has the u s socioeconomic system failed so many of its citizens what might be done to repair it two noteworthy books have advanced this effort isabel sawhill s the forgotten americans and oren cass s the once and future worker sawhill onetime clinton administration official and current brookings institution scholar is a center left economist highly regarded in washington circles for almost half a century cass a rising reform conservative star at the manhattan institute served as domestic policy guru in mitt romney s 2012 presidential campaign both sawhill and cass identify the collapse of work in modern america especially for men and in particular for men of prime working age without college degrees as the epicenter of the present american socioeconomic crisis both offer detailed carefully argued approaches for getting america back to work and more broadly for revitalizing our society and economy although the sawhill and cass assessments and prescriptions differ appreciably what may surprise is the number of points upon which the authors agree among them 1 the current over emphasis on gdp growth as an end in itself 2 the failure of postwar trickle down economics to lift all boats 3 the need to subsidize wages for low paying jobs and 4 the importance of immigration control including limits on the number of less skilled foreign workers entering the country at the same time sawhill and cass overlook some of the central problems inextricably linked to the collapse of work in modern america both their strengths and their weaknesses clarify the question of how and whether we can meet this challenge at the outset of the forgotten americans sawhill explains that my goal for this book is very simple to catalyze a new discussion about how to create a jobs based prosperity and a less divided nation in the decades ahead she outlines what she says is a case for returning to a system in which work is rewarded over welfare hand ups over handouts wages over windfall profits it is about improving the lives of those who are neither rich nor poor but somewhere in the middle and it is about policies linked to mainstream values such as family education and work for sawhill however this appears to be a second best agenda reflecting her judgment that it is the most the political market will currently bear drawing on public opinion and survey data she links the relative decline in u s working class fortunes to an array of sociopolitical attitudes and economic views she regards as benighted or worse most crucially in her view distrust of government and government programs as long as a majority of the population remains hostile to government she theorizes it will be difficult to move forward with a more enlightened set of policies by which she means more redistribution by a bigger government instead she has organized an agenda around three values might command broad support family education and work sawhill counts 63 million americans in the white working class which she defines as non hispanic white men and women aged 25 64 whose educations stopped short of a four year college degree nowadays fewer than three fifths of these working class whites are married nearly ten percentage points fewer than for elite whites as she calls those who have at least a bachelor s degree counterintuitively working class whites labor force participation levels are 11 points below those of elite whites and when working class whites are actually working elite whites earn 77 more than they do because of what sawhill calls a precipitous decline in the relative wages of the less educated pointing to the work of harvard university economist raj chetty she warns that fewer and fewer young americans are earning more than their parents did chetty s studies suggest 30 year olds are now as likely to make less than their parents did at the same age adjusted for inflation as to make more partly due to slower overall economic growth but mainly to growing differences in earnings and incomes but sawhill emphasizes that she has tailored an economic agenda for all forgotten americans not just disgruntled anglos by her broader definition which includes non college men and women of all ethnicities in families earning less than 70 000 a year forgotten americans comprise 38 of the working age population to her credit and unlike her team left colleagues who favor an unconditionally guaranteed universal basic income sawhill squarely frames the road to recovery for today s forgotten americans in terms of moral agency and personal responsibility a phrase she uses no fewer than nine times in this short volume she extols what she calls the success sequence if an individual does just three things graduates from high school at least works full time and marries before having children that person s chance of being poor plummets from about 14 to about 2 and the chance of being middle class rises to 70 what the country needs are policies that give people a fair chance to succeed in their roles as students as workers and as parents in the twenty first century economy consequently most of the book is devoted to outlining sawhill s schema for supporting family education and employment for the forgotten americans so far so good but the devil is always in the details and as non partisan readers examine the fine print in sawhill s proposals they may find it more difficult than expected to make common cause with this self professed radical centrist sawhill is at her most persuasive on education and training she insists we need to prepare people better for the jobs that exist and rightly faults america s elementary and secondary schools for failing to impart more knowledge and skills to more students she advocates a big new government initiative she calls a new g i bill for america s workers for upgrading educational opportunities not only for college aspirants but also for what used to be called vocational trainees the returns from such an effort she indicates could be high one particularly attention grabbing study suggests that simply matching canadian levels of student test scores would hike u s paychecks by as much as 20 the price tag for her plan is about 1 of gdp meaning for now roughly 200 billion a year though much of this outlay would cover the europe style active labor market policies she admires apprenticeship systems job placement programs etc rather than education and training per se sawhill has other big government ideas for boosting the availability of better paying jobs as well one is an independent investment bank for funding investments in infrastructure and basic research given the ways of washington however such an organization is more likely to end up looking like amtrak than rand she also wants to raise the minimum wage to 12 an hour expand tax credits for child care and develop a new work credit to raise the take home pay for men and women earning less than 40 000 a year she proposes funding some of the new spending envisioned here from an aggressive new round of estate taxes on the one percent untaxed intergenerational wealth transfer is anathema to sawhill who decries america s lax death tax policies in four of her book s ten chapters as conservatives rethink their approach to labor policies sawhill may find allies across the aisle who will concur with her concept of subsidizing low wage work including oren cass though he disdains the existing earned income tax credit the main tax credit for poorer workers as byzantine and unfriendly for its supposed beneficiaries sawhill s approach to family policy by contrast is a consensus killer while eschewing the woke identity politics that has poisoned the progressive wing of her party she seems unaware that her own position on the family is itself rigid ideological and polarizing the reveal comes early on with her explication of why strong stable families are desirable having two earners is one way to boost family income the possibility that such families might be better off for other reasons as well or better off even if one spouse decided to stay home with the kids instead of dropping them at government sponsored daycare on the commute to work each day does not merit mention the author is equally tone deaf in extolling responsible parenting and family formation which to her apparently involves large supplies of long acting forms of contraception she warns that without government cost coverage for the most effective forms of contraception we will have not just more poverty and less opportunity but also higher costs for medicaid population controllers wary of heedless breeders abroad sometimes used those same arguments for mobilizing foreign aid although they have learned to be circumspect about this it is even more disconcerting to hear the same dog whistle trained domestically on our own citizens so much for a less divided nation the dirigiste utilitarianism in sawhill s approach to poor families however applies equally to families of the well to do she wants american families to be strong just not too strong otherwise they might transmit unwarranted opportunities and benefits to their kin thus she gives a shout out to her brookings colleague richard reeves s case for eliminating tax benefits for college savings plans child care etc for upper middle class parents who are denounced as dream hoarders the author also inveighs repeatedly against intergenerational inheritance a practice inconsistent with basic american values to sawhill s bafflement and exasperation voters from all income groups still want parents to be able to bequeath a fortune to their kids if they somehow manage to accumulate one in effect her family policy seems to count on embedding in each american household an overbearing and somewhat out of touch relative by the name of uncle sam uncle insists on the final say over many questions bearing directly on family wellbeing but he is arbitrary and inconsistent and he plays favorites is it really any wonder that many families and a great many hard pressed families do not trust uncle s judgment yes we are back to that lack of trust thing again try as she will to comprehend their point of view sawhill concludes that america s disaffected white working class is just plain illogical in its aversion to more government there is little question in my mind the white working class is voting against their own self interest she writes she has learned from berkeley s professor arlie hochschild who studied cajuns closely that conservative politics has no rational basis it appears to be delusional and self defeating an emotional and irrational attachment to a set of conservative views driven by fox news a comforting tribal imperative reinforced by friends family and neighbors how could it be that poorly educated as they admittedly are these forgotten americans cannot see that the value added taxes and carbon taxes and all the rest of the redistributionist apparatus that sawhill and her allies would like to impose on them today are actually in their best interest here we might want to reflect on the saga of deaths of despair the opioid abetted rise in mortality for less educated middle aged anglos documented by princeton economists anne case and angus deaton in a landmark 2015 study case and deaton identified this grim trend as unfolding from 1999 to 2013 on clinton s dubya s and obama s watch subsequent data showed that death rates were higher in overwhelmingly anglo rural america in 2013 2015 than in 1999 2001 for all age groups between 15 and 54 and yet it took america over a decade and a half until 2015 to discover this public health tragedy do the thought experiment part from rednecks what other disadvantaged group in modern america could possibly suffer such a prolonged calamity without authorities even noticing much less responding the question answers itself it likewise explains why this great swath of america feels unprotected by the government industrial complex and why they are reluctant to entrust more resources and power to a distant washington cadre that thinks it has the answers to what really ails the hicks where sawhill approximates sympathy for the objects of her study oren cass evinces genuine empathy the once and future worker is an admirable work in many respects not least in cass s intellectual willingness to reexamine everything that libertarian ish republicans thought they knew about the world before that annus horribilis 2016 all of the principles or shibboleths of modern republican conservatism get a hard look in this book cass concludes that much is wanting in the reaganite prescription for prosperity for all laissez faire union free workplaces and more it is a tribute to his open mindedness if not always to his persuasiveness that cass even questions the propriety of free trade one can only wonder how candidate romney would have fared in the 2012 election if he had relied on cass s latest missive instead of mitt s famous binders the once and future worker implicitly holds that the old thinking failed america and failed to understand the needs of many americans outside the bubble cass considers himself a conservative but the vision he lays out would have been regarded as heretical by many american conservatives in the not too distant past his is a conservatism with much less confidence in the market s spontaneous order and much more reliant on government abetted social solidarity and social capital augmentation the resulting rethink is a decidedly post leave us alone agenda resembling instead the outlook of christian democratic parties in europe after world war ii cass posits what he terms the working hypothesis that a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy this seemingly modest contention actually puts him in opposition to america s longstanding bipartisan consensus prioritizing economic growth and consumption what cass mocks as economic piety with the right preferring the supply side variant and the left preferring to raise consumption through government redistribution cass explains that while our economic endowments of physical and intellectual capital are quite robust america s social endowments have proven themselves highly vulnerable to among other things consumption oriented policies neither economic growth nor economic redistribution will rescue america from its current predicament argues cass building higher upon a crumbling foundation is a mistake if historically he continues two parent homes could support themselves with only one parent working outside the home then something is wrong with growth that imposes a de facto need for two incomes rather than taxing low wage work to cut other taxes and expand entitlements we can do the reverse we can provide a subsidy for low wage work funded with higher taxes and reduced transfer payments america needs productive pluralism cass maintains meaning a work first social contract in which people of diverse abilities priorities and geographies pursuing varied life paths can form self sufficient families and become contributors to their communities the once and future worker outlines the path to that vision policy by policy cass wants much more education and training targeted at the non collegiate population the reintroduction of tracking in high school a clampdown on low skill migration to america a complete overhaul of social welfare policies to reaffirm the importance of working for all who can and a managed trade policy to help revive the manufacturing sector which he considers the wellspring of better paying jobs for less educated americans most significantly he calls for subsidizing work big time cass talks of a 3 an hour hike in wages for american workers a bonus directly added to each weekly paycheck through a sort of negative payroll tax although he does not specify all its details what he has in mind is clearly a pricey program he puts the cost of this initiative at 200 billion but my back of the envelope calculations suggest it could easily come in between two and four times that amount in his vision the new u s welfare state would be kinder and gentler with more subsidiarity and less centrally administered dependence but the government that cass envisions would almost certainly be even bigger than the one we support today and the unintended consequences of subsidizing cheap labor on a mass scale are worthy of a consideration which he does not provide unlike many policy tomes the once and future worker is a pleasure to read an extraordinary chapter castigates environmental policy that justifies itself by assigning enormous economic value to clear air and water while refusing to consider the effects of regulation on the level quality or trajectory of employment cass argues compellingly that the prospect of massive labor displacement due to artificial intelligence and machine learning is seriously overblown since an abstract description rarely captures the full complexity of any job it is probably still too soon to know whether this time really will be different but if the next round of technologically induced disruptions in the labor market proves to be of historically familiar magnitudes oren cass will have explained why in advance not all of his book however meets the exceptionally high standards of those two chapters his discussion of labor unions and the future of work for example gets oddly dreamy cass is under no communitarian illusions about modern america s unions which he considers woefully incompatible with the demands and opportunities of the modern economy and actively harmful to both workers and firms but then he imagines a post wagner act the new deal legislation that authorizes our present system of collective bargaining with organized labor in this business labor elysium management and workers will cooperate together creatively in co ops kind of like german mitbestimmung only better please in our real existing america the most likely place and time for such a high minded workplace revolution are nowhere and never in fairness cass s enterprise co op fantasy is essentially harmless since it is so utterly unlikely ever to take root in the u s not so his misguided notions about managing trade to revitalize employment and in particular to stimulate a new wave of manufacturing jobs these proposals could find political resonance in an increasingly populist america and some day might even be embraced as policy but the all too predictable impact of such protectionist ambitions would be a poorer america and one with less demand for work thrown into the bargain too the populist fixation with manufacturing jobs isn t hard to understand typically these have provided good pay and steady employment for americans with less formal education but manufacturing is a diminishing sector in the economy and manufacturing jobs are a diminishing share of the labor market beginning with the work of 1971 nobel laureate simon kuznets three generations of economic researchers have traced the structural transformation that accompanies modern economic development as societies the world over grow more prosperous their shares of output and employment in agriculture dwindle to negligible proportions sooner or later the same thing happens in the industrial sector this is supply and demand manufacturing productivity frees up labor for other pursuits while consumer choices limit the market for machinery all affluent societies are service economies there are no exceptions consequently the share of industry and industrial jobs continues to decline more or less everywhere according to the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd just under 10 of u s employment in 2017 was in manufacturing the corresponding figure in canada that year was 9 and 8 in the netherlands norway and australia none of those societies suffers from obvious under industrialization rich countries with abnormally large manufacturing sectors have distorted economies and pay for these distortions either by soaking their neighbors as germany does through the european union or by soaking their own population as japan has done with its generation of lost growth sawhill unlike cass a skeptic of industrial policy and managed trade insists the idea that we can bring back manufacturing jobs in large numbers is misguided and that looks like the right call cass plays the china card to justify a more interventionist trade policy probably the strongest card in his hand he bemoans the china shock the surge of cheap manufactures that shuttered u s plants after beijing s accession to the world trade organization wto mit s david autor and others have estimated that the china shock resulted in the loss of two million or more blue collar jobs in the early 2000s cass also points to china s theft of international intellectual property an ongoing crime spree costing the world hundreds of billions of dollars a year but china s industrial espionage is illegal right now we don t need a whole new managed trade policy to address it just an elected government with the courage to confront beijing about its criminal behavior there may even be a case for systematically excluding china from our international supply chains but this would be a one off special case national security argument not a precedent for washington s global micromanagement of trade and finance as for the china shock subsequent research by economists robert feenstra and akira sasahara suggests that the u s lost little if any net employment from the expansion of international trade between 1995 and 2011 including china s accession to the wto rather the disruption to manufacturing employment was more than offset by a surge in service the sector now accounting for a third of all u s exports why the fetish about manufacturing jobs on a mean hourly basis u s service sector jobs actually pay slightly better than manufacturing work some of cass s trade policy proposals such as increased scientific research win on their own merits and are only indirectly connected to trade but other impulses sound confused do we really want to restrict foreign investment in america especially when companies like nissan and volkswagen create the manufacturing jobs of which cass approves it may help sell other components of cass s overall vision if proponents can tell voters they are tough on trade more generally however the very best state directed trade policy for the u s economy and the american worker would be one that never gets off the drawing board the forgotten americans and the once and future worker each contain insights that might help washington cope more effectively with today s employment crisis the work rate for american men between the ages of 20 and 64 is no higher today than it was in depression stricken 1939 unfortunately and despite their differences sawhill cass and most of their colleagues in think tanks and universities share certain blind spots about the continuing jobs crisis but the flawed consensus about what is troubling the little people these days limits our national efforts to alleviate their woes the most critical blind spot is the presumption that our employment crisis is basically a demand side problem a failure of job creation and a shortage of work especially for those with lower educational attainments to be sure the failure to create more work is part of the problem but neither the entirety nor the crux of it the trouble with the demand side theory can be seen in the chart on this page since the end of the 2008 09 recession america has witnessed an economic expansion now entering its eleventh year and the ranks of the paid labor force are 20 million workers greater than at the post recession nadir yet the number of men of prime working age between 25 and 54 neither working nor looking for work has barely budged since 2011 hovering close to seven million a total higher today than in 2009 and this is not for lack of employment opportunities to the contrary the number of job openings in america has increased by five million since 2009 at the moment there are more unfilled positions in the u s economy than there are prime age men who have dropped out of the labor force who might fill them not all of these unfilled jobs by the way are for computer coders and chemical engineers millions are in retail restaurants hotels construction and transport and do not require applicants with college degrees america s overall unemployment rate today is lower than at any time since the 1960s and the official unemployment rate for prime age men is just 3 yet for every prime age man who is out of work and looking for a job there are four more who are neither working nor looking this is not a problem that can be solved by more keynesian stimulus a new industrial policy or other so called demand side tools many american working age men and women missing from the job market look to be lost in the disability opioid archipelago disconnected from family and community as well as the workplace barely half of native born prime age american men with no high school degree are in the job market at all by contrast labor force participation rates for their foreign born dropout counterparts are as robust as for native born college graduates to boost jobs and wages for america s distressed strata sawhill and cass both favor restricting the influx of immigrants with few skills and little education will keeping mexicans out of the labor force really get our lost men back in it at the margin probably a little but if our present employment crisis is in large part a supply side problem that is not enough men being willing and motivated to take a job and show up at it on time and sober such restrictions might slow the economy without helping american citizens back into the workforce a rich country can afford a measure of populist virtue signaling but should have no illusions about the consequences that will and won t follow from restricting immigration the mystifying difficulty of drawing millions of lost men back into the workforce is also partially explained by another huge social problem hiding in plain sight america s ex con explosion this is a second blind spot for sawhill and cass and for that matter for almost all those who write about getting america back to work since the u s government inexplicably neglects to estimate the size of our sentenced population even well informed americans are commonly unaware that the jailed and imprisoned population in our era of mass incarceration comprises a tiny fraction of all americans with a felony conviction in their backgrounds maybe only a tenth or less the rest by now likely well over 20 million adults to build on the path breaking demographic reconstructions of sarah shannon of the university of georgia and her colleagues are in society at large i e back in the civilian non institutional population that the bureau of labor statistics references for all its job market statistics these former convicts are overwhelmingly male currently something like one in eight adult men in the general u s population is an ex con the proportion is very likely higher for those of prime working age and on current trajectories the share of male ex cons of prime working age is set only to increase while we inexcusably lack any official employment data on this large and growing contingent of americans we can be sure that the ex cons are over represented in the pool of labor force dropout their employment prospects clouded by what economists call institutional barriers until our government inquires about their plight they will remain statistically invisible in a way that precludes evidence based policy finally there is america s strange and ominous long term stagnation in educational attainment although cass does flag this problem in passing neither he sawhill nor most others concerned with the employment crisis seem to appreciate just how dire it is and how troublesome are its implications research on international educational attainment by robert barro of harvard and jong wha lee of korea university shows that americans were the world s most highly educated population in terms of years of schooling from the 1870s until more or less yesterday by their reckoning however america has achieved only marginal gains in educational attainment for its working age population since the 1970s indeed according to u s census bureau data mean years of schooling for americans in their late twenties was barely three months higher in 2006 than for their parents 30 years earlier this is not because the united states reached some insurmountable asymptotic threshold in the 1960s by barro s and lee s estimates educational attainment for u s youth 15 24 years of age had dropped to seventh place by 2010 falling behind hong kong taiwan south korea and iceland furthermore by 2010 such countries as canada ireland japan and singapore likewise had overtaken america in the percentage of persons in their late twenties with college degrees particularly shocking is america s male fail in higher educational attainment census bureau figures document an eerie stall and slump in matriculation levels for american men in their late twenties whose college graduation rates in 1977 were higher than ten 20 or even 30 years later this dramatic prolonged and highly unnatural setback has occasioned remarkably little alarm or even comment and so far as i can tell no one as yet has seriously tried to explain its causes of course better elementary and secondary teaching is a pressing national need as is ramping up vocational training but there should be no doubt that america needs more and better trained college graduates america today is under colleged with more and better college and post collegiate training our nation would be richer our growth rates would be stronger more people would be at work and median worker incomes would be higher it is quite possible that income inequality in our society would be less pronounced as well most of the measured income gains since the 1970s have accrued to those with college degrees or better a substantially greater supply of highly trained workers might have moderated those striking returns to higher education until and unless we understand the reasons for america s stagnation and relative international decline in educational attainment and redress this abnormality progress against our ongoing employment crisis and its allied afflictions will be correspondingly limited the men disconnected from the workforce the vast and yet somehow invisible army of former convicts the new normal of unfathomably slow advances in educational attainment these are just some of the major problems hiding in plain sight though american power and plenty are at their zenith we are a deeply wounded land material poverty has been more or less banished but our country is awash with misery our policy analysts and public servants have been slow to comprehend this paradox even though it is fundamental and though the misery in our wounded nation is by no means entirely economic in nature there is a glaring financial component to it america is mightier and richer than ever before even as economic self reliance is on the wane and dependence is on the upswing the united states may be practically sloshing with money overall but fewer and fewer americans are managing to find their own personal path to prosperity figures from the federal reserve indicate that the real net worth of the least prosperous half of america is no higher today than it was 30 years ago at the fall of the berlin wall on a per household basis this fed reckoning suggests that the real net worth of america s poorer half is actually substantially lower today perhaps as much as a third lower than it was in late 1989 america may have won the cold war yet that great victory has not been accompanied by anything like a social triumph for our people a workable formula for prosperity for all is sorely needed in america coming up with such a formula one could argue is the urgent and overarching task facing our country today getting america back to work would surely be an important step on a road to prosperity for all but that is only the beginning of the journey

americans should be more concerned about the derivatives tsunami and the dollar bubble paul craig roberts the fiscal cliff is another hoax designed to shift the attention of policymakers the media and the attentive public if any from huge problems to small ones the fiscal cliff is automatic spending cuts and tax increases in order to reduce the deficit by an insignificant amount over 10 years if congress takes no action itself to cut spending and to raise taxes in other words going over the fiscal cliff is going to happen either way the problem from the standpoint of conventional economics with the fiscal cliff is that it amounts to a double barrel dose of austerity delivered to a faltering and recessionary economy ever since john maynard keynes most economists have understood that austerity is not the answer to recession or depression regardless the fiscal cliff is about small numbers compared to the derivatives tsunami or to bond market and dollar market bubbles the fiscal cliff requires that the federal government cut spending by 1 3t over 10 years the guardian reports that means the federal deficit has to be reduced about 109b per year or 3 of the current budget more simply just divide 1 3t by 10 and it comes to 130b per year this can be done by simply taking a three month vacation each year from washington s wars the derivatives tsunami and the bond and dollar bubbles are of a different magnitude in a june 5 2012 column titled collapse at hand i pointed out that according to the office of the comptroller of the currency s fourth quarter report for 2011 about 95 of the 230t in u s derivative exposure was held by four u s financial institutions jpmorgan chase bank bank of america citibank and goldman sachs prior to financial deregulation essentially the repeal of the glass steagall act and the non regulation of derivatives a joint achievement of the clinton administration and the republican party chase bank of america and citibank were commercial banks that took depositors deposits and made loans to businesses and consumers and purchased treasury bonds with any extra reserves with the repeal of glass steagall these honest commercial banks became gambling casinos like the investment bank goldman sachs betting not only their own money but also depositors money on uncovered bets on interest rates currency exchange rates mortgages and prices of commodities and equities these bets soon exceeded many times not only u s gross domestic product gdp but world gdp indeed the gambling bets of jpmorgan chase bank alone are equal to world gdp according to the q1 2012 report from the comptroller of the currency total derivative exposure of u s banks has fallen insignificantly from the previous quarter to 227t the exposure of the four u s banks accounts for almost all of the exposure and is many multiples of their assets or of their risk capital the derivatives tsunami is the result of the handful of fools and corrupt public officials who deregulated the u s financial system today merely four u s banks have derivative exposure equal to 3 3 times world gdp when i was a u s treasury official such a possibility would have been considered beyond science fiction hopefully much of the derivative exposure somehow nets out so that the net exposure while still larger than many countries gdps is not in the hundreds of trillions of dollars still the situation is so worrying to the federal reserve that after announcing a third round of quantitative easing qe 3 that is printing money to buy bonds both u s treasuries and the banks bad assets the fed has just announced that it is doubling its qe 3 purchases in other words the entire economic policy of the united states is dedicated to saving four banks that are too large to fail the banks are too large to fail only because deregulation permitted financial concentration as if the anti trust act did not exist the purpose of qe is to keep the prices of debt which supports the banks bets high the fed claims that the purpose of its massive monetization of debt is to help the economy with low interest rates and increased home sales but the fed s policy is hurting the economy by depriving savers especially the retired of interest income forcing them to draw down their savings real interest rates paid on cds money market funds and bonds are lower than the rate of inflation moreover the money that the fed is creating in order to bail out the four banks is making holders of dollars both at home and abroad nervous if investors desert the dollar and its exchange value falls the price of the financial instruments that the fed s purchases are supporting will also fall and interest rates will rise the only way the fed could support the dollar would be to raise interest rates in that event bondholders would be wiped out and the interest charges on the government s debt would explode with such a catastrophe following the previous stock and real estate collapses the remnants of people s wealth would be wiped out investors have been deserting equities for safe u s treasuries this is why the fed can keep bond prices so high that the real interest rate is negative the hyped threat of the fiscal cliff is immaterial compared to the threat of the derivatives overhang and the threat to the u s dollar and bond market of the fed s commitment to save four u s banks once again the media and its master the u s government hide the real issues behind a fake one the fiscal cliff has become the way for the republicans to save the country from bankruptcy by destroying the social safety net put in place during the 1930s supplemented by lyndon johnson s great society in the mid 1960s now that there are no jobs now that real family incomes have been stagnant or declining for decades and now that wealth and income have been concentrated in few hands is the time republicans say to destroy the social safety net so that we don t fall over the fiscal cliff in human history such a policy usually produces revolt and revolution which is what the u s so desperately needs perhaps our stupid and corrupt policymakers are doing us a favor after all paul craig roberts is a former assistant undersecretary of the u s treasury and former associate editor of the wall street journal he is the author of many books including the tyranny of good intentions alienation and the soviet economy how the economy was lost and others maybe d c should have jumped off the cliff by keith johnson for months we ve been told that the world was coming to an end no i m not talking about the expiration of the mayan calendar i m referring to the much hyped fiscal cliff and the economic catastrophe that was said to take effect after january 1 2013 we were led to believe that unless our politicians took the appropriate action we d be faced with massive spending cuts and tax increases that would plunge the u s into a recession plagued year of high unemployment and a dramatic drop in the inflation adjusted gross domestic product but now that all the brouhaha has subsided in the wake of a bi partisan deal that was recently approved in the house i m left wondering if we might have been better off if the world had come to an end at least an end to the world envisioned by washington d c and their clients on wall street the rich still made out like bandits multinational firms are no longer required to pay taxes on all revenue generated on foreign soil meaning that you can now expect more jobs to be shipped overseas then there s goldman sachs and bank of america which both get tax exempt financing to build luxury apartments and office towers in manhattan and let s not forget the hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies for america s bread and circus industries hollywood producers motor speedway owners and rum manufacturers to name a few of course america s war machine is still expected to remain intact the harshest scenario for defense cuts would only put budgets back about the 2007 level and they aren t even really cuts to defense spending they are reductions in the rate of growth of defense spending says foreign policy analyst john glaser either way the budget for military empire and wars will grow the ones hardest hit by the new deal are the nearly 80 of working class americans who will see their tax rates increase from 4 2 to 6 2 due to an expiration of the so called payroll tax holiday this is an increase of about 50 retirees and the disabled are expected to be the next on the chopping block when a temporary measure to fund government activity expires on march 27 social safety net programs that american s have paid into for years will once again be held to scrutiny according to ap republicans say they are willing to raise the debt ceiling but insist any increase must be paired with significant savings from medicare medicaid and other government benefit programs likewise president obama has also signaled a willingness to target these programs i am very open to compromise he said after the passage of the house vote on january 2 medicare is the biggest contribution to the deficit the worst of the fiscal cliff is only a few months down the road but maybe there s a silver lining if we just went ahead and took the plunge after all it was only after americans were led to believe that their wallets would be drained at the stroke of midnight that they woke up and took notice perhaps real economic hardship is what it will take to wake them up again frankly i would rather suffer now than kick the can down the road and let future generations pay for the bitter fruits of our complacency keith johnson in an investigative journalist and host of the revolt of the plebs radio program
the us dollar remains at a critical juncture as fed policy will be on hold for the foreseeable future and as we start to see an economic rebound come out of europe the world s largest and strongest economy is likely to start to see economic growth slow in the fourth quarter further cementing the belief that the fed will have no changes in policy for the foreseeable future with europe starting to have some major macro events fall into place for them we could see the dollar react more to rebounding european data than to sluggish numbers from the us the overall tone with risk appetite will focus on both the aftermaths of the uk general election and the details with the phase one deal agreement between the us and china the focus will also fall onto the whether we see an improvement in china s november activity data and a plethora of rate decisions the boj and boe are widely to keep policy unchanged but we could see sweden s riksbank tighten policy while mexico s banxico cuts rates gbp whatever you think of the uk election result it s clear that this result partially lifts the cloud of uncertainty that s held back the currency and the economy for so long as the old adage goes the markets hate uncertainty as we know they re not too fond of brexit either but that s a discussion for another day for now no deal brexits have vanquished the upcoming boe meeting will be governor carney s last meeting and to be honest more attention will probably be paid on who boris johnson picks to be the next governor it will be interesting to see how much reference the policy statement provides regarding the election outcome eur the december flash pmi surveys and german ifo business confidence report could have serious impact on whether we see eur usd breakout higher if the bottom is in place for economic growth in the region we should see continue to see services remain resilient and upticks with the manufacturing readings oil from a macro economic perspective oil prices could rip higher after both trade and brexit uncertainty have been alleviated in the short term oil could still rally another 5 here despite oversupply concerns for the first half of 2020 because investors

remarkable that gold is higher after a phase one trade deal seems imminent brexit no deal risks have been wiped out and we are in the midst of a massive global stock market rally gold could see further momentum after the euphoria of this risk on move is faded investors will still have appetite for safe havens as we enter a very lengthy brexit transition phase and are not anywhere close to

basis points the rate cut is already priced in but in the last meeting two out of the five members voted for a 50 basis points cut economic data has been disappointing and although under less pressure if trade news is to be believed the mexican economy is struggling to get out of the technical recession it fell into earlier this year country hong kong protests have kicked off again with record numbers turning out last weekend they were reportedly peaceful and this was the first demonstration that had been officially sanctioned warnings about a self imploding economy seem to be falling on deaf ears and tuesday s unemployment rate could turn nasty as always there is the risk that protests turn violent again which would be negative for the hk33 index usd hkd is still in the upper half of the trading band china we re still waiting for an announcement regarding the phase 1 trade deal between the us and china both sides remain in constant daily contact reportedly and are always close to a deal china s export numbers released last weekend were dismal and may jolt china toward a faster deal recent talk is that the december 15 imposition of more tariffs by the us will be either postponed or suspended on monday we see china s industrial production and retail sales data ip has been surprisingly robust but the weak exports data might suggest the downside is vulnerable india indian equities have been sliding since the rbi failed to cut its benchmark rate last week there are no major data points to impact markets next week australia the next major focus for australia will be thursday s release of the november jobs report given that the rba has said it will be a major data point to influence monetary policy a weak number will push the rba toward a more dovish stance new zealand the nz economy appears to be steadily plodding along q3 growth data are due on thursday and expectations are for 2 0 y y after 2 1 in q2 a rebound in dairy prices has helped the kiwi but a weaker gdp print will be bearish for the local dollar latam politics latin american leaders might be breathing a sigh of relief at a us china tariff truce as the prolonged trade war took its toll in emerging markets which in turn heightened wealth inequality making social protests a common occurrence in the region the protests in santiago are ongoing and have taken the peso to record lows central bank and government intervention reduced the fall of the currency but it is only now with trade optimism that a recovery can begin the biggest risk is another disappointment when the two sides appear close to a deal this would not be the first time this has happened the urgency of the situation and the high political states for donald trump ahead of an election year could pave the way for a deal that if struck would boost risk appetite uk politics now that boris johnson has massive majority markets will look to see how hard of a brexit will he pursue brexit risks remain as we still could see eu trade talks completely fall apart a tremendous amount of nationalization risk has been lifted but now the clock begins for johnson to get all of their trading relationship agreements done next year business want certainty over the transition period and until we get that we could see limited rallies in sentiment and investment us politics now that the house judiciary committee is moving forward with two articles of impeachment against president trump we will see this get voted through in the house but ultimately this will not get voted through the republican held senate impeachment risks are still minimal for the president and his odds for re election are higher than ever key economic releases and events sunday december 15th 5 00 pm aud dec flash manufacturing pmi no est v 49 9 prior 7 30

by gary christenson bubbles like a cocaine high are fun while they last history confirms that bubbles and cocaine are enjoyable because central banks blow many bubbles and the u s imports a large quantity of cocaine bubbles are fun but they extract a price there is no free lunch examples 2019 the everything bubble it hasn t crashed yet but there are many bubble piercing objects on the horizon prepare for the implosion it s coming 2008 the housing bubble real estate mortgages collateralized debt and other derivatives nearly crashed the global financial system the official story claims emergency central banking measures saved it but 8 7 million americans lost their jobs bankers foreclosed on 10 million american homes and the doj prosecuted no bankers for fraud congress and the fed saved wall street banks and bonuses the fed showered 16 trillion per the limited audit in secret bailouts loans swaps and giveaways onto wall street and foreign banks another report wall street on parade claims the total was 29 trillion regardless a huge bailout worked once so we could see a larger bailout when the everything bubble crashes debt leverage is larger than in 2008 and more sectors of the economy are dangerously inflated the debt and credit monsters have grown 2000 internet stocks bubble the high flying nasdaq 100 soared from under 400 in 1994 to over 4 800 in 2000 then it collapsed more than 80 how many retirements and portfolios were devastated by investors arriving late to the casino most people failed to exit before the crash blowing bubbles is profitable for wall street and the stock market which is primarily owned by the upper few percent of the financial and political elite the lower 90 have benefited little wages are higher but the cost of living has increased even more flawed understated government inflation statistics show the average wage earner lost ground in the last several decades real statistics would show larger losses however wealth increased for the upper 1 blowing bubbles is fun for the participants and profitable for a few until the bubble crashes from wall street on parade wall street on parade is not buying the narrative that the 3 trillion that the new york fed has pumped out to the trading houses on wall street since september 17 is part of routine open market operations that the fed is legally allowed to do the united states should have allowed banks to fail in 2008 perhaps the u s should allow banks to fail in 2019 instead of creating 3 trillion or 30 trillion qe plus not qe and devaluing existing dollars so what bail out several banks print 10 or 50 trillion so what consider moral hazard wall street takes risks increases profits boosts bonuses and lets the taxpayers suffer if the bets in the wall street casino go bad more debt history shows that excessive debt leads to disaster it will not be different this time more dollars in circulation push consumer prices higher larger bubbles the 2008 bubble was larger and more destructive than the 2000 bubble expect the 2020 2024 bubble implosion to create more damage than the 2008 crash poor and middle class americans are hurt worse than the political and financial elite imploding bubbles diminished savings lost jobs and foreclosed homes devastate many fudged statistics and payoffs to wall street reduce trust in government privatize profits but socialize losses wall street might have said let the taxpayers pay for wall street bonuses and failed gambles from alasdair macleod with annual debt payments already accounting for most of the us budget deficit and that deficit getting larger any rise in dollar interest rates would be ruinous for federal government finances eurozone governments are in a similarly precarious financial position governments are ensnared in a classic debt trap a credit excess inflates bubbles debt increases the leverage makes a few wealthy and crushes many the assets disappear but debt remains someone pays interest on the debt the bubble seldom increases productivity or real wealth a good example of a current bubble is sovereign debt why loan currency units to a government that must borrow to repay past debt plus interest they roll over the original debt and never extinguish it this nonsense can t continue forever so many will suffer when the defaults occur speculation and front running partially explain the craziness from alasdair macleod an estimated 17 trillion of global bonds are negative yielding which is unprecedented this is a market distortion so extreme that it cannot be normalized without widespread financial disruption and debtor destruction there is no exit from this condition repeat there is no exit from this condition from sven henrich tweet we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us central banks are the enablers of the largest debt expansion in human history and insist on perpetuating what jay powell has called an unsustainable path from mish talk 250 trillion in global debt how can that be paid back the answer is of course it won t be paid back and since every debt is someone else s asset you can imagine what that ultimately means a great many people are a lot less wealthy than they think it is all phantom wealth that can disappear in an eyeblink repeat it is all phantom wealth that can disappear in an eyeblink that explains the fed s need to create trillions in printed currency units they must delay imploding the bubble you can run but you can t hide you can delay the inevitable but you can t prevent it bubbles will implode from martin armstrong custodial risk in new york city suffice to say that the negative yielding bonds are going to crash like something not witnessed since 1931 while a complete default is not likely prior to 2025 2026 we are going to witness the start of the collapse in 2020 the plan is inflate or die then speculating extend and pretend for another eleven months drop interest rates to near zero reelect president trump and let stocks and sovereign debt implode after the 2020 election fiat currencies will crash in purchasing power and congress will seek someone to blame as a distraction suggestions for blame china russia the other political party high frequency trading the latest war european banks impeachment proceedings climate change not on the blame list but should be the fed congress excessive spending the administration keynesian economic nonsense from daniel lacalle the next wave of debt monetization will also be a disaster if this monetary experiment has proven anything it is that lower rates and higher liquidity are not tools to help deleverage but to incentivize debt from christoph gisiger when it comes to science and technology man learns but when it comes to love war and finance he makes the same mistakes over and over again at the end of the day central banks are not all powerful they are not immune to the laws of economics my thesis is that when this bubble bursts gold should rally while bonds and stocks should crash a thought experiment in round numbers global debt has expanded by 82 trillion from 173 trillion to 255 trillion in the past 11 years in that time global gold reserves have increased by 30 000 to 35 000 tons or by about one billion ounces if that new debt had been backed by gold it would have required a gold price of 80 000 the price of gold is about 1 500 less than 2 of what would be necessary to back the global debt increase since 2008 the world has a global debt problem this suggests the banking cartel created too much debt a bubble and the price of gold is too low in our debt driven economy the crash of the everything bubble will reset stock and bond prices lower and gold prices higher perhaps to 5 000 to 10 000 during the next decade a western central banker might see it differently gold is useless and no amount of debt is excessive time will show this viewpoint is nonsense from bob moriarty on the daily sentiment index as of november 18th sentiment for the s p futures and the nasdaq index is approaching nosebleed territory the dsi at 90 for the s p and 91 for the nasdaq index suggests a top is coming soon not today but soon conclusions global debt exceeds 250 trillion much of it will not be repaid bubbles are fun while they last but they always implode and leave many in tears inflate or die the reset will be near when the mainstream media screams accusations at obvious scapegoats sentiment suggests a stock market top is close watch out below negative interest rates are a central bank created trap black hole expect massive losses in sovereign bonds someday soon gold prices compared to new debt since the 2008 crash are far too low expect a significant price rise in 2020 2024 as financial conditions deteriorate call miles franklin at 1 800 822 8080 to convert digital dollars to real money gold and silver bars and coins gary christenson the deviant

christmas came early friday as equities and the pound surged on reports china and the us had reached a trade agreement while british prime minister boris johnson won a landslide victory that will allow him to push through brexit investors flocked back into stocks around the world on news that donald trump had signed off on a long awaited pact between the world s economic superpowers that will see the cancellation of fresh us tariffs due at the weekend and the rolling back of previous measures after months of high level talks negotiators presented the president with a deal that will see china ramp up its purchases of agricultural goods bloomberg news reported the mood was already buoyant after trump said an agreement was close on the first part of a wider pact getting very close to a big deal with china they want it and so do we trump tweeted earlier in the day which helped fuel a rally on wall street that saw the s p 500 and nasdaq hit new records while the pact has yet to be finalised the news will come as a massive relief to investors after weeks of toing and froing with both sides offering sometimes positive sometimes downbeat comments on the talks progress trade tensions between the world s biggest economies have been a huge drag on global growth with most countries being sucked into the stand off sending some into or close to recession does it mean we get a comprehensive deal in 2020 hard to say but it this has created the necessary christmas cheer for a decent santa rally said neil wilson at markets com the trade headlines came as johnson s ruling conservative party won a huge majority in a crucial general election he now has sufficient power to finally drive his eu brexit deal through parliament the stuttering passage of which has caused years of uncertainty in britain commentators also suggested that his large majority meant johnson was not beholden to the extreme anti eu members of his party and would give him the ability to push for a softer brexit which would be better for the economy eu council president charles michel said the bloc was ready to hold trade talks with britain the election news sent the pound briefly soaring to as much as 1 3514 its highest since mid 2018 from 1 3163 before the poll was released it also rallied to 82 80 pence per euro a level not seen since just after the brexit referendum in 2016 the market is getting two christmas presents early said tai hui at jp morgan asset management the one two of positive news for markets sent equities surging in asia and europe tokyo and hong kong each soared 2 6 percent shanghai clocked up 1 8 percent seoul surged 1 5 percent and sydney rose 0 5 percent there were also big gains in mumbai singapore taipei manila and jakarta london rallied one percent while paris and frankfurt both surged by even more the soothing of tensions and removal of some uncertainty helped higher yielding riskier currencies rally the chinese yuan jumped one percent against the dollar while the south korean won and south african rand were both 1 5 percent higher australia s dollar the indonesian rupiah mexican peso and russian ruble also saw big advances as investors grew in confidence the global recovery fear of missing out trade of the last two months got a turbo charged boost naturally said oanda s jeffrey halley stock markets leapt to record highs on wall street emerging market and china centric currencies have surged as has oil in fact you could have bought almost anything in the last eight hours and it would be higher now however while the mood heading into christmas is of optimism hui pointed out there was still a long way to go on both issues the uk government will need to finalise the details on brexit and start a marathon of trade negotiation with the eu he said this is expected to be complicated and time consuming while new uncertainties could emerge for the business sector and on the china us trade deal our view has always been that the two sides would agree on phase one but these represent some of the lowest hanging fruits in the negotiation the future stages of negotiation is going to be much more challenging when it starts to involve china s industrial policy and technological development he added london ftse 100 up 1 0 percent at 7 343 40 tokyo nikkei 225 up 2 6 percent at 24 023 10 close hong kong hang seng 2 6 percent at 27 687 76 close shanghai composite up 1 8 percent at 2 967 68 close pound dollar down at 1 3450 from 1 3470 at 2200 gmt euro pound up at 83 14 pence from 82 87 pence euro dollar down at 1 1166 from 1 1177 dollar yen up at 109 62 yen from 109 30 yen west texas intermediate up 34 cents at 59 52 per barrel brent north sea crude up 46 cents at 64 66 per barrel new york dow up 0 8 percent at 28 132 05 close copyright afp all rights reserved
london stocks and the british pound jumped friday after an election triumph for conservative prime minister boris johnson that analysts said will bring clarity to brexit proceedings and unlock stronger economic growth other european stock markets although lagging buoyant london which rose over two percent at one point also powered ahead supported by confirmation of a partial trade deal between the united states and china however wall street s rally petered out with american equities finishing little changed on the day both beijing and washington finally said they were on the same page stocks had rallied thursday in anticipation of the trade deal with china but then declined when the pact was announced you got a pretty good example of buy the rumors and sell the news art hogan of national holdings told afp referencing the saying indicating equities rise more in anticipation of an event than after the event itself but it s certainly great news on brexit and us china trade war trade economists cheered the fact the deal pulled back from the brink but did not see much progress after many months of pain for american businesses and farmers president donald trump has canceled tariffs that had been due to hit 160 billion in chinese goods as of sunday and agreed to reduce some tariffs already in place china also committed to purchases of us manufactured merchandise energy goods and farm exports us officials said adding that the text of the agreement should be signed in early january in britain prime minister johnson will now push ahead with britain s scheduled exit from the european union on january 31 as he seeks to dispel three years of uncertainty and political deadlock with a post brexit probably expansionary budget planned in march the uk general election has provided a clearer path towards a resolution to brexit and looser fiscal policy which should boost economic activity and push up sterling uk equities and gilt yields said hubert de barochez an economist with capital economics but he warned that as long as there remains the possibility of something like a no deal those gains ought to be limited european leaders also welcomed what appeared to be an end to brexit paralysis but warned britain against becoming unfair competitor the sheer scale of thursday s victory the biggest conservative majority since margaret thatcher s heyday in the 1980s sent the pound soaring to an 18 month dollar peak and to highs against the euro not seen since the june 2016 brexit referendum the pound held at elevated levels on friday but pulled back somewhat from the multi month peaks forged overnight the broader ftse 250 index which is more weighted with domestic companies than the ftse 100 which is dominated by multinationals surged to a record high investors expressed relief that johnson roundly defeated main opposition leader jeremy corbyn s labour party which had vowed to re nationalize formerly state owned companies new york dow flat at 28 135 38 close new york s p 500 flat at 3 168 80 close new york nasdaq up 0 2 percent at 8 734 88 close london ftse 100 up 1 1 percent at 7 353 44 points close frankfurt dax 30 up 0 5 percent at 13 282 72 close paris cac 40 up 0 6 percent at 5 919 02 close euro stoxx 50 up 1 1 percent at 3 731 07 close pound dollar up at 1 3336 from 1 3161 at 2200 gmt euro pound down at 83 37 pence from 84 57 pence euro dollar up at 1 1117 from 1 1130 dollar yen up at 109 35 yen from 109 31 yen tokyo nikkei 225 up 2 6 percent at 24 023 10 close hong kong hang seng 2 6 percent at 27 687 76 close shanghai composite up 1 8 percent at 2 967 68 close brent north sea crude up 1 6 percent at 65 22 per barrel west texas intermediate up 1 5 percent at 60 07
by christopher cleverly ceo of kamari a barrister by profession chris has made it his mission to help bring development mechanisms to africa which can empower africans to seize their own destiny his journey on this mission began during the 1990s when he attended king s law college and became a barrister after graduating he founded the trafalgar chambers in the u k and became the youngest head of chambers in over a century in 2005 he founded the made in africa foundation an organization he has guided to fulfill his dream of bringing systemic infrastructure change to africa today he is ceo of kamari a blockchain project looking to build an ecosystem of mobile gaming and payments for one billion people across africa astronomical hyper inflation is an unenviable economic outcome that has plagued a number of countries in recent years notably zimbabwe south africa and venezuela but it s not only fears of ever creeping inflation that fertilize the imagination of tech savvy free thinkers in such nations a group that is collectively driving increased demand for alternative blockchain based solutions the devastation that hyper inflation causes with citizens frantically attempting to preserve whatever value they can in the face of straitened economic circumstances illustrated by the trope of a shopping cart brimming with banknotes being wheeled down a dusty street is painful to watch much less experience naturally heads turn towards sounder monetary alternatives during such episodes with cryptocurrency proponents positioning blockchain as the solution to inflation across africa the flight from fiat the tangible benefits of adopting deflationary cryptocurrencies particularly for african economies laboring under high inflation and indeed other nations languishing on bloomberg s misery index are manifold the ease with which blockchain based monetary systems enhance commerce has been demonstrated beyond the african continent and within its borders south africa for example has permitted digital currency based payments trades and investments making a significant contribution to the global boom the ability of south africans to avail themselves of local exchanges and trade fiat currency for bitcoin or other crypto assets at the present market rate contrasts sharply with the misfortunes of citizens in countries like nigeria zimbabwe and kenya whose governments have taken a dim view of crypto assets this is nothing short of a travesty because bitcoin offers a great deal of promise for such countries consider risk for example because bitcoin is transparent immutable and entirely unlike any other financial asset information on its public ledger cannot be distorted deleted or destroyed it is the very antithesis of fiat currencies that despotic leaders are prone to debasing at will through wanton printing and with developing markets including africa tipped to represent half of all non cash transactions worldwide by 2021 in the process overtaking mature markets for the first time it seems like the time is right for blockchain to get a fair crack of the whip a decade in the making in the recent past bitcoin has proven entirely capable of outperforming other assets as both an investment vehicle and a store of value as well as furnishing citizens with a means to transfer funds into and out of their country as was the case during the greek bank shut down in mid 2015 liquidity crises stock market disruption asset fire sales political upheaval structural currency devaluations cryptocurrency has ridden many waves and survived a decade of adversarial testing while gradually accruing trust among initially skeptical parties of particular interest to african citizens is the fact that cryptocurrency can be securely stored managed and accessed from anywhere in the world moreover non cash transactions of this nature provide measurable benefits to society specifically by tackling the persistent scourge of corruption imagine the benefits to be derived from replacing a hidebound system wherein the ability to create and regulate money is the self appointed right of central banks oftentimes blockchain technology is described as a natural response to decades of underhand and unjust financial management you could scarcely conceive of a better use case than in africa this is borne out by new research by digital assets data which indicates the usage of bitcoin as a store of value and fiat alternative in high inflation countries indeed bitcoin trading volume appears to rise in countries blighted by high inflation and unstable banks even as the bitcoin price falls the precipitous december 2017 december 2018 price drop saw trade volume in low inflation countries drop by some 70 while for high inflation nations it actually rose by 60 blockchain a single invention with a myriad number of applications another notable advantage of greater blockchain adoption in africa is increased competition brought about by the proliferation of digital currencies this competition will not only serve to stimulate the currency market and the financial market more generally but also put more power into the hands of consumers and everyday citizens in this scenario traditional banks seeking to maintain their status or simply remain a going concern must countenance the idea of better serving the consumer via a process of innovation and progressive reform naturally the decentralized nature of fixed supply cryptocurrencies is incredibly appealing in an inflation blighted african context due to a combination of familiar political instability corruption disastrous central bank policies and procedural bottlenecks that circumscribe traditional financial services of course there are prevailing headwinds that threaten peer to peer digital currencies such as bitcoin regardless of the burgeoning interest from the populace the pushback comes from power brokers of the global financial system namely governments central banks and regulators none of whom are keen to break up the age old currency issuing monopoly but the simple truth is that blockchain technology offers the possibility perhaps the best most realistic one of a brighter future for african nations crippled by hyperinflation a recent speech by bank of england governor mark carney alluded to the potential of digital currency to disrupt the dominance of the us dollar noting that the stockpiling of dollars has become a major barrier to global trade such an outcome could prevent africa suffering from being pegged in terms of imports and exports in us dollars and the euro via the cfa although any nascent digital currency must take account of african internal commerce and intra continental trade to avoid the aforementioned eye watering inflation the great thing about blockchain is that it permits the unpegging of currencies to each other as well as the creation of new digital value stores underpinned by global baskets of underlying currencies such local digital currencies rely on local values and transactions thereby immunizing national economies from swings elsewhere as noted by carney reducing the influence of the us on the global financial cycle would help reduce the volatility of capital flows to emerging market economies perhaps when he said this carney did not envisage the launch of the digital yuan as a way of protecting china s foreign exchange sovereignty so soon after the digital yuan has the potential when combined with china s far reaching belt and road economic expansion and investment program to bypass and dominate the dollar when future historians review the strange death of the american empire they may well lament the moment that the federal reserve killed off facebook s libra instead of recognizing that it was their only defense against the digital yuan however many commentators believe that there will be no one coin to rule them all but rather a proliferation of tokens and blockchains interoperable and satisfying different needs blockchains can be used to simplify the need for national fiats but can also consider the complexity of local economies it s all in the design perhaps this is why 15 cryptocurrency related operations have been initiated in africa in the past year alone many of the citizens of african countries have lost confidence in the traditional banking system and eagerly await a day when financial freedom and security become a basic human right rather than a luxury for the elite there is still significant work to be done in ensuring that blockchain technology realizes its full potential in africa as a medium of exchange store of value and means of remittance as economic crises intensify and national currencies further falter however the case for crypto

the dollar s ascendency gives the us administration an unrivalled ability to exercise coercion by imposing economic sanctions chinese and european aspirations to weaken the dominance of the us dollar as the global currency of choice have come to naught with the latest global survey showing the greenback is on one side of 88 of all foreign currency transactions an 18 year high the dollar s ascendency gives the us administration an unrivalled ability to exercise coercion by imposing economic sanctions a new report by the united states studies centre s stephen kirchner argues that the dominant role of the us dollar reflects the depth of us capital markets and the strength of us institutions and is likely to be long lasting however the paper warns that excessive use of economic sanctions will lead affected nations to develop workarounds the triennial survey of foreign exchange turnover conducted by the bank for international settlements showed the us dollar s share had dropped to 84 9 at the beginning of the decade but has since gained ground at the expense of both the euro and the yen the euro was on one side of 32 3 of foreign exchange transactions this year down from 39 0 in the 2010 survey while the share of the yen dropped from 19 0 to 16 8 only 4 3 of global foreign exchange deals involve china s renminbi significantly less than the 6 8 using the australian dollar the foreign exchange market which turns over us 6 6 trillion a day is only one dimension of the us dollar s dominance it also accounts for 63 of outstanding debt securities compared with 20 for the euro and 40 of cross border financial transactions the us dollar is used as the currency for invoicing more than three times as many global exports as america itself ships about 70 of nations peg their own currencies in some way to the us dollar it is also the currency of choice for the world s central banks which use it for 62 of their foreign exchange reserves although kirchner argues that this status as a reserve currency has little impact on the dollar s ubiquitous use in global commerce rather it s a reflection of the depth and liquidity of us capital markets and their supporting economic and political institutions when the euro was launched in 1999 many economists expected it to rival or even supplant the us dollar the former head of international economics at the us treasury fred bergsten expected the euro would match the us dollar within five to 10 years china s central bank has been pursuing a strategy to internationalise the renminbi since 2006 when it argued it would enhance china s international status and bring a rise in power standing the international monetary fund included the renminbi in the basket of currencies used to determine the value of its special drawing rights in 2016 however kirchner argues that both the euro zone and china show that size alone will not deliver international status to a currency only well developed capital markets backed by sound political institutions relatively sound monetary and fiscal policy property rights and the rule of law can provide the underpinnings for a currency that is widely demanded outside its own borders he says oth the euro zone and china are beset by chronically weak political and economic institutions that are also resistant to reform the prospect that either the euro or rmb significantly displace the dollar in the global economy in the medium term is close to zero he says the euro has been a source of economic weakness rather than strength for its member economies by limiting the scope for exchange rate adjustment to absorb economic shocks euro denominated assets are not seen by global investors as a safe haven in times of trouble because the monetary union is not backed by any common budget strategy or banking union between 2012 and 2019 the euro s share of global payments dived from 44 to 34 while the european central bank s own measure of its international role shows it has been in decline since 2006 and is virtually no greater now than it was at its birth 20 years ago the indispensability of the us dollar in global transactions gives washington a powerful lever us economic sanctions can prevent companies and individuals from accessing the us payments system to settle us dollar transactions non us banks rely on their relationships with us banks and their access to us regulated dollar payments system infrastructure to effect international transactions on behalf of their clients the report says russia iran venezuela and north korea have been the subject of sanctions whose enforcement is made effective largely by the role of the us dollar in the global economy however the economic aggression is bringing some pushback for example europe is moving to price its oil imports in euros to facilitate continued purchases from russia with iran a special vehicle has been established so that european importers and exporters match their transactions on the european side of the border while their iranian counterparties do the same with their rials on their side if the us government were to abuse the role of the dollar as an instrument of international economic coercion it might further foster the development of alternative non us dollar based payments mechanisms the report says david uren is an honorary associate at the united states studies centre at the university of sydney this article first appeared at the australian strategic policy institute image reuters

resulting in ownership of approximately 50 2 to 50 6 of the votes of pcc pro forma the completion of the reorganization management announcements after 23 years as co chief executive officers of pcc paul desmarais jr and andré desmarais have decided to retire from their roles they will continue to play an active role in the governance of pcc and maintain their positions as chairman and deputy chairman respectively of pcc s board of directors they were appointed to their roles in 1996 and have overseen a period of dramatic growth and value creation for pcc pfc and the companies in the group since their appointment the annualized total return to shareholders including dividends and capital appreciation has been 11 7 and 13 1 for each of pcc and pfc respectively compared to 7 7 for the s p tsx composite index the board of directors of pcc has indicated that it will appoint r jeffrey orr current president and chief executive officer of pfc as president and chief executive officer of pcc upon completion of the reorganization jeff has been instrumental in building and strengthening pfc s businesses for almost two decades and we look forward to continuing to work with him to execute our shared vision of creating shareholder value in the financial services industry said paul desmarais jr pcc chairman and co ceo the reorganization is a natural step that reflects our evolution from a diversified holding company into one that is primarily focused on financial services said andré desmarais pcc deputy chairman and co ceo simplifying our corporate structure will make it easier to understand and value pcc appropriately said r jeffrey orr pfc president and ceo at the same time the more targeted strategy will allow us to better focus our investments and our efforts to create and return value to shareholders i am excited to be a part of this new chapter of pcc s storied history pfc board of directors and special committee the pfc board formed a special committee of directors the special committee comprised of susan j mcarthur marc a bibeau and siim a vanaselja to review and consider the reorganization the terms of which were negotiated at arm s length with pcc the pfc board unanimously approved the reorganization following the report and favourable recommendation of the special committee and has agreed to unanimously recommend that pfc minority shareholders vote in favour of the reorganization rbc capital markets rbc has provided its opinion the fairness opinion to the special committee that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications contained therein the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization is fair from a financial point of view to the pfc minority shareholders rbc also prepared a formal valuation of the pfc common shares the pfc valuation and the pcc subordinate voting shares the pcc valuation as required under multilateral instrument 61 101 protection of minority security holders in special transactions mi 61 101 rbc concluded that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications included in the pfc valuation and pcc valuation respectively that the value of the pfc common shares on an en bloc basis was in the range of 46 50 to 55 00 per share and the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares pro forma the completion of the reorganization on an expected market trading value basis was in the range of 32 75 to 33 75 per share as required under mi 61 101 rbc prepared the pfc valuation on an en bloc basis without including a downward adjustment to reflect the liquidity of the pfc common shares the effect of the reorganization on the pfc common shares or the fact that the pfc common shares held do not form part of a controlling interest rbc did not consider it appropriate to value the pcc subordinate voting shares on an en bloc basis as pfc minority shareholders receiving the pcc subordinate voting shares under the reorganization would not be able to effect a sale of 100 of pcc making it inappropriate to consider methodologies to assess the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares that are based on a change of control transaction in preparing the fairness opinion given that approximately i 88 of pcc s net asset value is represented by its ownership of 64 1 of pfc s common shares and ii upon completion of the reorganization pfc minority shareholders will continue to own a slightly higher percentage of the current assets and liabilities of pfc than they currently own and will also own that same percentage of pcc s assets and liabilities other than the pfc common shares currently owned by pcc rbc did not consider it appropriate to compare the value of the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization i e the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to the range of values in the pfc valuation which were determined on an en bloc basis as required by mi 61 101 rbc viewed the reorganization as economically equivalent to pfc acquiring the assets and liabilities of pcc other than the pfc common shares held by pcc and compared the consideration paid by pfc for such assets and liabilities to the value of such assets and liabilities rbc also compared the value of the consideration to be received by the pfc minority shareholders the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to recent trading levels of the pfc common shares a copy of the fairness opinion pfc valuation and pcc valuation the factors considered by the special committee and the pfc board and other relevant background information will be included in the management information circular and related documents the meeting materials to be sent to pfc shareholders

they already know before it s too late as i am about to show you with shocking urgency now is the time to make basic preparations to come out ahead in the collapsing value of dollar denominated assets to not be a victim or a sucker i have no intention of being either and i know you feel the same way at the end of this letter i will tell you how to get the newest most authoritative source of information about hidden inflation how it is ripping you off and what you can do to protect yourself the ultimate hyperinflation defense manual is probably among the most important guides i have ever offered you can t find this information anywhere else and you haven t a moment to lose a dire warning from two past federal reserve board chairs as the editor of the bob livingston letter i pay very close attention to recently resigned or soon to be departed high level u s officials once they are out of office many are remarkably candid even as the mainstream media stop reporting their words in my experience recently retired officials often hint at dangers to come leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in which americans like you and i should pay close attention that s why it s so important to note the departing warning of former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan a man noted for understatement who flatly told congress serious economic disruptions are in the works due to trillions of dollars in federal obligations that will be visited upon taxpayers and retirees like a gigantic balloon payment and that was well before the trillions in helicopter money started raining down on america now listen to former fed chair paul volker who presided over 70 s era inflation and was even more blunt he warned that the chances of an all out dollar collapse due to runaway spending were greater than 50 50 these former insiders are referring to a level of unfunded liability by the federal government which is so gigantic as to boggle the mind to give you some idea of the scope of this problem the government would have to extract 473 000 from each and every u s household to cover the rapidly approaching national balloon payment on unfunded liabilities obviously something is going to have to give this is why i want to rush you information on how treasury bureaucrats are forming emergency contingency plans to freeze ira and 401 k accounts in the event of a national financial panic

because passive retirement planning is a thing of the past to get the most out of your life over 50 you can no longer listen to only one or two paid experts make your house payments and assume the

inaction how to live through hyperinflation in the past few months prices have been skyrocketing lumber prices have almost tripled real estate is soaring prices for some commodities have shot through the roof and let s not even talk about the grocery store but don t be fooled the current temporary period of inflation will soon be followed by even more massive inflation that s because president biden and his allies in congress have embarked on the biggest government spending spree in history this socialistic expansion of government will inevitably lead to a devaluation of the u s dollar hyperinflation that could wipe out your life savings imagine a world of 20 per gallon of gasoline 50 hamburgers and average housing rentals costing 10 000 a month or more the economic stimulus packages of the last few years alone will amount to 6 trillion nearly 7 times what the troubled assets relief program tarp program spent and the stimulus plan is only the tip of the iceberg when you add in the unfunded liabilities that s trillions the government doesn t have over the next few years whether the government borrows it or prints it an increase that big in the money supply is going to do only one thing send inflation through the roof the last time the u s government tried to spend its way out of a recession in the 1970s the inflation rate increased by 500 the ultimate

diversified holding company into one that is primarily focused on financial services said andré desmarais pcc deputy chairman and co ceo simplifying our corporate structure will make it easier to understand and value pcc appropriately said r jeffrey orr pfc president and ceo at the same time the more targeted strategy will allow us to better focus our investments and our efforts to create and return value to shareholders i am excited to be a part of this new chapter of pcc s storied history pfc board of directors and special committee the pfc board formed a special committee of directors the special committee comprised of susan j mcarthur marc a bibeau and siim a vanaselja to review and consider the reorganization the terms of which were negotiated at arm s length with pcc the pfc board unanimously approved the reorganization following the report and favourable recommendation of the special committee and has agreed to unanimously recommend that pfc minority shareholders vote in favour of the reorganization rbc capital markets rbc has provided its opinion the fairness opinion to the special committee that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications contained therein the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization is fair from a financial point of view to the pfc minority shareholders rbc also prepared a formal valuation of the pfc common shares the pfc valuation and the pcc subordinate voting shares the pcc valuation as required under multilateral instrument 61 101 protection of minority security holders in special transactions mi 61 101 rbc concluded that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications included in the pfc valuation and pcc valuation respectively that the value of the pfc common shares on an en bloc basis was in the range of 46 50 to 55 00 per share and the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares pro forma the completion of the reorganization on an expected market trading value basis was in the range of 32 75 to 33 75 per share as required under mi 61 101 rbc prepared the pfc valuation on an en bloc basis without including a downward adjustment to reflect the liquidity of the pfc common shares the effect of the reorganization on the pfc common shares or the fact that the pfc common shares held do not form part of a controlling interest rbc did not consider it appropriate to value the pcc subordinate voting shares on an en bloc basis as pfc minority shareholders receiving the pcc subordinate voting shares under the reorganization would not be able to effect a sale of 100 of pcc making it inappropriate to consider methodologies to assess the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares that are based on a change of control transaction in preparing the fairness opinion given that approximately i 88 of pcc s net asset value is represented by its ownership of 64 1 of pfc s common shares and ii upon completion of the reorganization pfc minority shareholders will continue to own a slightly higher percentage of the current assets and liabilities of pfc than they currently own and will also own that same percentage of pcc s assets and liabilities other than the pfc common shares currently owned by pcc rbc did not consider it appropriate to compare the value of the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization i e the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to the range of values in the pfc valuation which were determined on an en bloc basis as required by mi 61 101 rbc viewed the reorganization as economically equivalent to pfc acquiring the assets and liabilities of pcc other than the pfc common shares held by pcc and compared the consideration paid by pfc for such assets and liabilities to the value of such assets and liabilities rbc also compared the value of the consideration to be received by the pfc minority shareholders the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to recent trading levels of the pfc common shares a copy of the fairness opinion pfc valuation and pcc valuation the factors considered by the special committee and the pfc board and other relevant background information will be included in the management information circular and related documents the meeting materials to be sent to pfc shareholders

since their appointment the annualized total return to shareholders including dividends and capital appreciation has been 11 7 and 13 1 for each of pcc and pfc respectively compared to 7 7 for the s p tsx composite index the board of directors of pcc has indicated that it will appoint r jeffrey orr current president and chief executive officer of pfc as president and chief executive officer of pcc upon completion of the reorganization jeff has been instrumental in building and strengthening pfc s businesses for almost two decades and we look forward to continuing to work with him to execute our shared vision of creating shareholder value in the financial services industry said paul desmarais jr pcc chairman and co ceo the reorganization is a natural step that reflects our evolution from a diversified holding company into one that is primarily focused on financial services said andré desmarais pcc deputy chairman and co ceo simplifying our corporate structure will make it easier to understand and value pcc appropriately said r jeffrey orr pfc president and ceo at the same time the more targeted strategy will allow us to better focus our investments and our efforts to create and return value to shareholders i am excited to be a part of this new chapter of pcc s storied history pfc board of directors and special committee the pfc board formed a special committee of directors the special committee comprised of susan j mcarthur marc a bibeau and siim a vanaselja to review and consider the reorganization the terms of which were negotiated at arm s length with pcc the pfc board unanimously approved the reorganization following the report and favourable recommendation of the special committee and has agreed to unanimously recommend that pfc minority shareholders vote in favour of the reorganization rbc capital markets rbc has provided its opinion the fairness opinion to the special committee that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications contained therein the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization is fair from a financial point of view to the pfc minority shareholders rbc also prepared a formal valuation of the pfc common shares the pfc valuation and the pcc subordinate voting shares the pcc valuation as required under multilateral instrument 61 101 protection of minority security holders in special transactions mi 61 101 rbc concluded that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications included in the pfc valuation and pcc valuation respectively that the value of the pfc common shares on an en bloc basis was in the range of 46 50 to 55 00 per share and the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares pro forma the completion of the reorganization on an expected market trading value basis was in the range of 32 75 to 33 75 per share as required under mi 61 101 rbc prepared the pfc valuation on an en bloc basis without including a downward adjustment to reflect the liquidity of the pfc common shares the effect of the reorganization on the pfc common shares or the fact that the pfc common shares held do not form part of a controlling interest rbc did not consider it appropriate to value the pcc subordinate voting shares on an en bloc basis as pfc minority shareholders receiving the pcc subordinate voting shares under the reorganization would not be able to effect a sale of 100 of pcc making it inappropriate to consider methodologies to assess the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares that are based on a change of control transaction in preparing the fairness opinion given that approximately i 88 of pcc s net asset value is represented by its ownership of 64 1 of pfc s common shares and ii upon completion of the reorganization pfc minority shareholders will continue to own a slightly higher percentage of the current assets and liabilities of pfc than they currently own and will also own that same percentage of pcc s assets and liabilities other than the pfc common shares currently owned by pcc rbc did not consider it appropriate to compare the value of the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization i e the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to the range of values in the pfc valuation which were determined on an en bloc basis as required by mi 61 101 rbc viewed the reorganization as economically equivalent to pfc acquiring the assets and liabilities of pcc other than the pfc common shares held by pcc and compared the consideration paid by pfc for such assets and liabilities to the value of such assets and liabilities rbc also compared the value of the consideration to be received by the pfc minority shareholders the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to recent trading levels of the pfc common shares a copy of the fairness opinion pfc valuation and pcc valuation the factors considered by the special committee and the pfc board and other relevant background information will be included in the management information circular and related documents the meeting materials to be sent to pfc shareholders

posted on by yves here it wasn t all that long ago that economics was called political economy one of the key choices in economics is what to prioritize efficiency or fairness and on top of that as nassim nicholas taleb and others have regularly pointed out achieving a high degree of efficiency typically comes at the expense of safety one additional introductory point adamti mentions adam smith in passing and suggests but doesn t say frontally something that needs to be said often his views have been badly distorted smith inveighed against monopolists and depicted gatherings of businessmen opportunities for them to scheme against workers and customers by anat r admati the george g c parker professor of finance and economics at stanford university graduate school of business gsb a director of the gsb corporations and society initiative and a senior fellow at stanford institute for economic policy research originally published at promarket author s note this essay is based on a speech i gave at the stigler center 2019 conference on political economy of finance whereas the content refers to my experiences as an academic with expertise in finance and economics the key ideas apply to other areas in business schools and beyond i hope colleagues will reflect on the harm from silos and on our opportunities as academics to benefit society there is absolutely no way to understand events before during and since the financial crisis of 2007 2009 while ignoring the powerful political forces that have shaped them yet remarkably much of the economics and finance literature about financial crises focuses on studying unspecified shocks to a system that it largely accepts as inevitable while ignoring critical governance frictions and failures removing blind spots would offer economists and other academics rich opportunities to leverage their expertise to benefit society commenting after the american economic association s annual meeting in january 2017 the economist urged economists to engage in deeper self reflection and stated that economists must take politics into account to be relevant and useful at the end of his recent book crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world which emphasizes the geopolitical context of events in recent decades historian adam tooze laments the narrowness of economics he quotes economist abba lerner who famously said in 1972 economics has gained the title queen of the social sciences by choosing solved political problems as its domain the history of financial economics is revealing in this regard by the second half of the 20th century when modern finance emerged as part of economics the holistic approach of early thinkers such as adam smith which combined economics moral philosophy and politics was long gone narrow social science disciplines replaced the holistic approach by the end of the 19th century in the 20th century economists sought to make economics formal precise and elegant similar to newton s 17th century physics the focus in much of economics particularly in finance is on markets even when economists postulate a social planner and discuss policy they rarely consider how this social planner gets to know what is needed or the process by which policy decisions are made and implemented collective action and politics are messy neat and elegant models are more fun and easier to market to editors and colleagues in my first 25 years as a finance and economics academic i had virtually no engagement with political economy everything changed for me professionally after the financial crisis of 2007 2009 the crisis led me to wonder how financial markets could cause such havoc and why they needed such extraordinary government interventions staying initially within the academic debate my frequent co author paul pfleiderer and i proposed a way to address claims in the literature about the potential usefulness of debt for corporate governance while making banks safer the idea was clever and based on economic concepts and insights but our paper had no fancy mathematics or data a modified version was later published in a law review in the economics and finance academia we realized one cannot get any engagement on important corporate governance and policy issues without appearing scientific through symbols tables or graphs get evonomics in your inbox in the real world it turned out important economic outcomes are often the consequences of political forces during 2010 people within regulatory bodies told me privately that false and misleading claims were affecting key policy decisions they urged me to help clarify the issues and i felt compelled to become involved despite years of research and advocacy however flawed claims persist and still have an impact a recently updated document lists and debunks 34 such claims adam smith many of my experiences in the last decade which involved extensive interactions outside as well as within academia were sobering i saw confusion willful blindness political forces various and sometimes subtle forms of corruption and moral disengagement first hand the harm from economists ignoring political economy became increasingly evident there was no way for me to return to ignoring the issues it was also impossible to explain my experiences using economics alone in writing an essay in 2016 for a book on finance in a just society edited by a philosopher i went beyond economics and finance and drew from scholarship in political science law sociology and social psychology my essay was entitled it takes a village to maintain a dangerous financial system sadly among the enablers of our inefficient and distorted financial system are economists and academics perhaps most shocking a fallacious claim about the impact and cost of more equity funding which contradicts basic teachings in corporate finance has been included in many versions and editions of banking textbooks authored by prominent academic and former federal reserve governor frederic mishkin see section 3 3 here or chapter 8 of the bankers new clothes a risk manager in one of the largest banks whom i met in 2016 at a conference attended almost exclusively by practitioners and regulators and who had dropped out of a top doctoral program in finance quipped in an email after quoting from an academic paper with such friends who needs lobbyists lobbyists who engage in marketing ideas to policymakers and to the public are actually influential they know how to work the system and can dismiss take out of context misquote misuse or promote research as needed if policymakers or the public are unable or unwilling to evaluate the claims people make lobbyists and others can create confusion and promote misleading narratives if it benefits them in the real political economy good ideas and worthy research can fail to gain traction while bad ideas and flawed research can succeed and have an impact luigi zingales highlighted political economy issues within our profession in a 2013 essay entitled preventing economists capture and in his 2015 afa presidential address entitled does finance benefit society zingales notes and laments a pro business and pro finance bias within economics and finance and the pervasive blindness to issues such as corporate fraud and political forces awareness of the risk of capture is the first line of defense he writes in his 2013 essay i agree that the issues are real yet often denied or ignored and that recognizing problems is essential for addressing them governance and political economy challenges are pervasive beyond banking where i encountered them so clearly for example corporate governance research including my own coauthored papers in 1994 and 2009 on shareholder activism has focused almost exclusively on conflicts between shareholders and managers effectively assuming that competitive markets contracts and laws protect everyone except for the narrowly defined shareholder who is implicitly assumed to own only one corporation s shares and to care only about the price of those shares having observed governance and policy failures in banking i realized that the focus on shareholder manager conflicts is far too narrow and often misses the most important problems we must also worry about the governance of the institutions that create and enforce the rules for all how power structures and information asymmetries play out within and between institutions in the private and public sectors is critical a 2017 journal of economic perspectives symposium on the modern corporation includes an essay i wrote on the distortions that arise as a result of the focus in corporate governance on financialized targets that purport to capture shareholder value when combined with political economy forces that can lead to governments failing to set and enforce proper rules the symposium also includes an essay by luigi zingales on how political and market power feed off each other we both noted that more public awareness and understanding of these problems is essential for addressing them economists and academics have numerous opportunities to be helpful by looking more frequently out of their windows expanding their domain beyond solved political problems collaborating across disciplines and bringing back a more holistic approach to their work small changes in this direction are starting to happen as the stigler center s conferences on the political economy of finance show but we can and should do much more numerous research topics are ripe for more study by theorists and empiricists within the following long list of topics still a partial one there are low hanging fruits and more challenging problems that may require interdisciplinary reach and which tenured academics are in a particularly privileged position to take on whistleblower policies the impact of consumers employees and politicians on corporate actions accounting rules for derivatives the effectiveness of boards audits and auditors regulation the design of bankruptcy laws money laundering corporate fraud the organization and pricing of deposit insurance debt subsidies the role of financial literacy and ideology in policy discussions the structure and governance of regulatory agencies and central banks lobbying of multinational corporations the governance of international bodies such as financial stability board basel committee and imf and the political economy of corporate enforcement anat admati photo by nancy rothstein engaging with policy issues in our research and teaching and even engaging in advocacy when appropriate and effectively lobbying on behalf of the public for example by writing comment letters or opinion pieces can be valuable and important policy involvement however requires not only disclosing potential conflicts of interest but most importantly scrutinizing research carefully to ensure it is adequate for guiding policy a problem i have become acutely aware of is that economists and others can be cavalier in claiming that research is relevant for real world application without such scrutiny as a theorist i know models have unrealistic and sometimes stylized assumptions yet models can bring important insights and theoretical and empirical papers that capture key features of the real world can be useful for policy it takes a big leap of faith however and can actually do more harm than good to claim that models whose assumptions greatly distort the real world are adequate for real world applications specific examples are discussed in the first paper i wrote with peter demarzo martin hellwig and paul pfleiderer sections 5 7 the omitted chapter from the book i wrote with martin hellwig paul pfleiderer s paper on the misuse of models in finance and economics which starts with the old joke about the economist assuming a can opener on a deserted island and among other things compares economics and physics and a recent presentation by paul pfleiderer that discusses the role of assumptions in theoretical and empirical research and which includes great visuals the key takeaways if research is claimed to be relevant for the real world are just because a model claims to explain something in the real world does not give it logical or actual validity even if we may never have the data to be able to reject a model there are ways to apply casual empiricism if this model was true we would observe x and we don t and we must be especially careful if a model contradicts other plausible explanations for what we see consider cigarette smoking improves people s health as an explanation of why people smoke just because a model can be calibrated does not give it logical or actual validity applying inadequate economic models to policy in the real world is akin to building bridges using flawed engineering models serious harm may follow we can also enrich our teaching and connect more dots for our students by developing interdisciplinary courses and by bringing out the bigger picture at least occasionally in teaching standard courses for example basic corporate finance courses show how to calculate the debt tax shield and we should point out that there is no good reason for the tax code to subsidize debt relative to equity and that this tax code can create distortions we can also ask whether shareholders as individuals actually want a company in which they hold shares to pursue positive net present value projects that involve pollution or deceptive marketing of harmful products many students are anxious to have such discussions there is a broad sense today that standard business practices and dysfunctional governments have exacerbated economic social and political problems we must find ways to broaden the discussion beyond our narrow lanes academic silos are part of the problem and we should break them to be part of the solution finally we can and should engage in trying to ensure that governments and other institutions serve society if only conflicted experts engage in the process of creating rules especially on important issues that appear technical and confusing such as accounting standards or financial regulation we get what karthik ramanna calls thin political markets and our assumptions about markets are more likely to be false academics may be in the best position to inform policy expose flawed or poorly enforced rules and help hold power to account we cannot assume others will be able or willing to do it without our help governance and politics are key to outcomes everywhere related issues about power and control and about the respective roles of governments and private sector institutions are playing out prominently today in the technology sector a course i taught recently about the internet allowed me to compare and contrast the finance and internet sectors the stigler center has laudably been informing policy related to digital platforms in a recent harvard business review piece i argue that business schools should practice and promote civic minded leadership much more than they currently do the text is also available here i hope more academics and academic institutions recognize and embrace the great opportunities we have to try to make the world a better place

understand and value pcc appropriately said r jeffrey orr pfc president and ceo at the same time the more targeted strategy will allow us to better focus our investments and our efforts to create and return value to shareholders i am excited to be a part of this new chapter of pcc s storied history pfc board of directors and special committee the pfc board formed a special committee of directors the special committee comprised of susan j mcarthur marc a bibeau and siim a vanaselja to review and consider the reorganization the terms of which were negotiated at arm s length with pcc the pfc board unanimously approved the reorganization following the report and favourable recommendation of the special committee and has agreed to unanimously recommend that pfc minority shareholders vote in favour of the reorganization rbc capital markets rbc has provided its opinion the fairness opinion to the special committee that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications contained therein the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization is fair from a financial point of view to the pfc minority shareholders rbc also prepared a formal valuation of the pfc common shares the pfc valuation and the pcc subordinate voting shares the pcc valuation as required under multilateral instrument 61 101 protection of minority security holders in special transactions mi 61 101 rbc concluded that as of december 12 2019 and subject to the assumptions limitations and qualifications included in the pfc valuation and pcc valuation respectively that the value of the pfc common shares on an en bloc basis was in the range of 46 50 to 55 00 per share and the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares pro forma the completion of the reorganization on an expected market trading value basis was in the range of 32 75 to 33 75 per share as required under mi 61 101 rbc prepared the pfc valuation on an en bloc basis without including a downward adjustment to reflect the liquidity of the pfc common shares the effect of the reorganization on the pfc common shares or the fact that the pfc common shares held do not form part of a controlling interest rbc did not consider it appropriate to value the pcc subordinate voting shares on an en bloc basis as pfc minority shareholders receiving the pcc subordinate voting shares under the reorganization would not be able to effect a sale of 100 of pcc making it inappropriate to consider methodologies to assess the value of the pcc subordinate voting shares that are based on a change of control transaction in preparing the fairness opinion given that approximately i 88 of pcc s net asset value is represented by its ownership of 64 1 of pfc s common shares and ii upon completion of the reorganization pfc minority shareholders will continue to own a slightly higher percentage of the current assets and liabilities of pfc than they currently own and will also own that same percentage of pcc s assets and liabilities other than the pfc common shares currently owned by pcc rbc did not consider it appropriate to compare the value of the consideration to be received by pfc minority shareholders under the reorganization i e the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to the range of values in the pfc valuation which were determined on an en bloc basis as required by mi 61 101 rbc viewed the reorganization as economically equivalent to pfc acquiring the assets and liabilities of pcc other than the pfc common shares held by pcc and compared the consideration paid by pfc for such assets and liabilities to the value of such assets and liabilities rbc also compared the value of the consideration to be received by the pfc minority shareholders the pcc valuation multiplied by 1 05 plus 0 01 to recent trading levels of the pfc common shares a copy of the fairness opinion pfc valuation and pcc valuation the factors considered by the special committee and the pfc board and other relevant background information will be included in the management information circular and related documents the meeting materials to be sent to pfc shareholders

critics say the government should allow the use of us dollars and other currencies to tame soaring prices in zimbabwe zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa vowed on friday not to revert to using the united states dollar despite the country s new local currency plunging against the greenback since its introduction this year fuelling inflation and economic hardship in 2009 zimbabwe dollarised the economy by allowing the us dollar and other foreign currencies to be used as legal tender in the country after hyperinflation decimated the value of zimbabwe s sovereign currency the government ended dollarisation in june after it outlawed the use of foreign currencies in local transactions in a bid to defend a fledgling interim sovereign currency this paved the way for the new zimbabwean dollar which formally entered circulation last month but economists say the decision to end dollarisation actually drove hyperinflation eroding wages and savings economists businesses and the opposition have accused the government of rushing to reintroduce the zimbabwean dollar without the backing of foreign currency reserves they say the government should allow the use of us dollar and other currencies to tame soaring prices no progressive nation can progress without its own currency however we have so many among our people who fight this decision we will not revert back to a basket of currencies never never never mnangagwa told zanu pf members at an annual party conference outside the capital there is little foreign investment in the troubled southern african nation which is in the throes of its worst economic crisis in a decade export earnings and remittances from the diaspora have fallen the resulting shortage of us dollars to pay for imports has led to fuel and electricity shortages hobbling businesses including in the important mining sector although it is now illegal to use foreign currency to buy local goods many people still take the risk and some businesses charge in both us and zimbabwe dollars hopes have faded that mnangagwa who took over from late president robert mugabe after a coup two years ago can quickly revive the economy which has left millions struggling and facing hunger mnangagwa said his government is pursuing difficult economic reforms including measures to reduce the budget deficit to single digits he said violent protests in january that erupted in the wake of a fuel price hike and calls by labour unions for strikes to boost paychecks in line with inflation were both part of an anti government plot to derail economic reforms and undermine his rule i want to commend the people of zimbabwe for rejecting the machinations by those with unbridled political ambitions who are even prepared to use violence divisions and disunity and violent demonstrations to acquire power mnangagwa said

here s our summary of key events overnight that affect new zealand with news there is a sense of deflation after two big international issues get resolved the big overnight news is that the chinese have confirmed there really is a phase one trade deal one where the americans will scrap the december 15 tariffs market reactions are mixed american equity and bond markets don t seem enthusiastic the s p500 is unchanged at present after rising 0 5 on the news then falling 0 8 on the details but the shanghai equity market rose an impressive 1 8 yesterday tokyo rose even more up 2 6 and hong kong was also up 2 6 maybe there is another reason for the muted wall street response weak november retail sales they rose at only a very modest pace in november virtually flat from october and only up 2 9 above the same month a year ago and a slower than expected start to the holiday shopping season and given that american inflation is up 2 1 in the year the gains look very mediocre business inventories were up 3 1 in the year in china foreign direct investment levels are rising they are up 6 in 2019 so far a gain of us 124 bln almost 30 of that is in high tech sectors and that portion grew a remarkable 28 in the year data for japanese industrial production for the year to october looks very discouraging down 7 7 and that is a faster rate of decline than for the year to september but that was in the shadow of their gst increase and when the typhoon hit looking forward they are more optimistic with 2020 growth of 1 4 partly as a result of an infrastructure stimulus boost in india the presumption is that their export prowess is all about services call centers it services and the like but it turns out these service exports are growing slower than their overall economy and declining they were up just 5 25 in the year to october with the uk election decided decisively the focus will now turn to trade deals not only in their back yard but with many countries eager to re negotiate access to the uk market the first issue to be resolved will be the irish question and now the uk government doesn t need the northern irish vote to resolve the matter it looks like the customs border will be the coast scotland will be trickier and both issues may end the united claims of their kingdom then there is the trade arrangements with the eu and especially the position of london as a regional financial hub it will almost certainly be diminished trade deals with nz and australia are way down the list of importance there but they may be easy deals to do meanwhile australia is getting ready to cook this forecast is frightening and their housing markets may be heating up too much as well the imf is warning regulators to be ready to act should rapid housing debt growth continue on current trends saying looser financial conditions could re accelerate asset price inflation boosting private consumption but also adding to medium term vulnerabilities given high household debt levels the ust 10yr yield is at 1 83 and very little different from this time last week but it is down 5 bps from this time yesterday and down 8 bps from where we left it last night bond markets are sceptical of the trade war deal their 2 10 curve is unchanged at 22 bps their 1 5 curve is at 12 bps their 3m 10yr curve is less positive 27 bps the aussie govt 10yr is down 8 bps overnight at 1 17 the china govt 10yr is virtually unchanged at 3 22 the nz govt 10 yr is now at 1 58 and unchanged overnight although it is up 9 bps in a week gold is up us 6 from this time yesterday to us 1 474 oz and up us 14 for the week the vix volatility index is just over 13 and a similar level to this time last week its average over the past year is 16 the fear greed index we follow has moved from moderate greed levels to extreme greed levels us oil prices are up further to just on us 60 bbl and the brent benchmark is now just at us 65 bbl the us rig count fell again to under 800 and its lowest level in nearly three years the kiwi dollar is at 65 8 usc and unchanged over the week but lower by nearly ½c overnight on the cross rates we are a little firmer at 95 9 auc against the euro we are unchanged at 59 2 euro cents and now the uk election result in known and decisive the uk pound is slightly weaker overnight pulling back from its gains yesterday but for the week it is 1 2 firmer that puts our twi 5 at just on 70 9 and virtually unchanged for the week bitcoin is little changed from this time yesterday now at us 7 270 the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here

yesterday it reached jpy109 45 and today jpy109 65 the high earlier this month was seen around jpy109 75 the intraday technical readings have not matched the strength of spot move although it looks

her debut press conference as president of the ecb the market voted with their feet in the sense that she statement and answers did not spark much movement there were some minor 0 1 percentage point adjustments to some near term forecasts but her assessment was consistent with the tone and path of the ecb she demonstrated knowledge of a number of technical issues lagarde comporting herself well and left no doubt about her inclusive and collaborative style which is likely to help ease some ruffled feathers the strategic review which has already begun is projected to take more of next year to complete a little longer perhaps than expected she seemed enthusiastic and a little upbeat by suggesting that several economic measures appeared to have stopped worsening and that lending to non financial businesses and households continued to grow while there have been some press pieces suggesting officials are becoming increasingly skeptical of the merits of negative interest rates lagarde pushed back and argued that it has been an important tool the euro has not fallen this week it is up about 0 5 today at about 1 1185 to bring the week s gain to about 1 1 it has jumped above the 200

cobank releases 2020 year ahead report forces that will shape the u s rural economy denver dec 12 2019 globe newswire the u s rural economy will continue to face headwinds in 2020 and is expected to underperform relative to the economy of urban america since 2014 gdp growth in rural counties has averaged almost 1 less than in urban counties that trend is likely to continue without a significant upswing in agricultural commodity prices energy exploration rural manufacturing and other industries upon which rural economic growth depend despite that bearish prognosis there is room for optimism according to a comprehensive 2020 outlook report from cobank s knowledge exchange division the u s farm economy has demonstrated its resiliency in the face of trade wars extreme weather and other disruptive events while the downside impact of trade disputes and tariffs will remain severe for many some agriculture sectors will see stronger exports and higher prices rising animal protein and dairy exports will be a bright spot for producers in 2020 most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively to the consumer said dan kowalski vice president of cobank s knowledge exchange division however without a meaningful u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with uncertainty in 2020 the cobank 2020 outlook report examines 10 key factors that will shape agriculture and market sectors that serve and impact rural communities throughout the u s global economy less trade slower growth after a year of trade tensions declining gdp and the slowest global economic growth since the depths of the financial crisis the world s leading economies hope to turn the page in 2020 the prognosis however offers little to support such optimism consumer strength the world over has prevented further slowing in the global economy the direction and severity of the u s china trade dispute will continue to have the most significant influence on the world economy in 2020 a leveling off of trade tensions would allow global economic growth to bottom out in early 2020 before showing signs of life later in the year however the vulnerable state of the global economy makes it susceptible to contraction if trade conditions worsen u s economy expansion for those left behind the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in the coming year there is evidence that since 2017 more people including those in rural communities have broadly shared the benefits of economic growth despite the continual rise in wealth inequality monetary policy sustain and prepare all eyes will be on the central banks as the world inches closer to the end of the longest period of economic growth in history japan and europe are still stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 all these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets federal reserve chair powell s role in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later u s government policy and trade up in the air agricultural policy at the federal level has been wrought with uncertainty and volatility the trade environment for 2020 remains hazy as well beyond a possible u s china phase one deal more progress with china will be a challenge as a result it is difficult to see trade as a bright spot in 2020 the atmosphere in washington today has given way to progress on agricultural labor legislation and the usmca but a protracted partisan fight over impeachment is on tap in the senate this rancor makes it difficult to advance legislation that helps agriculture which would give either side a win for the hotly contested 2020 election market facilitation program payments to farmers helped make up for persistently low commodity prices in the last year u s farm economy trade uncertainty lingers without a substantive u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with trade uncertainty in 2020 as questions linger as to whether usda will continue to soften the blow of the trade war for farmers and ranchers with government payments amid persistently low commodity prices and rising costs u s farmers and ranchers continue to struggle with low and declining working capital farm debt already at record levels is expected to continue climbing as credit quality in farm loans declines particularly for grain and dairy producers however stable farm real estate values have helped farmers the resiliency of farmland values despite the steep drop in net farm income over the years has allowed farmers to restructure debt and address tight cash flow and liquidity crunches specialty crops labor and water in the spotlight fruit nut and vegetable markets will continue to face rising production costs in 2020 due to mounting regulations particularly as they relate to controls over groundwater in california regulations under the state s sustainable groundwater management act sgma are about to go into effect and could potentially cause acreage shifts between crops of varying water needs other government action in 2020 could have a favorable impact on specialty crop growers the farm workforce modernization act currently being debated in congress is a hopeful sign for an improved regulatory environment for agricultural labor if passed it would help ease the tight labor supply plaguing agriculture grain farm supply and biofuels time to transform challenges for the grain sector will persist in 2020 fueled by commodity price pressure policy uncertainty and export weakness amid growing global supply abundance especially for corn and soybeans u s wheat producers and exporters though may benefit from an improved export pace in 2020 with the russian wheat crop struggling biofuels also face challenges in 2020 u s ethanol production according to the u s energy information administration is expected to fall by 1 9 in 2019 to 15 8 billion gallons and remain flat in 2020 the outlook for farm supply companies is mixed and continues to be heavily influenced by weather to improve its value proposition this sector is actively pursuing vertical and horizontal consolidation dairy and animal protein exporting your way to success with dairy and animal protein production looking toward another year of increased production in 2020 a rebound in exports will be critical to profitability in both sectors per capita consumption of animal protein in the u s will likely set a new record in 2019 overall dairy consumption in the u s will remain strong in 2020 as americans continue eating more cheese and butter but fluid milk will likely continue its long term decline strong demand and rising exports though will not erase financial stress at the farm level producers of beef pork poultry and dairy will likely experience stress from higher feed costs due to lower crop yields this fall rural electricity demand grows for cleaner lower cost power companies throughout the electricity supply chain are likely to face heightened simultaneous demands for cleaner and less expensive power generation in 2020 these pressures reflect the intense popular concern about climate change wealth and income inequality and slowing economic growth three issues which americans rank as equally important in recent polling in many rural communities these concerns are likely to manifest in more numerous and more vehement calls for greater renewable power generation for utilities the task of justifying multi million dollar expenditures on new renewable resources will be easier in 2020 as the unsubsidized costs of solar wind battery energy storage and flexible natural gas fired resources continue to decline rural communications investors have come to buy rural and regional telecommunications operators will become targets in 2020 for investors and strategic buyers as the pool of available mid sized fiber transport companies dries up demand for these companies has been so strong that valuations are reaching levels that were unthinkable a few years ago mergers and acquisition activity in rural markets should be brisk as the growth in data traffic offers attractive

street journal reported that despite president trump signing off on an agreement with china china appears to not be officially on board according to the wsj at a regular news briefing today foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chungying referred only to how news of the agreement pushed equities higher but did not confirm an agreement was reached instead chungying kept to the china party line saying

things got wiggly in september to address a shortage of short term funding that had pushed the overnight rate to as high of 10 yesterday the new york fed announced a new plan to address the problem which despite the initial assessment of it being idiosyncratic has only increased in severity the new plan consists of overnight lending through the new year of 225 billion coupled with a 190 billion longer term repo loans starting next week keep in mind all of that is on top of the current 75 billion already provided which tallies to a total of 490 billion remember back when half a trillion was real money this is essentially doubling the scale of its recent interventions those interventions by the way were unable to keep the overnight rate from rising above 4 this week the upper target limit

a remarkable feature of the election was that the economy usually centre stage in the campaign counted for so little but it will come to the fore now determining whether boris johnson can consolidate his triumph at the polls or whether his lustre will soon fade whether the economy performs well or badly will be crucial in determining living standards and the ability of the treasury to finance better public services above all the nhs the neglect of the economy in the election was particularly odd given how poorly it has been doing this year official figures released just two days before the election showed that activity had ground to a standstill in the three months to october on the basis of these numbers garry young of the national institute of economic and social research estimates growth of 0 1 per cent in the final quarter of 2019 taking the year as a whole he now expects growth of just 1 3 per cent that would be the lowest since 2009 when gdp shrank drastically in the wake of the global financial crisis the bank of england forecast in early november that the economy would grow in 2020 at the same sluggish pace as in 2019 but on the brighter side it expected a pick up in the course of the year to 1 6 per cent by the final quarter of 2020 however that projection was based on an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement said mark carney the bank s governor on 7th november that assumption has been swept aside by the conservatives commitment in their manifesto launched on 24th november not to extend the transition period following the planned brexit in january beyond the end of 2020 that has rekindled worries about a hugely damaging no deal brexit tearing the economy out of the customs union and single market in which it will remain during the transition period the one certainty about 2020 is that the hardening of the conservative stance during the election will foster further uncertainty this will continue to gnaw away at the economy as firms suspend or retrench their capital projects the bank of england said in its november monetary policy report that the uncertainty generated by brexit has been a key factor in the stalling of business investment since the referendum vote in june 2016 the self harming would not matter so much if the world economy were in a better place one reason why former chancellor george osborne s prediction of an immediate recession following the brexit referendum turned out to be wrong was that there was a subsequent surge in global growth which rose to 3 8 per cent in 2017 on international monetary fund figures the strongest since 2011 that helped british exporters especially since britain s main trading partner the european union grew strongly as the 19 strong euro area at its heart put on a turn of speed but that uplift has since turned to a chilly downdraft which has brought global growth down to its lowest in this decade figures from the organisation for economic co operation and development in late november estimated that growth would be just 2 9 per cent in 2019 trump s protectionist measures have contributed to a wrenching slowdown in world trade growth which has particularly hurt manufacturers and weakened investment the heavily exporting german economy at the hub of the euro area has slipped from growth of 2 8 per cent in 2017 to just 0 6 per cent this year on the oecd figures at best the world economy is likely to stabilise in 2020 rather than to improve the oecd expects growth to stay at 2 9 per cent if anything the balance of risks is tilted to the downside say economists at citigroup in a note on 9th december they cited a range of factors such as trade tensions political uncertainty a dwindling in america s recent growth outperformance and a spread of global manufacturing weakness to as yet more resilient domestic oriented service sectors as ever in economics there will be some offsetting factors one is that chancellor sajid javid s giveaway spending round in september will provide a moderate fiscal stimulus when it starts to take effect in the financial year starting next april and to the extent that the rise in sterling keeps down prices consumers will feel a bit better off though exporters will find the going harder overall however the british economy looks likely to remain stuck in 2020 at around this year s sluggish growth rate the oecd thinks it could do even worse forecasting a rise in gdp of just 1 per cent in 2020 followed by 1 2 per cent in 2021 more worrying still is the state of productivity growth since that is the mainspring of rising prosperity in the long term measured as output per hour worked productivity rose by only 0 5 per cent a year between 2010 and 2018 that is an extraordinarily slow pace between 2000 and 2008 a bad year for the economy it grew at an annual rate of 1 7 per cent more recent performance is even worse productivity in the second quarter of 2019 was 0 5 per cent lower than in the same period in 2018 against this dismal background it is difficult to be optimistic about the outlook for productivity gains in the early 2020s for one thing the dearth of business investment will take its toll on efficiency for another trade spurs higher productivity through greater competition and brexit will hamper commerce with the eu which accounts for half of total british exports and imports johnson may have prevailed at the polls but overcoming british economic weaknesses many of which are longstanding demands more than electoral sophistry rhetorical flourishes and political evasions are irrelevant in the treasury spreadsheets that spell out hard truths what lies ahead is a slow motion economy that will undermine the claims of a rosy post brexit future and expose the fiction that higher spending on public services can be achieved without tax increases
financial markets in asia followed gains on wall street after trump tweeted that he had signed a trade deal with china asian shares scaled eight month peaks on friday as a last gasp trade deal between the united states and china as well as a likely major election win by britain s conservative party looked to have cleared a couple of dark clouds from the global horizon the double dose of relief boosted the chinese yuan but slugged safe haven sovereign bonds and the japanese yen even leading investors to scale back the chance of more interest rate cuts around the world global investors have been given two of the biggest gifts on their christmas list and should be appreciative for a while at least said sean callow a senior forex analyst at westpac global equity indices such as msci world should set more record highs and sterling could push above 1 36 the pound hit its highest since mid 2018 as united kingdom exit polls seemed to rule out a shock win by the left wing labour opposition and could help clarify the outlook for brexit prime minister boris johnson gained a landslide victory in britain s parliament on friday with a total 364 out of 650 seats settling another long standing uncertainty a wave of trade euphoria had already lifted wall street to record highs overnight reuters reported the us has agreed to reduce some tariffs on chinese goods and delay a tranche of tariffs as part of a phase one deal china also has agreed to make 50bn in agricultural purchases in 2020 as part of the deal that person and another us source familiar with the talks said beijing s silence however fuelled questions over whether the two sides can come to a truce in their bitter trade war before a new round of tit for tat tariffs takes effect on sunday less need for more cuts in asia japan s nikkei climbed 2 1 percent to a 14 month high while south korean stocks firmed 1 2 percent e mini futures for the s p 500 rose 0 4 percent to another peak msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan put on 0 5 percent wall street had celebrated the trade news with record highs the dow ended thursday up 0 79 percent while the s p 500 gained 0 86 percent and the nasdaq 0 73 percent if the us cuts the current tariffs to some extent as reported that is not something markets have priced in so we could see a further leg up in the stock market said norihiro fujito chief investment strategist at mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities in tokyo the conservatives appear to be on course for a big win we are now finally seeing a clear direction on brexit after three years of deadlock but the rally in stocks was bad news for bonds and yields as us 10 year treasuries shot up to 1 95 percent a rise of 16 basis points in just two sessions interest rate futures slipped as investors priced in less chance of a rate cut from the us federal reserve next year a shift seen across a range of developed nations other safe harbours also took a beating with the yen sliding across the board the us dollar firmed further to 109 42 yen having risen 0 7 percent overnight the us dollar fared less well elsewhere as the pound and the euro benefited from the uk exit polls the euro added 0 5 percent to 1 1189 while the dollar dipped 0 35 percent on a basket of currencies to 96 742 the us dollar also lost out to the chinese yuan to hit an 18 week low as any truce would be seen as a boon for the export heavy economy the dollar was last at 6 9487 yuan having shed a steep 1 2 percent overnight the shift from safe havens saw spot gold ease to 1 465 04 per ounce oil prices rallied on hopes a trade deal would support global growth and thus demand us crude added 36 cents to 59 54 a barrel while brent futures climbed 0 8 percent to their highest in three months at 64 68

content supplied by the world gold council the gold price has risen more than 15 this year against a backdrop of falling interest rates economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions this article is a look back in time to forecast the future for gold gold has been on an upward trajectory since june and the price is now at record levels in many currencies does this mean we are moving into a new bull market for gold to answer that question we looked back in time assessing how gold has performed over the past century and the key characteristics of gold bull markets our research showed that gold bull markets are most likely to develop during global currency crises bond bull markets commodity bull markets or a combination of all three 1 global currency crises the great depression of 1929 and the collapse of the bretton woods system in 1971 provoked dramatic currency crises these in turn triggered prolonged gold bull markets the revaluation of the gold price in 1934 looking first at the great depression this began when wall street crashed in 1929 plunging the american economy into a vicious circle of deflation and stagnation in january 1934 the us congress passed the gold reserve act to try and stimulate the economy this gave president roosevelt the right to devalue the dollar and he swiftly announced a re evaluation adjusting the price of one ounce of gold from us 20 67 dollars to us 35 an increase of more than 70 the nixon shock of 1971 fast forward almost three decades and on august 13th 1971 president nixon decided to terminate the bretton woods system which had formed the basis for global currency markets since the second world war in december 1971 the g10 economies signed the smithsonian agreement in washington dc adjusting the official price of one ounce of gold from us 35 to us 38 implying an instant 7 9 depreciation of the dollar between 1971 and 1973 the gold price soared from us 35 to nearly us 100 per ounce both gold bull markets were both directly caused by the revaluation of the gold price during periods of extreme economic weakness which triggered global currency market crises 2 bond bull markets in some respects gold is a bit like a super sovereign zero coupon bond it has an intrinsic value it is highly liquid carries no risk of default and provides no yield as such the returns generated by gold depend on its underlying value rising over time much like bonds the price rises as yields fall a trend that was particularly evident during the two big us debt crises of the past 100 years the great depression in 1929 and the subprime crisis in 2008 the us authorities dealt with both crises in a similar fashion they reduced short term interest rates to around zero thereby injecting liquidity into the financial system and depreciating the dollar against major currencies gold benefited from this policy on two counts first as gold is priced and traded primarily in dollars its purchasing power increased as the us currency weakened second as interest rates were cut bond yields fell in sync this reduced the opportunity cost of investing in gold a non income bearing asset deleveraging in the great depression and the subprime crisis after the 1929 stock market crash the federal reserve fed reduced short term interest rates to around zero and replaced short term treasury bonds with long term treasury bonds known as the twist operation the deleveraging process that took place after the subprime crisis was very similar the fed reduce short term interest rates to about zero and adopted the twist operation on both occasions the dollar depreciated against other major currencies and gold however this time round the fed employed large scale asset purchases too given the pervasive effect of the us subprime crisis most developed economy central banks followed the fed and initiated quantitative easing in 2015 the european central bank went one stage further introducing negative interest rates which precipitated a surge in negative yielding bonds since that time the whole world has entered into an ultra low or even negative interest rate environment this encourages investors to focus on capital gains rather than yield a trend that plays to gold s advantage looking ahead therefore negative interest rates are likely to provoke further increases in the gold price 3 commodity bull markets gold can also benefit when commodities move into a bull phase commodity prices are closely related to economic cycles in the 1970s 1980s and the beginning of this century for example mining activity was constrained just as construction activity increased this created a significant imbalance between supply and demand and a sharp rise in bulk commodity prices particularly industrial metals such as copper gold also rose on these occasions partly because it is often included in commodity indices but also because rising commodity prices tend to go hand in hand with rising inflation and gold is widely acknowledged as a safe haven anti inflationary asset currency crises bond bull markets and commodity bull runs rarely occur independently of one another indeed a gold bull market usually arises when more than one paradigm is in evidence nonetheless one tends to be dominant in each bull cycle prospects for gold a new bull market dominated by the bond paradigm we believe that bond prices are the dominant force behind the current gold bull market bulk commodities are relatively plentiful so there is little danger of demand outweighing supply and prices are unlikely to show sustainable gains on the bond front however the us is now at the end of its current debt cycle history shows that deleveraging tends to begin and economic conditions start to deteriorate when us corporate leverage rises by 7 to 10 compared to the last cycle the current upswing began in 2010 leverage has reached a critical stage and a new round of deleveraging seems to be underway back in the days of the great depression a fierce round of deleveraging was followed by monetary tightening as signs of stability emerged the change of fed policy began around 1937 by this stage however loose monetary policy had pushed asset prices to a new high this prompted fears that aggressive tightening could provoke another crisis and a stock market crash as equities came under pressure the federal reserve began lowering rates again and by april 1938 the short term interest rate had come down to zero the stock market then stabilised and started to rebound this could be what we are experiencing today however it should be noted that the stock market rebound was temporary despite us rate cuts the bearish trend lasted until 1942 there are already signs that us markets are becoming wary of excessive leverage and the federal reserve has begun to cut short term interest rates most market observers expect further cuts and some speculate that more quantitative easing is around the corner either or both of these would probably provoke another round of dollar depreciation gold should benefit further from the low or even negative interest rate environment as well as the depreciation of the dollar and the bull market will gain fresh momentum first us treasury yields which act as a global bond benchmark are expected to fall leading to lower bond rates worldwide and a rise in the number of negative yielding assets in such an environment the opportunity cost of investing in gold is largely decreased second the dollar still has a major influence on the gold price a depreciating dollar enhances the purchasing power of gold and highlights its properties as a stable asset whose value appreciates over time there is another angle too de dollarisation the decision by many countries around the world to purchase fewer dollars and increase their exposure to other currencies and to gold highlighting this trend central bank gold reserves have increased significantly with china and russia among the biggest buyers worldwide when the global monetary system was restructured in the 1930s and again in 1970s this incurred a tremendous increase in gold amounting to 70 and 340 respectively in nominal terms dedollarisation may have the same effect on every count therefore gold can be expected to move from strength to strength
argentina is taking measures to fight out debacles created by implementation of neoliberal policies for years in the country the measures may appear unusual to many but the measures show a political leadership s effort to fight out poverty lack of medicare for common people there is also a plan to make current laws related to health and social emergencies ineffective on january 31 2020 argentina s president alberti fernandez on december 12 2019 summoned the chamber of deputies to approve the necessary laws to declare economic health and social emergencies in order to carry out this decision as soon as possible a well defined schedule of meetings and events has also been set up next monday the newly appointed ministers will come to congress to explain the bills related to economic health and social emergencies on tuesday the budget and general legislation committees will hold a plenary to issue an opinion on these bills on the next day the fernandez bills would arrive in the lower house seeking approval this schedule was agreed between president fernandez the coordinating minister santiago cafiero the legal and technical secretary vilma ibarra and the president of the chamber sergio massa during the monday meeting the new ministers are expected to argue in favor of the emergency declaration by contextualizing the measure with reference to the current lack of a national budget which reflects the true state of the public accounts that the former president mauricio macri leaves ministers are also expected to remind lawmakers that current laws related to health and social emergencies will no longer be effective on january 31 2020 the likely political response of some legislative banks to this whole process however may not be very encouraging right wing politicians opposition some right wing politicians have argued in advance that emergency declarations in these areas would grant president fernandez discretion to manage public resources through necessity and urgency decrees that is their argument to insinuate their possible opposition to the measure in that sense for instance maximiliano ferraro president of the right wing civic coalition bloc announced that he will not support the executive initiative arguing that emergency laws could grant the government exceptional powers that violate the national constitution behind this rhetoric the political motivations seem to be different right wing lawmakers are reluctant to recognize the magnitude of the social crisis that a neoliberal government which was led by businesspersons and supported by u s controlled international financial institutions left in argentina end poverty and misery earlier on the newly elected president of argentina alberto fernández called on his fellow citizens to join forces to end poverty and misery once and for all alberto fernández has taken charge on tuesday alberti fernandez called for open borders and spaces so that we all can think together about how to end poverty and misery fernandez called on all social sectors to work on this goal in order to improve the livelihoods of the argentinean people fernández the winner of the elections on october 27 visited the province of catamarca on saturday where he participated in the inauguration of the raúl ricardo alfonsín urban park along with alberto fernandez were the catamarca governor lucía corpacci the elected governor raúl jalil and the vice governor rubén dusso in a message posted on twitter fernández thanked corpacci for paying tribute to former president raúl alfonsín 1983 1989 raúl alfonsín taught us the importance of the ethics of solidarity which is to reach out to those who have stayed on the side of the road this is what we are going to do from december 10 in argentina the elected governor said in his tweet plan to increase minimum wages and pension during a meeting with the general confederation of labor cgt leaders the next labor minister claudio moroni mentioned that alberto fernandez plans to increase wages and pensions when he takes office in december promising a decree to level the field before starting the social dialogue was what workers liked the most so did the commitment to immediately improve the income of retirees and social plans recipients local outlet perfil reported increases would not be widespread but would be aimed at benefiting the most relegated sectors nevertheless further details of these measures will be announced when the new argentine government knows how president mauricio macri leaves the country s public accounts according to argentina s national institute of statistics and censuses a 4 persons family needed 35 647 66 to get out of poverty in october 2019 that amount was 47 1 percent higher than the equivalent figure in oct 2018 to avoid misunderstandings from the business community fernandez s team members stressed that the level the field decree will not increase all salaries or create a bonus for all workers the new argentinean government will set an emerging compensation mechanism to ease the burden of inflation while generating a broad social agreement on prices and wages the fernandez decree would be a bridge to assist those workers who have been hit hardest by the macroeconomic crisis as well as by particularly harsh conditions in their particular sector among them are those who failed to negotiate agreements in line with the evolution of inflation which would reach a 50 percent accumulated increase at the end of 2019 trump hits argentina and brazil with new tariffs the u s president donald trump recently sent shock waves through brazil and argentina announcing he would restore tariffs on u s steel and aluminum imports from the two countries in apparent retaliation for currency weakness he said was hurting u s farmers in an early morning tweet on december 2 2019 that sent officials from both countries scrambling for explanations from washington donald trump said brazil and argentina were presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies both countries have actively been trying to strengthen their currencies the real and the peso against the dollar their currencies have been buffeted by weakness that analysts partially attribute to trump s larger trade battle with china trump who gave no details about his new plan said the currency weakness was hurting u s farmers the u s trade war with china has made u s agricultural products less competitive compared with those from brazil and argentina effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries trump wrote representatives for the u s state department and the office of the u s trade representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment as they awoke to trump s tweet brazilian and argentine officials said they would try to speak with washington and press trump to reverse course brazil s main steel industry body said it was perplexed by a decision it labeled a retaliation emerging market stocks and the highly sensitive mexican peso slid to session lows following trump s post u s and brazilian steel shares rose brazil s president jair bolsonaro an avowed trump fan who has sought closer u s ties said in a local radio interview that trump s decision was not a retaliation adding that he would call his u s counterpart who he was confident would listen to brazil s concerns i don t see this as retaliation bolsonaro told radio itatiaia i m going to call him so that he doesn t penalize us our economy basically comes from commodities it s what we ve got i hope that he understands and i m almost certain he ll listen to us argentine production minister dante sica said trump s announcement was unexpected and he was seeking talks with u s officials additionally argentina s foreign ministry said it would begin negotiations with the u s state department sica said argentine government officials had discussed how to deal with the measures on monday morning and that he was seeking talks with u s commerce secretary wilbur ross to obtain more detail we are trying to get more precision about the announcement and what impact it could have both commercially and administratively sica said we do not yet know the magnitude of the measure he said argentina has exported around 700 million in steel and aluminum to the united states so far this year trump s accusation that the brazilian and argentine currencies were being artificially devalued was met with widespread skepticism argentina put in place currency controls to steady its beleaguered peso trump also urged the u s federal reserve to lower interest rates so countries no longer take advantage of our strong dollar lower rates loosen

brasil brazil s main steel lobby said it was perplexed by trump s decision it said in a statement that brazil s government could not be meddling with the real as the currency is free floating the

denver the u s rural economy will continue to face headwinds in 2020 and is expected to underperform relative to the economy of urban america since 2014 gross domestic product gdp growth in rural counties has averaged almost 1 less than in urban counties that trend is likely to continue without a significant upswing in agricultural commodity prices energy exploration rural manufacturing and other industries upon which rural economic growth depend despite that bearish prognosis there is room for optimism according to a comprehensive 2020 outlook report from cobank s knowledge exchange division the u s farm economy has demonstrated its resiliency in the face of trade wars extreme weather and other disruptive events while the downside impact of trade disputes and tariffs will remain severe for many some agriculture sectors will see stronger exports and higher prices rising animal protein and dairy exports will be a bright spot for producers in 2020 most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively to the consumer said dan kowalski vice president of cobank s knowledge exchange division however without a meaningful u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with uncertainty in 2020 most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively

that will shape agriculture and market sectors that serve and impact rural communities throughout the u s global economy after a year of trade tensions declining gdp and the slowest global economic growth since the depths of the financial crisis the world s leading economies hope to turn the page in 2020 the prognosis however offers little to support such optimism consumer strength the world over has prevented further slowing in the global economy the direction and severity of the u s china trade dispute will continue to have the most significant influence on the world economy in 2020 a leveling off of trade tensions would allow global economic growth to bottom out in early 2020 before showing signs of life later in the year however the vulnerable state of the global economy makes it susceptible to contraction if trade conditions worsen u s economy the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in the coming year there is evidence that since 2017 more people including those in rural communities have broadly shared the benefits of economic growth despite the continual rise in wealth inequality monetary policy all eyes will be on the central banks as the world inches closer to the end of the longest period of economic growth in history japan and europe are still stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 all these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets federal reserve chair powell s role in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later u s government agricultural policy at the federal level has been wrought with uncertainty and volatility the trade environment for 2020 remains hazy as well beyond a possible u s china phase one deal more progress with china will be a challenge as a result it is difficult to see trade as a bright spot in 2020 the atmosphere in washington today has given way to progress on agricultural labor legislation and the usmca but a protracted partisan fight over impeachment is on tap in the senate this rancor makes it difficult to advance legislation that helps agriculture which would give either side a win for the hotly contested 2020 election market facilitation program payments to farmers helped make up for persistently low commodity prices in the last year u s farm economy without a substantive u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with trade uncertainty in 2020 as questions linger as to whether usda will continue to soften the blow of the trade war for farmers and ranchers with government payments amid persistently low commodity prices and rising costs u s farmers and ranchers continue to struggle with low and declining working capital farm debt already at record levels is expected to continue climbing as credit quality in farm loans declines particularly for grain and dairy producers however stable farm real estate values have helped farmers the resiliency of farmland values despite the steep drop in net farm income over the years has allowed farmers to restructure debt and address tight cash flow and liquidity crunches specialty crops fruit nut and vegetable markets will continue to face rising production costs in 2020 due to mounting regulations particularly as they relate to controls over groundwater in california regulations under the state s sustainable groundwater management act are about to go into effect and could potentially cause acreage shifts between crops of varying water needs other government action in 2020 could have a favorable impact on specialty crop growers the farm workforce modernization act currently being debated in congress is a hopeful sign for an improved regulatory environment for agricultural labor if passed it would help ease the tight labor supply plaguing agriculture grain farm supply and biofuels challenges for the grain sector will persist in 2020 fueled by commodity price pressure policy uncertainty and export weakness amid growing global supply abundance especially for corn and soybeans u s wheat producers and exporters though may benefit from an improved export pace in 2020 with the russian wheat crop struggling biofuels also face challenges in 2020 u s ethanol production according to the u s energy information administration is expected to fall by 1 9 in 2019 to 15 8 billion gallons and remain flat in 2020 the outlook for farm supply companies is mixed and continues to be heavily influenced by weather to improve its value proposition this sector is actively pursuing vertical and horizontal consolidation dairy and animal protein with dairy and animal protein production looking toward another year of increased production in 2020 a rebound in exports will be critical to profitability in both sectors per capita consumption of animal protein in the u s will likely set a new record in 2019 overall dairy consumption in the u s will remain strong in 2020 as americans continue eating more cheese and butter but fluid milk will likely continue its long term decline strong demand and rising exports though will not erase financial stress at the farm level producers of beef pork poultry and dairy will likely experience stress from higher feed costs due to lower crop yields this fall rural electricity companies throughout the electricity supply chain are likely to face heightened simultaneous demands for cleaner and less expensive power generation in 2020 these pressures reflect the intense popular concern about climate change wealth and income inequality and slowing economic growth three issues which americans rank as equally important in recent polling in many rural communities these concerns are likely to manifest in more numerous and more vehement calls for greater renewable power generation for utilities the task of justifying multi million dollar expenditures on new renewable resources will be easier in 2020 as the unsubsidized costs of solar wind battery energy storage and flexible natural gas fired resources continue to decline rural communications rural and regional telecommunications operators will become targets in 2020 for investors and strategic buyers as the pool of available mid sized fiber transport companies dries up demand for these companies has been so strong that valuations are reaching levels that were unthinkable a few years ago mergers and acquisition activity in rural markets should be brisk as the growth in data traffic offers attractive returns for investors and opportunities for strategic buyers to gain scale and access to new markets 2020 will also bring the launch of the rural digital opportunity fund the latest broadband incentive program from the federal communications commissions and its largest effort to close the urban rural digital divide
stock market crashes the dow jones has rallied more than 25 in the year to date easily recouping losses from last winter current conditions are eerily similar to that of the circumstances ahead of prior stock market crashes regardless of your view on the market it is important to be aware of the trading risk with current valuations stock market crashes current climate compared to prior conditions the dow jones has enjoyed a remarkable rally in the twilight of 2019 which has put it on pace to recoup losses from the year prior despite trade wars slowing global growth and recession concerns evidently the combined effort of the major central banks has paid off with various stock markets approaching or extending beyond record levels as the market enters a historically bullish time of year thanks to the santa claus rally and january effect many market participants have called for a continuation higher a brief history of major financial bubbles crises and flash crashes but others are hesitant to accept current valuations fearing the market has become complacent and the risks highlighted earlier in the year may still spark a crash with that in mind we can compare the current landscape to the conditions present immediately prior to three of the largest stock market crashes in the last 30 years united states invasion of kuwait and the 1990 stock market crash the stock market crash in 1990 followed the us invasion of kuwait which saw oil prices surge in the lead up economic measures were unremarkable but not to the degree that the subsequent market reaction would suggest upon the invasion in july 1990 the dow jones went on to plummet 18 before october of that same year as oil surged from 16 a barrel to over 40 a barrel source bloomberg asset performances at the time were largely within reason which gave market pundits little reason to suspect a looming disaster the us dollar and gold were lower for the year and stocks were establishing new all time highs crude oil was beginning to show signs of volatility but far from the level of volatility that would follow similarly simple technical analysis of the dow jones at the time reveals little cause for concern trading comfortably above its 50 and 200 day moving averages the dow jones delivered a bullish breakout above 2 800 in mid may 1990 only to fall beneath 2 400 just 5 months later from a technical standpoint one could argue the dow s drive above resistance at 2 800 mirrors the industrial average s recent breakout above 27 600 dow jones price chart daily timeframe january 1989 july 1990 chart 1 dot com crash in the mid 1990 s to 2000 equity markets would be engrossed with technology stocks only for them to come crashing down in early 2000 the result saw the dow jones trade gradually lower for more than two years until it eventually bottomed in october 2002 in the months prior data revealed manufacturing was roaring and job additions were incredibly robust source bloomberg looking to the technical backdrop at the time the dow jones appeared to be on the brink of a breakout higher trading confidently higher since september 1998 the industrial average enjoyed a

terry gross host this is fresh air i m terry gross at democratic presidential debates this year candidates have clashed over health care and specifically over the idea of medicare for all soundbite of montage bernie sanders i who wrote the damn bill if i may say so intend to eliminate all out of pocket expenses all deductibles joe biden and if you notice nobody s yet said how much it s going to cost the taxpayer i hear this large savings elizabeth warren costs are going to go up for giant corporations but for hard working families across this country costs are going to go down and that s how it should work under medicare for all in our health care system george stephanopoulos senator sanders you were involved gross for some perspective on just how a medicare for all is defined by the candidates how it would work what it would cost we turn to sarah kliff an investigative reporter for the new york times she s covered health care policy for the past decade for the washington post and vox and since june for the new york times she spoke with fresh air s dave davies dave davies byline well sarah kliff welcome back to fresh air you know when people hear the term medicare for all i wonder if we re all hearing different things i mean does it mean literally enrolling everyone in the current medicare program or is it sort of a generic term for a single payer government sponsored universal health care sarah kliff i think it is more of the latter at this point i think medicare for all has been thrown around so much in the political debate it essentially means when politicians say it a very generous health care plan for all americans that they will call medicare it s quite different actually from the medicare system that covers seniors right now it would have many more benefits than what seniors are currently enrolled in but it s become this catchall and you see variations like medicare for all who want it or medicare for all who want to sign up it s become it polls very well people like the idea of giving everyone medicare but it s become this catchall phrase for a very generous set of government health insurance plans davies right well let s talk just a little bit about the medicare plan that currently exists for senior citizens a lot of people assume that it s free government insurance not really right kliff no no it s not medicare s a pretty complicated health insurance plan it has three different parts part a for hospitals part b for doctors and d for drugs and different parts come with premiums they come with the co payments that you might be used to from your private insurance there are deductibles many seniors buy private supplemental plans to cover all those costs that you have to pay out of pocket when you re a medicare enrollee and there s certain benefits that are not covered so it is a program that does require seniors to pay a significant amount and you do see some cases particularly with prescription drugs where seniors on medicare are still struggling to afford the medications that they need davies right and part of what you pay is for supplemental insurance for a private insurer but you can also pay i guess the minimum is 135 for the doctor s part of the coverage to the government right and that goes up with income kliff it does go up with income and that s a premium you re going to be paying month after month it s quite similar to the way we pay premiums when we are privately insured now i think if you hear that number right 135 that s significantly less than one would pay for private insurance the hospital part part a does not have a premium so it is a relatively good deal compared to the private market seniors do really like it medicare gets high marks year after year but it certainly does come with some costs and those costs can be a struggle for some seniors to afford davies right and for people who are more affluent it s not 135 it can be substantially more so there are costs kliff yes yes there are definitely seniors you know they get to 65 they ve earned their way into this medicare program but they re still expected to keep chipping in some percentage of the costs that they re accruing through it davies right now senator bernie sanders who of course is a candidate for president i mean he proposes medicare for all as a campaign proposition and he has a bill in congress it would be different from medicare right it would be far more generous kliff it would be far far more generous what bernie sanders envisions is a health care plan that has no co payments no premiums no deductibles you don t pay a single penny when you go to the doctor when you pick up your prescriptions so that is very very different from the current medicare system it s also a much wider range of health care benefits things like glasses and dental prescription drugs those are all worked into the basket of benefits that senator sanders wants to cover so it is a quite more robust more generous than our medicare program more generous than most other countries single payer systems that s really the plan that bernie sanders is talking about when he talks about medicare for all davies right and it s truly free to those who are in it and i guess that s consistent with the notion that health care is a right it shouldn t depend on your ability to pay kliff yeah this is something you know i ve talked to senator sanders about and something i know he feels quite strongly about is the idea that no one should think about money when they re going to the doctor you see other countries that have single payer systems but also ask patients to make small co pays when they go to the doctor maybe five 10 20 senator sanders feels very strongly that that should not happen he doesn t want anyone weighing is this doctor visit worth 5 to me or not so the system he s outlined the system that a number of his other competitors in the presidential primary have endorsed is one where you do not pay anything when you go to the doctor the entire system is financed by tax revenue it is not financed by co payments deductibles or premiums davies and i think a lot of people would think well that s exactly what you know exists in other industrialized countries is it kliff it isn t actually one thing you see in most of our peer countries is some use of co payments this is especially true in european health care systems where you do have to pay a small amount and it s probably smaller than what we re used to here in the states we re not talking 50 or 100 to go to the doctor it s more in like the five to 20 range there are small co payments for prescription drugs and there are certainly exceptions for low income citizens in those countries the one exception is the canadian health care system which i think it s fair to say senator sanders has modeled his bill off of the canadian system does not have any sort of co payment so they re a bit unique in that they ve really influenced health care policy here in the united states the way senator sanders thinks about it in the canadian system everything is financed through tax revenue there are no co payments when you go to i ve seen a canadian hospital s billing office and it s about two people in a room there just isn t much money for them to be handling davies so senator sanders proposes free medical care for everybody in a government sponsored plan and i guess another distinction is whether one would favor the elimination of private insurance carriers that is senator sanders proposal right kliff yes yes there really is not a role for private insurance in the world that senator sanders envisions one of the things his bill would do would bar private insurance companies from offering the same benefits that the public system offers and this is how it works in canada as well you cannot sell a private insurance plan that covers doctor visits senator sanders has said there you know might be some peripheral there might be a few small insurance products left maybe for cosmetic surgery or some things that insurance doesn t cover but there really isn t a market left in the world that he sees and that s a very controversial idea it s one that really tripped up former candidate and senator kamala harris who seemed to be stuck between you know the idea of whether or not to eliminate private insurance because i think there s a lot of frustration with private insurance but also a number of people who ve gotten used to the system that we have and are nervous about switching to a plan run by the government davies and senator warren s views have evolved a bit right on this what s her view of the role of private insurance kliff yeah so she has kind of moved slowly to endorse the idea of eliminating private insurance but she has not been a backer of that position as long as senator sanders my colleagues and i at the new york times recently spent a lot of looking into how senator warren thinks about private insurance and we see this slow evolution from the early 2000s when she was researching bankruptcy at harvard finding a lot of people with medical bankruptcy it was a lot of people who had private insurance and still were bankrupt and that really starts a evolution of her policy position from thinking these private insurers might have a role to her position today which is that we should eliminate the private health insurers but she has been later to come to that it s really been in the last year or so that she has quite vocally made it clear this is how she feels about private insurance that there should not be a role for it in the american health care system davies right but we should also note that she has modified at least the speed at which she would take the country to a medicare for all plan right kliff yes yeah so she initially came out with a plan to pay for medicare for all this was a big deal for her campaign because she was constantly facing questions in the debate about how do you pay for it and where s the money coming from she put that plan out and then a week later followed it up with another plan that says actually i think we should start with a public option we should start by giving people the option to sign up for a medicare plan we i would do that in the first year of my presidency and then pushing back the idea of medicare for all to the third year of her presidency so she has been in an interesting place politically kind of between endorsing medicare for all raising her hands at the debate when they ask if you want to eliminate private insurance but also she sees a slower transition than senator sanders does towards a system that does not have private health insurers davies there have been estimates of the cost of medicare for all what s the range kliff the range they re big numbers and there s a big range so they are all in the trillions and we re talking over the course of the decade how much more money the government would need to raise to run a medicare for all system and the range is from about 20 trillion to 34 trillion so again these are large numbers we re also talking about the entire american health care system over the course of a decade and that s a huge range it s almost you know some of the figures on the larger end are nearly double those on the smaller side davies right and so these would be the cost to the federal government to do this kliff exactly so this is how much more money the government would need beyond what it has right now to provide a government run health care plan to all citizens davies you know i think the reaction of a lot of people who like the idea of universal health coverage to this huge cost is well wait a minute don t we save a ton of money because we don t have armies of insurance companies and brokers and administrators arguing over who gets covered for what and generating all this paper and we don t have the profit that they earn right the government doesn t need to earn a profit so that s a savings and then you know you give people more regular preventative health care and prevent bigger problems and there must be savings there why does it cost a fortune if it s such a rational way to administer health care kliff i think that s a great question what and what i often hear from those who support single payer is that yes the government is going to need to raise more revenue you need more money to provide health insurance to all citizens but you re also getting rid of all that spending on health insurance premiums there s so much money that so many households across the united states are paying for premiums they re paying to get through their deductibles they re paying copayments when they go to the doctor so i think of it less as the government raising a new pot of money but more of a redistribution of who pays and if you look at these cost analyses the ones that suggest the government needs to raise trillions more dollars to run a medicare for all system they often also find that overall health spending will go down for some of the reasons you mentioned there ll be fewer administrative costs there will be less profit margins being picked up at different parts of the health care system so i think it is possible for two things to be true at the same time that the government needs to raise a lot of money to run a medicare for all system but that overall spending will go down but i do think you know to speak to one point you raised about the idea well everyone s going to get preventive care and that s going to lower health care costs that might be true in the long term but there actually and this is something that came up a lot during the affordable care act debate there just isn t great evidence that giving people more access to preventative care lowers costs there s great evidence that it is better for their health to get it but you have to give a lot of people preventative care you have to give a lot of flu vaccines to prevent one case of the flu and you just don t see a lot of evidence in the academic literature finding that this preventative care is a cost saver in a number of cases you actually see when more people get health insurance and there s low cost sharing you don t have pay to go to the doctor health spending actually goes up when something becomes free people use more of it so that s one place where it s a little hard to get cost savings even if you feel like you re doing the right thing by giving people the health care that they need davies right and you do have what something like 30 million uninsured people now who would be getting coverage and that s good but it s not free kliff it is not free and you have a number of people who have insurance but have really high deductibles or copayments so they end up putting off treatment gallup just put out survey data this week that about a quarter of americans with serious health conditions report putting off some part of treatment because of the cost so you think about those folks in a medicare for all system they might be using more health care that s going to drive up some spending even if you have these other mechanisms that are trying to bring down spending davies you know one of the elements of assessing the cost of doing this is figuring out what doctors and hospitals and other providers would be paid and i gather medicare now pays less than private insurers right kliff that s right and i think that is one of the most if not the most crucial question in building a medicare for all plan is how much do you pay the hospitals and doctors because that s really going to determine how much this thing costs and legislators and politicians they re walking this tricky line between wanting to reduce those payments they are looking at data that shows that americans doctors are earning twice what their counterparts earn abroad and thinking we should be able to see some savings there but also not wanting to decimate a health care system that has been built around these really robust payments so they worry about things like hospitals closing because they re not bringing in enough revenue or doctors you know moving into other professions or you know maybe more plausibly younger americans not wanting to go into medicine because they see less of an opportunity to make a good salary and so this is one of the trickiest questions in building a medicare for all system especially in the united states where we have developed a system that runs on really really big payments is how do you scale back payments and how much of a scaling back of payments is possible without creating some access issues for the people who are going to use the new health care system davies sarah kliff covers health care policy for the new york times we will continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air soundbite of rhythm future quartet s iberian sunrise davies this is fresh air and we re speaking with sarah kliff she s an investigative reporter she covers health care policy for the new york times we re talking about medicare for all its role in the presidential campaign what it would exactly mean and what it would cost i remember a series i think it was in the new york times a few years ago about people going to europe for medical procedures and even the cost of travel and staying in nice hotels they saved thousands and thousands tens of thousands over what it would cost to get their operations done in the united states and it made me wonder well how do these european countries control those costs do they simply regulate what providers are paid directly kliff that s exactly you have stumbled on the exact right answer they do regulate what providers are paid so in most european countries and canada you have some kind of central planning board that negotiates with the doctors unions to set payment rates each year one of the things that s really unique about the united states is that there s huge variation in what doctors get paid for different procedures you know i ve written a lot about emergency rooms and imaging and one of the things i see is the prices are all over the map you know i ve seen mris that cost a few hundred dollars i ve seen one mri that costs 25 000 so it s a huge variation and it s not really about how much does the service actually cost it s more of how much can a hospital charge how much market power do they have to charge certain amounts for the services they are providing so what would happen in the united states under a medicare for all system is what happens in other countries there would be federal regulation of health care prices and that s actually what happens in medicare right now the federal government sets the prices that doctors get paid when they treat medicare patients and some version of that would happen for the entire health care system if we had a medicare for all system davies right and so doctors right now accept medicare patients with the understanding they will make less and they will charge their privately insured patients more and be happy kliff right and the question is like how much can you if you re going could you go to medicare prices could you have everyone come in and pay the prices that medicare pays most politicians at this point don t think so if you look at the warren plan for example she s looking at having reimbursement rates that are like 110 120 of what medicare pays a slight bump from the medicare rates i think one thing that s actually really instructive is if you look at a policy that passed in washington state washington state is currently building the first public option and initially they wanted that public option to be cheap and the way they were going to keep it cheap was by paying lower medicare reimbursement rates through the lobbying and negotiation process that public plan is going to be paying 187 of what medicare pays which is actually pretty similar to what private insurance pays and the reason i mentioned that example is i think it s a good it is an instructive version of what happens when you try and tamp down on health care prices there s a lot of interests that want to push them up and keep the prices closer to a private health insurance plan davies right the lawmakers in the state of washington were quite committed to making a low cost affordable public option and what happened were they convinced that hospitals would close or providers would opt out or what happened what was the deciding factor kliff it was more about the politics and getting all the members on board is that they felt like if they wanted to actually pass this public option and not have the hospitals coming after them have enough you know if you think about local legislators often the largest employer in their district is a hospital so they re cognizant of the concerns that they have and i think there are some true concerns about such a quick shock to the health care system if you were to move reimbursement rates to just medicare levels that would be very difficult for hospitals to navigate if you just flipped that switch but there s also a lot of politics at play and so you end up in a situation where there was this ambitious plan to have a government public option that would pay medicare rates instead we end up with one that s paying nearly twice what medicare pays and they estimate premiums for that plan will be about five to 10 percent lower than the premiums for the private plan so a cost savings but not the dramatic one that legislators had hoped for gross we re listening to the interview fresh air s dave davies recorded with sarah kliff an investigative reporter for the new york times focusing on health care after a break she ll talk about how some of the democratic candidates who favor medicare for all propose to pay for the plan and about some of the possible consequences of such a dramatic overhaul of the health care system i m terry gross and this is fresh air soundbite of julian lage s presley gross this is fresh air i m terry gross let s get back to the interview dave davies recorded with sarah kliff an investigative reporter for the new york times focusing on health care they re examining proposals by democrats in the presidential race to create a single payer government run health care system in the country an idea often referred to as medicare for all when they left off they were talking about the challenge of controlling costs in american health care davies you know on the subject of cost i mean i m reminded of a project that you did maybe it was a couple years ago where you solicited emergency room bills and accumulated like 2 000 of them kliff yes davies and you looked at what people were charged for what did you find kliff i found two main things one that the prices were very very hard to find you know the reason i launched that whole project of collecting emergency room bills was that there was no other way to get that information you can t kind of knock on the hospital s door or call their media relations person and ask you know can you send me how much it costs to go to your emergency room they won t provide you with that information the only way that i could get it was by having patients send me bills that have that information the second thing i learned was just the huge variation in costs for very similar things a great example of this is pregnancy tests one of the things i would see is for women who are of reproductive age if you go into the emergency room they will often as part of procedure just test you for pregnancy because that might affect your treatment the price for a pregnancy test in an american emergency room can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars there s one i saw for more than 500 at a georgia emergency room and so the variation is so so so big and that is such a unique feature of the american health care system there is no other developed country where you see something as simple as a pregnancy test having a hundredfold variation depending on which emergency room it s delivered in davies and then there are these facilities charges kliff yeah davies that hit you even if you literally get a band aid and an aspirin right kliff yeah yeah so these are i think of these as like the cover charge for going to the emergency room this is just the price for walking in the door and seeking a service even before the various things they ll charge you you know i wrote about one father who went into the emergency room because he had cut his daughter s finger while clipping her nails he got a band aid and he got a 629 bill for that visit and 622 of that was the facility fee the cover charge for just going there the 7 other dollars was the band aid that they provided and again those charges they vary so much from one facility to another they re not kind of posted on the door when you go to the emergency room the only time you find out your hospital s facility fee is when you get a bill in the mail saying you have to pay that amount davies you know i think most people in when they have a medical problem or an injury are not in any position to ask about or assess prices and they aren t easy to get anyway and when you see this kind of variation i mean does it suggest that we re we really need some regulation that people have this wide wide discretion over what they can charge can kind of get away with whatever they whatever number they pick kliff so i think if you look across the world at our peer countries they certainly have decided that you do need this kind of regulation to run a health care system they think of health care as something akin to a utility like water or electricity something we all need to stay alive and so it s not a normal market so other countries have decided ok because this is such a critical service we are going to regulate it like a utility and we are going to decide what prices get paid and you work this careful balance of paying enough to make sure that those services stay up and running and are high quality but not letting the prices get so high where you end up with situations in the united states where you know people are scared to go to the emergency room or scared to go to the doctor because they don t know how much it costs and they know it can be really expensive so i think certainly the lesson i would take from other countries is that the way to control health care costs and not have this wild variation really seems to run through some kind of government intervention on prices davies if we go to a government sponsored single payer health care system you have all these hospitals that are privately owned many of them in chains with executives who are well compensated does that continue how does does that change kliff i think it probably has to i think you re going to see some hospitals who have built an entire business around the way that they are paid now they build certain wings that they know can bring in the revenue to support them because of how they re reimbursed by private insurance providers so i think if you go to a system where those hospitals are making less especially if they re making significantly less if they re only being reimbursed at medicare rates they re going to have to think about how to run a hospital differently i don t know if it ll be quite as lucrative to be a hospital ceo in a medicare for all system as it is right now so i think it would be a lot of hospitals needing to rethink their business plans particularly i think those that are most vulnerable are those that have a large share of patients who are privately insured if i think of hospitals that are already mostly treating medicare and medicaid patients they ve learned how to get by on lower reimbursement rates they probably cater to some of those services but if you are a hospital that s been used to treating a large share of privately insured patients this will probably a very very big change for you davies you know in other industrialized countries that have single payer systems are the hospitals private led institutions too kliff it varies from country to country if you look at britain for example they ve nationalized their health care system so most of the hospitals there are part of the government the doctors are government employees but then if you look in canada the vast majority of the health care system is private the government is contracting with private doctors private hospitals just as we do in the united states except in canada they re paying them government set rates you know in terms of whether they are a for profit or a nonprofit that s a little harder to figure out right now most american hospitals are actually nonprofits even though they re often bringing in large sums of money so most them do offer operate as nonprofits so i d imagine no one in any of these plans in the sanders plan or the warren plan is talking about nationalizing our doctors and hospitals as they do in britain all of them seem to envision that more like canada we would continue to have privately employed doctors and hospitals serving patients davies so let s talk about how we pay for medicare for all or universal coverage whatever we want to call it how does senator sanders propose to pay for his generous public health care kliff interestingly senator sanders has been the most vocal advocate for single payer he hasn t put out a specific plan that says here s exactly how i would pay for it instead his senate office has released a number of times a set of financing options the things you could use to pay for medicare for all it s often some combination of payroll taxes employer taxes sales tax some kind of different ways to raise money from americans i think one of the things they re especially concerned about is doing this in an equitable way in a way you know especially from senator sanders perspective where the millionaires and billionaires are kicking in more than they are kicking in now so in the sanders world we have a number of options but no specific list of ok this is exactly how i would pay for single payer davies and senator warren kliff so senator warren has put out probably the most definitely the most detailed financing plan among the 2020 candidates where she has a specific combination of payroll taxes employer taxes a few other smaller things to raise revenue to get to the 20 trillion that she believes is necessary to pay for a medicare for all system over the next decade so really it takes away those premiums that most americans are paying it replaces them with new taxes that are going to raise revenue send that over to the government to run this new health care system davies you know when i looked at senator warren s plan and of course she s known for having detailed plans i was it struck me that i sort of expected most of it to be tax the billionaires let s make this fair and that s in there but it doesn t account for the preponderance of the money there are a lot of other things like paying less like assuming you can really drive down the cost of prescription drugs there s it s pretty complex kliff right davies it s a big challenge isn t it yeah kliff there are two levers you can pull right one is the overall cost of the health care system what can we do to get costs down because the more you can bring that number down the less money you need to bring into the government so you see a number and so senator warren worked with donald berwick who used to run medicare in the obama administration to come up with an estimate of what do we think is realistic for what we would need to run this health care system there is a lot of quibbling among academics if the number they came up with is in fact realistic it does rely on some pretty aggressive cuts to prices like we were just talking about you know bringing provider payments much closer to what medicare pays now so you have this question of what does it cost that s the first lever the other lever you can pull on is where does the money come from once you come up with how much it costs you need to fill that hole and i think there s a number of interesting point financing choices that senator warren makes one which i find most interesting and surprised a number of economists that i talked to about it was this idea of essentially requiring employers to pay what they ve been paying in premiums as taxes to the government so whatever a big company has been kicking into their workers health care they have to keep spending that money it s just going to go to the government instead of the instead of going to the private insurers that they re paying now and again like you re saying you know that s not necessarily a tax on billionaires that s premiums that could be going to a lot of middle class workers right now so i think it is interesting how she has spread out some of this revenue but is still able to deliver on her promise of not raising taxes on the middle class which is one of the key things she had said she was going to do with this medicare for all financing plan davies sarah kliff is an investigative reporter covering health policy for the new york times we ll talk more after a short break this is fresh air soundbite of music davies this is fresh air and we re speaking with sarah kliff she s an investigative reporter she covers health policy for the new york times we re talking about medicare for all single payer health systems in the context of the forthcoming presidential campaign you mentioned that the american medical association has typically been against these single payer systems right kliff yes davies what about other providers like nurses i mean some i believe some nurses unions have endorsed sanders plan are other people in the health care system more welcoming of this concept kliff yeah i think they are you know as you mentioned the national nurses united they re a big big supporter of single payer a big supporter of bernie sanders a key advocacy group and you know when i say the ama generally has opposed single payer i think i often hear from a number of doctors who say hey well the ama doesn t speak for me you know i m a doctor and i d rather practice in a single payer system i think you see especially among primary care doctors you see stronger support for single payer than you do among some of the more high paid specialties like anesthesiology or orthopedics so i think you know doctors they are represented the ama is the largest lobby for doctors but they re not a homogenous group they are a large group of people with a wide variety of opinions on health care and you can certainly find a number of doctors you know particularly those affiliated with physicians for a national health program which is a group of doctors who support single payer there s a number of them who would prefer to practice in a system like what they have in canada davies you know a lot of people are aware that americans as a society spend more of our gross national product we spend more on health care than other industrialized countries yet get poorer outcomes you know we trail in all kinds of indicia of health does that suggest that there s just there s a lot of savings to be found if we go to universal health care kliff i think it does suggest there s significant savings we could get if we were to go to universal health care i think the question to me is could we have health care prices in the united states that look like canada s i don t know if we can get that low you know we have spent decades building a health care system that looks very very different from our peer countries and we are starting from a very different place than where they were when they built their universal health care system decades ago so i think there is certainly space for health care savings you know one of the most obvious to me is the massive amount of administrative costs that we have in the united states that do not exist in other countries that seems like some pretty low hanging fruit if we switch to universal coverage and i think the question is like well how much then can you reduce prices that s trickier work and then the trickiest of all is how much can you improve health outcomes in the process i think one of the things you see in our health care system is there is a decent amount of spending that s just not doing anyone much good whether it s care that s unneeded or an mri that s priced at 25 000 we often spend a lot of money on things that are not getting the value we would want what you see in other countries is more centralized planning of what are the things that we want to invest in that we feel like are going to make our population healthier we don t really think in that kind of centralized big picture way in the united states davies you know if we were to get a single payer system and administration was centralized in the central government it stands to reason that a lot of companies would go out of business i mean you know all these brokers and third party administrators and private insurers and presumably that would save a lot of money it might also put a lot of people out of work have the analyses of these proposals taken that into account kliff i don t think any of the analyses have made estimates of how many people would be put out of work but i agree with you that s actually something that would need to be thought about is what do you do with all these people who work in all these you know back offices of health care the people who code the medical bills and the people who negotiate with health insurers and the representatives for pharmaceutical companies who are going out to doctor offices there s this whole infrastructure of health care that you know other countries did not have to confront when they built their universal systems in the 1940s and 50s we re starting at a different place we re starting from a much much much more robust health care system that is employing millions of americans so this has been mentioned a little bit here and there in the debates when candidates talk about these issues but i have not seen a specific retraining program or specific ideas for what industries these people would go in to and i think it s one of the hard things about health care is when you look at job growth in the united states one of the areas that s reliably growing when you see good employment reports is employment in health care it is such an engine for getting people jobs so you have this kind of catch 22 of if you want to reduce health care costs you re going to need to pay fewer people in that space but those are you know from one person s view those are administrative costs from another person s views that s you know a job that s paying them a real salary davies right although i guess you d also have to hire more people to take care of the 30 million uninsured americans who would be getting better health care kliff yes yes so there are opportunities you know opportunity that we have a real need for elder care and home health aides some industries that currently do not pay very well but if they were incorporated into a national program might become a robust area with jobs so there may be some areas in the new health system that are providing jobs to some of the people who worked in the old health system davies you know sarah kliff before we let you go i kind of want to get a big picture view from you you know this debate over expanded health coverage occurs at a particularly contentious moment in american history i mean a bitter partisan divide a president who s under an impeachment inquiry what do you think the chances are that all of this will result in a significant expansion of health care coverage kliff i think the safe bet in washington and on health care is generally against action it takes a very very long time to push through a new government health care program you know we had medicare and medicaid created in 1965 and then you don t see another major expansion of health care up until 2010 when the affordable care act comes into place you might also count in 2003 medicare did add a drug benefit but that s essentially three examples of government insurance expansions over the span of decades and decades so this work is slow and it takes time to build the consensus around it that being said the one thing that might be a little different right now is how burdened american families feel by health care costs i spend a lot of my time talking to patients who are struggling with medical bills and many of these people have health insurance but they have such a high deductible that they re unable to pay their bills so i think the fact that you have so many americans who are not able to pay their bills who are going into collections who are getting sued by their hospitals and getting their wages garnished because they have fallen behind on their medical debt that s a pretty motivating factor for legislators and it is a if there is a reason to think medicare for all might happen in the short term horizon i think it s because of how expensive our health care system has gotten and how unaffordable it is for a lot of americans right now davies well sarah kliff thanks so much for speaking with us again kliff yeah thank you for having me gross sarah kliff is an investigative reporter for the new york times focusing

usd jpy has broken higher amid trade headlines and the fed decision final us gdp a rate decision in japan and sino american relations are eyed usd jpy near december high 110 00 next critical fibonacci resistance this week in usd jpy trade hopes boosted the pair jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve has doubled down on dovish comments regarding his triggers for changing interest rates he seems skeptical about inflation which remained stable in november with core consumer prices remaining steady at 2 3 yearly powell first wants to see prices rising significantly and persistently before hiking on the other hand an outlook that shows deteriorating future economic conditions would be sufficient to cut borrowing costs this asymmetry means the fed chair tends to lower rates a dovish bias powell made similar comments in october but the reaction was muted by reaffirming this stance the world s most powerful central bank sent stocks higher and the dollar lower as markets expect a rate cut despite the fed signaling a long pause after three consecutive cuts the bank left rates unchanged and the dot plot foresees no changes to policy throughout 2020 however usd jpy has remained confined to familiar ranges finally soaring on trade war related headlines us president trump tweeted thursday that a big deal was very close news agencies later reported that the trade deal was done and only needed trump s signature sending the pair to the 109 50 region the pair further advanced with the outcome of the uk election as boris jonhson s victory spurred risk appetite the usd jpy pair neared december high at 109 72 before correcting lower as hopes cooled a bit with chinese authorities announcing a deal is not yet done hopes prevail although it will depend on whatever these countries say next and if the us would snap more tariffs on china during the weekend or not in japan the final read of gross domestic product surprised with an increase to 0 4 quarterly growth in the third quarter better than initially reported us events us gdp additional trade headlines the economic calendar is packed with indicators in the last full week of the year markit s preliminary purchasing managers indexes stand out early in the week contrary to the ism pmis markit s figures have shown that both the manufacturing and services sectors are growing at a slow pace housing figures have been on the rise in recent months and tuesday s building permits and housing starts for november are projected to show a consolidation at higher levels thursday s existing home sales data is also expected to reflect stability the industrial output may rebound after a significant 0 8 drop in october the best is kept for last with the final read of third quarter gross domestic product on friday the second read of third quarter gdp surprised with an upward revision to 2 1 and that estimate may be confirmed now apart from the headline investors will examine the composition of growth how dependent the us economy is on the consumer and if the investment is recovering the university of michigan s final consumer sentiment index read for december will have the last word of the week as some traders take a weeklong christmas holiday here are the top us events as they appear on the forex calendar japan decision time for the boj the japanese yen moves primarily on global market sentiment which is mostly driven by trade talks other geopolitical issues such as north korea s escalating rhetoric are also eyed however the upcoming week features a top tier japanese event that may also trigger yen volatility the bank of japan is set to leave the interest rate unchanged at 0 1 once again but perhaps hint new stimulus in 2020 the tokyo based institution wants to push meager inflation higher but is wary of cutting rates further in negative territory hurting commercial bank s profits inflation figures for november will follow the boj s decision but they are likely to be shrugged off by markets that already have the tokyo region s statistics for last month here are the events lined up in japan usd jpy technical analysis dollar yen is holding near its december high which is also a six month high that said a break through the high will put the 110 00 figure in the bullet s eye weekly basis the pair is just a handful of pips below the 100 and 200 sma both converging in the 109 80 region technical indicators continue to lack directional strength but holding within familiar levels above their midlines the daily chart shows that the pair conquered the 20 and 200 dma both around 109 00 proving support the momentum and the relative strength index are at fresh multi week highs but the strength upward is limited resistance awaits at the december high of 109 75 ahead of the critical 110 00 figure next we find 110 65 held the pair down in may and it is followed by 111 05 also from the same period 111 65 and 112 45 are next support comes at 109 00 followed by this month s low at 108 39 it seems unlikely that the pair could break below this last unless the trade war gets a turn to the worst in which case the next bearish target comes at 107 75 a swing low from october and then by 107 which provided support in september and capped it in august 106 50 105 75 and 105 05 are next usd jpy sentiment poll the fxstreet forecast poll indicates that the market is seeing the usd jpy extending its advance within range bulls took over the weekly perspective currently at 77 leading also in the monthly view although decreasing to 41 bears take the lead in the quarterly view with 40 in the three cases however the pair is seen above 109 00 on average the overview chart shows that the bullish momentum is building up as the moving averages resumed their advances heading firmly north in the monthly and quarterly perspectives both are standing at multi month highs confirming higher highs are likely in the days to come those betting for a bearish case in the longer run are fewer although their targets lower weighing on the average related forecasts

in this era it looks like interest rates are likely to fluctuate around historically low levels poloz s comments came after canada shed approximately 71 000 jobs in november which pushed up the unemployment rate to 5 9 per cent poloz though said the one labour report had not dented the bank of canada s confidence in the domestic economy in view of the ambiguity of recent data on target

it s ten days short of three and a half years since the british voted by 52 48 to leave the european union the result led to the immediate resignation of prime minister david cameron and knocked the value of the pound dropping it from the 10 year average of around 1 60 to a low of 1 20 in the uncertainty during the months leading up to yesterday s election the currency once again tested those depressed levels as some punters projected a victory for a coalition led by labour party leader jeremy corbyn who campaigned on introducing hard left ideology sure to adversely impact the uk economy the pound rose strongly in the wake of this morning s news of a historic realignment of british politics where many working class seats have switched across to the conservative party whose leader boris johnson has the mandate to enact brexit next month the south african rand is also firmer on anticipation of improved prospects for one of its major trading partners the currency jumping over 30c against the us dollar from tuesday s pre poll level alec hogg it s that time of year where young immature minds believed that a grey haired bearded man would bring them lots of free gifts meanwhile everyone else voted for boris johnson paul o sullivan founder forensics for justice boris johnson s next brexit steps get it done then define it by joe mayer bloomberg boris johnson s election victory will allow him to get brexit done he now has to decide what it means in practice the size of his parliamentary majority gives johnson a free rein to take britain out of the european union in january after almost four years of gridlock the decisive win means he can also define britain s future relationship with the eu congratulations to boris johnson on his great win britain and the united states will now be free to strike a massive new trade deal after brexit this deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the e u celebrate boris donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 13 2019 beyond repeatedly telling voters he wants to get brexit out of the way in order to proceed with his domestic agenda johnson was notably reticent during the campaign about what it will mean in practice once britain leaves he will first need to strike a trade deal with the eu by the end of 2020 also read uk election boris smashes corbyn who resigns pound surges as tories grab majority brexit next month if johnson wants access to the bloc s single market he will have to give up control in some areas in particular taxation labour and environmental standards hard liners in his party are likely to object to that and push for a clean break at the end of the year but a big majority could allow him to marginalise them and cut a deal that keeps the uk more closely aligned with the eu at stake is what kind of country britain will be in a decade s time one that looks much like any other eu country or another in which it looks something like singapore with a lower tax and lightly regulated economy johnson s premiership will be defined by these tensions whatever happens brexit won t be done by jan 31 here are the next steps for johnson pass the withdrawal agreement bill january 2020 lawmakers return to parliament on dec 17 and johnson will want to move rapidly to enact the withdrawal agreement bill the formal legislation taking britain out of the eu first though he will have to pass a queen s speech proving he has the confidence of the house of commons so the brexit law may have to wait until the new year given all his candidates have promised to support the legislation johnson is unlikely to face obstacles in the commons convention dictates that the unelected house of lords refrains from blocking policies that are included in party manifestos but brexit has shown past practice can count for little johnson will need to steer the legislation through parliament before jan 31 otherwise britain would crash out of the eu without any agreement in place then the country will enter a transition period during which time almost all eu rules will continue to apply it will feel like nothing has changed negotiate the eu trade deal spring summer 2020 johnson s focus will then turn to negotiating a new trade relationship with the eu he will be working against the clock having just 11 months to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement a process which normally takes several years first he will need to hold a parliamentary vote on his negotiating objectives he may face pressure here from the hard liners in his own party who yearn for the freedom to diverge from eu standards then he will need to appoint a negotiating team the eu will also need to agree its negotiating mandate before talks start getting these approvals will eat into the transition period the contradiction johnson will have to resolve in the trade is his desire for both autonomy from eu rules and access to the single market the eu has indicated it is willing to give britain a zero tariff zero quota deal on condition the uk doesn t become a lightly regulated singapore on thames the eu is also likely to take a tough line on key priorities for big member states like france and spain expect to hear more on access to fishing waters and the status of gibraltar the tiny british territory to which madrid lays claim decide on extending the transition period july 2020 the uk and the eu have until july 1 to decide whether to extend the transition period by up to a further two years if both sides need more time for negotiations the conservatives ruled out extending the transition in their manifesto even though trade experts say completing a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2020 is highly unlikely that leaves open the risk that britain could still crash out without a trade agreement in place but with his majority johnson could just decide to extend the transition period trade negotiations continue autumn winter 2020 if the transition isn t extended the uk and the eu will face an intense six months to finalise a deal the danger for johnson in this period is that he will come under pressure to cede to the eu s demands in areas such as fishing and food standards in order to avoid crashing out without a deal ivan rogers the uk s former ambassador to the eu warned in a lecture in november the house of commons will have to approve the future relationship agreement each of the eu s 27 national parliaments as well the eu parliament itself will have to ratify it too the start of a new relationship january 2021 the first day of 2021 should mark the start of the uk s relationship with the eu either a future relationship deal will be in place or the uk will default to trading with the eu on basic world trade organisation terms this would look much like a no deal brexit for johnson the risk is this timetable slips allowing brexit to go on sucking the oxygen out of political debate his bet is that the logistics of negotiating a trade deal prove far less controversial than the act of leaving itself visited 238 times 1 visit s today

capitals and as many c suites as possible in the weeks and months ahead we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discreet gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in calgary poloz imagines where canada could end up years from now as digital technology protectionist politics and unprecedented levels of debt converge to generate forces that will be unfamiliar to executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid shit along the way this topic reflects my concern that we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us poloz wrote in the new paper by

content by way of example poloz mentioned hurdle rates the return on an investment that executives require to justify the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic growth now and it means that the economic potential of our economies will grow more slowly over the long term as well poloz has bought into the notion that we are in the early stages of an industrial revolution akin to the eras created by the steam engine electrification and the computer chip it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern the previous three industrial revolutions ended in misery as euphoria over the possibilities fuelled asset price bubbles that brought calamity when they burst but canada s central bank governor is a techno optimist even if some professions vanish overall employment always trends higher he also observes that policy makers have been getting better at managing the economy the third industrial revolution computer chips ended with the great recession a terrible outcome and yet an improvement on the depression of the 1930s advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content poloz said central banks and others have studied the mistakes of the past few decades and have adjusted their approaches accordingly that doesn t mean there will never be another big recession but it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast if policy mistakes were the trigger for previous recessions and policy makers have learned how to limit such mistakes then it s conceivable the current expansion could extend longer than those that have come before in poloz s previous paper he said the productivity gains from ai should allow central banks to leave interest rates relatively low for longer because inflation will remain contained that would help cushion the bumpy transition to a new economy in other words if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast a more likely cause would be debt at almost 180 per cent of disposable income canada s household debt will be a vulnerability for a long time arguably for a generation or at least until mom and dad leave behind their real estate and savings to help millennials pay off their debts poloz said advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the burden is manageable as servicing costs are reasonably low still the weight of it could cause voters and their elected representatives to seek ways to lighten the load poloz warned that a renewed tolerance for inflation could emerge something for which markets appear ill prepared we should at least consider the possibility of a confluence of incentives between indebted households and indebted governments to tolerate another inflationary episode like that of the late 1970s and 1980s poloz said financial markets appear to be attaching very low weight to this risk today poloz stressed that he could be wrong about where the arc of history is headed but his thinking makes for a good frame for bank of canada policy canadian policy makers surprised many on bay street by leaving interest rates unchanged this year as almost every other central bank cut one reason for the disconnect appears to be that the central bank is taking inflation more seriously than investors and yet poloz has sent a clear signal that he s comfortable letting the economy run a little hotter than rules designed for a pre revolutionary economy might allow in a way he s showing us we needn t fear the future call it a parting gift email kcarmichael nationalpost com twitter carmichaelkevin article content share this

september in his press conference chairman powell kept a positive though more subdued tone about the us economy his comment that the fed would not raise rates until it saw a significant and persistent increase in inflation was unusual and unexpected the fed s attention to inflation since the financial crisis has been almost exclusively rhetorical price gains have been below the fed s 2 target for most of the past decade and there is no reason to expect this to change powell s notice combined with the lack of gdp improvement in the fed estimates was the source for the subsequent dollar weakness

technical outlook the restrained range this week left the usd cad technical apparatus essentially unchanged though the pair is now at the lower end of the three week range rather than near the upper

the dollar canada only closed above the upper limit at the very beginning and the very end of the period the next resistance is minor at 1 3525 just above the may high close the december 2018 high at 1 3685 is not a resistance level as it was a product of the extremely limited end of year liquidity common each december likewise the brief high at 1 3800 in june 2017 and the spike to above 1 4600 in january 2016 are both too long ago and too short to provide reference technical support and resistance lines are indicators of historical price action they provide signs of trading interest at their

retail sales increased less than expected in november as americans cut back on discretionary spending despite a strong labour market raising fears the economy was slowing a bit faster than anticipated in the fourth quarter the report from the commerce department on friday bucked a recent raft of fairly upbeat data on the labour market housing trade and manufacturing that had suggested the economy was growing at a moderate speed in spite of headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth the federal reserve on wednesday kept interest rates steady and signalled that borrowing costs were likely to remain unchanged at least through next year amid expectations the economy would continue to grow modestly and the unemployment rate remain low just as the fed was in the middle of a victory dance convinced they have returned the economy to a position of strength after just three rate cuts the consumer waves a red flag said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel in chicago any signs the consumer is waning could have sizably negative consequences for growth at year end and into next year retail sales rose 0 2 per cent last month data for october was revised up to show retail sales increasing 0 4 per cent instead of climbing 0 3 per cent as previously reported november s sales gains were meagre despite reports from retailers of brisk black friday business some economists blamed a late thanksgiving this year compared to 2018 which pushed cyber monday shopping into december the late thanksgiving could also have thrown off the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data holding back sales economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales would accelerate 0 5 per cent in november compared to november last year retail sales increased 3 3 per cent excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales edged up 0 1 per cent last month after rising by an unrevised 0 3 per cent in october these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the economy even accounting for the thanksgiving related distortions retail sales have slowed considerably after rising by an average of 0 7 per cent per month in the first eight months of this year economists believe sales are cooling as wage growth has stalled despite the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century as we have been asking is this just noise or an early sign that cracks in the strong consumer story are starting to form said michelle girard chief u s economist at natwest markets in stamford connecticut we are watchful it is the latter consumer spending grew at a 2 9 per cent annualized rate in the third quarter november s slim gain in core retail sales left economists to expect that consumer spending would rise at around a 2 0 per cent rate in the fourth quarter but slowing consumer spending is boosting inventories at retailers which could limit the downside to fourth quarter gdp growth ebbing trade tensions in a separate report on friday the commerce department said retail inventories excluding autos which go into the calculation of gdp increased 0 7 per cent in october after rising 0 2 per cent in september growth estimates for the fourth quarter now range from as low as a 1 3 per cent rate to as high as a 2 0 per cent pace the economy grew at a 2 1 per cent pace in the third quarter economists did not expect a de escalation in trade tensions between the united states and china to materially change the outlook for the economy in 2020 arguing that it would take a long time to reverse the damage caused by the 17 month trade war on sectors like manufacturing and agriculture president donald trump and chinese officials said on friday they had agreed to a phase one trade deal that included cutting u s tariffs on chinese goods stocks on wall street were mixed in volatile trade with investors confused on the status of the u s china deal the dollar fell against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose it is unlikely that the so called phase one agreement with china will change things significantly in the short run said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania there is little expectation that the next phase where the real deals are supposed to be made will happen and if they do when that would be the case last month auto sales increased 0 5 per cent after rising 1 0 per cent in october higher gasoline prices

washington the united states and china said they agreed to the details of the first phase of a broader trade agreement in a move that will see the u s reduce tariffs and at least temporarily calm fears of an escalating trade war between the world s two largest economies the deal announced hinges on china increasing purchases of american farm goods such as soybeans and pork and making new commitments on intellectual property and currency speaking to reporters in washington president donald trump said he expects china s agriculture buying to hit 50 billion annually pretty soon without specifying a timetable in return trump agreed to reduce some existing u s tariffs halving 15 duties on 120 billion of imports but maintaining a 25 levy on some 250 billion of chinese goods he said he would also delay new import taxes set to take effect on sunday on 160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys this is an amazing deal for all thank you trump said in a series of tweets that came as chinese officials announced the deal at a late night press conference in beijing advertisement the s p 500 index swung between gains and losses while the dollar fluctuated with treasuries as neither side delivered enough details to calm investors who sent stocks to records thursday on reports fresh tariffs due sunday have been averted washington and beijing have been in trade war for almost two years with involving nearly 500 billion in products shipped between the two nations hit by tit for tat tariffs that mixed market reaction reflected the fact that details of the deal remained murky the text agreed by the two sides comprises nine chapters includes sections on intellectual property forced technology transfer food and agricultural products finance currency and transparency boosting trade bilateral assessment and dispute resolution chinese officials said in beijing while it had been agreed chinese officials said the text still needed to undergo a review by lawyers on both sides a normal step for trade agreements u s tariffs would be rolled back in stages they said ning jizhe the vice chairman of the national development and reform commission stressed that increased agricultural purchases must comply with world trade organization rules expanding china u s trade will not affect interests of other trading partners he said u s trade representative robert lighthizer said in a statement the agreement also included an enforcement mechanism though it wasn t detailed the interim deal with china which was announced as impeachment proceeding against trump progressed in congress on friday offers a short term political victory for the president and will allow him to claim that his tariffs have paid dividends it was hailed by trump supporters in congress as well as some former u s officials who had tried their own hand at negotiating with china this is the first bilateral trade deal in 20 years it was hard fought hard won and long overdue said hank paulson the former u s treasury secretary while the issues between the u s and china extend far beyond trade this is a first step toward completing a comprehensive trade agreement democrats criticized the deal with senate minority leader chuck schumer saying trump sold out for a temporary and unreliable promise from china to purchase soybeans what bloomberg s economists say the latest tariff adjustments are not large enough to impact bloomberg economics headline growth forecast for 2020 which remains at 2 0 however to the extent these measures improve businesses willingness to make capital investment the indirect impact could be significantly larger the deal puts off negotiations over issues such as china s vast web of industrial subsidies and the behavior of its state owned companies that have been longstanding american complaints and will prompt questions over whether the deal has been worth the cost carl riccadonna andrew husby and eliza winger are economist at bloomberg economics business groups immediately called for more negotiations on future phases to get under way this is an encouraging first phase that puts a floor under further deterioration of the bilateral relationship u s china business council president craig allen said in a statement but this is just the beginning the issues facing the u s and china are complex and multi faceted they are unlikely to all be resolved quickly phase two trump said on friday that negotiations on a second phase of the agreement would begin immediately china would like to see the tariffs off and we re ok with that he told reporters but they ll be used as a negotiating table for the phase two deal which they would like to start immediately and that s ok with me but many analysts remain skeptical that trump will be able to conclude those talks on those more intractable issues before the november 2020 election chinese officials have privately expressed skepticism that progress can be made past phase one as have some u s business leaders that has raised questions about the effectiveness of trump s strategy and the tariffs that he has rolled out in a way not seen since the 1930s despite the deal announced on friday some analysts did suggest that the limited scale of the deal may help trump weather criticism of it from china hawks and others and therefore contribute to the fragile peace holding the reason the president insisted phase 2 will start immediately is phase 1 is very small said derek scissors a china expert at the american enterprise institute who has advised the trump administration the positive side is that a small deal implemented slowly is much more likely to hold through the election versus a seemingly big deal falling apart deal pressure both trump and chinese president xi jinping have been under domestic political pressure to get at least a partial deal as a result of the impact of the trade war on both both the u s and chinese economies this year many economists have pinned forecasts for a global economic rebound next year on a cease fire china s gross domestic product rose 6 in the third quarter from a year earlier the slowest pace since the early 1990 the u s is showing signs of downshifting too with a record long expansion weakening to a crawl this quarter as tariffs spread uncertainty across manufacturers and others whose supply lines run through china that damage has put particular pressure on trump who is pinning hopes for re election next year on a solid economy that boasts the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s he campaigned in 2016 promising to revive american s decaying manufacturing base a sector that s been among the most disrupted by tariffs shawn donnan miao han and jenny leonard are reporters for bloomberg news

how much do you trust political figures totally mostly somewhat hardly not at all do the ends justify the means yes often sometimes rarely never should freedom of speech and expression be limited in any way yes for threats libel slander hate speech or criticism of government yes for threats libel slander or hate speech yes for threats libel or slander yes for yelling fire in a crowded theater no how do you feel about taxes they re too low for the rich taxes are the price we pay to live in a free country they re about right they re too high income tax is unconstitutional and should be repealed taxation is theft should discrimination be tolerated in the workplace no not on the basis of race sex age sexual orientation or gender preference anti discrimination laws should be vigorously enforced and quotas imposed no not on the basis of race or sex anti discrimination laws should be enforced no not on the basis of race or sex but anti discrimination laws go too far if they lead to affirmative action no not on the basis of race or sex but the means should be moral suasion not government intervention yes for any reason such as building a cohesive corporate culture firms that discriminate for economically irrational reasons will go out of business anti discrimination laws often create conflict and lead to unintended consequences how big a problem is wealth inequality major problem that requires significant taxes on wealth major problem but not easy to remedy minor problem there are more pressing concerns minor problem the cure is worse than the disease non problem that will destroy the economy if pursued aggressively are big companies like amazon and google becoming monopolies yes we should break them up yes regulate them more not sure no there s still plenty of competition as long as they re not putting a gun to anyone s head who cares we shouldn t be punishing successful entrepreneurs who should be responsible for k 12 education education is too important to be left to parents education is a basic human right and responsibility parents and government with public schools available to all and federal government needed to establish standards parents and government with public schools and emphasis on local control parents but the government still has a role in making sure parents educate their children either privately including homeschooling or with government issued vouchers shut down the department of education education is too important to be left to government bureaucrats all education should be private and voluntary charity will fill the void for those in need who are your favorite presidents lincoln wilson and fdr because they led in times of crisis lbj jfk and obama because they were progressive visionaries washington and reagan because they were charismatic conservative leaders jefferson cleveland and coolidge because they avoided trouble and paid down debt william h harrison because he died just 31 days into his term was lincoln justified in waging the civil war yes on the grounds of abolishing slavery preserving the union and majority rule yes on the grounds of abolishing slavery and preserving the union yes but lincoln went too far in jailing dissidents while union generals like sherman went too far in harming civilians no the south should have been allowed to secede on the basis of self determination no lincoln was a calculating politician who snuffed out any limited government impulses and ushered in an era of big government and total war what caused the great depression wild speculation led to the 1929 crash fdr s new deal and world war ii got the country out of depression the federal reserve made the mistake of sitting idly by while the money supply contracted sharply in the early 1930s wild speculation led to the crash but fdr s new deal spending went too far and possibly prolonged the depression fdr s new deal turned a garden variety recession into the country s worst depression aggressive money printing by the fed caused a fake boom in the 1920s while unprecedented monetary and fiscal intervention in the economy by both hoover and fdr exacerbated and prolonged the depression what do you think about fdr s social security plan enacted in 1935 master stroke that kept many seniors out of soup lines should be expanded and benefits means tested good idea but needs to be shored up not expanded it made sense at the time but didn t take into account people living longer very concerned it should ve been kept small available only to those most in need massive ponzi scheme that will fuel generational conflict and likely bankrupt the country which of these services should be provided by government roads schools courts national defense medical care roads schools courts national defense schools courts national defense courts national defense none which of these wars should the u s government have avoided none vietnam war vietnam war iraq war vietnam war iraq war world war i vietnam war iraq war world war i world war ii how do you feel about the military heroes rooting out evil around the globe and defending our freedoms at home we need to increase defense spending and create more jobs doing heroic work but we re reaching limits on how much we can afford to spend on defense we should maintain a strong military presence abroad but pull out of quagmires like iraq and afghanistan we could easily cut defense spending in half by shutting down bases and bringing our men in uniform home the military industrial complex is kicking over hornet s nests around the globe bankrupting the country feeding the government parasite and threatening our freedoms at home in the process dismantle the empire and ultimately privatize defense where do you stand on the large trade deficit with china use all means possible to reduce this even military force as a last resort raise tariffs and apply political pressure on the chinese to enforce intellectual property rights use diplomacy avoid any restrictions on free trade and enforce intellectual property rights statistical nonsense trade is mutually beneficial encourage more by removing all tariffs and other trade impediments what do you think about trade embargoes with countries like iran cuba and north korea these are our enemies starve them into submission limit trade and any foreign aid to food and medicine allow government vetted tourism and limited trade allow unlimited tourism and limited trade end all embargoes regardless of the regime in power and allow our citizens to trade with and visit these countries without government interference how does it make you feel when a large multinational company builds a factory in a poor country and hires workers at well below american wages sick to my stomach this is capitalism at its worst big business exploiting the poor who have few options i see where these companies are providing slightly better opportunities for these poor workers but why don t they do more to help them greed mixed emotions american consumers are benefitting from the lower prices but some americans are losing their jobs pretty good actually everyone benefits foreign workers the company and its shareholders and american consumers in addition to the win win win of foreign workers shareholders and consumers the world is becoming more interconnected and less bellicose these companies should be applauded what should the role of the federal reserve be smooth out the business cycle and prevent a systemic collapse i e a run on the bank focus on avoiding deflation keeping inflation at 1 2 i have no strong opinion but probably prevent depressions minimal role should be audited and severely limited in its scope should be abolished the fed serves special interests on wall street and creates the boom bust cycle misallocates capital and causes inflation in the process what are your thoughts on health care should be a basic human right with medical services provided by government for everyone there should be private health care for those who can afford it and public health care for those who can t government should provide more assistance system has its flaws but it s still the best in the world no need for major changes litigation reform and repealing state laws that mandate unnecessary insurance coverage would make health care more affordable system is a mess thanks to government intervention get rid of medicare medicaid licensing laws and costly malpractice lawsuits and allow the free market to work its magic what are your thoughts about climate change global warming will reach crisis proportions within a decade we need a massive world government response in order to save us this is a serious problem that must be dealt with but i fear giving up our sovereignty to a world government bring on the green new deal i m concerned but fear the issue has been politicized we need less hysteria and more balance this is an overreaction global warming isn t happening global warming may or may not happen but that doesn t warrant impoverishing ourselves with world government solutions costing trillions of dollars the free market is the best way to adapt to any changes in climate how do you feel about legalizing drugs no way drug use and addiction would explode legalize marijuana but regulate and tax it heavily start with the least dangerous drugs and go from there legalize all narcotics but keep the fda legalize all drugs and abolish the fda where do you stand on intellectual property rights patents trademarks copyright necessary to promote innovation necessary but sometimes goes too far in need of reform leads to frivolous lawsuits and in need of major overhaul restricts competition and should be abolished where do you stand on the constitution too confining and gets in the way of governing living document that should bend with the times adaptable but should be rigid when guaranteeing certain personal freedoms should be but hasn t been interpreted literally and faithfully betraying the limited government vision of the founders nice try but opened the door to high taxation and big government what are your impressions of democratic government ideal way to govern and protect our freedoms will of the majority should prevail great idea system of checks and balances was put in to prevent abuse of the minority by the majority doesn t work quite as well in practice as in theory still it s the best system of government man has come up with so far founders feared democracy and tried to limit government tyranny of the
