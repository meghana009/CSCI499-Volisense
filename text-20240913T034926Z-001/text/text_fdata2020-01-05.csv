president muhammadu buhari by our reporters president muhammadu buhari cross section of nigerians interrogated president muhammadu buhari s claim of progress in economy security infrastructure and other key areas in his new year letter saying the country did not fare better in 2019 they said the current state of the sectors requires the declaration of a state of emergency instead of what they described as lip service read also armed with statistics of nigeria s place in various human development reports cross section of the people urged buhari to stop what they termed self glorification and appreciate the real dangers facing the country in critical sectors real dangers the president had in the message titled nigeria s decade pointed at gains and ongoing efforts in economy rail transport security infrastructure power agriculture and electoral process but nigerians of different classes in their response told sunday vanguard that the president s claims that policies in those areas are working are inaccurate economy policies working on economy buhari said our policies are designed to promote genuine balanced growth that delivers jobs and rewards industry our new economic advisory council brings together respected and independent thinkers to advise me on a strategy that champions inclusive and balanced growth and above all fight poverty and safeguard national economic interests a good example of commitment to this inclusive growth is the signing of the african continental free trade area and the creation of the national action committee to oversee its implementation and ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to allow us to fully capitalise on regional and continental markets however those who spoke to sunday vanguard had different opinions do not take more loans mailafia a former deputy governor central bank of nigeria cbn dr obadiah mailafia warned against continuing with current approaches to economic realities 84 4 billion he said in a matter of five years our national debt has ballooned from 10 billion to a staggering 84 4 billion and we do not have much to show for it i would be wary of taking more debt without these guardrails of financial discipline some of us were involved in the paris debt negotiations in 2005 2006 that saw our debt cleaned up by the club of international creditors at that time our external debt was about 36 billion even then it was a heavy burden on our public finances we were spending something like 5 billion on debt servicing alone in the deal that we negotiated with the paris club we paid back something of the order of magnitude of 20 billion for the rest to be written off i was acting for the central bank governor at the time and i recall signing the cheque for the first tranche of 7 5 billion public finances when i signed the cheque i caught fever immediately and had to have bed rest i could not fathom coughing out such a staggering amount to pay off some rich people in the advanced industrial countries it was a necessary surgical operation but i felt the pain to the innermost marrow of my bones i know what debt peonage is even the western powers later regretted letting us off the hook the paris club settlement broadened the fiscal space for us to re launch our economic development process without the harsh imf and world bank conditionalities those who love our country and cherish our economic freedom and our very sovereignty as a country must be careful not to take that dangerous route again dangerous route as matters currently stand we are already spending 50 percent of our annual revenues in servicing our national debt if a few variables undergo adverse changes we could find ourselves in real difficulty if for example our exchange rate falls with the dollar we could find the debt compounding and if oil prices fall again we would find things even more difficult in terms of capacity to repay our loans it is therefore evident that incurring additional loans especially in the staggering amount being reported will complicate our public finances the more doomsday scenario if we are currently using 50 percent of our revenues just to pay back our loans you can deduce that taking another 30 billion will take our total debt outlay to about 114 billion as you know we derive 50 percent of all our public revenues from oil and the same product accounts for 94 percent of all our foreign earnings this means we are not developing enough tradeables to boost our international earnings it is prudent to always factor in the risks involved nothing in our integrated global marketplace is stable currencies and commodities will continue to fluctuate it is also a truism that we are entering a post hydrocarbon industrial civilisation post hydrocarbon most of the advanced industrial economies have already given orders to their automobile manufacturers to move into production of electric cars within the next two decades 90 percent of the automobiles in the rich countries will be electric vehicles that will wipe off 70 percent of the market for oil most of our leaders have given no thought whatsoever to this impending doomsday scenario if we continue to borrow in the expectation that we will continue to earn enough from oil to repay our debts we would be living in a fool s paradise cost saving we need a comprehensive programme of cost saving and control of waste in all aspects of the administration such cost savings including regular elimination of ghosts are crucial to more prudent public financial management i would imagine that the ippis payment system is the right step in the right direction such cost saving will release considerable sums that could be redeployed into infrastructures and other sectors i also heard recently that some statutory bodies have not been releasing funds into the federation account as required by law we hear that nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc liquefied natural gas lng and federal inland revenue service firs are allegedly among the culprits i suspect that such funds would amount to some 2 trillion annually we must do more to ensure that these agencies obey the law 2 trillion annually in so doing we could boost the level of revenues required to finance infrastructures we need to deepen macroeconomic and institutional reforms including privatization we must deregulate the downstream sector for power for example so that foreign and local private investors can invest in the power distribution sector which currently remains a government monopoly through public private partnerships ppps we can get foreign investors to invest in key sectors for example in railways ports and harbours such financing arrangements will lessen pressure on the treasury therefore obviating the need to incur further loans finally we must improve the extractive capacity of the state nigeria is among the lowest in terms of tax to gdp ratio ours stands at five percent compared to south africa s ratio 25 9 percent in the oecd countries the average is 70 percent so we need to get the framework right we need to boost investments in key infrastructures and put in place the right institutional support systems to boost businesses and especially small and medium scale enterprises smes but timing is important in a time of slow and delicate recovery you need demand management and expansionary policies you must also secure the common peace in an atmosphere of insecurity investors will not come and local business will be undermined and with it the social capital needs to build trust and confidence in the future existential decision it was an existential decision that the obasanjo administration undertook to give us a breathing space you would recall that the economy grew by an average of seven percent during those years what we paid was grosso modo 20 billion in raw cash not the 30 billion that you are suggesting recall that during those years 90 percent of our national debt was external and dollar denominated and most of it was owed to bilateral and multilateral donors the local component of our debt was low because our capital markets were not as developed as they are today the scenario today is different most of our debt is local in principle we could print more naira and pay it off but we are obviously not going to do that because of the implications for inflation and the long term value of our legal tender currency the other dimension is china china is becoming our biggest single creditor the chinese do not impose harsh conditionalities like the washington institutions normally would but the chinese always insist on collateral if a debtor is unable to service his loans declaring a moratorium several africans notably ethiopia djibouti madagascar kenya and zambia currently face the prospects of having major national assets taken over by the chinese for failure to service their loans my advice to this government is that we should tread carefully only take loans that you are sure you can repay we must never take loans for consumption we must take them if we must only take for infrastructures and projects that have a guaranteed calculated return on investments if the government is desperate we could also declare an amnesty of three years for all the stolen wealth of nigeria it is estimated that nigerians have squirreled abroad something like 170 billion declaring a moratorium would allow most of this money to be repatriated we would only require that they bring the money and invest in the country with no questions asked however after the moratorium has expired we must pursue and hound the robber barons down it worked for italy a few decades ago and i don t see why it wouldn t work for us it s definitely worth try we want revamped economy diwe similarly national president national association of south east town unions asetu chief emeka diwe demanded a better economy and well secured nigeria he said first we would want to see a revamped and diversified economy in which the recent increment in vat would lead to greater dividends to people and local manufactures aided through sound policy frameworks we would want the federal government to revisit the automotive policy of past administrations and have a rethink on its deal with hyundai to protect nigerian indigenous carmakers the government should urgently address the various security challenges in the country the menace of the herdsmen against innocent vulnerable citizens is one thing the government must address make economy competitive prof agbedo for the head of department of linguistics igbo and other nigerian languages university of nigeria nsukka unn prof chris agbedo buhari must ensure that his economic policy has positive impacts on ordinary nigerians he said although president buhari has identified fighting corruption security tackling unemployment diversifying the economy enhancing climate resilience and boosting the living standards of nigerians as main policy priorities his government seeks to pursue it is not yet uhuru for nigeria as the economic recovery and growth plan established on three strategic objectives of restoring growth investing in the nigerian people and building a globally competitive economy is yet to impact positively on ordinary nigerians who are getting hungrier and angrier by the day the world bank review of the macroeconomic indices holds no hope for nigeria as economic growth is constrained by a weak macroeconomic framework with high persistent inflation multiple exchange rate windows and forex restrictions distortionary activities by the central bank and a lack of revenue driven fiscal consolidation results no hope for nigeria nigeria s human capital development remains weak due to under investment which explains the country s ranking as 152 out of 157 countries in the world bank s 2018 human capital index with the 2019 fiscal year deficit at n3 trillion in eight months as reported in the media it is obvious that nigeria cannot continue to spend more than it earns without getting into financial straits nepotism favoritism also glaring instances of nepotism that clearly mark federal appointments in recent times tend to represent a drawback to the corruption fight on security nigeria has never had it so bad given the incidences of rising insurgency and terrorism kidnapping serial killings and other forms of violent criminalities therefore i look forward to seeing buhari s government appreciating the urgency in reducing dependency on oil and diversifying the economy addressing insufficient infrastructure building strong and effective institutions and re jigging governance issues and public financial management systems govt taking gains of wage increase asogwa still on the economy a senior lecturer in the department of philosophy unn nicholas asogwa said more should be done in the sector to alleviate the sufferings of the masses asogwa said although government made a lot of paper promises in terms of policies that will revamp the economy it does not seem to me that these promises had much impact on the lives of ordinary nigerians considering the level of hardship in the country prices of goods keep on soaring while salaries of workers remain static government has increased the minimum wage but wants to take away the supposed gains as it proposes to increase tax by 50 percent the capital market remains all time down depicting low investors confidence kidnappings insurgency ethno religious crises herdsmen farmers conflicts and senseless killings among others have continued to be the order of the day in fairness to this administration it is doing fairly well in the fight against corruption that notwithstanding the corruption fight is not yet comprehensive as there is a belief that the president is shielding some corrupt persons in his administration even in the face of petitions govt lacks sound economic policies jonah on his part programme coordinator of civil liberty organization clo eastern headquarters enugu comrade kindness jonah bemoaned the state of the economy borrowing not best option audu economist and banker dr aliyu audu said obasanjo is right in the sense that if we are borrowing for infrastructure and we are not spending the money on infrastructure the debt burden will be high we are spending over 25 percent of our budget on debt servicing that is not good money meant for capital expenditure is being used to service debt this deprives the country of money meant for capital expenditure we must reduce our borrowing or we find alternatives to generate revenue also borrowing from local banks is not good in the sense that banks are now looking forward to government borrowing which is far safer and less risky they are not keen to lend to local businesses this is called crowding out infrastructure on rail transport buhari said on transportation we are making significant progress on key roads such as the second niger bridge lagos ibadan expressway and the abuja kano highway 2020 will also see tangible progress on the lagos to kano rail line through executive order 007 we are also using alternative funding programmes in collaboration with private sector partners to fix strategic roads such as the apapa oworonshoki express way abuja and port harcourt have new international airport terminals as will kano and lagos in 2020 to recapitulate some of the projects nigerians should expect to come upstream from 2020 include 47 road projects scheduled for completion in 2020 21 including roads leading to ports major bridges including substantial work on the second niger bridge completion of 13 housing estates under the national housing project plan lagos kano maiduguri and enugu international airports to be commissioned in 2020 infrastructure collapse is alarming diwe on the contrary diwe said the infrastructure deficit in the country is alarming there is hardly any federal road in the south east that is in good shape further the pace of work at the akanu ibiam international airport enugu is rather inexplicably slow same with the second niger bridge government should see to it that all these are speedily addressed mr president needs to move beyond the orthodoxy of recurring rhetoric and the mantra of diversification as a hollow economic jingle to initiate the basic rudiments for economic recovery pandef religious leaders others disagree on infrastructure contrary to the president s remarks pan niger delta forum pandef christian leaders and citizens in the south south region expressed dissatisfaction at the manner the government tackled security and infrastructure last year urging it to change strategy this time national chairman of pandef and former military administrator of akwa ibom state air commodore idongesit nkanga retd who spoke to sunday vanguard in uyo said if i look at what they are discussing about security and what is in the budget it may not go the way i would have wanted to see things this year if you do not have the equipment what can you really do i expect a structural change in the security set up but if the money is not made available i do not think my expectations will come to pass it bothers me because i do not even know what is happening to us during the civil war we moved personnel around so for him buhari to say that we cannot do that now because we are in a state of war he does not know the damage that is being done nigeria is a country that is grossly short of infrastructure and unfortunately no country can develop without infrastructure insecurity on insecurity buhari said the federal government will continue to work with state governors neighbouring states and our international partners to tackle the root causes of violent extremism and the networks that help finance and organise terror our security forces will receive the best training and modern weaponry and in turn will be held to the highest standards of professionalism and respect for human rights we will use all the human and emerging technological resources available to tackle kidnapping banditry and armed robbery fg should fix roads in 2020 bishop egbebo however bishop of catholic diocese of bomadi most rev hyacinth egbebo told sunday vanguard that insecurity is one evil plaguing this country i think the way to really arrest the security menace in this country would be the provision of jobs those who are having our money in their pockets and bank accounts overseas should think of coming to invest here so they can employ the teeming youths on infrastructure i will focus attention on nigerian roads nigerians will be very happy if the federal government will do whatever it can to fix nigerian roads because our roads are like deathtraps we say all the prayers when we travel on the roads on healthcare i expect that there should be attention for the rural healthcare system to be put in place for those of us living in riverine areas it is not possible to access healthcare in a way that can prevent sudden deaths it s scandalous bishop adeleye similarly anglican bishop of cross river state arch bishop tunde adeleye expressed concern about the security situation and health infrastructure in nigeria he said what the government should do is to improve the state of nigeria police there is this litany of complaints from police of lack of weapons they should also be given training that is in tandem with modern crime fighting the health facilities in the country are in a state of complete decay that is the reason the president visits the united kingdom at the slightest opportunity for health checks if the hospital in aso rock which millions are budgeted for every year is not able to take care of the health needs of the president tell me what would be the state of our hospitals that are not so privileged fg should complete east west road uruah the youth leader in emohua local government area of rivers state mr thankgod uruah said we would want the government to speedily complete the east west road which has lingered for so long some parts of the roads are now impassable like the npkolu axis and apajo area in obio akpor and eleme local government areas in the area of security i want the federal and rivers governments to declare a state of emergency in this area abolish foreign medical trips leader of egbema voice of freedom evf pastor nicholas evaristus said this year the only thing that will show that we are now responsible is the provision of security health and infrastructure we are in a new decade and nigeria should draw better health security and infrastructure plans for the next 30 years enough of medical tourism hide original message on security corruption economy buhari passed akpama ex governorship candidate and former inter party advisory council ipac chairman in cross river state mr goddie akpama however differed with others he said the federal government under the leadership of muhammadu buhari has consistently stated that it will face three major issues these are tackling corruption fixing the economy and fighting insecurity since 2015 the government has taken several steps to achieve them in its bid to tackle corruption the government introduced the whistleblowing policy in 2016 on security especially in the restive north east region the buhari administration established the multi national joint task force mnjtf aimed at combating trans border crime and boko haram insurgency
india s flagging economy is not out of the woods yet and the government is expected to introduce more measures to help boost slowing growth however the widening gap between new delhi s revenue and its expenditure is limiting the scope of policy tools at its disposal that can effectively rejuvenate the third largest asian economy analysts say the government has already declared and implemented many stimulus measures says vk vijaykumar the chief investment strategist at geojit financial services headquartered in kochi kerala more can be expected but unfortunately the government has limited wiggle room for concessions which might worsen the already precarious fiscal deficit india s economic growth slowed to a more than six year low of 4 5 per cent in the quarter to the end of september 2019 according to government data that compares to 7 per cent is the same period a year earlier fitch ratings last month cut its growth forecast for india to 4 6 per cent from the previous 5 6 per cent estimate for the current financial year which runs until the the end of march citing a squeeze in credit availability from non banking financial companies and deterioration in business and consumer confidence everything worsened for india during 2019 says sujan hajra chief economist at anand rathi a financial services company based in mumbai as of now with whatever data we have that doesn t draw a pretty picture for india s growth and doesn t show an impending recovery he adds government finance is likely to be a bigger problem in 2020 than in 2019 because clearly the government s idea to boost growth implies that it has to give stimulus rather than increase taxes or cut spending new delhi has already taken a series of steps in recent months as policy makers try to revive the country s sluggish economy on new year s eve the government unveiled a 1 4 trillion dh5 14tn infrastructure plan that includes the development of rural infrastructure airports roads and ports in the country a move policy makers say is aimed at realising prime minister narendra modi s vision of india becoming a 5tn economy in the next five years in september india slashed corporate tax rates to 22 per cent from 30 per cent within weeks of announcing stimulus packages to help the ailing car and property sectors but what has been done is far from enough and economists expect more packages to come from the government in the short term a cut in personal income tax is expected says mr vijaykumar this can help boost consumption a complete reform of capital market related taxation is also expected there are however questions on the government s ability to foot the bill for such costly measures india s fiscal deficit which is the gap between the government s revenues and how much it spends widened to more than 8 trillion indian rupees dh409 4bn in november compared to its budgeted estimate of 7tn rupees according to data from the controller general of accounts the government only just managed to hit 50 per cent of its revenue target which adds to worries that india is likely to breach its fiscal deficit target 3 3 per cent of the country s gross domestic product for this year india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman has said the corporate tax cut alone would mean the government taking a 1 45tn rupees hit in revenues annually the deficit slippage is now more concerning as the april to november fiscal deficit crossed the budget estimate by 14 8 per cent says kruti shah an economist at mumbai based emkay global financial services the level is at a record high in comparison with corresponding levels in the prior years observing the current level the probability of fiscal slippage to a level of 3 8 per cent to 4 per cent is very likely within this financial year in our view escalating tensions between iran and the us are further fuelling concerns about india s public finances due to its huge dependence on oil imports and the fact that the government often has to absorb sharp increases in fuel prices to soften the impact on the masses brent crude prices gained more than 3 5 per cent on friday following an air strike that killed a top iranian military commander in iraq stoking fears of iranian retaliation that would increase the risk premium and further hike the crude prices economists however point out that it is not all doom and gloom for india as there are some bright spots in the overall picture a report in the economic times on friday for example cited some retailers and consumer goods companies as saying the festive season between october and december was the best in four years weak consumer spending in india has been a major drag on economic growth some green shoots can be seen but the coming summer will tell us whether the momentum is sustained manish sharma chief executive of panasonic india told the newspaper mr hajra points out that foreign direct investment fdi flows into india are also encouraging official data shows that fdi into india rose 15 per cent to 26bn during april to september over the same six month period in 2018 these factors have raised hopes that things have bottomed out says mr hajra some are even predicting growth to start picking up later this year we expect growth to gradually recover to 5 6 per cent in the financial year april 2020 to march 2021 and 6 5 per cent with support from easing monetary and fiscal policy and structural measures that may also support growth over the medium term according to a fitch report mahesh singhi the founder and managing director of singhi advisors a global investment banking firm in mumbai says he is looking forward to the union budget expected to be presented at the beginning of february during which the government is likely to make further announcements to spur the economy the wish list ranges from a cut in personal income tax slabs to far reaching structural reforms including amendments in land and labour laws he says government spending he explains is much needed to boost consumer confidence once the outlook for the economy improves people may start spending more leading to a revival in consumption the international monetary fund imf however has raised another concern about india s economic health when it pointed to the country s public debt in one of its recent reports the washington based lender said that while there is a lot of focus on the fiscal deficit a broader and more relevant measure of the government s fiscal position and its bearing on the economy is the public sector s borrowing requirement which has risen to about 8 5 per cent of gdp economic development projects and enhanced social initiatives in india will be vital in the coming years the imf said but to generate the revenue needed to get them off the ground india s debt among the highest in emerging markets must be reduced economists in india however say india s debt levels are manageable and are not particularly high by international standards the united states for example has a government debt to gdp ratio of more than 100 per cent india s external debt is low says mr vijaykumar debt servicing is not an issue at all also foreign exchange reserves at 450bn are ample domestic debt is a bit high but not in dangerous territory in the context of falling interest rates debt servicing is easy jigar doshi the executive director indirect tax at nexdigm skp a professional services group in india says that given the fiscal situation rather than spending large amounts of money to boost the economy it appears that the government would try to encourage investment in india by easing investment norms and reducing red tape in bureaucracy privatisation of government owned companies to raise funds is also on the cards the government is keen to further reduce its debt burden and is looking at measures such as raising finances through strategic divestment in certain public sector undertakings says mr doshi the government is planning to make another attempt at selling its debt laden airline air india this year and it also wants to sell its oil and gas firm bharat petroleum corporation raising more investment and selling stakes in state owned companies could help india enormously analysts say the year 2020 is expected to bring better news for the economy says mr doshi
as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash

as cad eyes poloz speech and dec jobs data the pound to canadian dollar rate declined in the opening week of the new year as the loonie advanced against all major rivals other than the japanese yen although the outlook for the week ahead sees the exchange rate starting off in neutral ground even though the charts are arguing for further losses canada s dollar broke kept pound sterling under pressure throughout last week and broke above the key 1 30 resistance level against its u s rival as investors celebrated the president donald trump s claim that his phase one deal to end the trade

iranian retaliatory attacks on saudi arabian soil as well as the risk of a complete collapse of social order in iraq likely means that oil will have to trade with a risk premium for the time being that is probably the most important market take away for now world war iii is not around the corner says andreas steno larsen a strategist at nordea markets the missile strike has stoked fears of a possible u s conflict with iran in the gulf leading stock markets to fall and the u s dollar as well as oil prices to rise however what matters most to the outlook for the pound to canadian dollar

president donald trump that u s forces were responsible for the killing of a senior iranian military commander in iraq stoking tensions between the two rivals that are likely to again set the agenda in currency markets early in the new week tensions were already rising between the u s and iran after the white house said the u s was responsible for an earlier missile attack on an iran backed militant group in iraq although the death of targeting of general qassem soleimani earlier in the week has exacerbated the fued and president trump may now have upped the stakes again when saying via his twitter feed late saturday the u s has preselected 52 sites inside iran for attack in the event that any of its bases or personnel in iraq or elsewhere are targeted by iran enabled forces investors are unlikely to welcome the hawkish white house rhetoric which could see risk assets remain on the back foot monday and safe havens continue to outperform that would benefit the dollar against all currencies other than the japanese yen and swiss franc but it also provide support to the euro in the short term if it forces more international investors out of emerging markets in that environment the now slow moving domestic story could easily fall by the wayside for sterling monday sees the ihs markit final services pmi for december released at 09 30 and consensus is for the earlier flash estimate of 49 0 to be revised higher to 49 1 although risk might be to the downside given that both the construction and manufacturing surveys have already surprised on the downside despite markets also looking for upward revisions there too figures covering the pre election period are affected by high political uncertainty so the poor pmis for december shouldn t cause too much concern says andrew wishart at capital economics the first clean data for the post election period it is in these we need to see some improvement in order to confirm a boris bounce if that doesn t happen expect interest rates to be cut in the following months tuesday sees the withdrawal agreement bill back before parliament for the committee stage before the whole of house which could take until the end of wednesday while lords amendments and the third reading of the bill are expected to take place thursday the bill is the legislative vehicle through which the withdrawal agreement is brought into force prime minister boris johnson s withdrawal bill is widely expected to become law given the scale of the conservative majority so the event itself is seen by analysts as unlikely to move the pound which will leave sterling to take its cues from developments in the international arena and on the charts that being said johnson will meet european commission chief ursula von der leyen in downing street on wednesday as markets wait to hear if a possible february visit to the u s and meeting with president donald trump will be confirmed senior tories have been calling for the government to waste no time in starting parallel trade negotiations with the u s and foreign secretary dominic raab is set to meet secretary of state mike pompeo in london thursday although that meeting may now be overshadowed by the state department s ire over the uk s response to recent events in iraq which has echoed that of france and germany three and a half years after the eu membership referendum the uk will finally leave the eu in 4 weeks time says jane foely head of fx strategy at rabobank the tone and the pace of the talks between the uk and the eu will be instrumental for guiding gbp in the months ahead and we see ample scope for gbp usd to dip back to the 1 28 area as politicians on both sides lay out their positions if an appropriate deal is successfully negotiated it is possible that gbp usd could trade in a 1 35 1 40 range in 2021 that said there is a lot of ground to be covered before this becomes a realistic prospect aa the canadian dollar what to watch the canadian dollar saw a strong start to the new year in which it advanced against all major rivals other than the yen although appetite for the loonie will be tested in the week ahead developments in the international arena notably in tensions between the u s and iran as well as the bank of canada s interpretation of recent economic events will be key to the canadian dollar s trajectory in the days ahead canada s dollar is sensitive to the price of oil the country s largest export and so was able to hold earlier gains against the u s dollar last week despite the greenback stabilising in response to the u s admission that it killed iran s qassem soleimani wti crude oil futures prices rose 3 1 on friday while brent crude futures rose 3 7 in response to fears over a possible u s iran clash in the gulf which boosted the u s greenback and other safe haven currencies oil prices will rise further next year and that the boc and the nb will continue to keep rates on hold even as the ecb and several other central banks ease policy says jonas goltermann at capital economics this suggests to us that the loonie and the krone will outperform while we expect the us dollar to strengthen broadly as the fed remains on hold we forecast that the canadian dollar will appreciate by 4 against the greenback canada s oil industry and bond yields that still pay investors more than those of the u s government helped prevent the usd cad rate from rising too far off its recent low around 1 2950 the loonie had fallen to lowest since late 2018 last week amid earlier broad weakness in the dollar that was prompted in part by president donald trump s declaration that his phase one deal with china will be signed on january 15 however analysts at scotiabank say the canadian dollar s correlation with oil prices isn t what it used to be and that the u s dollar could be due a further comeback meanwhile other local analysts are looking to the economic calendar for clues for on the likely trajectory of the loonie in the week ahead there could be scope for disappointment history has taught us that large moves either up or down aren t always offset the following month moreover even after the shock decline november the year over year gain in employment was still a little higher than would normally be expected given the muted pace of gdp growth says andrew grantham at cibc capital markets thursday will see bank of canada governor stephen poloz address the greater vancouver board of trade s economic outlook forum in which he s expected to provide insight into the bank s reading of the november jobs report which showed employment contracting sharply in canada and the unemployment rate rising 40 basis points in a straight line to 5 9 the speech is due at 19 00 london time on thursday poloz s speech will come barely more than 18 hours before statistics canada will publish jobs figures for december which markets will scrunise closely for signs of a more protracted turn for the worse in the labour market consensus is looking for the economy to have added 31 8k new jobs in december and for the unemployment rate to have declined from 5 9 to 5 8 the data is due out at 13 30 on friday the boc left its cash rate unchanged at 1 75 all year in 2019 supporting bond yields and lofting the loonie but it s said households the consumer and international tensions will be key to its policy decisions in the months the belief in low volatility has become fairly engrained in market psyche says greg anderson head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets fear of a breakout is minimal speculative activity is low these factors probably enhanced usdcad s reaction to the generalized usd dip between christmas and new year s day but they may well reinforce a return to the 1 30 to 1 35 range in january
the new zealand dollar continued on its strong recovery path in late december climbing to a high of 0 6750 against the usd on 1 january the kiwi dollar s five cent appreciation from 0 6250 in early october to 0 6750 proving to be as rapid as the decline from 0 6750 to 0 6250 through the months of july august and september last year the spectacular turnaround in the currency s fortunes over the last three months was caused by offshore fx traders speculators unwinding their short sold nzd positions as their reasons for selling the kiwi dollar in the first place the trade wars and a forecast weaker nz economy forcing further rbnz interest rate cuts did not eventuate as they and most others expected the chinese and americans have now agreed terms on the phase 1 trade deal and it will be

recognised that both the domestic and export parts of the economy were performing at a level well above their previous dire forecasts despite the uncertainties risks from the trade wars and low business confidence levels the return of the nzd usd exchange rate to 0 6700 has brought the nz currency value more into line with its economic fundamentals whereas the sell off to 0 6250 last october took it to a serious undervalued position vis à vis prime drivers like export commodity prices fresh global geo political risks halt the usd decline the significant de escalation during december of the two global economic risks that dominated financial and investment markets in 2019 brexit and the china us trade wars commenced an unwinding of previous safe haven buying of the us dollar the usd weakened to above 1 1200 against the euro by late december and the growth commodity currencies like the nzd and aud were the beneficiaries of flows moving out of the usd the weaker usd trend came to a shuddering halt last week when a us drone rocket took out the irani military leader general qasem soleimani in baghdad oil and gold prices surged along with the usd currency value as yet another middle east crisis prompted an immediate risk off mode from financial investors and traders the eur usd exchange rate moved back to 1 1160 and further usd gains can be expected in the short term as the markets await the inevitable iran terrorist retaliation against the americans somewhere in the world it is difficult to estimate how long the heightened geo political tensions will last as a negative impact on financial and investment markets however historical price action patterns would suggest at least two to three months us president donald trump is highly unpredictable dangerously instinctive and with no clear strategy as to the likely consequences of such an overt us attack on iran on the other hand the iranians cannot expect there to be no consequences from their support of terrorist activities in many parts of the world the implications for the nz dollar value are that the normal strong gains during the month of january due to exporter buying in thin illiquid holiday fx

india gold posted all time highs in the local currency during the course of the year in short as currencies raced for the bottom gold raced to the top the true hallmark of a bull market in gold says veteran technical analyst john murphy is its ability to rise relative to other major currencies and it s doing just that historically adds atlas pulse s charlie morris in a recent in depth report on gold s prospects for 2020 it has proved to be important that gold rises in all currencies and not just in us dollars this simple test ensures we don t mistake dollar bear markets for gold bull markets since 2000 the world s best currencies have been the swiss franc and the thai baht and gold recently broke higher in both that implies that gold is rising everywhere mark mobius mobius capital partners explains in a newsmax interview why he thinks investors should allocate at least 10 of their portfolios to gold the reason is that gold maintains its status as a currency a currency that has stood the test of time there is a growing realization that the supply of fiat money is growing at a rapid pace not only because of central bank activities to drive down interest rates by printing more money but also because of the rapid and inexorable rise of cryptocurrencies they are beginning to realize that fiat currencies like the u s dollar and euro really do not have anything behind them

comparative amount of publicity received by each at the same time the gains in stocks over the past two years have been shallow so much so that hussman funds john hussman was moved to offer the following observation yet for all the bullish exuberance speculative enthusiasm and fear of missing out fomo we ve observed among investors in recent weeks and indeed in the past two years the fact is that a pullback of just 11 in the s p 500 would place the total return of the s p 500 index behind the return on treasury bills since the january 26 2018 market high given current overextended extremes the entire gain of the s p 500 since early 2018 could be given up in a handful of trading sessions men it has been well said says charles mackay in extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly one by one at present we are experiencing a modern day version of that process at usagold we do not have a rush to buy gold and silver at the moment instead we are experiencing a steady stream of new and old clientele purchasing to hedge the extremes to which john hussman alludes above they are returning to gold one by one not as a herd much of the repeat business is coming from clients who bought early in gold s secular bull market during the early 2000s all of which brings us back to a recent quote from billionaire investor thomas kaplan we have posted previously in this newsletter it sums up with great clarity gold s role in the private investment portfolio and offers his view of its future his target price measured in years recalls prices in the late 1990s early 2000s and the multiple returns that came years later as the bull market gained maturity strength and

the start of the new year has seen a drastic switch in focus from trade wars to possibly a us iran war the focus for the week ahead was supposed to be the leaking of the details of the phase one trade deal but that will not be the case financial markets will now closely follow the tit for tat response following the us airstrike in iraq that killed iran s top commander iran s response is likely to be strong but not necessarily swift as iranians re evaluate their strategy iran is convinced the killing of qasem soleimani was an act of war and we should not be surprised if we see a limited military confrontation over the upcoming weeks risk aversion could also remain the overall theme next week as we could see markets become disappointed with the lack of substance in the 86 page phase one agreement prior to the january 15th signing we should start to see leaks of part of the agreement usd the dollar could continue to benefit on safe haven demand as tensions escalate in the middle east safe havens could see further gains next week because the us is sending more troops in preparation of a potential military confrontation the falling dollar call that markets were embracing for the first quarter will likely take a break here oil general qassim soleimani oil prices spiked alongside gold as tensions are approaching a critical level between us and iran the trump administration strike was a strong retaliation to the attack on the us embassy in iraq by pro iranian militiamen financial markets are now awaiting iran s response which will likely have a wide reaching impact on all asset classes iran may choose to target americans abroad cyber attacks along with further uprisings in the regions that will see us troops on heightened alert in iraq yemen syria and the israeli lebanese border oil volatility will remain intense and we could see swings in both directions as investors will likely push prices higher on actions that yield supply disruptions or increased military conflict expectations if iran initially targets allies to the america or cyber attacks we could see oil prices somewhat soften gold investors have not priced in the chance of a full blown out war in the middle east and gold will remain the favorite safe haven trade other safe havens such as the dollar and yen will benefit from the developments in the middle east but gold will remain king gold prices could easily take out last year s high and make a run towards 1 600 an ounce over the course of this month bitcoin bitcoin could benefit from heightened tensions in the middle east the digital coin has outperformed oil and gold following the us airstrike that killed a top iranian commander we could see investors temporarily put concerns aside that tighter restrictions from the chinese and us will weigh on the crypto space bitcoin could see further bullish momentum on expectations demand will greatly increase in the middle east uk nothing has changed over the festive period the uk is still on course to leave the eu at the end of january with only a few days of scrutiny over the withdrawal bill next week standing in the way the pound has managed to hold onto much of its election gains although it remains a little off the highs given boris johnson s recently earned majority in the house of commons i can t imagine he ll suffer any major setbacks next week after which attention will shift to 11 months of trade negotiations and the direction of travel of the bank of england under the leadership of andrew bailey who replaces mark carney on 16 march risk barring any bizarre surprises next week the near future should be far less turbulent that we ve become accustomed to of course no deal wto brexit remains on the table at the end of next year so in effect we just have a new deadline cny the chinese yuan could decline on disappointment with the details with the phase one trade deal and on further escalation in tensions between the us and iran the yuan was expected to continue to strengthen on an extended pause in trade tensions between the world s two largest economies chances of any progress on a phase two deal seem to be closer to slim to none turkey a relatively quiet week in store for turkey with only a couple of pieces of low tier data due out 2019 was a bounceback year for turkey with the central bank under the leadership of murat uysal following the removal of governor murat cetinkaya in july cutting interest rates by 12 in five months to 12 in a bid to lift the economy out of recession the plan worked although there remains questions around the independence of the central bank considering the actions of erdogan in removing the governor and his past views on interest rates the currency is holding up for now though although risks remain risk this is a currency that s prone to rapid devaluations especially at a time when the central bank is cutting interest rates aggressively despite warnings about the impact such a move will have on the currency so far the central bank has been rewarded for ignoring these warnings but that may not last riksbank minutes minutes from 19 december released on wednesday at the meeting the riksbank went against the trend and raised rates by 25 basis points to 0 moving away from negative interest rate policy that some central banks continue to embrace policy makers appear concerned about negative unintended consequences of nirp which makes a move back into negative territory in the near term unlikely they may also not be in any particular rush to hike though either hong kong the quiet period on the protest front looks set to continue into early january the economy continues to implode with tourist bookings over the christmas period reportedly down 53 from a year

principle barring any unforeseen setbacks expectations are that it will be ratified signed in the second half on january pmi numbers were steady in december and next week we have only ppi and cpi to

reserve requirement ratio by 50 bps effective jan 6 which is expected to free up about 115 billion in funds which could give the economy a lift as we kick off 2020 risk any back tracking on the phase

like a play on the 2020 story benign conditions a trade truce and more money printing in g3 economies said ing head of commodities strategy warren patterson were events in the middle east to escalate severely overweight positioning in risk assets could easily trigger a 7 to 10 per cent correction in global equity markets advertisement the msci world index has risen 3 1 per cent since the start of december pushed higher by news that the us and china agreed to a phase one trade deal this gave markets temporary relief from the uncertainty of a trade war which has dominated investor sentiment since early 2018 the easing of the strain between china and us had calmed the market into year end but the flare up in the middle east highlights the risk that politics will play over the course of 2020 said jpmorgan asset management global market strategist kerry craig the market impact will be dictated by the extent the souring relationship impacts the oil price and whether or not there was

the spate of production issues witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2019 he added consumption from india and china remained strong with more chance of an increase in demand than a decrease i think most things look fairly good for oil for the next three to six months he said advertisement any sustained increase in the price of oil could have ramifications for a number of central banks with inflationary pressures from higher fuel prices likely to be a point of interest for policymakers historically the economic damage from these events comes when a surge in energy prices creates rising inflation pressures and rate hikes by central banks said jpmorgan s mr craig however the price spike could be contained as the global oil market has plenty of spare capacity resilient market prices have already remained relatively resilient in the face of a number of escalations in the tensions between the us and iran advertisement in may 2018 president trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear accord created by the obama administration which had relieved sanctions on iran in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons program the two countries came to a flashpoint in june last year with washington accusing iran of attacking two oil tankers in the persian gulf a move denied by tehran later that month iran s revolutionary guard shot down a us drone after it allegedly entered iranian airspace oil markets have so far proved relatively resilient to the rising tensions even with sanctions introduced against the islamic republic by the us hampering its ability to sell its oil any significant and sustained disruption would likely mean the end of the opec deal to cut production by 1 7 million barrels per day with members wanting to ensure adequate supply for the market said ing s mr patterson advertisement there is also the potential for emergency releases from government stocks ing also noted mr trump s desire to keep oil prices low particularly ahead of november s presidential election saying they expected brent crude to trend back towards us60 a barrel through the first quarter a drone attack on saudi arabia s energy infrastructure in mid september took 6 per cent of the globe s crude supply offline and sent oil prices soaring prices recovered within two weeks as producers worked quickly to bring additional supply online more often than not the knee jerk reaction in markets has reversed over the course of the coming months mr craig said as there is scope for other oil producing nations to at least offset some of the decrease in supply from iran or iraq as well as the fact that the us is less reliant on oil imports the market impact may be more narrow than in the past advertisement safe havens rise the spike in oil prices and weakness in equities at the end of last week saw an increase in investor appetite for safe haven assets gold surged 1 5 per cent to us1552 38 an ounce on friday its biggest spike since late august the yield on the australian 10 year note dropped 9 basis points to 1 25 per cent on friday while the us 10 year treasury yield fell 9 basis points to 1 79 per cent its heaviest fall in a month both us treasuries and the dollar have started the year on the front foot as the escalation of tensions between the us and iran has prompted renewed safe haven demand said capital economics senior economist jonas goltermann while we think that treasury yields are unlikely to move much in 2020 we expect the dollar to continue to recover from its autumn slump advertisement the japanese yen and swiss franc both firmed on friday benefiting from a sharp increase in safe haven demand the risk of military action between the us and iran is unpredictable for this reason market participants may want to consider some hedges in a currency portfolio to protect against sudden spikes in risk aversion said cba currency strategist elias haddad the japanese yen is the ultimate safe haven currency because of japan s large current account surplus and net foreign asset position japanese companies and investors tend to repatriate foreign assets when markets turn risk averse the swiss franc could be a less attractive safe haven with mr hadded warning the swiss national bank snb was likely to intervene if the franc strengthened much further the snb continues to warn that the swiss franc is highly valued and reiterated its willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary he said the sudden return of volatility across global markets following a month of relatively solid returns has showcased just how vulnerable markets are particularly with global equities trading around record highs this is not the start to the new year that many investors would have been wishing for however it highlights the need to be balanced in asset allocation after a year of tremendous returns in nearly every asset in 2019 said mr craig
by w a wijewardena the sick economy president gotabaya rajapaksa now fondly called gota by everyone inherited an underperforming economy it was just like the economy which the previous administration had inherited from his brother some five years ago as i had presented in this column repeatedly the economy was turning from bad to worse since around 2013 and it was the job of the previous administration to put it on the right growth path they were successful somewhat in constitutional reforms but regarding the economy their performance record had been far from the desired hence the economy today is characterised by sad stories all around gota s immediate challenge has been to convert them into pleasant and promising stories what are those sad stories that confront him falling growth rate three weeks ago the department of census and statistics sri lanka s official statistical bureau responsible for assessing the size of the economy and its growth rate came up with the first piece of sad news the growth rate in the third quarter of 2019 has been 2 7 a little up above the previous quarter s rate of 1 6 but pretty much less than the growth of 3 5 recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year thus in the first three quarters of 2019 the real economic growth has been at a dismal 2 7 accordingly the year is likely to end up in a rate of less than 3 as has been predicted by international agencies what is important for gota is the predicted economic growth rate for the next three years which if no action is taken would settle between 3 and 3 5 if he is to meet the targets set in his manifesto the growth rate should practically double to 6 5 this is indeed a herculean task for any economic planner the fragile external sector the supporting drivers of economic growth have also been very weak exports in the first 10 months of 2019 have been virtually stagnant recording a growth of only 0 8 in the services sector the main driver of growth tourism has not recovered from the depth to which it had fallen after the easter bombings in fact its earnings have fallen by 21 in the first 10 months remittances which had been the single most important relief for the country s fragile external sector in the past have declined by 6 during the same period both agriculture and services have been at a very low level of performance the industrial performance has been a little better but it cannot single handedly rescue the economy hence gota must adopt a multi pronged approach to expand agriculture services tourism exports and remittances simultaneously if the economy is to remain on course with the planned targets the external debt overhang the country s external debt overhang is looming frighteningly over gota s administration that has been the cumulative effect of the original sin committed by sri lanka ever since it had gained independence from the british that sin was to borrow abroad to finance local investments in the absence of adequate local savings and invest in sectors that have contributed poorly to the country s foreign exchange earnings as revealed by the central bank statistics in the next 12 month period the total foreign debt servicing commitments comprising both the repayment of the principal and the payment of interest will amount to 6 billion this is made up of the government s commitments amounting to 4 8 billion and those of the private sector by about 1 2 billion the country s liquid foreign exchange balances after taking out the illiquid gold reserves at end november 2019 had been some 6 5 billion and if it is used for debt payments its foreign exchange reserves would fall to a critically low level thus gota s problem is slightly different from those of the private sector borrowers the latter may be having rupee funds to meet its commitments and its problem is lack dollars in the country gota s problem is that he has neither rupees nor dollars to do so hence he has no alternative but to borrow abroad to fill his coffers and use those proceeds to repay his loan commitments this strategy known as loan recycling and used by all the previous successive governments would provide only a temporary solution to the country it adds to gota s woes and if continued unabated those of any future administration to come to power as well the need for using scarce money prudently but just like the previous administration had been preoccupied by constitutional reforms and a hurry to bring the alleged corrupt deals of their predecessors to justice gota is also preoccupied by considerations other than the economy he has to seek parliamentary majority in a general election in a few months time hence all governmental resources are now being diverted to attaining that goal at the expense of sound economic policies accordingly at a time when the treasury was limping with a huge cash shortage he has offered a costly tax cut to citizens and jobs for 100 000 samurdhi kids the first would drain the treasury of a promised revenue flow of about rs 600 billion and the latter would impose an unexpected cost of rs 42 billion on his already fragile budget numbers that latter amount is a lot of money equal to the annual administration budgets of some 14 state universities this is a serious choice to be made by a government which is planning to increase the university admissions by about a quarter by establishing 300 odd university colleges the government does not have money for this and hence the available moneys will have to be spent prudently a write off four months ahead as far as economic rebuilding is concerned the next four months will be a write off for gota since his government has to fight a parliamentary election to secure majority if the voting pattern at the recently concluded presidential election is repeated his government has a good chance of securing a simple majority in parliament but what is being fought for now is not just the simple majority but a two third majority the latter is needed by him to amend the constitution and revert to the governance structure that prevailed prior to 2015 to attain that goal his government has to postpone all the unpopular economic reforms that are necessary to come out of the present economic malaise hence the economic war has to be temporarily kept aside until the conclusion of the scheduled parliamentary elections since sri lanka has no time to waste that temporary recess will surely be fatal to the country s economic rebuilding exercise inadequate capacity for developing technology sri lanka has a limited scope for creating economic prosperity for its people through historically prominent growth drivers like subsistence agriculture three tree crops comprising tea rubber and coconut apparels and telecommunication services all these sectors have now reached their saturation point with the available technology hence any further development leading to increased additional wealth creation known as value addition in these sectors requires the adoption of advanced technologies given sri lanka s inadequate capacity for developing such advanced technologies in house the attainment of this goal is necessarily a medium to long term objective hence in the initial stage of economic development sri lanka needs to use technologies developed elsewhere this was the strategy adopted by the four asian tigers namely singapore taiwan south korea and hong kong that was done by attracting foreign direct investments or fdis with high technologies on one side and forcing local universities to get affiliated to world s reputed universities to develop its own technology on the other a good example in the present era is sri lanka s competitor in most respects vietnam that country which was nowhere in the global trade map some 30 years ago is the home for large technology based manufacturers like nike samsung ibm intel fujitsu and hp today according to the world bank data vietnam s high tech exports in 2017 had been 41 of its manufactured exports the comparable figure for sri lanka had been just 1 implying that it has a long way to go to attract high technology in the initial period of economic expansion the strategy adopted by both south korea and singapore could serve as guidance to sri lanka south korea s technology policy south korea s strongman president park chung hee who held the post from 1963 till 1979 had a separate technology policy side by side with his industrial policy to acquire or develop new technologies and make them available to all sectors concerned to improve productivity and go for new areas of production in this respect technology had been recognised as a public good to be necessarily produced by the state it consisted of two aspects one was to develop new technology through research and development and improve the technologies adapted from other countries the other was to facilitate the use of technology for going for new products and improving the existing production practices to develop technology in house new research institutes were setup while encouraging the existing universities to undertake new research and development programs one of the institutes so setup was the korea institute of science and technology popularly known as kist with the joint participation of both the korean and us governments this institute was later amalgamated with the korea institute of science and is presently known as korea advanced institute of science and technology or kaist its success is gauged by the number of global patents it has got and its ranking within the top 50 universities in the world and at the 6th place among asian universities south korea is a technology driven economy and its high tech exports in 2018 had amounted to 36 of manufactured exports according to the world bank data singapore s going for a western oasis in singapore prime minister lee kuan yew forced all singaporean universities to get affiliated with universities of repute in usa and improve curricula and research capability based on such collaboration as a result the national university of singapore which was relatively unknown in early 1960s got itself elevated to the 22nd position in global ranking by 2018 in addition to developing in house capacity for technological advancement lee adopted a policy of attracting fdis with high technology to the country to enable the expatriates from the western world to come and work in singapore a conscious policy to convert the country to a western oasis was adopted in this policy singapore improved its environment healthcare facilities education and transport to be on par with any developed country so that the expatriates felt as if they were working in their own countries this was a miraculous development and today singapore s high tech exports amount to about 52 of the manufactured exports according to the world bank data industry 4 0 both south korea and singapore are presently going through the fourth industrial revolution also known as industry 4 0 or 4ir this is a term coined by the founder and chairman of the davos based world economic forum klaus schwab to distinguish the modern wave of high technology based global production model from the existing model of production using electronics and computers gota s problem is that sri lanka is still in the second industrial revolution or industry 2 0 or 2ir in which production processes are only partly mechanised he has to make a leapfrogging from industry 2 0 to industry 4 0 bypassing industry 3 0 or 3ir this is challenging but not impossible provided he adopts an appropriate policy package to wean the local businesses to the use of emerging technologies vietnam has begun this process by introducing a road map covering 2020 through 2030 in which all sectors in the economy including education and healthcare would go for new technologies wake up and fight the war i have discussed how sri lanka should go for industry 4 0 in a previous article in this series under the title presidential aspirants and voters read ips s soe 2019 before you make your next move available at the following para from the article aptly describes the challenge before gota in this context state of the economy 2019 by the institute of policy studies makes the following remark it can be argued that sri lanka is yet to even come to terms with technologies of the third industrial revolution electronics and information technology leave alone those of 4ir the reality though is the pace of change or the quantum leap of technology from one revolution to another is so swift that countries can no longer be complacent what this means is that the world is waking up every morning with news of next big thing hitting the market a sleeper will find himself being overtaken by all others who are continuously awake and vigilant on the developments in new technologies so gota should wake up and fight his economic war to a conclusion as he did in the case of his other wars the writer a former deputy governor of the central bank of sri lanka can be reached at waw1949 gmail com

death of major general qassem soleimani head of the elite quds force who was also one of iran s most influential figures and by iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei s vow of revenge us secretary of state mike pompeo said the strike aimed to disrupt an imminent attack that would have endangered americans in the middle east the most dramatic moves were in the oil markets with brent

is something that could have major cross asset implications said salman ahmed lombard odier s chief investment strategist what is critical is how it pans out in the next few days ahmed said whether it turns into a theme depends on iran s reaction and then the us response iran promised harsh revenge the quds force and its paramilitary proxies have ample means to mount a response in september us officials blamed iran for attacking the oil installations of saudi aramco the state energy giant and the world s largest oil exporter iran has denied responsibility for the strikes and accused washington of warmongering the trump administration then did not respond beyond heated rhetoric and threats and markets settled down within a week after brent surged 14 6 percent its biggest one day

the pound to euro rate week ahead charts point to new highs as brexit bill set to clear parliament image adobe images gbp pares gains amid spike in geopolitical tensions charts tip post referendum high for gbp eur ahead but u s iran tensions set to dominate fx this week brexit bill could clear parliamentary hurdle this week eur to take cues from usd german economic data technical studies suggest sterling could yet still rise to levels against the euro not seen since 2016 however such gains are unlikely to occur as soon as this week as the uk currency endures a soft start to 2020 sterling was on the back foot as the new year commended with the move lower coming without any obvious catalyst but some analysts suggest lingering anxieties over upcoming trade negotiations between the eu and uk could be playing a part in the currency s weakness the pound is likely to remain in a consolidative pattern against the euro over coming days as the soft start to 2020 extends a little further however at some point over coming weeks the gbp eur exchange rate could recommence themedium term rally that has been in place since august 2019 technical analysts at commerzbank have suggested that a break above the exchange rate s recent high around 1 2080 could still be achievable and the pound is a buy upon any weakness above pound to euro rate shown at 4 hour intervals our bias within these two limits is neutral but near term while capped by the 5 month downtrend we will err on the bearish side and allow for another failure and possible retest of the 0 8239 recent low says karen jones head of technical analysis at commerzbank referring to the inverse of gbp eur a eur gbp rate of 0 8239 would mean a pound to euro rate of 1 2137 which is above the recent peak around 1 2080 and would be the highest level seen by sterling against the euro since june 29 2016 barely more than a week after the brexit referendum jones says the eur gbp rate will remain offered below the 55 day moving average of 0 8587 which means the pound to euro rate is expected to retain an upside bias above 1 1645 but she s told clients to walk away from their bets on sterling if the exchange rate happens to fall below 1 1627 eur gbp at the end of last year spiked down to but recovered from the 55 quarter moving average at 8226 but the rebound has so far been capped by the 5 month downtrend at 8596 jones writes in a briefing to clients above pound to euro rate shown at weekly intervals aa pound sterling what to watch pound sterling softened against both the euro and dollar heading into the weekend as investors responded to an admission by president donald trump that u s forces were responsible for the killing of a senior iranian military commander in iraq stoking tensions between the two rivals that are likely to again set the agenda in currency markets early in the new week tensions were already rising between the u s and iran after the white house said the u s was responsible for an earlier missile attack on an iran backed militant group in iraq although the death of targeting of general qassem soleimani earlier in the week has exacerbated the fued and president trump may now have upped the stakes again when saying via his twitter feed late saturday the u s has preselected 52 sites inside iran for attack in the event that any of its bases or personnel in iraq or elsewhere are targeted by iran enabled forces investors are unlikely to welcome the hawkish white house rhetoric which could see risk assets remain on the back foot monday and safe havens continue to outperform that would benefit the dollar against all currencies other than the japanese yen and swiss franc but it also provide support to the euro in the short term if it forces more international investors out of emerging markets in that environment the now slow moving domestic story could easily fall by the wayside for sterling monday sees the ihs markit final services pmi for december released at 09 30 and consensus is for the earlier flash estimate of 49 0 to be revised higher to 49 1 although risk might be to the downside given that both the construction and manufacturing surveys have already surprised on the downside despite markets also looking for upward revisions there too figures covering the pre election period are affected by high political uncertainty so the poor pmis for december shouldn t cause too much concern says andrew wishart at capital economics the first clean data for the post election period it is in these we need to see some improvement in order to confirm a boris bounce if that doesn t happen expect interest rates to be cut in the following months tuesday sees the withdrawal agreement bill back before parliament for the committee stage before the whole of house which could take until the end of wednesday while lords amendments and the third reading of the bill are expected to take place thursday the bill is the legislative vehicle through which the withdrawal agreement is brought into force prime minister boris johnson s withdrawal bill is widely expected to become law given the scale of the conservative majority so the event itself is seen by analysts as unlikely to move the pound which will leave sterling to take its cues from developments in the international arena and on the charts that being said johnson will meet european commission chief ursula von der leyen in downing street on wednesday as markets wait to hear if a possible february visit to the u s and meeting with president donald trump will be confirmed senior tories have been calling for the government to waste no time in starting parallel trade negotiations with the u s and foreign secretary dominic raab is set to meet secretary of state mike pompeo in london thursday although that meeting may now be overshadowed by the state department s ire over the uk s response to recent events in iraq which has echoed that of france and germany three and a half years after the eu membership referendum the uk will finally leave the eu in 4 weeks time says jane foely head of fx strategy at rabobank the tone and the pace of the talks between the uk and the eu will be instrumental for guiding gbp in the months ahead and we see ample scope for gbp usd to dip back to the 1 28 area as politicians on both sides lay out their positions if an appropriate deal is successfully negotiated it is possible that gbp usd could trade in a 1 35 1 40 range in 2021 that said there is a lot of ground to be covered before this becomes a realistic prospect aa the euro what to watch europe s single currency advanced on the dollar and pound during the european session friday but still close the week a fraction lower against both although the outlook for the week ahead is uncertain the euro was borrowed and sold frequently last year in order to fund wagers on emerging market currencies which have all cratered ever since the killing of iran s general general qassem soleimani so it could benefit intermittently from weakness in the developing world if investors have to buy back the single currency in order to exit their exotic trades and those emerging market currencies not to mention other risk assets might not fare too well on monday when markets wake to the latest threats from the u s against iran the japanese yen should once again outperform especially against those risk sensitive currencies directly exposed to oil exports via the straits of hormuz i e the korean won and the indian rupee notably eur usd has shown very little correlation with world equities over recent months and on balance we would favour higher usd yields and us near energy independence keeping eur usd gently offered says chris turner head of strategy at ing fresh geopolitical tensions have prompted fears of a conflict with iran in the gulf and thrown the dollar a lifeline because previously it was being crushed by jubilation over trump s claim that the much vaunted but always elusive phase one deal to end the trade war with china will be signed at the white house on january 15 that had fueled an increase in so called risk currencies as well as the euro although economic data due out of europe will also have an impact on the euro to dollar rate in the week ahead key items on the economic docket include eurozone inflation figures for december as well as german factory orders and industrial production numbers for november with europe s most recent and ongoing bout of economic weakness having its roots in the industrial sector of the continent s largest economy wednesday and thursday s figures will be watched closely by the market for signs of a turnaround especially after china s manufacturing pmi indices were shown stabilising for the month of december suggesting the worst of the global industrial sector s woes may now be behind it markets are looking for eurozone inflation to rise from 1 to 1 3 for the month of december and for the core rate of inflation which excludes food and energy items from the goods basket to hold steady at 1 3 the numbers are unlikely to cause any harm to the euro although the european central bank ecb is seen as unlikely to lift its interest rate any time soon whatever the economic and inflationary weather so the data might not do much positive for the single currency either german factory orders are expected to have risen 0 3 in november after declining 0 4 in october while industrial production is seen rising 0 9 which would partially reverse a 1 7 decline from the previous month the numbers will need to beat market expectations in order to have any hope of engineering and upturn in the euro to dollar rate the greenback remains a well functioning safe haven for global investors when geopolitical risks are involved when the bombs fall investors push into the dollar says ulrich leuchtmann head of fx strategy at commerzbank it is therefore not surprising that in light of the news of us air strikes on iran the dollar index dxy is rising and marching towards 97 00 again and that eur usd is relinquishing most of its gains from the end of 2019
washington the federal reserve s policymaking committee saw much less risk of recession at its meeting last month when it kept interest rates steady after three straight cuts and signaled that it expected to keep low rates unchanged through this year minutes of the december meeting released friday showed that fed officials favored keeping rates in a low range of 1 5 to 1 75 to cushion the u s economy from slow global growth and the trump administration s trade conflicts officials were also concerned that inflation still hadn t reached the fed s target level of 2 still many fed policymakers at the dec 10 11 meeting expressed the view that the risks of a u s china trade war had diminished along with the probability of a disruptive brexit the meeting occurred two days before the trump administration and beijing reached a preliminary trade deal though press reports had already suggested that an initial agreement was near at their meeting last month fed officials noted that the u s economy was showing resilience despite the trade fights and a weak global economy the minutes said a rise in long term rates also suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months since last month s meeting though tensions have escalated in the middle east as the trump administration has confronted iranian backed forces in iraq on friday stocks sank on wall street and oil prices jumped after u s forces in iraq killed a top iranian general yet many analysts say higher oil prices could potentially benefit the u s economy because of the sharp increase in the past decade in u s oil production higher oil prices encourage energy companies to invest in drilling wells which boosts demand for steel pipe and other equipment from u s factories and creates jobs those trends increasingly offset the drag on consumer spending exerted by higher gas prices joe brusuelas chief economist at the tax advisory firm rsm suggested that the risks to the u s economy are for now contained as a result we do not expect any action by the federal reserve brusuelas said there would need to be a much greater disruption to oil supply from the persian gulf to warrant a rate cut by the fed in the near term but should iran respond to the attack and military action escalates the danger to the u s economy could increase economists said the wild card is whether turmoil in the middle east triggers a sustained sell off in equities depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labor market and inflation concerns become secondary said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics though the fed s policymaking committee voted unanimously last month in favor of keeping rates unchanged several members voiced concerns about the long term consequences of very low rates keeping rates ultra low could fuel excessive risk taking on wall street a few participants warned which could lead to dangerous asset bubbles if those bubbles were to burst it could make the next recession more severe than otherwise but a greater number of fed officials felt that the job market could still strengthen and draw more people off the sidelines into jobs without sending inflation up too much that sentiment would favor keeping rates low to further reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth chairman jerome powell echoed that view in the post meeting news conference signaling that the fed was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future we have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation powell said at the news conference fed officials also expressed concern that americans expectation for future inflation was too low inflation expectations some argue can become self fulfilling if workers expect low inflation they re less likely to demand higher pay which in turn allows companies to keep a lid on prices low inflation expectations are another reason for the fed to keep rates down in hopes that they will eventually boost inflation in comments since the december meeting fed officials have remained upbeat about the economy s prospects in remarks titled is a recession around the corner thomas barkin president of the federal reserve bank of richmond said he was concerned about the weakness in business investment which he attributed to uncertainty caused by factors ranging from rising middle east tensions to the outcome of trade talks with china but he said there were reasons to be optimistic including the benefits of the fed s three rate cuts last year while there is always the risk of a shock the fed has done a lot to support the economy s continued expansion and to provide buffers against the downside barkin said in comments to a bankers association meeting in baltimore
investors placed the longest economic expansion in history on death watch last summer when recession fears ran rampant although their concerns have receded and the stock market has rallied forcefully into a new year recession remains a top concern there s some good news amid the gloom since world war ii the length of time the economy has spent in a recession has been shrinking goldman sachs data shows this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now the fact that we re still experiencing a record long expansion is proof that the economy has become more durable also the federal reserve s emergency support after the financial crisis persists to this day and is keeping both financial markets and economic data in good shape to explain this resilience even further goldman economists dug into the past century of recessions to unearth the most common catalysts their analysis turned up five major factors which can be split up as follows the first three have lost their potency over time and do not pose any imminent threat however there are brand new risks embedded in the final two here they are complete with goldman s assessment of the ongoing threat level 1 industrial shocks and inventory imbalances the manufacturing sector s risk to the economy has diminished since the 1980s thanks to improvements in technology and smarter forecasting techniques manufacturers have become better at forestalling shocks to their output in addition the manufacturing sector now contributes far less to economic growth than services which adds about two thirds 2 oil price shocks the us first sunk into a recession on account of an oil spike in 1973 related stories but since then price fluctuations have been having a diminishing impact on how the economy fares the shale boom of the 2010s was partly responsible for this cushioning as investment in the infrastructure used to extract and refine oil offset the hit to consumption that came about because of higher prices 3 aggressive rate hikes the fed has historically hastened recessions by hiking interest rates too quickly in the face of inflation the most important structural change is the improvement in monetary policy that has flattened the phillips curve and firmly anchored inflation expectations on the fed s 2 target said jan hatzius goldman s chief economist in a note this means the fed can show more restraint even when inflation pressures are bubbling 4 financial imbalances and asset price crashes the combo of excessive subprime lending and a housing bubble proved lethal and led to the great recession despite the clean up efforts of banks and regulators after the recession financial risk remains an important threat in principle according to hatzius he cited two rising trends to back up this assertion first the share of gross domestic product that is derived from financial assets is near historic highs in other words the financial sector matters a lot more to the economy secondly there is a higher correlation between us and other developed market stock returns meaning that the domestic market is more sensitive to foreign shocks hatzius sees the risks stemming from these two trends as lying dormant for now but they will be new when they arise 5 fiscal tightening herein lies the second and final source of new risks on hatzius radar optimum decisions on tax policy and government spending which make up fiscal policy could be jeopardized because washington is plagued by dysfunction hatzius added this dysfunction has created new economic risks arising from events such as shutdowns and debt ceiling fights that can have substantial effects on financial conditions and growth the hyper partisanship exists at a time of soaring government deficits the implication is that even if the right fiscal policy is implemented it may prove to be less effective at averting a recession
telegram gazette staff central massachusetts showed economic strength in 2019 and moves into the new year on strong legs the telegram gazette asked business and economic leaders about their expectations for 2020 we posed two questions 1 what are your expectations or predictions for the business climate in central massachusetts as we move into 2020 do you see economic vitality and job growth 2 what trends do you see emerging in 2020 in your industry or the local business environment or local economic development in general here is what they had to say tim murray president and ceo of worcester regional chamber of commerce 1 i believe we will see continued economic development momentum in central massachusetts worcester s growing recognition as an innovation hub for the region s diverse economy should continue to drive this growth transportation housing and tax policies will influence the extent by which the region can fully leverage this momentum 2 as an organization that represents a broad based cross section of businesses of all sizes and sectors issues around access to talent and expanding the workforce pipelining to include workforce training programs are critical to the region s economic growth john c roche president and ceo of hanover insurance 1 the momentum established in central massachusetts over the past several years was increasingly evident in 2019 and bodes very well for sustained economic vitality and growth i am as bullish as ever about the region s prospects given the continued cooperation and coordination among the public and private sectors and from a mix of longtime central massachusetts advocates and newcomers who recognize the region s tremendous promise the breadth of our revitalization involving commercial and residential development hospitality retail entertainment the arts and more will continue to generate strong economic growth and prosperity as central massachusetts becomes an even more conspicuous alternative to greater boston and realizes its potential 2 the strength of the u s economy is reflected throughout our industry as well as in many industries throughout central massachusetts while competition continues to intensify globally in our business and across our region opportunities are developing for companies with the ability to anticipate emerging consumer demands and expectations and to innovate and improve the customer experience companies that can rise to the challenges ahead will prosper consumers will benefit from enhanced pricing choice and convenience investors will be rewarded and communities will be advantaged dan rea executive vice president of worcester red sox 1 when we first announced our intention to build polar park in august 2018 one of the biggest factors in our decision was the robust and still developing business climate in worcester and central mass as a whole since our announcement we ve seen nothing to change our opinion or dissuade us from that initial optimism and we re galvanized by the fact that the story of our ballpark and its surrounding development is but one piece of a broader mosaic of growth around the city 2 from allen fletcher s project bringing online a ground floor market and residential units in kelley square to the recent restaurant announcements made by chip norton and his team at the mercantile center we re grateful to the coalition of private business people and public officials who have cultivated this growing scene this scene will soon include our ballpark and its mixed use development components nearby and we re excited to see the momentum proceed in 2020 as we and others continue our work michael crawford senior vice president and worcester market executive rockland trust 1 rockland trust is bullish on worcester my expectation for the 2020 business climate in central mass is continued strength and growth in fact we are in the midst of hiring additional commercial lending staff and will be opening our first branch in the city this year with the many ongoing development projects new businesses openings and worcester s private and public leadership there is significant activity and a distinct air of optimism in the community which should continue 2 a trend i have noticed is the heightened amount of interest and investment dollars coming from outside the region into the city we all know about the sale of the 446 and 600 main street high rise properties both were very large sales however just in the last week i have heard from four separate boston area investors who were calling about financing for smaller properties in worcester worcester s resurgence is no longer our secret dr eric w dickson president and ceo of umass memorial health care 1 worcester has an incredible opportunity for jobs and economic growth especially in the health care space each year 10 000 patients from central massachusetts are transferred to boston area hospitals for services and procedures that if we had the space could be done here in worcester this outmigration not only increases the cost of medical insurance for employers in the region but also costs the region several thousand high paying jobs that migrate with the patients to boston we have to improve our medical infrastructure in the region to keep costs low for employers while reaping the employment and financial benefits of maintaining the associated jobs here in worcester 2 i think we are seeing a greater outpouring from hospitals across the country who are looking to address social determinants of health issues that are roadblocks to wellness for people in our communities i could not be prouder of the work anchor mission organizations like ours have done over the past year to attack the problems our patients face outside of the hospital setting it is the most inspiring new trend in health care and i am glad umass memorial has been an early adaptor additionally we and other organizations will continue to leverage virtual medicine digital diagnostics and digital therapeutics to provide care in non traditional settings over the next decade i predict that digital medicine will transform healthcare robert morton ceo of bankhometown 1 local business owners are as positively optimistic about 2020 as they were about 2019 if not more so outside investment into worcester like the planned addition of the woosox continues to provide the necessary shot in the arm for local economic development which in turn creates an environment for favorable business growth in the new year any expectation that exists for a recession indicates that it would be at least a couple of years off and generally mild 2 despite local business owners high level of optimism a lack of skilled talent necessary to fill critical job openings continues to be a challenge therefore business owners who are able to attract train and motivate new talent will enjoy the greatest levels of success in 2020 and into 2021 craig blais president and ceo of the worcester business development corp 1 in the worcester area i anticipate more growth and expansion as confidence in investment and return becomes more certain we expect continued growth in the the life sciences and more mixed use development in addition we will see more expansion in both affordable and market rate housing we must continue to develop pad ready sites for developers and end users 2 i see more mixed use investment specifically in the canal district and downtown as the ballpark infrastructure upgrades and contiguous development matures in the coming months anthony consigli ceo of consigli construction 1 our expectation for the general business climate in massachusetts in 2020 is for it to be relatively consistent from 2019 we would be surprised if there were major changes nationally prior to an election locally massachusetts and central mass continue to benefit by having so many positive attributes for business right here 2 we hope that more economic expansion continues westward from boston due to challenges with transportation permitting and real estate and construction costs we expect construction to slow a bit in 2020 not because of the economy but because of a continued strain on skilled labor and the resulting costs impact owners looking to build for their business or organization are searching for ways of lessening building costs without exposing themselves to higher costs in later years by building poorer quality steve rotman ceo of vystar which acquired rotmans 1 i anticipate a continued healthy business climate in central massachusetts with the expanding transportation infrastructure being a key factor thanks to investments in rail and the worcester airport a lot of businesses are relocating here and that in turn is attracting home buyers who appreciate the lower cost of living and doing business here and easy access to numerous large cities within a 50 mile radius including boston providence hartford springfield lowell nashua fitchburg leominster and gardner we are seeing an evolution where older buildings are being acquired by visionary well capitalized developers and investors who are planning and or executing renovations to adapt them to the new digital economy in some cases buildings are being transformed for mixed commercial residential use the inclusion of residential units in commercial buildings helps keep the downtown areas vibrant and reduces traffic congestion as residents are living in close proximity to work restaurants and other services they use this helps these smaller businesses thrive as well 2 while traditional retail overall is declining as can be seen in how shopping malls are struggling we are seeing job growth in e commerce not just for the furniture sector but across many sectors i expect to see continued growth in this area all types of businesses should be planning their e commerce strategies if they want to survive as for rotmans furniture many customers still want to sit on or touch the furniture before they buy it so we don t see our retail footprint decreasing anytime soon however over the past several years in line with the national trend we have been expanding our e commerce business to serve the growing number of consumers who want the convenience of shopping online and having quality merchandise delivered quickly to their doors with vystar which in addition to owning rotmans produces vytex low protein latex used in many types of products and rxair uv light air purifiers almost all consumer sales are online or business to business and we expect that to continue due to increased demand and to better service our customers we have expanded our shipping to 7 days week and added next day and same day delivery throughout new england edward f manzi jr chairman and ceo of fidelity bank 1 i expect 2020 to be a strong year conversations we have had with our client base have been very positive a big part of what is driving the positive momentum is that asset values of all kinds are going up when that happens people feel good because their balance sheets are stronger the demand for credit is strong delinquency rates are low and the demand for talent is high these are the kinds of factors we can see that suggest things are still healthy news events such as the death of qassem soleimani and the 2020 election are worth watching because they can be potential sources of volatility affecting both assets and confidence the results could have a lasting effect on the economy 2 community banking has a strong future people still want a local source for sound financial information they can use to make good decisions i expect the trend towards consolidation in the community banking space will continue in the first quarter of 2020 fidelity bank will be finalizing our merger with family federal savings our third merger in four years overall central massachusetts will continue to see a migration of capital from the outside moving into our region strong local leadership from city officials in worcester fitchburg leominster and gardner as well as our local chambers of commerce have led to sustained economic growth that helps companies invest in the market with confidence richard burke president and ceo of fallon health 1 persistence it s a trait that the city of worcester has long exemplified and the momentum we are now seeing is the reward of that continued course of action carried by the success of the downtown and the impact of the worcester red sox worcester is experiencing a period of growth and renewed energy that catalyst exists because of the commitment and optimism by many who deeply believe in this community and continue to make investments in it the many positive changes taking place are helping to make this region even more attractive and i believe the future here is bright 2 healthcare is an evolving industry we will continue to see efforts to address key health care cost drivers including prescription drugs we will see closer collaboration among payors providers and policymakers to find ways to deliver high quality care at a more affordable cost we may see more provider consolidation which affects health care costs additionally we can expect to see movement towards integrating and investing in behavioral health and primary care the two main entry points to the health care delivery system andy davis director of worcester regional airport 1 with the surge in commercial real estate activity construction and in the service sector with more hotel rooms sports and dining options over the past few years worcester and central mass have built a solid foundation for jobs and economic growth the region should continue to see more positive economic activity in 2020 with worcester regional airport as a connection to the national and global economy in 2019 a study released by massdot showed worcester regional airport has an economic impact of 97 million a 109 increase from a similar study in 2014 we expect this growth trend to continue in 2020 and beyond as more people recognize the airport s convenience and affordability 2 with a continued strong economy demand for both business and leisure travel should grow and airlines will want to compete for that business with more flight options what will be key for worcester regional airport to reap the benefits of increased service is for the region to support the flights we have today there are over 1 million residents that live closer to worcester than any of the other surrounding airports in 2019 they flew over 3 million times and almost 200 000 used worcester it won t take much to grow that number and prove to the air carriers that there is demand for more flight options steve joseph senior vice president of unum 1 we ve called worcester home for 90 years and we re excited to be part of the continued renaissance of downtown what we re seeing here mirrors the economic growth occurring throughout the country as more people join the workforce and participate in our growing economy 2 as a leading provider of employee benefits offered through the workplace employment trends play a key role in our business we ve seen a strong labor market for the last several years and believe that trend will continue companies like ours prosper in a low unemployment environment as demand for employee benefits grows that also drives competition for talent something we re seeing across the u s james umphrey principal at kelleher sadowsky 1 2019 showed strength in nearly every sector of the economy although manufacturing has slowed over the past decade many companies that manufacture in specific niches that require technology and engineering expertise have been growing at rapid rates worcester county has become very viable location for warehouse distribution companies as well as those in the fulfillment sector this is primarily due to a lower cost of land and space as well as a very central location for distribution throughout new england the service sector of the economy continues to grow throughout this region of the state and i am bullish that this will continue due to affordable real estate and an attractive labor pool especially young people graduating from local colleges and universities 2 there is a trend in the industrial sector to either repurpose older mill type properties into housing or demolish existing buildings and construct new warehouse distribution centers in the office segment we see a continued turn for companies to move back into urban environments in order to satisfy younger workers millennials in particular i think that there will be a continued trend to see more housing developed in urban areas such as downtown worcester due to strong demand and economic incentives such as opportunity zones low interest rates continue to be a strong factor in making real estate one of the most attractive investments in the future harry kokkinis president of table talk pies 1 table talk pies is proud to be a part of massachusetts food manufacturing industry which is such an important part of our economy we believe that food and beverage manufacturing will continue to play a strong role in the economic vitality and job growth to this region in 2020 and for the foreseeable future we are grateful for all of the talented and passionate members of the table talk team this community provides and we are committed to attracting and training future generations who want to make pies with us 2 this is a really exciting time in the history of worcester public and private investment is fueling a renaissance in our city that is great to witness the construction of polar park and the relocation of the triple a affiliate of the boston red sox to worcester is already having a positive impact on our community we believe it will bring about long term economic and cultural benefits we are proud to be a part of this renaissance worcester has also become a destination for those who love food with many new restaurants and specialty food shops opening this development has inspired us to start offering new flavors such as our limited edition pancake pie in addition to our traditional favorites we will also be launching a new line of 4 inch snack pies in partnership with nestle usa this year we hope these new pies chocolate pecan pie chocolate coconut pie and chocolate chip cookie pie made with nestle toll house morsels will become customer favorites in the years to come robert d cox jr managing partner bowditch dewey 1 i expect economic vitality and job growth in the worcester area in 2020 and beyond with increased traffic congestion we re going to see an influx of people wanting to reduce their commuting time into the city the impressive occupancy rates of new residential developments like 145 front street at city square are examples of what s to come these will build momentum for a walkable downtown with restaurants and entertainment options as more people see worcester as a place to live work and play 2 two interlocking trends will surface concerns about climate change and traffic congestion with the next generation exerting even more pressure to act on them the median age in worcester s urban core is 30 in september the city adopted a resolution endorsing a declaration of climate emergency requesting regional collaboration to mitigate climate change prepare infrastructure and protect residents by among other things revitalizing public transportation incentivizing use of clean motor vehicles and making best use of our roads and infrastructure that gets back to making worcester s downtown a walkable city with more residential development charles chip norton jr owner of the mercantile center 1 worcester is well positioned to continue with its strong economic performance through 2020 worcester has developed a very diverse economic foundation of health care life science medical research manufacturing warehouse distribution and a strong service sector with affordable housing and labor and a high level of intellectual capital worcester continues to be a very attractive place for companies to relocate to or continue to grow within the community 2 i see a continued trend of new market rate housing being built and a continuation of people living in worcester and commuting to the boston area also i see a continuation of companies migrating back into urban office settings overall i see a real estate market that continues to grow and receive more investment from outside developers opportunity zones will continue to drive development in the designated areas providing housing and new office and industrial space edward m augustus jr worcester city manager 1 we ve had a strong year and we see that momentum continuing into 2020 in the city of worcester there were nearly a thousand more building permits issued in 2019 as compared to the year before which is an increase of about 20 percent this is a welcome sign that we re poised for continued growth in the year ahead and beyond 2 there s been a high demand for housing as the market continues to be strong housing developers are looking to meet a growing demand for all types of housing among different groups including professionals empty nesters and seniors the city s already burgeoning food and dining scene also continues to expand with the announcement this year of two exciting restaurants coming to mercantile center in ruth s chris and a project from broadway hospitality group owners of tavern in the square
the difference between success and failure in forex trading is very likely to depend upon which currency pairs you choose to trade each week and not on the exact trading methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits each week i am going to analyze fundamentals sentiment and technical positions in order to determine which currency pairs are most likely to produce the easiest and most profitable trading opportunities over the next week in some cases it will be trading the trend in other cases it will be trading support and resistance levels during more ranging markets big picture 5th january 2020 in my previous piece last week i forecasted that the best trades were likely to be long of the s p 500 index following a daily new york close above 3240 and long of the eur usd and nzd usd currency pairs these were not good calls as the s p 500 index closed at 3257 9 on thursday but then closed down on friday by 0 71 from there the eur usd closed down by 0 18 while the nzd usd currency pair closed down by 0 51 last week s trades produced an averaged loss of 0 47 last week s forex market saw the strongest rise in the relative value of the japanese yen and the strongest fall in the relative value of the australian dollar fundamental analysis market sentiment fundamental analysts are leaning in favor of the view that the recent quarter point cut in the u s interest rate will be the last cut for a while with recent fomc meeting minutes showing that the fomc is broadly satisfied to stand still for the foreseeable future on rates the u s economy is still growing but there are some fears of a pending recession a major issue concerning sentiment on the u s and global economies is the trade dispute between the u s and china although the situation has improved here as it seems that phase one of a u s china trade deal is about to be signed market sentiment is dominated by rising tension in the middle east following the u s action on friday which killed the iranian general in charge of iran s proxy military activities this event saw stocks lower and safe haven assets notably gold rise in value while riskier assets began to sell off friday produced counter trend moves which have sent most of the long term trends in the forex market into seeming hibernation however the price of crude oil and therefore the canadian dollar got a boost on friday as did gold so we do see a valid long term bullish trend in gold and a bearish one in the usd cad currency pair technical analysis u s dollar index the weekly price chart below shows last week printed a bullish pin candlestick which closed near the top of its price range this is a weakly bullish sign but the price is below its levels from both 3 and 6 months ago which indicates a long term bearish trend the price is well below the key resistance level at 12310 we have mostly bearish signs here but the short term bullish action makes this week s direction hard to predict gold usd gold in usd terms just made its highest weekly close in more than 6 and a half years at the end of last week last week s candlestick candlestick was strongly bullish on above average volatility and closed almost right on its high both of which are bullish signs gold was already strengthening but the safe haven asset got a boost at the end of the week as military tensions in the middle east spiked the only thing bulls seem to have to worry about is the potentially resistant inflection price just ahead at 1557 31 but the price seems poised to continue to make a major long term bullish breakout usd cad the price of this currency pair made its lowest weekly close in almost 18 months at the end of last week this is a bearish sign but note that this long term trend can be bouncy and we already saw a bullish bounce here from the support level at 1 2962 so bears should probably be a little cautious and try to manage short trades actively on shorter time frames the main reason for the sharp move down at the end of last week was the spike in the price of crude oil which has boosted the canadian dollar but it is also true that the canadian dollar was already quite strong conclusion this week i forecast the best trades are likely to be long of gold in usd terms and short of the usd cad currency pair
british prime minister boris johnson is not the type of leader able to navigate a divided country through a dimly understood political project that requires difficult decisions and concessions with limited upside benefits along with a lot of hard work says the writer llustrative image epa efe facundo arrizabalaga eu flag wikimedia org by the end of january 2020 the uk should have passed the withdrawal agreement bill into legislation giving prime minister boris johnson s conservative party led government full discretion to finalise a new trade deal with the european union eu by the end of 2020 the withdrawal bill makes it illegal to extend talks beyond 2020 there is a commonly held view that the johnson government which now has a solid parliamentary majority is in a much better position to negotiate a good deal with brussels this view is wrong while the decision to leave the eu is a political decision the process of actually leaving and making the necessary arrangements subsequent to leaving is an economic and legal technical question a parliamentary but not a popular majority might allow johnson s government discretion to strike a deal with the eu but he will find that he can t negotiate with objective reality one objective reality is the uk s geographical location just off europe the gravity theory of trade is well established empirically and theoretically the proximity of trading partners is more important than the size of the economy over half of the uk s trade is with other eu countries the uk s trade with the netherlands alone is as much as 50 of the value of the uk s trade with the us an economy 20 times the size of the netherlands even at the height of the british empire britain s trade with europe was bigger than its trade with its colonies this is true for the southern african region too despite its relatively small economy south africa is the largest trading partner to many of its neighbouring countries on the continent even if the uk were to leave the eu without a deal its largest trading partners would still be in europe and would remain so into the future johnson and his government having learnt very little over the past three years will also have to understand what the eu is and what can reasonably be negotiated at its core the eu operates firstly as a customs union and then more recently as a single also known as the common market a customs union is the establishment of a single customs territory among different countries so that duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce are eliminated with respect to substantially all the trade between the members and that the same duties and other regulations of commerce are applied by each of the members of the union to other countries via a common external tariff the southern african customs union sacu is the world s first customs union and it is via sacu that south africa has a free trade agreement with europe turkey is in a customs union with the eu the single or common market is different article 26 of the treaty of the functioning of the european union tfeu where it is referred to as the internal market is an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods persons services and capital the four freedoms is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the treaties the single market extends beyond the eu to members of the european economic area eea which includes european free trade association efta countries norway iceland and liechtenstein eu single market rules apply through harmonising processes a special court and a surveillance authority but for the efta states it excludes trade in agricultural and food products the other efta member switzerland has its own harmonisation and surveillance arrangements with the eu effectively efta countries are rule takers from the eu and have limited influence on the formulation of the rules the purpose of the single market is to remove regulatory barriers between members including state support for companies the single market rules provisions are then enforced by rulings from the european court of justice the single market further requires the progressive harmonisation of national laws establishing common rules to guarantee both free circulation of goods and services the catch is this by replacing national codes and the freedom to legislate single market regulation ceases to act as barriers to trade another way of understanding the single market is through the analogy of building blocks the first of which is a body of law specifying minimum requirements for the safety and environmental impacts of a wide range of products linked to a tranche of standards legislation defining technical or quality requirements the second building block is a body of law defining conformity assessment procedures and a system of accreditation to ensure that conformity assessment bodies have the technical capacity to perform their tasks another building block of the single market in goods is ce marking used to signify that products have been assessed in accordance with relevant eu rules and meet the relevant safety health and environmental protection requirements the final building block is legal metrology with legislation providing a consistent basis for measurements weights and so on the single market therefore can be understood to be a regulatory union the logical outcome of the four freedoms what this means in practice is regulation of a wide range of matters that would otherwise have to be regulated by each country s national legislatures or lawmakers efta members are not in the eu s customs union and could therefore negotiate their own trade or partnership agreements with other countries but the scope to do so is very limited due to their participation in the single market the eu itself has 40 comprehensive free trade agreements covering 70 countries and various other trade arrangements or partnerships with most of the rest of the world for the uk these 40 eu trade agreements represent about 11 of the uk s trade and includes that component of its trade with south africa it is possible and a likely outcome that the uk could formally leave the eu but remain within the single market for the uk this would mean brexit in name only and a worse deal than it already has in almost every respect the arrangement works for norway as it can exercise full jurisdiction of its large fishing sector and can maintain its own agricultural policies but over 50 of norway s exports are oil and gas both globally traded commodities and not regulated by the eu moreover norway has just 8 of the uk s population and its economy is just 15 of the size of the uk s the uk in contrast is a much more diversified economy the second or third biggest in the eu and far more tightly integrated with the broader eu economy like norway the uk does have a fishing sector but it is much smaller than norway s and it s a vanishingly small part of the uk s national economy in addition norway s contributions to the eu budget that secures its participation in the single market is on a per capita basis not far off what the uk already contributes as a full eu member efta member countries being relatively small countries within the context of the 500 million population of the eu would not significantly increase their influence if they were eu members the uk is different having a country and an economy the size of the uk s outside the eu decision making process yet being a rule taker and a significant contributor to the eu s budget but also unable to negotiate different arrangements with other countries by virtue of its participation in the single market just expands the democratic deficit and defeats the whole stated purpose of brexit leaving the single market however looks very difficult to do and any benefits if there are any will be hard to realise a vast body of law the so called eu acquis communautaire necessary for the uk to participate in the single market is already national legislation having the freedom to change say food standard regulation or product or financial market regulation is one thing but what should the replacement regulation if any look like are uk consumers of say food less demanding of health and safety standards than their continental counterparts efta countries have never been in the eu and have over time built an extensive bureaucracy including protocols around border checks over time for the uk all of this will have to start from scratch a case of unscrambling an egg leaving the eu s customs union and single market would require the negotiation of a free trade agreement the basics of which would have to be in place in its withdrawal agreement the starting point for all trade agreements are the rules of the world trade organisation which requires of its 164 members that countries treat each other equally with regard to tariffs and services market access known as most favoured nation preferential treatment regarding tariffs is only allowed in a free trade agreement provided this covers substantially all trade unilaterally dropping tariffs for some countries and not for others is not permitted agreeing to reduce tariffs for thousands of product lines and the quotas quantity for which those tariffs apply is just the first step securing preferential tariffs in a free trade agreement requires proof that a product comes substantively from one of the parties known as rules of origin these prevent a country not part of a free trade agreement simply rerouting its products through a country that is in a free trade agreement wto rules covering rules of origin require substantial documentation processes protocols on mutual recognition of customs processes and unavoidably border checks for compliance having operated within the eu very little of the customs checks bureaucracy and related infrastructure such as truck and trailer parking exists on either the uk or eu side the nature and extent of these will be the outcome of the trade deal if any that can finally get negotiated the issue of hard borders between northern ireland and the republic of ireland which would breach the good friday agreement between the uk and the republic of ireland has already resulted in discussions to have northern ireland remain within the eu and therefore not be included in a new uk customs union even after the border and customs infrastructure is put in place the administration of them can be time consuming and costly one estimate is that a third of eu exports which could enjoy lower tariff charges through preferential trade agreements don t claim them to avoid proving origin negotiating trade deals take a long time the recently completed free trade agreement between the eu and canada took seven years to complete larger countries with attractive domestic markets typically set the conditions for access to their larger market they are therefore able to insert conditions regulating competition minimum labour intellectual property public procurement state support of national companies environmental provisions and customs procedures the eu canada agreement contains 30 chapters dealing with just these details none of the above addresses the issue of trade in services trade agreements typically don t deliver significant access to services markets the uk is relatively strong in the services economy and its reach has been considerably strengthened via participation in the eu s single market what does this mean for south africa then in 2018 south africa exported nearly 31 billion of goods to the eu representing 32 of total exports the uk alone represented 7 4 of all sa s exports or 23 of sa s exports to the eu in addition there are many non trade related areas where the eu has agreements with south africa such as development aid investment support and other matters a good deal of south africa s exports to the eu and particularly the uk is in agricultural products which is probably the country s only remaining truly globally competitive sector the free trade agreement with the eu allows south africa to export certain agreed quotas of agricultural products at zero or very low tariffs this is important because average eu tariffs on agricultural products at 12 4 on non agricultural goods are a significant barrier of course south africa has an interest that there is not too much disruption in its major export markets and its main source of foreign direct investment but a raft of questions arise that are difficult to answer should the uk leave the eu will the eu seek to reduce south africa s existing tariff quotas by the amount represented by the uk market if so what is our position on that it would certainly influence how south africa might want to sequence its trade negotiations with the uk shoring up its existing eu free trade agreement before discussions with the uk commence would be wise irrespective of the above what would south africa s negotiating position be when negotiating directly with the uk a free trade agreement with south africa would be a significant prize for the uk but outside the eu its negotiating position would be much weaker how should south africa press home this advantage knowing that the uk has its own farming sector lobby what is the capacity of the uk to negotiate with south africa when it is simultaneously negotiating with the eu the usa china japan australia south korea and many of its other main trading partners each country will be asking itself the same questions and each of them will start the process of a trade negotiation by consulting with business and others as to what they wish to see the detail is all important and there is a lot of it none of this can be done in a year not even remotely whatever the political mandate within the uk might be besides boris johnson the very embodiment of perfidious albion has a record of being dishonourable disloyal and lazy not the type of leader who is able to navigate a divided country through a dimly understood political project that requires difficult decisions and concessions with limited upside benefits along with a lot of hard work

as households adopt rooftop solar they transform generation and its ownership shifting away from utility monopolies and making power production their own paul hawken drawdown as far as the future is concerned it is not a question of foreseeing it but of making it possible antoine de saint exupéry citadelle 1948 december 17 2019 will be remembered as an important day in the history of redding california and its relationship with the planet on which it resides for that was the day a majority of its elected representatives on the city council publicly voted to kill the best local hope for non polluting renewable energy available to us if we hope to avoid a catastrophic transformation of our climate three councilmembers julie winter kristin schreder and erin resner accepted the redding electric utility s argument that a fair rate of payment to customers with rooftop solar is 6 08 cents per kilowatt hour when they sell their excess power back to reu by contrast a consortium of redding s solar companies had proposed an alternative rate of 12 cents per kilowatt hour as the most reasonable compromise between the previous rate of 15 cents and the new six cent rate councilman michael dacquisto had argued that the clear intent of the council was to ensure fairness for everyone and make sure the rate they established would pencil dacquisto defined the term pencil as meaning the minimum amount necessary to keep the local solar industry alive dacquisto said the six cent rate failed the fairness test and would in fact kill the local solar industry at least within the city limits adding we can all agree on that mayor adam mcelvain voted with dacquisto in support of the 12 cent rate the main reason given by those voting for the six cent rate was that the previous rate of 15 cents was an unfair subsidy benefiting customers with solar panels and harming non solar customers especially poor people who cannot afford them dacquisto pointed out that reu said this unfair subsidy amounts to 900 000 a year which means the 43 000 customers without solar would pay an extra 1 75 a month on top of their average electric bill if we assume the average poor person in redding is paying much less than average on their electric bill we can see their portion of the subsidy would amount to less than a dollar a month the question is whether this small cost shift justifies crippling redding s local solar industry when scientists tell us the climate crisis requires that we urgently transition from fossil fuels to renewables such as solar panels in addition as dacquisto pointed out reu and or previous city councils have never had a problem with subsidies before this in fact the councilman pointed out that reu has 10 different rate structures for specific customer groups which suggests that those who pay more subsidize those who pay less david ledger one of the members of the solar committee selected by the city manager to advise them on this issue spoke at the public meeting regarding his concerns he said that reu provides subsidies to low income customers provides new homeowners with a 3000 subsidy and new businesses with a 25 discount on their utility bills the cost of these subsidies is passed on to other reu customers why aren t we concerned about these subsidies the only subsidy reu and the council appear to oppose is one that helps local citizens dramatically reduce their carbon footprint why is this could it be because it is the one subsidy that also reduces reu s revenue it would not be surprising if reu viewed residential rooftop solar as an economic threat the sun s energy is free after all as more people switch to solar less revenue flows to reu but which is more important reu s income or maintaining a livable planet for future generations back in 2008 i had a conversation with paul hauser reu s new director at the time he admitted to me that he was strongly opposed to anyone in redding putting solar panels on their roofs because he said it would be unfair to customers without solar i was stunned if everyone thought this way the whole world would continue to burn fossil fuels which would be catastrophic jim feider who was reu s director from 1997 to 2008 said much the same at the recent public meeting he stated even a six cent subsidy was too much and was an unfair burden on non solar customers are subsidies unfair but is it unfair as the environmental and energy study institute eesi recently stated there is a long history of government intervention in energy markets numerous energy subsidies exist in the u s tax code to promote or subsidize the production of cheap and abundant fossil energy some of these subsidies have been around for a century and while the united states has enjoyed unparalleled economic growth over the past 100 years thanks in no small part to cheap energy in many cases the circumstances relevant at the time subsidies were implemented no longer exist today the domestic fossil fuel industries namely coal oil and natural gas are mature and generally highly profitable additionally numerous clean and renewable alternatives exist which have become increasingly price competitive with traditional fossil fuels according to the international monetary fund imf in 2017 the governments of the world subsidized fossil fuels by 5 2 trillion which includes nearly 300 billion in direct cash payments these are referred to as pretax subsidies when we factor in the full societal and environmental costs of burning fossil fuels the imf finds an additional 4 9 trillion of post tax subsidies according to robinson meyer writing in the atlantic what does this mean according to meyer the burning of fossil fuels releases deadly air pollution hastens the destruction of the climate and sometimes increases traffic fatalities and since all of those things kill people they also depress a country s tax base account for both the harms and the smaller tax base says the imf and you produce an overwhelming number every year for example about 90 000 americans die because of air pollution produced by fossil fuels not renewable energy this means our fellow citizens subsidize air pollution with their life globally air pollution causes an estimated 600 000 deaths each year in children under five mostly from pneumonia one study linked 400 000 deaths worldwide to climate change each year and predicted this number will grow to 600 000 per year by 2030 according to the imf the u s is the second largest subsidizer of fossil fuels in the world totaling 649 billion the imf stated efficient fossil fuel pricing in 2015 would have lowered global carbon emissions by 28 percent and fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46 percent and increased government revenue by 3 8 percent of gdp and while some members of our city council are concerned about hurting poor people by subsidizing energy usage by solar customers our ongoing dependence on fossil fuels is devastating to the poor meyer writes the burning of fossil fuels demands the grant of something valuable not from one equal to another but from the poor to the rich from the weak to the powerful the wealthy can and do burn more fuels after all according to the world bank if allowed to continue at the present rate human caused climate change could force an additional 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years according to the united nations office for human rights climate change will have devastating consequences for people in poverty even under the best case scenario hundreds of millions will face food insecurity forced migration disease and death climate change threatens the future of human rights and risks undoing the last fifty years of progress in development global health and poverty reduction they tell us climate change will have the most severe impact in poor countries and regions and developing countries will bear an estimated 75 80 percent of the costs of climate change as oxfam reports the people least responsible for causing climate change bear the brunt of its impacts poor communities particularly women and marginalized groups face the greatest peril according to the imf each additional ton of carbon we add to the atmosphere which comes from burning just 86 gallons of gasoline adds 40 of global costs because our global emissions are so high and so damaging compared to zero from renewables this alone adds over 1 trillion in costs to all of us who is subsidizing who aren t all of us who are driving electric cars and powering our homes with solar panels subsidizing those who are burning carbon fuels and irreparably damaging the planet so what s the problem in his book the long thaw climate scientist david archer reminds us of what we are doing to the only planet on which life is known to exist by continuing to rely on fossil fuels instead of renewable energy he writes that we add 20 pounds of co2 to the atmosphere for every gallon of gasoline we burn and obtain a benefit of 2500 kilocalories of energy as we know the co2 we emit will trap earth s radiant energy by absorbing infrared radiation for hundreds of years about a quarter of our emissions will last thousands of years archer writes if we add up the total amount of energy trapped by the co2 from the gallon of gas over its atmospheric lifetime we find that it ultimately traps 100 billion kilocalories of useless and unwanted greenhouse heat the bad energy from burning that gallon ultimately outweighs the good energy by a factor of about 40 million as far as i can tell reu and the council are not considering the huge cost all of us are paying as we continue to ignore the climate crisis we are running out of time instead of creating barriers that prevent people from quickly transitioning to renewable energy reu and our city council members should do all they can to facilitate a rapid shift away from fossil fuels for decades climate scientists have warned us that the likelihood of catastrophic or dangerous climate change increases as we burn fossil fuels for our energy and transportation needs they set 1 5 c or 2 7 f as the critical guardrail that we must avoid if we wish to preserve a healthy planet for future generations in order to achieve this all of us must strive to live within a strict carbon budget according to an intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc special report that examined how much carbon we can still burn and not exceed 1 5 c warming as of january of 2018 we only had 420 gigatons gt of co2 left to emit two years have now passed and we have burned through 80 gt 40 gt a year of our greenhouse gas budget which means we only have 340 gt left this gives us only about 8 and a half years if we continue to drive gas powered cars fly on airplanes use electricity from coal and natural gas and raise and eat livestock at the same pace as we have in recent years we will have committed ourselves and our heirs to an extremely hot and hostile planet a recent united nations report warned that if we fail to take this seriously and continue business as usual the earth will warm by 7 f in the next 80 years if we hope to avert catastrophic climate change we need to immediately begin reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent every year starting now by 2030 we will need to produce 50 percent less emissions each year than we do today to avert disaster scientists tell us that we have a 67 chance of keeping the earth from exceeding the 1 5 limit if we follow this course and in case you were wondering we need to be completely carbon free by 2050 one thing all scientists agree on is that we should have begun decarbonizing decades ago the longer we wait the more hopeless it becomes so what s the solution i was recently asked to provide ideas for solutions to the climate crisis the easiest answer to this request is to encourage people to read paul hawken s drawdown the most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming and then work locally with fellow citizens to transform our community away from head in the sand climate science denial and avoidance and toward responsible stewardship of our most precious resource the earth itself whose fragile balance of ecosystems allows life to exist in that book you will find rooftop solar listed at number 10 out of 80 solutions to the climate crisis in other words rooftop solar is the 10th best solution based on the total amount of greenhouse gases they can potentially avoid or remove from the atmosphere this is what our city council wants to discourage in redding if we can join with the rest of the world in transitioning globally to at least 7 percent electricity generation by 2050 we can avoid 24 6 gt of emissions and save 3 4 trillion in home energy costs why wouldn t we do our part in drawdown hawken writes numerous studies show that the financial benefit of rooftop pv solar photovoltaics runs both ways by having it as part of an energy generation portfolio utilities can avoid the capital costs of additional coal or gas plants for which their customers would otherwise have to pay and broader society is spared the environmental and public health impacts added pv supply at times of highest electricity demand can also curb the use of expensive and polluting peak generators some utilities reject this proposition and posit contradictory claims of rooftop pv being a free rider as they aim to block the use of distributed solar and its impact on their revenue and profitability my italics others like pg e accept its inevitability and are trying to shift their business models accordingly for all involved the need for a grid commons continues so utilities regulators and stakeholders of all stripes are evolving approaches to cover that cost so what are we going to do the majority of redding s city council members good intentioned as they may be are now on record as discouraging redding s residents from getting free energy from the sun and preferring that they pay reu to provide them electricity that comes from the burning of fossil fuels and eats away at our dwindling carbon budget but this can change we do live in a democracy we do have options each of us has a voice and a vote we can go to city council meetings and let our council members know that we believe the climate crisis should be taken seriously we could let them know that we want them to support and subsidize residential solar and wind and any other form of energy that comes along that doesn t add heat trapping gases to the atmosphere it is not too much to ask in fact it is the very least we can do and it is time we can change and we will but we need everyone on board please join us whether we like it or not a new brutal world is already here and will be getting worse even here in our community that is inevitable the next decade is the most important ten years in the history of humanity because we you and me and everyone we know will get to decide by our actions how bad or good the future will be future generations will bless or curse us depending on what we do with our brief time on earth i believe we will do the right thing i hope you do too

low interest rates mean many investors have to search hard for returns writes louise mcbride as 2020 unfolds investors could face much more volatile stock markets than they did last year 2020 doesn t look to be as good a year for investment returns as 2019 was said andrew milligan head of global strategy at aberdeen standard investments asi stock market sell offs are likely 2019 was a relatively calm year it did not have the big market sell offs which 2018 had if you are investing in equities expect some sort of big shock at some point in 2020 as we are almost overdue one while there are some upsides for 2020 including record low unemployment in many countries and a de escalation in and possible end to the trade war between the us and china investors still face big challenges the uncertainty around brexit remains there are fears that the lull in the us china trade war could be short lived investors are facing another year of zero to below zero interest rates indeed 2020 will be the 11th year of record low european rates these dismal rates make it very hard for many investors to achieve returns unless they take on more risk the only way to make a high return in these markets is to trade very significantly which has a lot of dangers to invest in less liquid assets or to invest in riskier assets such as private rather than public assets said milligan you might also make a good return by investing in some emerging market assets though this comes with a currency risk it s important to decide how much risk you are comfortable taking on so if you want to increase your exposure to investments that are likely to deliver better returns than deposits which ones could make money in 2020 emerging markets a number of investment experts believe emerging market equities could do well in 2020 these equities are the shares of companies listed or largely active in emerging or developing economies such as brazil russia india and china some shares can offer investors the opportunity to make significant returns but equally it is also possible to lose a lot of money assuming relative political stability and continued moderate economic growth asi likes emerging market equities and emerging market bonds generally on the assumption there s a recovery in global trade in 2020 said milligan emerging market bonds such as those of brazil south africa and indonesia could be worth investing in according to peter brown co founder of baggot investment partners these bonds still have an interest rate on them and interest rates can be as high as 10pc said brown you have a currency risk when you buy emerging market bonds but that currency risk usually eases when the us dollar weakens i think the us dollar will get weaker in 2020 barclays is more cautious on emerging market equities emerging markets have generated disappointing returns of late said barclays in its latest global economic outlook some green shoots have started to appear but another three or six months may be necessary to reassure investors while growth forecasts for advanced economies have been falling emerging markets excluding china should provide a source of improvement in 2020 investors as always will need to be very selective on regions and cognisant of risks as with any share investment it could be a big mistake to invest directly in a small number of emerging market stocks so should you wish to gain exposure to emerging markets it is usually best to do so through a diversified investment fund and after getting some independent financial advice be sure too to fully understand the risks of any bonds you are considering japanese shares japanese equities could do well this year according to asi and the global investment manager blackrock the de escalation of the us china trade war is expected to boost japanese shares as would a recovery in global trade and continued moderate global economic growth a deep slowdown or a stepping up of trade disputes however may damage japanese shares european shares some believe that 2020 could be a better year for european shares than us ones though brexit and the upcoming eu uk trade deal talks might take their toll on european equities there s value in european equities said brown by contrast us equities and the dollar are overvalued going forward we think it will be risky to have exposure to us equities and the us dollar the us stock market should stagnate but the european stock market should do well us stocks have delivered good returns for many investors over the past five to 10 years but some believe this is unlikely to continue and that lower returns should be expected for us shares in the coming years a number of investment managers including blackrock are cautious about us equities due to the upcoming presidential election the us presidential election could impact financial energy and healthcare stocks as well as faang facebook amazon apple netflix and google stocks said milligan the regulations may change in these areas after the election that would affect us companies and eu companies with us bases barclays however believes us shares could perform well in 2020 though it acknowledges that the outcome of the presidential election will have a significant impact on the american economy in the coming years us equities have outperformed strongly over the past five years said barclays in its global outlook for 2020 we see little reason for this to change tech shares some expect semiconductor stocks to do well this year particularly those linked to 5g companies who make semiconductors an essential part of all electronic devices include intel qualcomm and samsung over the past year and a half many semiconductor companies have been hit by the trade tensions between the us and china however with these tensions easing demand for semiconductors could increase in 2020 the technology stocks asi likes are the simpler 5g smartphone and semiconductor chip related stocks said milligan with 5g becoming more popular in many countries it looks possible there will be an improvement in that sector there are early signs that spending on the smartphone and semiconductor sector is picking up amazon is one of the shares being tipped by goodbody for 2020 despite the relentless advance of e commerce the performance of amazon shares has significantly lagged faang peers and broader us markets in 2019 said jerome kavanagh senior trading strategist with goodbody heightened regulatory scrutiny of the company and sector has undoubtedly dented investor sentiment likewise rising costs have weighed on profits in recent quarters we believe these risks are now fully captured in the share price hence we see the recent weakness as a buying opportunity investors should however be mindful that faang shares could be hit by increased us government regulation and scrutiny this year walt disney walt disney is another of goodbody s stock picks for 2020 early subscription numbers to disney walt disney s new streaming service have greatly exceeded expectations which bodes well for the international rollout of the service in 2020 said kavanagh property for those interested in european property healthcare related accommodation student accommodation and logistics sites could perform well in 2020 according to milligan some new areas of real estate are attractive he said the demand for data centres is noticeable whether it is property shares or bonds that you plan to dip your toe into this year know exactly what you are getting into with investments should you be taking on more risk in the hope of getting better returns only do so if you can afford to lose money losses can be made as quickly as returns on riskier investments no nos for 2020 risk rating of 1 to 3 around half of irish investors have no chance of making money on their investments because their cash is in low risk investments which make little if any return according to peter brown of baggot investment partners most investment funds and products have a risk rating which indicates how much risk an investor takes when putting money into them that rating typically ranges from one to seven an investment with a risk rating of one such as a deposit account will have a very low chance of losing money on the stock markets but will also deliver low if any returns an investment with a rating of seven will be a very high risk product with the potential to deliver high returns as well as high losses anyone who is invested in a product with a risk rating of one two or three has no chance of making money said brown nearly 50pc of the market are in that space people need to ask if they should up their risk profile to a four long dated bonds be careful with bonds particularly with your pension there s a good chance that people have between 40pc and 60pc of their pension in zero yield bonds said brown this is dangerous if you have got negative yielding bonds in your pension those bonds will lose money you should be in very short dated european bonds long dated bonds are very dangerous a short dated bond is typically one which matures within or before five years long dated bonds have much longer investment terms typically maturing over anything from 10 to 30 years it s difficult to see most government bonds doing very well this year unless there s a big recession or a big collapse in inflation said andrew milligan of asi we re seeing low government bond yields lengthy deposits long term investors who leave all of their money on deposit are taking a huge risk due to inflation and low interest rates said dan moroney investment strategist with brewin dolphin investing in shares for short term investors can be risky but for a long term investor as long as you are sufficiently diversified shares should not be risky short term volatility is the price you pay for long term success you could improve your pension s exposure to equities by investing in a diversified fund or exchange traded fund a cost effective way to get exposure to global stock markets according to moroney get independent financial advice before making any changes to your pension investments though retail properties property investors should tread carefully with retail it s very unlikely that shopping centres and malls are attractive as a property investment due to the pressure which online shopping has put on such outlets said milligan
the decade just ending was the longest period without a slump in the major economies since 1945 but it also involved the weakest recovery in 2019 global growth was at its slowest since the global financial crisis of 2008 what factors led to the slowdown and what enabled the major capitalist economies to avoid a major slump the slow annual gdp growth of 1 2 is due to low investment rates as a recent imf report notes firms turned cautious on long range spending and global purchases of machinery and equipment decelerated trade conflicts were also an important factor in the slowdown in technology spending global trade in durable final goods and components simply slowed to a standstill since 2009 globalization and free trade increasingly has given way to protectionist measures as in the 1930s governments worldwide introduced 2 723 new trade distortions affecting an estimated 40 of world trade by november 2019 emerging economies suffered most in most cases growth has been far lower in the last six years than in the same period before the great recession in the 1930 s in argentina brazil russia south africa and ukraine for example there has been no growth at all in 2018 many central banks placed a hold on their policy interest rates or in the case of the federal reserve actually hiked the rate in 2019 the opposite was the case as monetary authorities reversed their stance that the global economy had been normalized interest rates on government bonds and other safe assets fell back towards zero or even turned negative with borrowing so cheap large corporations and banks sucked up cheap credit not to invest in productive assets but to buy up shares and bonds stock market prices thus rocketed they are up 30 in the united states and global stock markets are now worth 86 trillion just short of an all time high and equal to almost 100 of global gdp the main purchasers of corporate stocks are the corporations themselves these so called buybacks pushed up stock prices making it easier to buy out other companies or get more credit much of the buyback funds were borrowed this expansion of what marx called fictitious capital has replaced investment in productive capital and it has been financed by issuing more debt to fund the cost of servicing existing debt the major capitalist economies are now living in a fantasy world where the stock and bond markets insist world capitalism has never had it so good while the real economy is stagnating in terms of output trade profits and investment the other factor enabling the capitalist economies to avoid a new slump was the rise in employment and the fall in the jobless rate instead of investing heavily in new technology and shedding labor companies took in more cheap labor generated by the recession and immigration according to the international labor organization the global unemployment rate dropped to just 5 its lowest level in almost 40 years in the 2010s it seems that companies rather than reducing their costs in the face of recession and low profitability by sacking workers and introducing labor saving technology opted to take on labor at low wages and with precarious conditions no pensions zero hours guaranteed under temporary contracts etc there was a sharp increase in zombie companies that make enough money to pay a low wage workforce and service their debts but not enough to expand high employment and low real gdp growth means low productivity growth which over time means stagnating economies a vicious circle the predicted ai robot revolution in industry has yet to materialize globally the annual growth in output per worker has been hovering around 2 for the past few years compared with an annual average rate of 2 9 between 2000 and 2007 these factors may have delayed the advent of a new slump the fundamental driver of a capitalist economy is profit however neither the average profitability of capital nor the amassing of profit is rising in the major economies according to the latest data on the net return on capital provided by the eu s ameco database profitability in 2020 will be 4 lower than the peak of 2017 in europe 8 down in japan and flat in the united states the growing profitability crisis threatens to turn the increased credit for corporations from a bonus into a burden the institute of international finance estimates that global debt has now hit 250 trillion nearly 32 500 for every person on earth the world bank joined the bank for international settlements in warning that the largest and fastest rise in global debt in half a century could lead to another financial crisis as the world economy slows world bank chief david malpass warned that a sudden rise in risk premiums could precipitate a financial crisis as has happened many times in the past as we enter the 11th year since the end of the last global slump there are fundamental factors suggesting a new slump is not far away they are stagnant or falling profits and profitability weak or falling investment rising corporate debt and falling trade amid a global trade war the global cost of borrowing has reached an all time low partly due to central bank policies of zero interest rates and quantitative easing but also because there is no demand from the capitalist sector for credit to invest in productive assets or from governments to spend capitalism is a system in which profits rule investment and investment rules employment and income and that rules spending sooner or later the fundamental factors of profits and investment will override the counteracting factors of low interest and unemployment source china org
the peso is seen taking a hit from escalating tensions between the united states and iran as oil becomes more expensive bdo unibank inc chief market strategist jonathan l ravelas said he expected the local currency to trade within the range of 51 to 51 25 against the dollar this week after closing at 51 09 versus the greenback last friday ravelas noted that the peso s close last week was a far

iranian commander qasem soleimani prompting iran s government to express moves to avenge his death global oil prices climbed by more than 4 percent after the airstrike at baghdad airport amid investor worries on the us iran conflict s impact on the commodity s supply in an email friday ing bank manila senior economist nicholas antonio t mapa said the brewing tension in the middle east forced broad risk off tone with the peso retreating with safe haven assets such as the dollar back en vogue crude oil prices naturally spiked on possible supply tightness which exacerbated the peso s retreat as more expensive oil translates to increased demand for the dollar mapa said also given the substantial deployment of overseas filipinos in the region the threat of a possible disruption in remittance flows threatened the supply side for dollars and its concurrent boost to domestic spending thus slowing gdp growth at least marginally mapa added the latest philippine statistics authority psa data showed that in 2018 1 26 million filipinos were working in the following middle eastern or west asian countries bahrain israel jordan kuwait lebanon saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates uae

nonetheless said that world oil prices would need to rise much further before higher prices started to have a major impact on inflation or monetary policy across asia given that energy and transport prices have a relatively low weight in most country s inflation baskets this jump in oil prices is only likely to push up inflation by around 0 1 percentage point with the key exceptions of china and india inflation across most of the region is very low and policymakers are unlikely to be too concerned capital economics senior asia economist gareth leather said in a jan 3 report titled oil price spike to have limited impact on inflation in the case of the philippines headline inflation averaged 2 5 percent at end november last year within the government s 2 4 percent target range while the psa will release the december 2019 inflation figure on tuesday jan 7 the bsp already projected the rate of increase in prices of basic commodities to have had settled within the range of 1 8 2 6 percent that month for capital economics the much bigger risk is that the crisis in the middle east escalates to a full blown military conflict which pushes up global oil prices to well over 100 per barrel this would be more likely to unnerve policymakers especially in india vietnam and china where inflation is already above target but so long as this is avoided we think most central banks in emerging asia will cut interest rates further over the coming months capital economics said capital economics had projected the bsp to cut interest rates by 50 basis points this year in a separate

it cannot be overstated bubbles are of paramount importance for markets finance more generally economies and social and geopolitical stability two u s bursting episodes over the past 20 years would seem to make this proposition indisputable i would add that bubble dynamics have never been more pertinent than they became over the past year apply monetary stimulus to a historic financial bubble and you re asking for serious trouble the story of a perilous 2019 yet bubble these days has no part in conventional analysis or dialogue for central bankers economists or market pundits to even utter the word on cnbc or bloomberg would suggest one is hopelessly detached from reality from my vantage point bullishness and new paradigm thinking these days rivals that of the early 2000 peak today s faith in central banking is unrivaled the willingness to embrace egregious excess unmatched to summarize the 2019 policy backdrop in one word capitulation it was to be a year of monetary policy normalization the new fed chairman was to finally return policy rates to a more reasonable level after leaving rates near zero for seven years the fed belatedly took a baby step in december 2015 a full year went by before mustering the courage for a second cautious step and a year full later december 2017 rates were still at 1 00 policy rates were only up to 1 25 to 1 50 when powell took the reins having delayed the process much too long normalization was not going to go smoothly rates were taken to 2 25 to 2 5 by the end of 2018 and the wheels almost came off powell s january 4th dovish u turn essentially ended any notion of rate normalization avoiding market instability was the priority and celebratory markets took full advantage in 2019 the odds central bankers would ever actually tighten monetary conditions became exceedingly low to accurately comprehend 2019 demands attention to key bubble dynamics first of all to employ monetary stimulus in the late stage of a bubble ensures instability conventional thinking both in policy circles and the markets was that with limited ammunition central bankers should utilize stimulus early and aggressively late cycle bubbles by their nature connote financial and economic fragilities there are at the same time powerfully entrenched inflationary biases including expansive infrastructures fostering higher asset prices policymaker

jeff prestridge after a truly golden 2019 experts are forecasting more big gains for bullion this year here s how you could strike gold in 2020 gold had a good year in 2019 a very good year as frank sinatra once sang in dollar terms it was up in price 19 per cent priced in pounds it rose by 15 per cent finishing the year at a tad over 1 157 an ounce it s the fourth consecutive year that gold prices in sterling terms have risen yet according to investors and some financial experts gold has further to go much further even they believe 2020 should be another excellent year for an asset that many consider a safe haven in both calm and stormy times gold investors had a strong 2019 with the price of gold rising by 15 per cent an asset that most experts insist should always be considered by investors looking to build a broadly diversified investment portfolio sitting alongside other long term investments such as equities bonds and property this is despite the fact that unlike other assets gold is non income producing it s all about the price with gold it rises and you win it falls and you lose the latest poll conducted by precious metals dealer bullionvault suggests that confidence to deliver strong price gains this year remains sky high nearly four in five of bullionvault s clients believe that gold prices will rise by more than 10 per cent in 2020 the most bullish its investors have been about gold for three years indeed one in six investors are even more exuberant about the prospects for gold predicting gains of 30 per cent in the next 12 months of course you would expect precious metals investors to talk up an asset they have a financial interest in but bullionvault s clients are not exclusively gold investment fans indeed they typically hold no more than 10 per cent of their investments in gold and one in five believes that global stock markets will perform better than gold this year adrian ash director of research at bullionvault says the main drivers of rising gold prices last year were strong investment demand and big purchases by central banks these factors mitigated the impact of reduced gold jewellery purchases in china and india as a result of a slowdown in economic growth and consumer spending there but this year he believes that fear will drive the gold price even higher resulting from potential geo political and global economic risks such as rising tensions between the us and iran he says yes gold and equity prices especially in the united states rose last year but history shows that gold also does well when other assets suffer and financial markets now face a raft of worries from potential conflict in the middle east president trump s impeachment continued trade issues between china and the united states the uk and europe through to the possible fracturing of nato and the growing challenge to the west from both russia and china he adds november s us presidential election could well bring a surge in financial risk indeed money managers are already betting on a wall street sell off and an accompanying jump in gold prices to 2 000 or even 3 000 an ounce to put these figures into perspective in dollar terms gold finished 2019 at 1 523 an ounce investors agree that gold is a useful asset to help diversify a portfolio a more sanguine but supportive view comes from david coombs of investment house rathbones he is head of multi asset portfolios at the london based investment firm responsible for deciding the asset mix of various key funds he admits that as an investment manager gold has rarely held any allure for him because it does not generate an income but since late 2017 he has changed his mind as abnormal times call for abnormal investment decisions as a result some 4 7 per cent of the 600 million fund rathbone multi asset strategic growth portfolio he manages is currently invested in commodities with the biggest holding via a stock market listed exchange traded company ishares physical gold that tracks the price of gold coombs holds gold in the fund not primarily because of potential geo political risks around the corner although like ash he admits they are not in short supply it is more a result of low interest rates in the uk across europe and especially the us he says negative interest rates on some 10 year government bonds in countries such as france germany and switzerland mean the opportunity cost of gold has fallen to its lowest level in decades by selling negative yielding bonds to buy gold you are effectively increasing your income he argues yet more important adds coombs is the direction of interest rate travel in the us he explains over the long term the price of the shiny metal usually moves in the opposite direction to us interest rates so when times are good there s confidence in the economy and interest rates are increasing investors then don t need gold but when uncertainty hangs over the us economy and already low interest rates are cut further investors look to gold for shelter and that s what happening now the federal reserve the us s answer to the bank of england is creating a supportive environment for gold he concludes from a strategic point of view gold is a good hedge against disinflation a valuable benefit these days considering that i think we re facing long term disinflationary headwinds everyone says gold is a hedge against inflation but it is actually a hedge against capital destruction in these abnormal times we see gold as a good store of value coombs thoughts are echoed by bill dinning chief investment officer at waverton investment management he adds one reason why many investors have historically thought gold unattractive is that it costs money to store around 0 2 per cent per annum to store a one kilo bar of gold but for much of the last five years it has been cheaper to store gold than it has been to lend money to many western governments so it makes gold a more attractive component of a diversified portfolio one investor argues that by selling negative yielding bonds to buy gold you are effectively increasing your income wealth readers who wish to hold gold in their portfolios can do so in many ways they can purchase the physical metal through merchants such as baird co bullionvault sharps pixley the gold bullion company the pure gold company the royal mint and spink for example the purchase of 10 000 of gold online through bullionvault will cost 0 5 per cent initially plus 0 36 per cent per annum to store if sold after a year the sales fee would be 0 5 per cent total fees of around 136 a one ounce minted gold bar bullion from royal mint currently costs just over 1 191 it will be delivered free of charge although royal mint offers buyers the choice of having the gold stored securely at its vaults on gold worth 10 000 the annual vault charge would work out at about 120 although it could be higher if gold prices are rising gold bullion can also be bought from the royal mint and then held inside a self invested personal pension gold bullion can also be bought from the royal mint and then held inside a self invested personal pension or a small self administered pension scheme used by some company directors for financial planning pounce if it drops to 760 an ounce although the mood music is in favour of gold two cautionary comments one from brian dennehy investment expert at fundexpert and the other from duncan macinnes at investment manager ruffer don t get sucked in by the gold bugs with megaphones says dennehy wait until gold drops to below 1 000 760 an ounce and then pounce food for thought check the price on sites such as bullionbypost co uk macinnes warns gold is highly unpredictable it is uniquely capable of making forecasters appear silly as in the short term its price drivers are so ephemeral and diffuse so invest with caution maybe monthly and only invest a slice of your wealth in it gold may be indestructible as spandau ballet sang 37 years ago but that doesn t stop its price falling this means that 100 of gold purchased by a basic rate taxpayer for their sipp will only cost 80 because of pension tax relief at 20 per cent while for a higher rate taxpayer it will only cost 60 the gold must be held in royal mint s vaults further details at royalmintbullion com not all providers of sipps or ssass will accept physical gold as a holding so check beforehand rather than buy physical gold investors can buy a stock market listed exchange traded company whose performance tracks the gold price all fund platforms allow investors to buy these shares

if virgil told you about an article arguing that the current system can t handle the challenges of globalization pointing to the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working people from industrial workers and white collar clerks to medium high managers you might be inclined to react as follows that s old news i ve read a hundred articles making that point again and again over the last few years quite a few of them in fact at breitbart news okay but what if virgil told you that this particular article was written in 1994 as in a full quarter century ago in other words way ahead of its time it s worth recalling that back in 1994 in the wake of the end of the cold war the elites were in love with globalization they were avidly consuming utopian books such as the borderless world the end of history and the twilight of sovereignty and yes 1994 was the year that the north american free trade agreement nafta went into effect as president bill clinton said as he signed the trade treaty nafta means jobs american jobs and good paying american jobs in fact clinton mentioned the word jobs a full 50 times in that speech indeed all that repetition might make one think that the 42nd president was trying really hard to convince americans that he was telling the truth about their jobs interestingly as clinton spoke in support of the trade deal he was joined at the podium by former presidents gerald ford and george h w bush in other words at the elite level support for nafta was virtually unanimous everything would be wonderful we were assured if the globalists got their way yet back then one observer was having none of this giddy optimism in april 1994 veteran d c think tanker edward luttwak writing in the london review of books argued that trade deals such as nafta were hollowing out middle america and that the elite didn t either notice or care neither the moderate right nor the moderate left even recognizes let alone offers any solution for the central problem of our days the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working people from industrial workers and white collar clerks to medium high managers luttwak s point was that globalization and trade were a threat to the cultural and economic structures of each and every developed country that is long standing and intricate systems of work and life were now being exposed to the tidal waves of change in the global economic ocean defenders of such planetary tidal waving said that it was inevitable given that countries such as mexico and china were entering the world economy and that as they did so of course they would be making big waves and yet luttwak s point was that the elites were neither noticing nor caring about the societal impact of these waves crashing on the home country luttwak was especially cutting in his dismissal of the republican response in this situation what does the moderate right have to offer only more free trade and globalization more deregulation and structural change thus more dislocation of lives and social relations luttwak added that republicans were in the curious position of being economic libertarians and at the same time social conservatives that is they were more than a little schizophrenic because wide open economics typically pulverizes any particular cultural heritage as he put it the standard republican after dinner speech is a two part affair in which part one celebrates the virtues of unimpeded competition and dynamic structural change while part two mourns the decline of the family and community values that were eroded precisely by the forces commended in part one okay so luttwak gets credit for being ahead of his time way ahead he had grasped the reality that economic growth and transformation is dislocating especially when that economic growth is differentialized within the society as owners prosper and workers suffer as luttwak put it the voguish business consultant jargon of the era concepts such as restructuring and re engineering was mostly just code words for downsizing and outsourcing that is a given company might grow by slicing domestic employment and moving production overseas but it was growing only its own profits not its contribution to american society yes luttwak s was a lonely voice in 1994 and yet he knew that he was on to something in 1998 he published the equally prescient turbo capitalism winners and losers in the global economy describing the contemporary system he noted it enriches industrializing poor countries impoverishes the semi affluent majority in rich countries and greatly adds to the incomes of the top 1 percent on both sides who are managing the arbitrage as we all know it took a couple of decades for people to see that luttwak s critique was dead on back in the 90s and 00s the elite consensus held that if planetary arbitrageurs operating in financial and informational hubs such as new york city and san francisco were prospering that was a good enough sign that everyone was prospering in this reckoning what s good for goldman sachs and google is good for america and of course if more immigrants legal or otherwise were needed to serve in the service economy well that was good too we can add that this smug view was bipartisan president george w bush shared bill clinton s economic opinions indeed if anything bush was even more of an enthusiast for closer integration with mexico although of course bush ended devoting most of his presidency to the folly of closer integration with iraq and afghanistan and as for barack obama he was another globalist seeking closer integration with many countries including china thus it took until the 2016 election for a presidential candidate to say enough that candidate of course was donald trump and in an odd way some of trump s anti globalization arguments were echoed by another prominent 16 candidate sen bernie sanders in the memorable words of stephen k bannon head honcho at the trump presidential campaign and then for a time the top strategist in the trump white house the globalists gutted the american working class and created a middle class in asia by now most national politicians in both parties pay at least lip service to the luttwak bannon argument there s a realization that the american middle class paid the price while the bi coastal elite reaped the reward and that s why the various trans atlantic and trans pacific trade deals favored by the obama administration and hillary clinton seem to be dead and as an aside on the 2020 presidential campaign post clinton democrats having finally soured on bill and hill style neoliberalism are now targeting white house hopeful pete buttigieg for his association with mckinsey co that s the notorious and scandal plagued management consulting firm that s been at the forefront of so many corporate decisions to lay off and to outsource among other forms of international skullduggery buttigieg is easily recognized as the candidate most likely to revive those globalist trade deals in keeping with his overall harvard mentality no wonder he s so popular with the sonoma crystal wine cave fundraisers okay so luttwak stands as a prophet however let s hope that he isn t proven to be right about everything that he wrote back in 1994 after all the headline atop luttwak s piece a quarter century ago was scary it bannered why fascism is the wave of the future that s right the f word fascism luttwak was careful to point out that fascism started out separate and distinct from nazism that is the fascist movement of benito mussolini who took power in italy in 1922 may have been un democratic and illiberal but it was not hitlerian in its war mongering antisemitic and genocidal evil in fact within the early italian fascist movement jews were well represented but then of course mussolini took on a catastrophic turn in the 1930s after hitler came to power in germany and italy signed on to hitler s axis mussolini was later fully and criminally complicit in hitler s wickedness and yet still luttwak is right to draw a distinction between early fascism and nazism and so it s with the early mussolini model in mind that luttwak argued back in 94 that severe economic dislocation would open the door to unpleasant political reaction and that is the space that remains wide open for a product improved fascist party dedicated to the enhancement of the personal economic security of the broad masses of mainly white collar working people such a party could even be as free of racism as mussolini s original was until the alliance with hitler because its real stock in trade would be corporativist restraints on corporate darwinism and delaying if not blocking barriers against globalization luttwak himself is no fascist and yet as a learned historian and acute observer he could see a quarter century ago that global trends were pushing americans toward the point where an anti liberal backlash would come in full force interestingly in that 1994 article the american figure that luttwak pointed to as an early indicator was ross perot the businessman turned populist perot was no fascist but his success as a political outsider was indeed a stark repudiation of the liberal and bipartisan status quo just two years earlier perot had of course run for president as an independent winning an impressive 19 percent of the national vote and what was one of perot s signature issues why it was his opposition to nafta that trade deal he said would create a giant sucking sound as american jobs went south of the border perot was mocked at the time and yet of course he has been proven right and clinton plus fellow nafta cheerleaders bush 41 and bush 43 have been proven wrong just as luttwak said it would nafta turbo charged north america enriching the fat cats of wall street and silicon valley while sending regular jobs from ohio to mexico but okay just one last thing what about that f word fascism if luttwak was correct in his economic and social predictions might he be correct too in his political prediction about the coming of a product improved fascist party today many on the left have their answer donald trump is a fascist a google search of donald trump and fascist elicits millions of hits including an october 2016 washington post op ed entitled how fascist is donald trump and just on december 21 rep alexandria ocasio cortez speaking to an audience in california declared it is fascism what we re evolving into of course the left was playing the fascist smear game long before trump both richard nixon and ronald reagan were routinely labeled as fascists as was george w bush and in 2004 the leading liberal group moveon org went there equating bush to yes hitler indeed as the liberal atlantic magazine acknowledged in 2016 it s been a standard tactic of the left to smear just about every republican as a fascist so as we can see the left s demagoguery has cheapened the word fascist to the point of irrelevance today the f word is simply just one more insult in the left wing arsenal so no trump is not a fascist and neither are republicans in fact come to think of it if we wanted to envision fascism in the 21st century allowing for changes in style and fashion we might think of antifa which is the hipster name for anti fascist as breitbart news has pointed out antifa ideologists believe that violent thuggery on the streets is a key part of their strategy for provoking civil strife and that of course is classic fascism so in other words when we see the word antifa we should just delete the anti and know that we re seeing fa of course there s more going wrong with american society than just antifa hooliganism the sort of churn that luttwak lamented a quarter century ago has been profoundly damaging to the social fabric and we see it in the worsening of societal indicators including flattened wages family breakdown opioid use and gun violence including mass shootings and yes it s possible that if the deterioration continues some sort of strong antidote more precisely a horrible antidote could emerge so if we want to make sure we can fend off even the threat of fascism we should start with leadership that s both strong and wise strong leaders stand up to extremist antifa type violence of course and yet at the same time they are wise enough to solve the underlying social conditions that contribute to extremism after all italian fascism emerged from the wreckage of world war one and we can add that communism another terrible extremism that s a kind of mirror to fascism emerged in russia at around the same time in the wake of the same war and a decade later nazism emerged from the war too as well as from the depression so obviously we start our anti fascism plan with a commitment to overall peace and prosperity that is no stupid foreign wars no crazy economic policies and then we have to get to work on the healing of our homeland repairing the many social and cultural injuries and injustices caused by turbo capitalism
what is the story of the u s economy not unlike the proverbial elephant subject to scrutiny by a band of blind men the nation s economy is subject to multiple narrative descriptions depending on which component of the beast whether our economy or an elephant the blind man massages some media pundits have argued that the historically low unemployment rates combined with record stock market performances attest to a strong economy that would propel trump to victory in 2020 if only he were disciplined enough to stay on point about the economy stupid others claim focusing on these numbers is akin to grasping the trunk and the tail of the elephant missing the bigger and much more accurate picture of an economy that has not just failed but actively assaulted the vast majority of americans msnbc s stephanie ruhle for example has been unrelenting in fleshing out this more comprehensive narrative insisting among other points that the stock market and the overall economy are not the same thing to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily it may very well be the more compelling storyteller or the storyteller who gets access to the most air time who tilts the 2020 election robert shiller s recent splashy book narrative economics underscores this point in a general way arguing that the popular and viral narratives purveyed about the economy don t so much describe the economy but drive the economic events themselves regardless of the truth value of the story itself as the yale university professor and nobel prize winning economist told cnbc it may not be so logical it may be more as i said of animal spirits this is an emotion that you feel at a certain time that you sense you see in other people so when you see other people feeling confident about the market you feel more confident yourself he attributes recent market strength for example to trump s storytelling prowess he s a motivational speaker we ve never had a motivational speaker president before he knows how to create animal spirits what cannot be emphasized enough however is the importance of a crafting an economic narrative that aligns as closely as possible with our economic reality generating the most effective understanding of the dynamics and performance of the economy for good decision making by voters and good policy making by legislators how we tell this story is vital to lives of the american majority which is why shiller s applause for trump s motivational stirring of animal spirits is absolutely misplaced and damaging to american lives as we get a hold of the entire elephant of the trump economy we find an economy on a sugar high thriving on taxpayer debt enriching even further the already wealthy and heading for a crash as we limn this elephant let s start with the national debt and deficit trump inherited a strong economy and it is typically during healthy economic times that the government pays down the national debt but both the deficit and debt have grown under trump s administration largely because of his tax cuts that served largely the wealthy reports indicated that in october the federal government s budget deficit ballooned 34 from a year earlier to 134 5 billion projecting that the annual deficit will top 1 trillion for the first time in eight years the national debt meanwhile has surged beyond 22 trillion hmmm if the economy is booming shouldn t the federal government s coffers be filling up and not depleting we can certainly understand how in a time of recession the government would need to provide economic stimulus and thus run a deficit but when the economy is supposedly experiencing record performance when trump slashed corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 percent we were told as usual that these tax cuts would pay for themselves create an economy that enriches us all basically trump is using the credit of the american worker to enrich corporate america and the wealthiest of americans it s as if for most americans someone maxed out their credit cards and yet they got none of the benefit of the goods and services purchased these tax cuts benefited the wealthy and did not trickle down despite trump s promises that companies would invest in workers and not cut jobs companies like at t wells fargo and general motors lobbied for them promising to re invest their tax savings in their workers and companies to the benefit off the nation as a whole and yet all of these companies have engaged in massive layoffs or plant closings at t has eliminated over 23 000 jobs since the tax cuts went into effect despite receiving a 21 billion windfall from the tax cuts with the prospect of cashing in an additional 3 billion annually in tax savings in november 2018 gm announced it would be closing five plants eliminating 14 000 jobs in communities across ohio maryland michigan and ontario canada while buying back 10 billion in stock and earning a net profit of 8 billion on which the company paid no federal tax other automakers have also slashed thousands of jobs saving billions of dollars wells fargo did raise the minimum wage of its employees though the tax savings for the company were 47 times larger than the cost of that pay raise to the company and the company announced its plans in september 2018 to eliminate 26 000 jobs at the same time that it has raised health insurance costs for its employees meanwhile homelessness in the u s has increased for the third year in a row under trump s rule despite low unemployment rates poverty is increasing west virginia is a telling case study of how the jobs being created particularly in retail and service industries do not pay a living wage as sean o leary senior budget analyst for the west virginia center on budget and policy told cbs news it s cashiers retail sales people service employees those are our fastest growing jobs but those jobs don t pay very well tara martinez executive director of a soup kitchen in west virginia elaborated the jobs that are available are minimum wage and part time they don t have benefits poverty homelessness and despair continue even for those who are working and seek work in this supposedly thriving economy let s get the story straight our lives depend on it

if virgil told you about an article arguing that the current system can t handle the challenges of globalization pointing to the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working people from industrial workers and white collar clerks to medium high managers you might be inclined to react as follows that s old news i ve read a hundred articles making that point again and again over the last few years quite a few of them in fact at breitbart news okay but what if virgil told you that this particular article was written in 1994 as in a full quarter century ago in other words way ahead of its time it s worth recalling that back in 1994 in the wake of the end of the cold war the elites were in love with globalization they were avidly consuming utopian books such as the borderless world the end of history and the twilight of sovereignty and yes 1994 was the year that the north american free trade agreement nafta went into effect as president bill clinton said as he signed the trade treaty nafta means jobs american jobs and good paying american jobs in fact clinton mentioned the word jobs a full 50 times in that speech indeed all that repetition might make one think that the 42nd president was trying really hard to convince americans that he was telling the truth about their jobs interestingly as clinton spoke in support of the trade deal he was joined at the podium by former presidents gerald ford and george h w bush in other words at the elite level support for nafta was virtually unanimous everything would be wonderful we were assured if the globalists got their way yet back then one observer was having none of this giddy optimism in april 1994 veteran d c think tanker edward luttwak writing in the london review of books argued that trade deals such as nafta were hollowing out middle america and that the elite didn t either notice or care neither the moderate right nor the moderate left even recognizes let alone offers any solution for the central problem of our days the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working people from industrial workers and white collar clerks to medium high managers luttwak s point was that globalization and trade were a threat to the cultural and economic structures of each and every developed country that is long standing and intricate systems of work and life were now being exposed to the tidal waves of change in the global economic ocean defenders of such planetary tidal waving said that it was inevitable given that countries such as mexico and china were entering the world economy and that as they did so of course they would be making big waves and yet luttwak s point was that the elites were neither noticing nor caring about the societal impact of these waves crashing on the home country luttwak was especially cutting in his dismissal of the republican response in this situation what does the moderate right have to offer only more free trade and globalization more deregulation and structural change thus more dislocation of lives and social relations luttwak added that republicans were in the curious position of being economic libertarians and at the same time social conservatives that is they were more than a little schizophrenic because wide open economics typically pulverizes any particular cultural heritage as he put it the standard republican after dinner speech is a two part affair in which part one celebrates the virtues of unimpeded competition and dynamic structural change while part two mourns the decline of the family and community values that were eroded precisely by the forces commended in part one okay so luttwak gets credit for being ahead of his time way ahead he had grasped the reality that economic growth and transformation is dislocating especially when that economic growth is differentialized within the society as owners prosper and workers suffer as luttwak put it the voguish business consultant jargon of the era concepts such as restructuring and re engineering was mostly just code words for downsizing and outsourcing that is a given company might grow by slicing domestic employment and moving production overseas but it was growing only its own profits not its contribution to american society yes luttwak s was a lonely voice in 1994 and yet he knew that he was on to something in 1998 he published the equally prescient turbo capitalism winners and losers in the global economy describing the contemporary system he noted it enriches industrializing poor countries impoverishes the semi affluent majority in rich countries and greatly adds to the incomes of the top 1 percent on both sides who are managing the arbitrage as we all know it took a couple of decades for people to see that luttwak s critique was dead on back in the 90s and 00s the elite consensus held that if planetary arbitrageurs operating in financial and informational hubs such as new york city and san francisco were prospering that was a good enough sign that everyone was prospering in this reckoning what s good for goldman sachs and google is good for america and of course if more immigrants legal or otherwise were needed to serve in the service economy well that was good too we can add that this smug view was bipartisan president george w bush shared bill clinton s economic opinions indeed if anything bush was even more of an enthusiast for closer integration with mexico although of course bush ended devoting most of his presidency to the folly of closer integration with iraq and afghanistan and as for barack obama he was another globalist seeking closer integration with many countries including china thus it took until the 2016 election for a presidential candidate to say enough that candidate of course was donald trump and in an odd way some of trump s anti globalization arguments were echoed by another prominent 16 candidate sen bernie sanders in the memorable words of stephen k bannon head honcho at the trump presidential campaign and then for a time the top strategist in the trump white house the globalists gutted the american working class and created a middle class in asia by now most national politicians in both parties pay at least lip service to the luttwak bannon argument there s a realization that the american middle class paid the price while the bi coastal elite reaped the reward and that s why the various trans atlantic and trans pacific trade deals favored by the obama administration and hillary clinton seem to be dead and as an aside on the 2020 presidential campaign post clinton democrats having finally soured on bill and hill style neoliberalism are now targeting white house hopeful pete buttigieg for his association with mckinsey co that s the notorious and scandal plagued management consulting firm that s been at the forefront of so many corporate decisions to lay off and to outsource among other forms of international skullduggery buttigieg is easily recognized as the candidate most likely to revive those globalist trade deals in keeping with his overall harvard mentality no wonder he s so popular with the sonoma crystal wine cave fundraisers okay so luttwak stands as a prophet however let s hope that he isn t proven to be right about everything that he wrote back in 1994 after all the headline atop luttwak s piece a quarter century ago was scary it bannered why fascism is the wave of the future that s right the f word fascism luttwak was careful to point out that fascism started out separate and distinct from nazism that is the fascist movement of benito mussolini who took power in italy in 1922 may have been un democratic and illiberal but it was not hitlerian in its war mongering antisemitic and genocidal evil in fact within the early italian fascist movement jews were well represented but then of course mussolini took on a catastrophic turn in the 1930s after hitler came to power in germany and italy signed on to hitler s axis mussolini was later fully and criminally complicit in hitler s wickedness and yet still luttwak is right to draw a distinction between early fascism and nazism and so it s with the early mussolini model in mind that luttwak argued back in 94 that severe economic dislocation would open the door to unpleasant political reaction and that is the space that remains wide open for a product improved fascist party dedicated to the enhancement of the personal economic security of the broad masses of mainly white collar working people such a party could even be as free of racism as mussolini s original was until the alliance with hitler because its real stock in trade would be corporativist restraints on corporate darwinism and delaying if not blocking barriers against globalization luttwak himself is no fascist and yet as a learned historian and acute observer he could see a quarter century ago that global trends were pushing americans toward the point where an anti liberal backlash would come in full force interestingly in that 1994 article the american figure that luttwak pointed to as an early indicator was ross perot the businessman turned populist perot was no fascist but his success as a political outsider was indeed a stark repudiation of the liberal and bipartisan status quo just two years earlier perot had of course run for president as an independent winning an impressive 19 percent of the national vote and what was one of perot s signature issues why it was his opposition to nafta that trade deal he said would create a giant sucking sound as american jobs went south of the border perot was mocked at the time and yet of course he has been proven right and clinton plus fellow nafta cheerleaders bush 41 and bush 43 have been proven wrong just as luttwak said it would nafta turbo charged north america enriching the fat cats of wall street and silicon valley while sending regular jobs from ohio to mexico but okay just one last thing what about that f word fascism if luttwak was correct in his economic and social predictions might he be correct too in his political prediction about the coming of a product improved fascist party today many on the left have their answer donald trump is a fascist a google search of donald trump and fascist elicits millions of hits including an october 2016 washington post op ed entitled how fascist is donald trump and just on december 21 rep alexandria ocasio cortez speaking to an audience in california declared it is fascism what we re evolving into of course the left was playing the fascist smear game long before trump both richard nixon and ronald reagan were routinely labeled as fascists as was george w bush and in 2004 the leading liberal group moveon org went there equating bush to yes hitler indeed as the liberal atlantic magazine acknowledged in 2016 it s been a standard tactic of the left to smear just about every republican as a fascist so as we can see the left s demagoguery has cheapened the word fascist to the point of irrelevance today the f word is simply just one more insult in the left wing arsenal so no trump is not a fascist and neither are republicans in fact come to think of it if we wanted to envision fascism in the 21st century allowing for changes in style and fashion we might think of antifa which is the hipster name for anti fascist as breitbart news has pointed out antifa ideologists believe that violent thuggery on the streets is a key part of their strategy for provoking civil strife and that of course is classic fascism so in other words when we see the word antifa we should just delete the anti and know that we re seeing fa of course there s more going wrong with american society than just antifa hooliganism the sort of churn that luttwak lamented a quarter century ago has been profoundly damaging to the social fabric and we see it in the worsening of societal indicators including flattened wages family breakdown opioid use and gun violence including mass shootings and yes it s possible that if the deterioration continues some sort of strong antidote more precisely a horrible antidote could emerge so if we want to make sure we can fend off even the threat of fascism we should start with leadership that s both strong and wise strong leaders stand up to extremist antifa type violence of course and yet at the same time they are wise enough to solve the underlying social conditions that contribute to extremism after all italian fascism emerged from the wreckage of world war one and we can add that communism another terrible extremism that s a kind of mirror to fascism emerged in russia at around the same time in the wake of the same war and a decade later nazism emerged from the war too as well as from the depression so obviously we start our anti fascism plan with a commitment to overall peace and prosperity that is no stupid foreign wars no crazy economic policies and then we have to get to work on the healing of our homeland repairing the many social and cultural injuries and injustices caused by turbo capitalism
ihuoma chiedozie the nigerian economy has become more vulnerable to shocks as a result of the depletion of the excess crude account according to the world bank the eca was established in 2004 to save revenues in excess of the budgetary benchmark price generated from the sale of oil with the aim of protecting the country s budgets against shortfalls caused by the volatility of crude oil prices the account was expected to insulate the nigerian economy from external economic shocks the eca rose from 5 1bn in 2005 to more than 20bn in november 2008 but during the last meeting of the national economic council in december 2019 the minister of finance budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed reportedly disclosed that the balance as of november 19 2019 was 324 98m in its latest nigeria economic update the world bank warned that a moderate decline in oil price could trigger another recession noting that the exhaustion of the eca had made the country more vulnerable fiscal buffers in the excess crude account have been exhausted rendering nigeria more vulnerable to shocks the bank said noting that the account was mismanaged the report added the eca has rarely operated as envisaged when it was established in 2004 it was to be drawn on only when the actual crude oil price falls below the budget benchmark price for three consecutive months however state governments contended that the federal fiscal responsibility act of 2007 creating the eca was not binding on state and local governments the world bank observed that the sovereign wealth fund was established in 2011 by the three tiers of government to serve as the oil savings fund for the country the swf has three components future generations infrastructure and stabilisation funds the stabilisation fund like the eca was to support federation revenue in times of economic stress it was envisaged that the balance in the eca in 2011 would be transferred to the swf the world bank said instead in 2012 seed capital of only 1 5bn was transferred plus another 0 5bn in 2017 the balance of the stabilisation account reportedly as of december 17 2019 was n30 5bn while the natural resource fund held n88 3 at the same date the world bank further observed that nigeria s consolidated government revenue was very low by the standards of comparable countries during the commodity boom nigeria s consolidated government revenue reached 12 per cent of gdp among the lowest ratios for structural aspirational and regional peers it said after oil price and production shocks and nigeria s first recession in over two decades in 2016 general government revenue plunged to six per cent of gdp second lowest of 115 countries for which data are available recovering to eight per cent of gdp in 2018 government revenues are projected to plateau there unless there are significant tax policy and administration reforms the bank warned that the prevailing situation will continue to constrain the budget envelope and limit fiscal space for investing in physical and human capital in the absence of fiscal buffers such as the one that was supposed to be provided by the now exhausted eca nigeria risks another recession due to the country s dependence on oil the bank said it added a moderate decline in oil prices could lead to a recession in nigeria due to its dependence on oil the nigerian economy is highly vulnerable to a drop in oil prices the oil sector remains the dominant source of risk for growth of nigeria s economy with sustained suboptimal policy decisions aggravating the size of the potential impact on the economy for example a sudden decline in oil prices to 2016 levels sustained for a year would undermine growth and fiscal balances and the lack of monetary and fiscal buffers would magnify the impact of any shock to the economy if oil prices dropped again by about 25 per cent the country could swing into a recession with a more difficult recovery path evaluating the possible impact of a temporary decline in oil price the bank noted that the development could subtract up to 0 5 percentage points from growth the report projected yet the indirect spillover effects on external and fiscal balances and the financial sector would be significant similar to if not worse than what happened during the 2016 recession since the federal government s deficit is already twice the size of nigeria s revenues the fall in fiscal revenues proportionate to the 25 per cent fall in oil prices would virtually eliminate space for infrastructure spending with obvious long term repercussions for growth with no fiscal buffers available the excess crude account balance is less than 0 5bn and no likelihood of external borrowing as investor confidence drops because of uncertainty over nigeria s policy response deficits would have to be financed domestically sending the cost of borrowing soaring because there are no buffers the nonoil economy could contract by more than in 2016 with the economy as a whole shrinking by more than two per cent recovery would be slow in the absence of structural reforms even if the oil price rebounded by about 15 per cent as the global economy recovers however world

the rand to pound sterling exchange rates came under some significant pressure this week amidst fluctuating risk appetite in the first half of the week this came curtesy of thin trade with the post christmas lull in market leaving the rand without any support while the rand made an attempt to rally on tuesday amidst a downturn in the us dollar usd this proved short lived against a buoyant pound the rand made another attempt to strike higher on thursday as traders returned from their new year break in light of fresh us china trade optimism after it was announced the two powers would sign their phase one trade deal in washington on 15th january but this rally again proved short lived as zar exchange rates were pressured by a resurgent us dollar at the start of 2020 however the majority of the rand s losses were focused at the very tail end of the session mostly as a result of escalating tensions in the middle east this came as a result of a us air strike in bagdad which hit a top iranian general and spooked investors with fears of conflict between washington and tehran the killing of major general qassem soleimani saw iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei promise severe revenge on those responsible unsurprisingly the renewed tensions in the region spooked markets leading investors to shun risk sensitive currencies such as the south african rand advertisement olivier jakob managing director of oil consultants petromatrix said the killing of soleimani calls for a serious increase of the geopolitical risk premium this was supposed to be a holiday week for many traders many will be cutting the holidays short and call in for an emergency risk meeting pound exchange rates buoyed as boris johnson announces substantial rise in minimum wage the pound gbp trended higher through the first half of this week s session partly on the back of some end of year flows but also on the back of some positive news for uk workers boris johnson announced on tuesday that the national living wage would rise 6 2 in april a rise of more than four times that of inflation gbp investors hope the bump with fuel more consumer spending and help to bolster economic growth however the pound struggled to extend these gains through the latter half of the week coming under pressure from renewed brexit jitters and some lacklustre pmi figures on the brexit front it seems that gbp investors are growing increasingly nervous about a potential no deal brexit in december as the uk prepares to officially leave the eu at the end of the month coupled with a surprise drop in the uk s construction pmi and the manufacturing sector suffering its second worst contraction in growth since 2012 this keep demand for sterling limited through the second half of the session gbp zar exchange rate forecast lingering brexit uncertainty to weaken sterling looking ahead to next week s session the pound to south african rand gbp zar exchange rate may struggle to consolidate its recent gains as the absence of any notable uk economic data keeps brexit in the spotlight this may dampen sterling sentiment next week as gbp investors are growing increasingly concerned that the uk could face a no deal brexit at the end of the year amidst scepticism boris johnson will be able to negotiate a trade deal with the eu in just eleven months meanwhile the fallout from the us air strike against soleimani may hang over the rand next week limiting demand for the risk sensitive currency also potentially stifling demand for the rand will be south africa s latest manufacturing pmi which is expected to have sank further into contraction territory in december

professor of political economy patrick okedinachi utomi in this interview with gbenga salau said the country s political class has constantly plundered the country s fortunes hence the pathetic state of her economy while calling for the dismantling of the obnoxious political structure which has made the country anaemic utomi insists that it was time the country started producing to boost her economy failure of which she would eventually die how will rate the economy in 2019 i will add no value by rating the economy because it is not a matter of measure but the question is did it sustain the nigerian people in the sense of an economic system we entered 2019 with a few dubious honours we became poverty capital of the world overtaking india in absolute poverty even when india s population is about seven times that of nigeria the real meaning is even more significant we also entered 2019 being classified by bill and melinda gate foundation along with zaire for producing more than 40 per cent of the poorest people on the planet within a few years on most indicators including human development index we are in a very pathetic position for a country that produces a lot of crude oil which is money the main problem here is the organisation of the nigerian society which is done in such a way that it does not incline the country towards economic growth what is required is a very fundamental surgery those who run the country have the mindset that revenue determines economic progress and that is why talks about budget is about the amount of money brought in and spent determining progress hence they say the bigger your budget the bigger the revenue and the better you are doing this is absolute nonsense because many times you are getting poorer what makes you escape poverty is production you produce your way out of poverty therefore what makes for a productive environment is a web of values that create an enabling environment for investment it is a set of incentives economics is all about incentives that take your best talent to where you would like to produce the most so that the engine of growth is kept reeling our economy however is a rent economy and what matters is not getting your best talents to where they can most produce what matters is connection revenues are collected from oil and somehow they are shared among friends mainly politicians and their friends who are in business i saw a quote that stunned me but so correct from brako a ghananian and he said any country where the politicians are richer than the businessmen is a country on the verge of collapse that is a classic case of nigeria economics is about incentives for the best talent to go into where there are most opportunities to creatively destroy today s value and produce higher values but the incentive system does not work that way in nigeria as far as i am concerned the only thing that is incentivised in this country is rent extraction that is why as a trader you know someone somewhere he gives you contract and you end up making money from the contract we are just oscillating between rent collection but we are not creating wealth and the political class is not ready to deal with it as a country we have one of the most expensive political systems in the world and the amount of money that we spend on protocol alone can kill any normal economy so our political system is broken and not working for the nigerian economy to get better but only designed to share more who gets more of what thus we created an economic system that follows a political philosophy of government of politicians for politicians by politicians and their business friends it is not a government of the people not for the nigerian people therefore the economy is not going to grow we can create all the committees in this world but the nigeria s economy is designed to burst so we must do something fundamental now the 2020 budget has been signed into law already but you insist that we must do something fundamental now is this budget incapable of powering development how much is in the budget less than seven per cent of gross domestic product gdp and where will that take us to even at that there are so many politicians that are waiting to share from that amount which cannot even power real growth you can now see why i call it government of politicians by politicians and for politicians what then do you think we should be doing in 2020 to effect a positive shift economically what we need to do is to signal to the world that nigeria is getting serious if nigeria is serious the world would bring in capital to invest in nigeria and drive growth there is a french economist called thomas piketty he is probably the biggest writer on the subject of capital in the world the point of his research is very profound saying there is more capital in the world today than there has been in human history because of globalisation this is depending on how you see it and what lens you wear fortunately or unfortunately most of this money is in the hands of a few people for instance 10 young boys in california have more capital than the entire african continent that is the nature of the disproportion of capital the point is the capital is there and that capital will go where it finds the most comfort one of those young boys who owns the capital mike zuckerberg flew into lagos and was jogging on the ikoyi link bridge the other day and i remembered calling my friends in lagos government that they do not need advertisement any more just take a photograph of zuckerberg jogging in lagos or walking in yaba between danfos then you have sold this country and city which is the naked truth but politicians behaviour in the country is the biggest factor that has been putting off investors in addition to that we run a crazy structure where most of the little money available goes into making politicians happy so the simple truth is not many people will bring their investments here another ugly scenario is losing your investments when there is a new sheriff in town who ends up cancelling everything that his predecessor did a new governor comes on board and ends up cancelling everything that the governor before him did a new central bank governor comes in with a set of new rules and all those who invested yesterday stand to lose everything that they invested these foreigners are not crazy they will look at our country and say i cannot take my money to that kind of place so the first thing to save nigeria is to get the political class better behaved thereafter make nigerian institutions stronger because the biggest risk in doing business in nigeria is regulatory risk a business is likely to fail in nigeria more from the action of a regulator than from a market problem in the environment how many people in the world would go into such environments to invest we need a national conference of politicians to educate them on how to run a country that grows right now the political class is working against the country s economic progress they are not doing it out of wickedness even though they may be selfish but they are doing it out of ignorance so how do we educate them we literarily need a national conference to discuss the structure of nigeria the nigerian economy does not give people confidence they know that we do not have elections they know that elections in nigeria constitute a complete farce and that is how it has been since 1999 but getting worse one after the other how do you go to a place where nothing is certain in 1998 i wrote a book titled managing uncertainty competition and strategy in an emerging economy if you read the book today it is as if i am writing it today in the book i talked about the framework for competitive strategy and i showed how predative behavoiours of politicians is killing the economy we need to begin to create institutions that create boundaries that would make businesses find nigeria a worthwhile place to invest in again the federal government wants to lift 10 million people out of poverty but here you are trying to make us escape poverty to production does this mean that we may remain in captivity for so long i am not going to debate with anybody what they can do or not do i will tell you what realities suggest down the path that we are traveling you see what nigeria needs most is private capital to come in i travel around the world and i know the feedbacks that i get i know very few would want to come in to invest but their position is based on what they have observed which might not be fair look just in one day in the last quarter of 2018 the ubs of switzerland a bank and another closed shop these are investment bankers that bring in investors but they closed and left and what are you saying with your budget the model that nigeria has been following very sadly is the model of venezuela it has the largest reserve of crude oil in the world but every time oil price goes south they cannot even buy milk on the streets of venezuela that is the model that nigeria is pursuing just slightly better than venezuela we must change all of that the model that i prescribed is the model based on latent comparative advantage what are we endowed with as a country is it sesame seed and agricultural produce if so lets create institutional arrangement that facilitates the development of the value chains on those endowments until we becoming global leaders on those value chains for instance sesame seed is produced in the north central why don t we develop a programme for plantation and processing of sesame seed we should programme the educational system from primary school to have a curriculum on managing sesame seeds processing all of those things that add up to engaging macdonald an outfit that uses sesame seed and oil towing this line nigeria would be producing all these and distributing them around the world and trading within africa we would be creating millions of jobs nigeria must produce if she does not she would die to what extent has leadership failure and sham elections hindered our growth as a nation simply put the problem of nigeria is total failure of leadership on january 12 2020 it would be 50 years since the nigerian civil war ended i was here in lagos during the civil war and we were dancing james brown music not knowing who was a yoruba or calabar person among us yet we were fighting a civil war at that time today you get on social media and boys who were born 30 years after that are abusing one another based on ethnic lines leadership failure is responsible for that there is so much buzz about the country s debts stemming from loans what are we not getting right in our loan structure it still boils down to what i said earlier we are not producing if we borrow to produce then the expansion of the economy can contain debt servicing but we are borrowing to spend and consume when you consume it is gone so where are you going to get the money to pay back nigeria s current borrowing pattern is a dangerous track unless it boosts production the fundamental issue with nigeria s economy is that it does not produce it believes in revenue rather than production 2023 is already here and geopolitical and ethnic cards are being played by different groups what should be the talking points as we look towards 2023 it still comes down to the same question the guys are looking for whose turn is it to steal your people have stolen so let my people steal it is not about building a nation or creating wealth the question should be who can get nigeria out of this mess nigeria is dying who can stop this wrath not where does he come from you made an attempt the last time but where do i start i have written a book about it and i am writing a second book on it first of all we do not have political parties in nigeria we have these funny enterprises that people have created as their personal businesses and they call it apc pdp and all that those parties are designed to stop people who can move nigeria forward from coming up i can prove it they are simply private enterprises of state captors who are interested in sharing the booty the political system now has to collapse completely if nigeria is going to go anywhere because there is nothing democratic in the process what does it even stand for i was one of them i was in one of those parties i helped found the party and the road map of the party was written in my house right here but what does the party represent all the english that we wrote down meant nothing and the people just wanted to capture power and do as they pleased you said we must dismantle the political parties because they are business enterprises how do we do that when the ceos will not let go that is why nigeria is on existential struggle if we do not dismantle the political parties nigeria will die as a country i am definite about that they will struggle because it is their businesses but the people have to rise in one form or the other in a democracy there are ways that the people can do that i have told people that these things are small things if everyday one million people march in front of national assembly to say this mess cannot go on those guys will quit they will quit the bottom line is that it is not working nigeria is not making progress as an investment destination everybody has given up on nigeria and oil companies are leaving if you want to tell the truth that oil is the only thing that we are holding on to and it is an area that we should not be playing with in the sense that this finite resource is wasting as the world is moving away from fossil fuel it is something we should be distancing ourselves from even at that it can sustain us in the meantime if you look at the body language of the oil majors the only one that is making serious commitment to nigeria is total plc thus we got a serious existential crisis and we cannot allow politicians whom we do not understand what they are doing to continue misleading us we have to challenge them as a people that this nonsense cannot go on if you cannot lead get out of the way more so when they do not even allow the people to determine who leads them because of the farce called election but which the whole world knows that they are no elections we need to begin again we need to start afresh that is the naked truth we need a new approach to governance if some very good persons are brought in and put in this mess they would just be moving around in circles government needs to move closer to the people and the most important level of government should be the local government so that the people can take their destiny into their hands this is a time to look at the thoughts of somebody like prof peter eke who has written one of the best pieces in nigeria s political science field from far back as 1975 where he lamented the absence of morality in the public space in eke s argument you have the primordial culture where people go for town union meetings and they will not want to steal because of the consequences here the morality of society shifts to the primordial base but when you get to the federal government where the money belongs to nobody the thinking is steal the whole thing and bring back to our village we have got to the stage where we need to tell ourselves that we need to shift governance to the level that connects to the people move most of the power down there whatever ways you choose to do it let power get closer to the people now if those people elect directly a representative to the parliament and those representatives pick the best among them it is easier to get the very best among them to be their prime leader or prime minister you will also find out that not only will you be running a good local government administration but the people that come from the local government areas to be representatives in abuja are also permanently held accountable because they just go there to make laws for the generality of the people those people will be held more readily accountable and the system of government will work more effectively the logic of what the military gave us under obasanjo was to say that part of nigeria s problem is that everybody does not own the man who is the president if we get a president who goes all over the country and everybody owes loyalty to him he would act in the interest of everybody how many of those who have been president in nigeria have acted in the interest of everybody therefore that logic collapses on the basis of that secondly the so called president amasses so much power but unfortunately the nature of military rule allows people to give so much power to the big general at the centre with the small colonels in the regions who can t even talk to him we then reached a point where government is about how can i get my share of what is left in abuja an american political scientist richard joseph called it bureaucratic prebendalism that is sharing the national cake it is just like a pastor or vicar who gives out prebends to his assistants the idea of going to abuja to beg oga please give me small takes away the whole incentive structure of production from the system no economy has been built on sharing revenue every economy that is an economy of substance is built on production what the governments of the regions did the most in nigeria was that they generated a competition of who develops their regions most and two american political scientists robert melsone and wolpe in discussing modernisation in nigeria back in the 1970s described that process of competing ethnic nationalities working on who will bring progress most to their people as competitive communalism indeed the era of competitive communalism was when nigeria thrived i make bold to say that it is the military that created this bureaucratic prebendalism culture where everybody goes to beg for a prebend in abuja and nobody wants to produce let me give you a very simple illustration in the 1960s there were more local governments in southern nigeria simply for administrative conveniences they were not involved in revenue sharing than in northern nigeria in 1975 76 the olusegun obasanjo led government looking at examples from eastern europe and brazil made local government areas part of the fiscal transfer system so significant revenue was now going to them quickly every colonel who had power started working towards getting his village to become a local government and before long we got 774 local councils with about 500 from the old north twice as many as in the south guess what it means that since 1975 76 a huge amount of revenue has been flowing to northern nigeria through local government reforms this is a great irony because northern nigeria has also got poorer than southern nigeria all these years nothing makes my point from that illustration than the fact that revenues do not make for economic growth what makes economic growth is production and this is the reason that we need to get away from this mindset of getting a bigger share of the cake because it does not make anybody rich but just makes a few elite foolish because since they have more money they do not know what to do with it but their people are becoming poorer you talked about the need for a national conference for politicians and another to restructure the economy but a few years ago we had one that its outcome has not been implemented i do not want to get into this debate because of the problem we have in africa about sovereign national conferences but let me state clearly that we should not have a conference just for the amusement of whomever that is in power to do whatever he likes i mean president goodluck jonathan could have saved all of us this nonsense if he had the courage to implement something that had a national consensus in his time but because he was looking at winning the next election he failed to do what he should have done and this is the reason that we must hold him accountable however the point remains that we should not look at issues from the point of these people will win or those people will lose because this is supposed to be a win win thing now restructuring has got a bad name because some people think others will get more revenue while we get less but even the much that they are getting is still making them poorer and that is why i am saying that the problem of nigeria is ignorance what we need to do and the kind of national conversation that we should have if conference will be like one of those things is on what leads to wealth creation and what takes people out of poverty everybody who is a responsible nigerian but who does not feel ashamed that nigeria is the poverty capital of the world his head should be examined when i walk around the world i walk with my head bowed because i come from a country where misery is the middle name of everybody what we really need is a conversation not conference on why we are poor and miserable that process may lead to the education of the nigerian political class to understand what it takes not to be poor and miserable and also understanding the fact that their being able to steal as much as they want has not made them rich it has only made them foolish the country s education system must play a role if truly ignorance is the reason why we are poor yes it is not helping matters we have a lot of certificated illiterates in nigeria to be educated is not to be certificated i was in rome a few weeks ago when a certain educator and a prince of the catholic church anglican pastor and a professor at oxford university became a cardinal john henry cardinal numan was canonized a saint one of the great legacies of numan is what is referred to as the idea of the university a collection of lectures and talks he gave in dublin around 1850 which became known as the idea of a university and he talked essentially about what it meant to be a person worthy in character and learning today there are many who have certificate but do not have the character to be called educated persons and part of the problem of our country is that we assume that anybody with a certificate is educated there is a certain humanity that arises from being educated that makes you understand the essence of common good that makes you understand that public life is a stage of morality french man baron montesquieu who had the most influence on the founding fathers of america and who first propounded the doctrine of separation of power argued that central to being in public life is virtue the same point that eke argued in his two publications as morality which i argue as leadership values and ethos unless you recognise that the reason that you are a senator is to advance the common good of all and that there are certain conducts that go with that role that elevate the dignity of the human person unless you understand that you are not fit for that position and we have in nigeria such people who think it is a contest of brute power i had a conversation with a retired intelligence officer a senior citizen who said he has never seen in the country s history where the naked pursuit of raw power and money has been so central to public life as it is today a truly educated people will not act like that what is now happening is just crude pursuit of plunder famous french writer frederic bastiat in his book the law talked about legal plunder man by nature is inclined to plunder and this always leads to eventual failure the political class is plundering and enjoying it by riding fancy cars the worst part of it is that those who chased the former set of plunderers out are also having a field day plundering in this situation the society is experiencing a double fall this is more dangerous for society including the original plunders in 1975 76 the olusegun obasanjo led government looking at examples from eastern europe and brazil made local government areas part of the fiscal transfer system so significant revenue was now going to them quickly every colonel who had power started working towards getting his village to become a local government and before long we got 774 local councils with about 500 from the old north twice as many as in the south guess what it means that since 1975 76 a huge amount of revenue has been flowing to northern nigeria through local government reforms this is a great irony because northern nigeria has

job seekers speak to the staff of a recruitment agency in arlington us agence france presse the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped from a more than two year high last week pointing to sustained labour market strength that should continue to underpin consumer spending and the economy a data showed factory activity in the mid atlantic region almost stalling this month manufacturers received more orders increased shipments and boosted hours for employees their outlook for capital expenditure over the next six months was also upbeat offering some tentative signs of stabilisation in manufacturing amid an easing in tensions in the 17 month trade war between the united states and china the trade tensions have bruised business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure leading to a downturn in national manufacturing activity but a turnaround in manufacturing which accounts for 11 of the economy could be delayed boeing announced on monday it would suspend production of its best selling 737 max jetliner in january as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now grounded aircraft drags into 2020 economists estimated that boeing s biggest assembly line halt in more than 20 years which is expected to wreak havoc on supply chains could cut first quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a per centage point the economy isn t going off the rails here said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york but at the same time it isn t setting any land speed records initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 18 000 to a seasonally adjusted 234 000 for the week ended dec 14 the labour department said the drop which only partially unwound the prior week s jump of 49 000 likely does not indicate a material shift in labor market conditions as claims data tend to be volatile in the period following the thanksgiving day holiday the surge in the week ended dec 7 which boosted claims to 252 000 the highest reading since september 2017 probably reflected a late thanksgiving day this year compared to 2018 that could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data economists polled by reuters had forecast claims would fall to 225 000 in the latest week they expect claims to remain elevated relative to october s low reading given volatility in the data around the holiday season and end of the year at this point we are not concerned about the rise in initial claims and view it as a statistical quirk related to the seasonal adjustment process around thanksgiving said john ryding chief economist at rdq economics in new york a second report on thursday from the national association of realtors showed existing home sales dropped 1 7 in november home resales however increased 2 7 from a year ago the solid labor market and low mortgage rates are driving demand for housing the dollar was steady against a basket currencies while prices for longer dated us treasuries fell stocks on wall street were trading higher financial markets were unmoved by the impeachment late on wednesday of president donald trump who is unlikely to be removed from office the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility rose 1 500 to 225 500 last week still consistent with a strong labor market last week s claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of december s employment report the four week moving average of claims rose 4 250 between the november and december survey periods suggesting some cooling in job growth the economy added 266 000 jobs in november the most in 10 months the unemployment rate fell back to 3 5 the lowest in nearly half a century labor market strength is supporting consumer spending keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from the trade tensions and slowing global growth in a third report on thursday the philadelphia federal reserve said its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 0 3 in december from 10 4 in november but there were increases in measures of new orders unfilled orders factory hours and shipments while manufacturers reported paying higher prices for raw materials and other inputs they appeared unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers in a significant way the philadelphia fed survey s six month business conditions index slipped to a reading of 35 2 this month from 35 8 in november reuters
weekly comment gbp cad win the race nfp fomc minutes well another year down which currency did best this year oddly enough it depends entirely on which day you start measuring if you take it from the last day of 2018 to the last day of 2019 it s cad with gbp coming in second but if you take it from the first trading day of 2019 to the last 2 january to 31 december gbp and cad switch places with gbp narrowly edging out cad 5 16 to 4 53 gbp s performance surprised me but in fact the guru community did pretty well here at the beginning of 2019 when gbp usd was at 1 26 the consensus forecast for year end was 1 36 the story of how it got there is well known and not worth discussing in great length basically the currency plunged until august when it began to look less likely that britain would crash out of the eu without an agreement and it gradually recovered gbp added a burst when pm boorish johnson defeated the appalling jeremy corbyn in what must be one of the greatest examples of a lesser of two evils election ever tweedledum vs tweedledummer note though that gbp usd remains well below the 1 4877 eur gbp above 0 7653 level it hit on the day of the 2016 eu referendum when it looked like remain was likely to win what happened with cad advertisement the graph above shows that the currency began appreciating after the last bank of canada meeting on 4 december the graph below shows that rate expectations changed notably then with expectations of further rate cuts the signing of the usmca the treaty formerly known as nafta plus indications that the great umbrella d trump had folded on the us china trade war has spurred hopes that the trade issue that s dogged the canadian economy will end bringing peace prosperity and the age of aquarius to canada moreover cad is still generally tracking energy prices although not necessarily on a day to day basis the graph below shows the correlation between daily changes in wti futures and usd cad over the last five years the correlation is measured over a rolling 120 day period as you can see although the relationship isn t as strong as it has been at some times in the past 0 67 it s still significant at 0 32 meaning when oil prices go up usd cad tends to do down which is what you d expect the end of the us trade wars is not only good for canada specifically the us takes 70 of canada s exports but also good for global growth which should help oil prices to recover so it s good for canada both directly and indirectly and with every measure of canadian inflation right in the middle of the bank of canada s target range that makes loosening even less likely bullish cad what s the best bet for 2020 the market s forecasts as divined by the median of all the forecasts in bloomberg are for eur to be the best performing currency over the year even so the dollar is expected to fall only 2 7 vs eur which is a fairly narrow range for a year when the dollar is expected to fall vs most currencies note though that although these forecasts are described as market consensus in fact there is no consensus or very little they re merely the median of a lot of people s forecasts overall they range from 1 06 to 1 21 at year end in other words some people think eur is likely to weaken while others think it will do much better than the median indeed some people have an end q1 forecast that s more bullish than the market consensus end year forecast how well do you think these experts will do remember that these forecasts are made by people who are making at least a six digit salary and employing cutting edge economics i ve made a spreadsheet that lists all the currency forecasts available in bloomberg with a function that uses excel s random function to predict whether the currency will be up or down over the coming year next year at this time i ll dig out this spreadsheet and see how the proverbial monkeys throwing darts did in relation to the highly paid fx analysts come back a year from now and let s see whether throwing all that money and brainpower at the problem performed better than just flipping a coin disclaimer i freely admit that i used to be one of those highly paid investment bank analysts too maybe that s why i m so cynical about these forecasts i know how they re made indicators next week nfp time again as the year starts up we have little on the agenda this coming week the main point will be the monthly speculation over the us nonfarm payrolls nfp the market looks for a healthy adp report of 158k well above the recent average of 120k that s partly because of mean reversion and also expectations that the big miss last month will be rectified the adp report massively underestimated the initial nfp figure last month by 199k that s about 3x the six month average of 64k over time though the two series do tend to move fairly closely together the fit is even better for the final figure of the nfp the adp report is designed to predict the final nfp figure not the initial one so it s reasonable to think that if the adp underreported the nfp last month it should be significantly higher this month although as you can see from the graph above that doesn t always hold big moves in one direction are often followed by a big move in the opposite direction but not always the nfp is also expected to show some mean reversion after last month s blow out surprise this month the figure is expected to be a bit below the recent average the unemployment rate is forecast to stay at the 50 year low of 3 5 average hourly earnings are expected to show a robust 0 3 mom rise which is enough to keep the yoy rate unchanged at a healthy 3 1 it would add to the market s conviction if wages were accelerating but as long as the growth rate isn t slowing that s probably enough to show that the labor market is reasonably tight i think figures like this would be show that the us labor market is still healthy it might not get people thinking about a rate hike but it would add to the view that a rate cut is becoming increasingly unlikely that should tend to support the dollar the us also gets a hefty dose of fedspeak on thursday when fed gov clarida v new york fed s williams v chicago fed s evans nv and st louis fed s bullard nv speak evans and bullard tend to be at the more dovish side of the fomc so even though they re not voters now we should pay attention to what they say if they re not arguing for further cuts any more then the center really has shifted for the eurozone the eu wide consumer price index cpi comes out on tuesday but that s usually an anti climax after today s german cpi they re all expected to be pretty similar both the headline and core eu wide cpis are forecast to be 1 3 which would be a slight acceleration for the headline figure but the same pace for the core index which is the more important one also germany s trade balance and industrial production come out on thursday

consider it a wake up call stock market investors shouldn t panic but intensifying u s iran tensions bring home the potential for geopolitical turmoil to make for more volatile price action in 2020 after a blockbuster 2019 rally investors analysts and economists said oil prices jumped friday while investors dumped equities and piled into haven assets like gold and treasurys in a knee jerk reaction to a u s airstrike in baghdad that killed a top iranian military commander tehran vowed to retaliate and most observers expect them to follow through read who was qassem soleimani and why is his death a major development in u s middle east relations here s what market participants should keep in mind things could get choppy we came into this year calling for a continuation of the equity bull market but with a single digit return profile and elevated volatility said david donabedian chief investment officer at cibc private wealth management in an interview and with the u s iran conflict unlikely to be a one and done event the effect on oil and other markets is unlikely fade quickly as it did in september after an attack on saudi arabia s oil infrastructure that was widely blamed on iran he said see strait of hormuz the world s biggest oil chokepoint in focus as u s iran tensions flare short term market volatility is almost entirely driven by policy or geopolitical uncertainty said brian levitt global market strategist at invesco in a friday note this time will likely be no different we expect that uncertainty may persist in the near term as markets await potential retaliation from iran and disruption in the global oil markets he wrote room to fall stocks ended 2019 on a tear with major u s indexes logging a series of records in december and following through with another set of records on the first trading day of 2020 on thursday on friday the dow jones industrial average djia 0 81 ended with a loss of 233 92 points or 0 8 at 28 634 88 but off session lows the s p 500 spx 0 71 gave up 23 points or 0 7 to close at 3 234 85 while the nasdaq composite finished at 9 020 77 a loss of 71 42 points or 0 8 friday s decline didn t even erase thursday s gains but even bullish analysts warned that overbought conditions and expectations iran will indeed retaliate leave scope for a pullback and increased volatility the 2019 stock market rally wasn t confined to the u s with the msci world index rising 12 since early october said analysts at ing in a friday note and the big rally in risk assets in december certainly looked like a play on the 2020 story benign conditions a trade truce and more money printing in g3 economies were events in the middle east to escalate severely overweight positioning in risk assets could easily trigger a 7 10 correction in global equity markets they wrote not your father s oil shock middle east tensions mean worries over the threat to the world s oil supply and while a wider conflict with iran could create havoc the potential economic pinch isn t the same as it was in past decades also read why the oil market rally on elevated u s iran tensions may be short lived our reliance on fossil fuels to generate economic growth has come down substantially over the years it s not the 70s donabedian said it would take a significant and sustained jump in oil prices for example west texas intermediate crude trading above 75 a barrel for an extended period to begin to raise serious questions about the sustainability of the economic recovery he said in addition the u s thanks to the shale boom is now a global oil exporter the growth of the domestic fossil fuel industry means that higher oil prices are less of a drag on the u s economy ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon economics in a friday note observed that domestic u s oil production runs at almost 13 million barrels a day while consumption is at 21 million barrels a day but while that should mean higher oil prices would depress economic growth recent experience suggests otherwise that s because in the shale area oil sector capital expenditures are acutely sensitive to prices even in the short term he said in a note when oil prices collapsed between spring 2014 and early 2016 the ensuing plunge in capital spending in the oil sector outweighed the boost to consumers real income from cheaper gasoline and heating oil and overall economic growth slowed markedly he said this story played out in reverse when oil prices rebounded in the three years through spring 2018 and economic growth picked up even as consumers real incomes were hit archive why falling oil prices are now a net drag on the u s economy bulls remain bold while analysts see scope for volatility and a near term pullback so far events haven t been enough to turn bulls into bears historically regional geopolitical happenings are not the events that end business and market cycles said invesco s levitt noting that market returns on average have been positive 12 months after spikes in economic uncertainty as measured by a widely followed index see chart below the larger market narrative of slow growth benign inflation globally generally accommodative monetary policy globally and equities still attractive relative to bonds has not changed in our opinion the backdrop for equities and other risk assets remains favorable he said economic calendar in addition to events in the middle east investors will also work through a busy economic calendar in the week ahead the main event comes friday with the december u s jobs report economists surveyed by marketwatch expect the u s economy created 155 000 new jobs last month down from 266 000 in november the unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3 5
but what if the worst possible case eventuated and the end of this prolonged period of increasing global borrowings the termination of the debt super cycle arose running through extreme scenarios such as these is a routine exercise all investors should undertake to test the boundaries of thinking and promote the ability to safeguard investments we find it useful to assess these scenarios to inform portfolio actions particularly for long dated exposures the idea is to consider assets that may outperform in these extreme events and ideally still profit in more benign base case scenarios by looking to the past we can plan for the future a deflationary recession advertisement the inflation rate in australia has stubbornly been below or at the lower end of the rba s 2 to 3 per cent band for more than five years our expectation is that as unemployment falls wages and ultimately inflation will pick up but what if this base case does not eventuate and something more extreme occurs such as a persistent drop in the price of goods consumers would hold out for further savings triggering companies to cut employees to reduce costs the unemployed would chew through their savings in a worse case defaulting on mortgages too many defaults and the banks would write them all off as losses spooking customers into withdrawing their savings leaving banks unable to meet their obligations financial systems would collapse liquidity would disappear and credit would be scarce the human cost is also large as unemployment would rise significantly this scenario a deflationary recession occurred in 1940s america when the world was at war and the us was struggling under the weight of from the great depression when the us economy entered a classic wartime deflationary deleveraging cycle president roosevelt announced ambitious fiscal policy responses that stabilised the economy by targeting the shortage of goods and labour at the same time the federal reserve lowered interest rates to finance government debt especially when pearl harbour drove appetite for the us war effort advertisement this experience is more than a history lecture it s a scenario which has an invaluable lesson for investors in an environment where economic and consumer confidence in a nation s economy is muted follow the fiscal don t fight it position yourselves firmly in the line of fiscal spending targets such as infrastructure but there is another black swan recessionary scenario investors need to be aware of an inflationary recession what if unlike the above there was a sustained increase in the price of goods and services ordinary australians would stretch their paychecks even further while some investors would initially experience increased profits while the rba would work to keep inflation in check there may be times when black swans interfere letting hyperinflation in to be fair this is a more far fetched scenario but if we wanted to get creative we could point to potential catalysts such as an animal epidemic water shortage or increased energy prices fundamentally shifting our economy and marketplace hyperinflation occurred in weimar germany after the reichstag firm in the belief germany would win world war i shifted the economy to war production counting on foreign debt future reparations and control of the resource rich industrial territories advertisement they were wrong and when drowning under a massive war debt and reparations the government printed more money it flooded the economy and devalued their currency hyperinflation then became a reality in which the people suffered a loaf of bread that cost 160 marks at the end of 1922 cost 200 000 000 000 marks less than a year later money was used as wallpaper what can an investor do they say history never repeats but it does rhyme while neither the inflationary or deflationary recession scenario is an ideal time for any portfolio if you believe in the ultimate strength of the government and central bank in question then the best policy is to not fight them and align your portfolio with assets that are close to their likely fiscal and monetary policy agendas at the time short dated government bonds credit bonds in utility like corporates and infrastructure assets on essential services are likely to wear the brunt of a downturn better than many assets furthermore they are unlikely to do a portfolio significant harm in the event that these black swans never eventuate they provide solid income in a wide range of environments and are likely to have good downside protection in a more benign cyclical slowdown than the extreme measures explored here after all forewarned is forearmed katrina king is the general manager for research and product innovation at qic
some sovereign funds and institutional giants sprinkle capital at blockchain and digital currency startups posted on 01 05 2020 blockchain or distributed ledger technologies are frequently associated with cryptocurrencies such as as bitcoin however blockchain is a network of separate computer systems that interact to make record and document transactions it is regarded as a democratizing tool for decentralized transactions the world bank is steering clear of issuing recommendations but did indicate that blockchain technology could increase efficiency and lower remittance costs and potentially improve access to finance for unbanked populations who are currently outside the traditional financial system the world bank also sees the potential to transform various other sectors as well like manufacturing government financial management systems and clean energy early interest in blockchain among institutional investors has been low swfi s latest survey results show that blockchain is seeing investment by a mere 9 of large institutional investors despite this digital asset managers are reporting that most new inflows are coming from institutions since institutional investors have such deep pools of capital it would not require many of them to move the needle in the blockchain markets the potential has been theorized but not yet thoroughly tested in many applications in real world conditions it is believed that using blockchain technology digital assets can be traded at any time of day or night holidays and weekends could be irrelevant trades could be made through blockchain on any day of the year high transaction costs particularly for real estate are also expected to come down innovations can also be made at the institutional level state street s blockchain outlook state street is pursuing blockchain use enthusiastically state street s blockchain in 5 presentation laid out the potential for blockchain to speed reconciliation shorten settlement time and automate processes however state street is also wary of regulatory governance and technical challenges before it can reap what it thinks is huge potential that will only be unlocked through experimentation state street s enthusiasm is tempered with the knowledge that it s still early days in the blockchain revolution security is also thought to be a thorny problem even though blockchain is supposed to make transactions more secure due to the multiplicity of computers involved as opposed to a single system that can be hacked or shut down automation has been a theme at state street and it has been reducing headcount in it and elsewhere state street s vice president of media relations brendan paul said that headcount reduction would streamline our it organization and removes unnecessary layers that get in the way of our overall success some it employees who made up the unnecessary layers have been following state street s former chief technology architect moiz kohari to manetu a data based startup that treats data as its prime business state street still has 38 000 workers on the payroll and is shifting much of its new hiring to china india and poland where the costs of doing business are not as high as they are in advanced western economies china supports blockchain but not cryptocurrencies china is emerging as the world s leader in blockchain thanks to the endorsement of president xi jinping mr xi urged his people to seize the opportunities blockchain offers although it still isn t clear how blockchain will be developed or adopted mr xi called it an important breakthrough in independent innovation paradoxically bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly discouraged in china that s because the ruling communist party has no interest in decentralized and untraceable transactions in an era where citizens are already sneaking money outside of the borders instead the government is creating a digital currency of its own which is tied to the yuan this first ever sovereign digital currency is expected in 2020 hainan province is a tropical location that is compared to hawaii and it hosts china s blockchain pilot zone over 100 blockchain organizations have located there and more are signing on us 142 million has been set aside by the government to help them study and direct blockchain based solutions for housing healthcare trade and even the tourism that the island is known for singapore s sovereign wealth fund temasek and china s hna group are there working on improvements in the aviation industry in 2018 temasek purchased shares in hainan airlines which hna controls through the hainan province cihang foundation microsoft has been there for years and founded an innovation center chinese search engine baidu is also there dubai s blockchain center has agreed to partner with hainan s pilot zone and help it to meet its goals additional state owned enterprises are expected to make a transition in the years ahead crytpocurrencies it bears repeating that it is common for investors to equate blockchain with cryptocurrencies even though crytpocurrencies are merely one use of blockchain technology albeit the most popular when establishing an investment in cryptocurrencies there are a number of open questions that need to be addressed first the variety of cryptoassets already available is set to increase each cryptoasset may require different security protocols investment timeframes and security apparatuses it would be important to know which blockchain type corresponds to the cryptocurrency being purchased the specific exchange being used would also need to be evaluated one of the most famous exchanges was mt gox mt gox handled 70 of bitcoin exchanges at one time before it was shut down by regulators as many as 850 000 bitcoins vanished on the computer system and forensic computer investigators attempted the impossible task of tracking them down unfortunately this was without much success another company quadriga fintech solutions operating out of canada left investors approximately us 200 million poorer after its 30 year old founder died unexpectedly without sharing the access pin to the bitcoins he had secured for investors through his laptop computer an employee who could act as a backup could have helped since much of the perceived value of cryptocurrencies revolves around the fact that they are an untraceable way of buying and selling there is generally no counterparty to verify transactions another open question is whether the particular cryptocurrency being purchased is a legitimate currency regulators have not yet taken a unified position on this neither the financial standards accounting board nor the international accounting standards board has firm guidance to offer recognizing and reporting on these investments in a legal way remains a mystery it is not yet clear how to properly value or pay taxes on these assets for the time being most are opting to count them the same way they count patents or copyrights as indefinite lived intangible assets the u s internal revenue service irs taxes cryptocurrencies as property with taxes due upon conversion to dollars over time more specific instructions should become available where some see risks others see opportunities abu dhabi s mubadala investment company funded a local cryptocurrency

this post is part of coindesk s 2019 year in review a collection of 100 op eds interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world richie hecker is an entrepreneur and management consultant at traction scale 2019 was the year of libra rising an attempt led by facebook to create a new form of digital currency and banking system transformative in potential and huge in aspirations libra was the seminal crypto event of 2019 yet like most of the icos that predated it libra is doomed to fail in its current form there i said it yes i m a big believer in the transformative power of technology for the underbanked to make it easier to save money and build credit unfortunately libra in its current form is not the solution because it offers an overcomplicated approach that will make it extremely difficult to execute for background on where i am coming from i have run a community with 100 million users and spent many years in financial services including working on bank acquisitions related professor ben noys what crypto sees in accelerationism facebook could create a global payments network which can benefit users around the world with its billions of users and experience with scaling systems facebook already has the basic infrastructure in place to create a transformative payments system if you add in all of the partners lined up as shareholders of libra it covers the gamut of global payments and commerce and should be able to succeed this opportunity exists because the current banking system is closed there are a host of regulatory licenses needed to hold send and store money regulatory scrutiny is meant to ensure safety and security to protect citizens from fraud and to prevent money laundering but too often these controls kill competition and raise prices leaving room for improvement in the system often consumers cannot send wires on weekends and it can take days for global payments to clear between banks the banks themselves are developing a real time commercial payments platforms but they are not quite there yet banks have zelle for real time peer to peer payments and it works well but you need to be a bank to use it paypal has venmo which works for individuals the banks also have a b2b rtp network through the clearing house that is live story continues it is nascent but it exists and the federal reserve is also developing its own real time payments network called fed now for 24 7 365 payments this will eventually come to life this may make it difficult for a startup to compete long term libra good and bad related while we wait for laws we need better interpretations of existing regulation so what is libra and why is it doomed to fail libra creates a digital token representing a basket of assets and a payment system designed to make it easy to send money around the world according to the white paper libra s mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people in a way it is venmo with its own currency running on a new real time payment system this payment system would be open 24 7 as opposed to the current banking system that is only partially 24 7 those connected with zelle and rtp libra creates a phantom payment network on top of existing currencies the phantom currency represents traditional assets like dollars and transfers instantly and then the actual assets can settle later libra says it will be backed by a basket of assets but is not clear on exactly what assets will be inside of a libra this lack of clarity over what assets it will comprise will likely lead to regulatory jurisdiction vs jurisdiction hell every regulator touched by libra will begin investigating it it is not clear if it is a currency a derivative a security a commodity pool and so on thus it isn t clear which laws apply jurisdictions will likely disagree with each other on this point as they do already in defining digital currencies at home nation states could easily fight over the aspects over digital money as there does not appear to be any enacted international trade agreements that govern this type of financial arrangement even after libra works out its legal jurisdiction it will still be very hard to create the desired benefits for its stated use cases libra s stated goal is to provide digital banking for the 1 7 billion unbanked provide a way for people in volatile markets to hold a stable asset and offer a cheap way to exchange money worldwide but these benefits will be extremely difficult to achieve many of these issues can be addressed by learning one big lesson from the father of payments networks visa in libra s proposed system banking the unbanked will still require full due diligence and adhering to know your customer regulations to combat money laundering which could result in that signing up for libra will be similar to dealing with any bank today with similar challenges the on off ramps are different but the regulations are similar the expensive part of instituting a currency exchange is the last mile which libra cannot solve without building its own in person network or partnering with existing retail and atm networks m pesa the east african mobile money transfer system regarded as a top system addressing the underbanked partners with western union and other incumbent networks so users can make it easier to send and receive money m pesa has 28 million active customers and facilitates 50 pertcent of kenya gdp m pesa s customers will now be able to send money to anyone in the 200 countries in which western union operates libra could set up similar partnerships to withdraw cash or enable digital transfers and simply do it at a lower cost by introducing itself as competition in some countries replicating local withdrawal networks will prove challenging the cell networks are the key gatekeepers for mobile money in the developing world it will be hard to compete with the carriers that have an existing most and user trust however a new offering could lead to a price war that could help customers or to libra taking losses to subsidize growth this is the equivalent of western union lowering its fees to add more value back to its customers this could be greatly add value the real cost of sending a payment is low and the cost of wholesale currency conversion is low so it is possible to do lower cost payments if facebook can create an internally coherent payments and consumer ecosystem it will incur fewer on off ramp costs the big opportunity for libra aside from developing a wallet is working with retailers and others to sell consumers products based on their net worth and spending habits this it can do with the in network money without worrying about consumers breaking back to fiat most countries with volatile currencies have currency controls which they will place on libra essentially making it money laundering to create an inflation hedge for example a government could make it illegal to buy or transfer more than a government mandated threshold of libra each year and therefore converting out of the local currency would be a crime chinese nationals are able to transfer up to only 50 000 per person per year out of the country china could easily pass a law to say any financial asset or cryptocurrency would fall under the rule as well even if libra figures out a way to launch and achieve its stated goals it will likely be crushed by fraud libra does not have a clear policy and process for fraud prevention engine or a simple mechanism to solve fraud disputes essentially it creates a wild west free for all so the lack of fraud controls will likely lead to a bad actor immediately creating an app to defraud people into sending their libra to the scammer mobile bankers in kenya sometimes keep all of their savings on their phone and routinely get scammed into giving up their passwords libra has great promise but has serious challenges to overcome many of these issues can be addressed by learning one big lesson from the father of payments networks visa visa started as bank americard inside bank of america as an internal credit system then it became a system licensed to other banks and finally an association owned by its members and a public company this staging approach allowed it to grow steadily and avoid undue regulatory and political burdens until it was ready to take over how to make libra work follow the same path of visa one back libra initially with only u s dollars or another single currency this will enable libra to launch within the current u s banking regulatory framework if it launches inside the u s banking system it will be respected everywhere with the possible exception of china there are clear ways to set this up so it would pass all regulatory scrutiny by including other assets libra brings a host of potential regulatory conflicts on itself so even if it wins regulatory approval that approval will be expensive and time consuming two the network should centralize administration so there is an anti fraud system in place and a clear body to communicate with for regulatory scrutiny what libra proposed is essentially centralized anyway with a single database to run the system facebook has such a large network that implementing a low fee payment system would be a huge first step it can invite others onto the platform and finally turn it into a consortium once the bugs are removed and it has passed regulatory scrutiny in fact facebook already has the infrastructure for this payments inside of messenger it already has an anti fraud system and it is tied to your facebook id three after that facebook can enable people to build applications on top of the existing payments system this step likely won t require much additional regulatory requirements facebook mastered apps many years ago these steps implemented properly will make it easy for libra to launch and avoid being shut down by regulators the cost of these steps will be steep they would require almost total centralization and be a continuation of their existing business but the benefit could be fast fair global banking a friend of mine once said bring me a small island before you promise me the world a simpler staged approach can help libra prosper and deliver related stories
china has decided to keep its inflation target unchanged this year at around 3 sources say suggesting policymakers will continue to roll out more economic support measures while avoiding aggressive stimulus some analysts have speculated that beijing will raise the inflation target to 3 5 which would give authorities more room to support the world s second largest economy as growth tails off to the slowest in nearly 30 years but policy sources told reuters the government expects surging food prices to start easing in the second half of the year as the government takes steps to address pork shortages the 2020 inflation target to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in early march was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference last month according to three sources with knowledge of the meeting s outcome the target will still be around 3 one of the policy sources said we cannot rule out the possibility that inflation may break 5 in the coming months but that could be short lived the state council information office and the national development and reform commission the state planner did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment china s consumer price inflation cpi accelerated to a near eight year high of 4 5 in november as pork prices doubled due to a massive outbreak of african swine fever but producer prices have remained in deflation for five straight months the diverging price trends have complicated policymakers efforts to revive activity without risking overstimulating the economy while beijing has rolled out a series of support measures in the last two years mainly in the form of higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts leaders have pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008 09 global crisis which saddled the economy with a mountain of debt price pressures seen easing china has kept its inflation target at around 3 since 2015 while food prices have spiked there has been little sign of a pick up in inflation across the broader economy suggesting demand remains sluggish core inflation which excludes food and energy prices has stayed largely subdued currently the cpi rise is mainly due to pork prices this is a structural not a broad spread price rise pork prices could start to fall in the second half said a second source still the government may face a tough job in keeping inflation below 3 this year policy insiders said adding that rising inflation expectations could reinforce the central bank s cautious approach to further policy easing a lower inflation target could help cool down the inflation expectation which is one of major forces driving up the headline inflation during the upper cycle said steven zhang chief economist and head of research at morgan stanley huaxin securities the government may have higher than expected confidence to curb the food inflation despite the surging pork prices on wednesday the central bank announced its eighth cut since early 2018 in banks reserve requirements rrr or the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves in a bid to shore up the economy analysts expect at least one more rrr cut this year the central bank has also begun lowering its key lending rate in recent months with more expected possibly before the end of this month but the cuts have been far smaller than substantial easing in the united states and many other economies over the past year policy sources have told reuters that beijing plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6 in 2020 china s third quarter growth slowed to 6 still among the fastest in the world but its weakest expansion in nearly three decades
it was the best of times it was the worst of times charles dickens a tale of two cities dumpster diving is a sad reality for many americans who are part of the 50 million people who are not able to find a daily meal therefore they scrounge for food in garbage dumpsters headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters more than 40 000 veterans of united states us wars are homeless on any given night government data reveal these homeless veterans like many other poor people are not enjoying the best of times that donald the great impeached trump boasts about he is always boasting about the lowest unemployment in 50 years and record high stock market growth under his presidency poverty and racism the crass realities of america are that the rich are getting richer while workers who are paid starvation wages are getting poorer and poorer therefore the working people simply cannot afford the rising cost of food rent medical expenses transportation among other necessities of life as their daily conditions of life worsen millions of people become the faceless numbers not caught up in the rosy statistics bragged about by television pundits and conservative politicians such as donald trump of great significance too political economists have long identified this general tendency for wages to move towards a starvation point where as we see now the working classes are not able to afford food there are also racial disparities reflected in those who are poor and homeless and who have been left behind by the purported gains of economic progress african americans make up 40 per cent of homeless minorities even though they are just 13 per cent of the general population hispanics make up 21 per cent of the homeless even though they are just 18 per cent of the general population this shows that people of colour are being left behind by the gains of the free market economy increased poverty directly led to a rise in food banks food banks are places set up to help the needy get a daily meal and according to researcher larry romanoff the number of food banks increased from 200 in 1980 to more than 40 000 now he notes that 50 million hungry americans today includes the 25 per cent of all children in the us who go to sleep hungry at night global research december 18 2019 tax dodging by the rich meanwhile tax dodging by rich people has caused lost revenues of more than us 280 billion reuters reports adding that there is more than us 32 trillion hidden in non tax paying offshore bank accounts the panama papers exposed some of this disgraceful unlawful behaviour this was a trove of 11 6 million files belonging to a law firm mossack fonseca that was leaked to the press more than us 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties was recovered from some tax dodgers including apple after the international consortium of investigative journalists published the panama papers american tax dodgers identified in the panama papers included several persons from donald the great impeached trump s inner circles two of trump s cabinet members were named one of whom is an exon mobil executive among the reported top companies that pay little or no tax are apple google facebook amazon general electric and a host of multinational corporations and big business leaders yet they benefited from a us 1 3 trillion tax cut donald the great impeached trump gave himself and his cronies in another exposé on october 26 2018 jon schwartz revealed in the intercept that goldman sachs a very large wall street investment company was found to have 551 tax dodging subsidiaries registered in the cayman islands poor people suffering despite the façade of trumpian economic success there is a septic rotting underbelly of cancerous poverty that is spreading through the dirt poor rural poverty pockets the appalachian mountains mcallen texas memphis tennessee and urban america where there are the highest concentration of poverty the middle class is also very squeezed financially according to the world inequality report 2018 the world s middle class which contains all the global 90 per cent of income groups in the united states and the european union are being financially squeezed meanwhile the top one per cent grabbed twice as much of global wealth as the poorest 50 per cent of the world s population this is a political economy of poverty and social oppression given these realities at what point does there emerge the need to balance the scales of economic justice to achieve the general economic well being for the whole society fight for justice meanwhile as the american 2020 general elections gather steam progressive politicians such as senators bernie saunders and elizabeth warren are leading the fight for political social and economic justice bernie saunders is a democratic socialist he is campaigning for some of the same type of egalitarian principles and policies that michael manley and the people s national party under his leadership once advocated for jamaica the american democratic socialists are the progressive wing of the democratic party political solutions advocated by these conscientious american social reformers include mobilising and educating citizens to get involved in the fight for social and economic justice fighting for a living wage of us 15 per hour which is twice the national minimum wage affordable universal healthcare for the american underclass tuition free college education up to a first degree progressive tax policies to make the rich share the national burden it is delusional therefore for donald the great impeached trump to boast that unemployment is low and the stock market is at a record high how does this help the 50 million americans who go to bed hungry at night many of these poverty stricken souls forage for scraps of food in garbage dumpsters that is extremely bad and sad for an extremely wealthy country that is just the very

economic statecraft by obadiah mailafia 08170000411 sms only one of the popular delusions in our national economic management is that development planning is bad and that all we need are the so called rolling plans and mid term expenditure frameworks the history of planning in nigeria goes back to the colonial times before independence the departing british brought in economists from the world bank to assist in designing our first five year development plan covering the years 1962 1968 the distinguished american economist wolfgang stolper was one of the architects of our first national plan about which he wrote with such nostalgia in his memoirs we have had altogether four national plans since independence the first national development plan 1962 1968 the second national development plan 1970 1974 the third national development plan 1975 1980 and the fourth national development plan 1981 1985 in addition there have been the so called rolling plans such as the national economic empowerment and development strategy the seven point agenda and vision 2020 vision 2020 was crafted in 2009 as a long term perspective document with the target of increasing the national gdp to be among the top 20 by the year 2020 its implementation framework was weak while it was deficient in vital areas such as industrialisation technology and innovation in january 2020 it is clear that we have been off target by a wide margin with a total gdp of 446 5bn we come 28th in the world gdp ranking the 20th position that we so coveted is currently held by wealthy switzerland followed in a descending order by taiwan poland thailand belgium iran austria and nigeria in 1985 the ibrahim babangida military administration was foolishly persuaded by the bretton woods institutions to jettison planning altogether our half baked neoliberal economists who bought into the fraud were in no position to know that works such as those by naomi caiden and aaron wildavsky planning and budgeting in poor countries 1974 were really sponsored stratagems to ultimately ridicule and discourage planning in developing countries this is not to say we should by any means idealise planning economic development planning is not a panacea for all economic ills but i see it as a discipline and tool for resource and political mobilisation that enabled leaders and the nation s economic managers to focus on long term strategic policy choices economic planning also helps to minimise the rampant policy inconsistencies and instability that accompany regime changes contrary to what many suppose the emerging countries that have enjoyed accelerated growth and structural transformation have been precisely those that never jettisoned economic development plans these include china india south korea malaysia singapore and indonesia those countries have persisted with economic development in disregard to pressure from foreign powers and the results have been salutary many of the challenges that we face today are precisely problems that by their very nature require long term thinking not just mid term expenditure plans we in nigeria would be well advised to go back to the traditions of economic planning but we must do so devoid of ideological dogmatism the idea of lumping planning under finance and budget is technically wrong the person who plans the economy should not be the same person who spends the money an inherent conflict of interest will arise in such an arrangement it is my considered opinion that we should revitalise the national planning commission as an autonomous professional organisation a centre of excellence attracting the best economists in the country regional and urban planning should also be integrated into the new planning framework we should plan not only for accelerated sustainable growth we should also plan for our cities and regions while adopting a comprehensive strategic approach to the overall planning process we must embark upon a more ambitious project of accelerated agriculture based industrial revolution anchored on inclusive growth that generates jobs for millions of our people we need nothing less than a new philosophy of development that puts people at the heart of the development process of course without peace and harmony nothing meaningful can happen nigerians have become more divided than ever before thanks to the private agendas of our population who put private interests before the welfare of the people we need a coalition of nigerians who believe not only in peace and justice but who can also be trusted to work hard to deliver solid outcomes in terms of the greatest good for the greatest number we therefore need to forge a new national consensus on the goals and objectives of sustainable growth and national transformation bold action is also needed in economic reform long term strategic planning and in strengthening governance and institutional performance the current administration s commitment to anti corruption is in the right direction but we must also understand that fighting corruption is not a substitute for economic policy there is a risk that we may be going off tangent by chasing thieves instead of focusing on the arduous imperatives of governance and rigorous implementation of economic policy we must of course recover all our stolen patrimony but this must be seen as part and parcel of a policy drive for re booting our economy and re engineering growth and long term sustainable development equally important is placing priority on the private sector as the driver of growth the notion that government knows everything and is best placed to tackle our national development challenges is part of the old thinking that we need to jettison we need to reinvent government as a smart entrepreneurial state that focuses on areas in which it has the highest comparative advantage infrastructure education health security and other public goods while reforming the civil service to make it more professionalised and effective we must allow the private sector to become the engine and locomotive of growth while building an enabling environment for foreign investors and local businesspeople especially smes diversification of the economy away from oil dependence has to be one of the fundamental pillars of economic planning and policy in the years ahead structural diversification of the economy has to be founded on seven pillars first enhancing the quality of governance leadership and core public institutions including reform of the civil service secondly fixing the energy deficit and the parlous physical infrastructure placing the private sector at the heart of the economy as the engine and locomotive of growth thirdly harnessing our best talents in the service of scientific research technology and innovation with strong linkages to industry for production of high value added products for domestic and world markets and fourth upscaling our education system skills and training with strong emphasis on the stem disciplines instead of the current dominance of humanities and social sciences it goes without saying that security social order and harmony constitute the fundamental bedrock of economic progress this goes hand in hand with macroeconomic stability and improvement of economic fundamentals such as moderate interest rates a stable naira that is progressively a semi convertible international trading currency progressive industrial and trade policies and forging bold regional and international trading partnerships that hook us into the integrated global marketplace going forward we need to design a long term perspective plan that is broken down into five year economic development plans covering the years 2020 2040 we will need to also create a public private sector economic development board on the singapore model that will drive the implementation of this long term perspective plan we should aim to achieve the following five principal targets in our development planning 1 creation of a 2tn economy 2 lifting our per capita income to 20 000 3 building of a diversified and industrialised technological knowledge economy 4 membership of the oecd club of industrialised economies and 5 building of a strong united and prosperous democracy anchored on the principles of social justice the rule of law

democratic presidential candidates the health care crisis is often discussed these candidates maintain they are terribly worried about rising health care costs but their party created the problem by foisting the unworkable affordable care act on the nation in 2010 the latest issue democrats are using to attack the president is his bold move to kill gen qassem soleimani this iranian major general was one of the foremost terrorist leaders in the world he commanded the islamic revolutionary guard corps foreign operations unit democrats are expressing their concern that the attack may destabilize the region yet that is precisely what soleimani had been doing for years on friday morning a u s military drone strike killed soleimani at the main airport in baghdad soleimani was responsible for the deaths of approximately 600 americans and an untold number of anti government protesters in iran he has been spreading terrorism around the globe for years he was even sanctioned by the obama

the pound to dollar exchange rates have seen an uptick at the start of the week with uk services data providing sterling buyers where do analysts believe gbp usd is tipped to go from here long term we believe the cycle from the 2007 highs at 2 1160 completed at 1 1490 in 2016 with a higher low at 1 1950 in 2019 say analysts at lloyds bank on monday january 6 as such an eventual recovery through 1 45 towards 1 60 1 65 is expected in the years ahead medium term we see the risk of a 1 25 to 1 35 range developing first the pound to dollar exchange rate initially got off to a strong start last week striking a two week best conversion in the post christmas lull this uptrend in sterling was aided by boris johnson s announcement that workers on minimum wage in the uk would be in line for a notable bump in pay in 2020 johnson announced the national living wage will rise by 6 2 in april a jump of more than four times that of inflation and expected to provide the average worker with an extra 900 a year this buoyed gbp investors on hopes the bump will boost consumer spending and subsequently economic growth in 2020 however as we entered the second half of the week and traders returned from the new year festivities a little more sober we saw sterling beat a hasty retreat the slump in the pound appeared mostly fueled by brexit uncertainty as gbp investors grow increasingly sceptical that boris johnson will be able to negotiate a trade deal with the eu in just eleven months and avoid a no deal brexit at the end of 2020 also contributing to the pressure on sterling was the uk s latest pmi figures which showed the uk s manufacturing sector stumbled over the finishing line in 2019 advertisement duncan brock group director at the chartered institute of procurement supply commented the pace of manufacturing s decline in december will set alarm bells ringing as production levels sank at their fastest levels since july 2012 and with no sign of immediate recovery in sight us dollar exchange rates recovery fueled by risk off trade meanwhile the us dollar usd struggled in the first half of last week closing 2019 on a sour note as a usd sell off appeared to take hold of markets the usd selling bias was attributed to a risk on mood in markets as donald trump confirmed a phase one trade deal would be signed with china on 15th january in washington as well as some year end shorting of the currency however the second half of the week and the start of 2020 saw the us dollar roar back to life as investors flocked back to the currency amidst a surge in safe haven demand this came as a result of escalating tensions in the middle east in the wake of a us air strike against a top iranian general in baghdad week ahead outlook robust data to bolster the us dollar exchange rates the killing of general qasem soleimani stoked fears of possible conflict between washington and tehran with skittish investors flocking to the us dollar and other safe haven currencies looking ahead the pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate may remain on the back foot this week with the publication of the latest us economic data in the first half of the week we have the publication of the ism non manufacturing pmi with economists forecasting it will show that us service sector activity rose in december turning to the second half of the week we may see us non farm payrolls also bolster usd exchange rates if employment continued to expand at a robust pace in december also strengthening the us dollar throughout the week may be the fallout from the us air strikes with the potential for a further escalation in tensions likely to keep the safe haven currency in demand meanwhile the pound is likely to face some pressure at the start of this week s session as the final reading of the uk s service pmi is expected to confirm growth in the key service sector slipped to a nine month low in december on top of this gbp exchange rates are also likely to be shaped by brexit sentiment potentially leaving sterling vulnerable to further losses as investors grow increasingly jittery as the uk prepares to officially leave the eu later this month
good morning wherever you are here s our summary of key economic events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news of a sudden elevation in risk with events in the middle east adding to economic climate and political risks around the world the downer comes at a bad time for the us the widely watched ism factory pmi fell sharply to its steepest drop in ten years in december and much worse than expected that is the fifth straight month on decline new orders fell faster the data suggests their gdp grew at only 1 3 pa in q4 2019 accentuating the economic decline given that china s factory pmi is expanding it is clear that the us is not winning the tariff wars and a 50 state analysis in the us shows that nine of them are expected to contract into recession in 2020 the most since the gfc the most interesting thing about those nine is that they are mostly in the trump heartland american 2019 vehicle sales look like they will be well under 17 mln and that will be the lowest level since 2014 meanwhile the us fed indicated it is ready to hold its policy settings unchanged for a long time yet in canada factories are slowing there too but at least they are still expanding in china not only are they contending with the asf virus in their pig herd a new sars like virus is spreading in humans and causing widespread unease and as the chinese spring festival approaches starting january 24 monetary authorities are readying a huge cash injection to ensure there are no liquidity issues up to four times as much as they released last week with their 50 bps reserve ratio cut that could see another nz 650 bln flooding their banking system on top of the nz 175 bln last week all up that is approaching a nz 1 tln addition in january alone china is about to claim that is nominal gross national income per capital exceeded us 10 000 in 2019 a rise of about 6 for comparison new zealand recorded us 40 640 in 2018 australia recorded us 53 230 and the us recorded us 63 080 in hong kong protests continue the latest by teachers pushing back at removal threats for participating in the demonstrations all this is having a severe impact on the city s retail trade which was down by an eye watering 23 in november year on year and similar to the sharp october decline in australia the extreme temperatures and fires are affecting food supplies in victoria and nsw the areas of greatest stress are the centres of dairying for both states not only are livestock is a bad way on many farms those that have fodder and water can t get supplies out of the area milking cows are under extreme stress and production factories in the area don t have staff to operate they are all at home fighting fires or protecting their properties perversely when this fire season crisis is over there is likely to be a significant rebuilding of much lost infrastructure and when that occurs it could be positive for australian economic activity until then the data will be very negative all the while global markets are trading at extreme greed levels volatility is moderate the ust 10yr yield will start this week at 1 79 and a 9 bps drop since friday their 2 10 curve has tightened up now at 26 bps their 1 5 curve is much flatter at just 5 bps and their 3m 10yr curve is moved the most much narrower at 27 bps the aussie govt 10yr is down 8 bps at 1 22 the china govt 10yr is unchanged at 3 19 holding its notable stability and the nz govt 10 yr is also down 7 bps lower at 1 59 and as you would expect gold is much firmer today up us 27 from friday now at us 1 552 oz a reflection of the sudden risks in the middle east us oil prices are more than us 2 higher at just over us 63 bbl and the brent benchmark is also sharply higher at just over us 68 50 bbl not helping is that us crude oil stocks have dropped sharply the kiwi dollar will start the week very little changed at 66 7 usc on the cross rates we are also unchanged at 95 8 auc against the euro we are holding at 59 7 euro cents that puts our twi 5 at 71 5 and the same level as just before the holiday break started but bitcoin is up 1 6 to us 7 450 from where we left it on saturday the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here
jeddah a further escalation in geopolitical tensions could provide additional short term upside to oil and gold prices a report report prepared by three analysts from ubs ag and ubs said that being said in our base case we still target a brent oil price drop to 60 bbl during 1h20 gold on the other hand is expected to reach 1 600 oz negative real rates in the us and a weaker us dollar favor stronger precious metal prices in general analysts dominic schnider cfa caia giovanni staunovo and wayne gordon said following the us airstrike in iraq crude oil and gold moved higher during friday trade crude oil prices are up nearly 4 to 68 7 bbl for brent and 63 4 bbl for wti and 1 3 to nearly 1 550 oz for gold respectively at the time of writing the precious metal complex silver platinum and palladium tends to benefit from bouts of market uncertainty industrial metals on the other hand are down in line with risk assets with equities and growth sensitive currencies coming under pressure they said a more serious escalation in the middle east which is not our base case would have a broader economic and financial market impact through sharply higher crude oil prices the region accounts for almost one third of global oil supply iran and iraq produced 2 13 million barrels per day mbpd and 4 65mpbd of crude in november 2019 respectively and combined accounted for nearly 8 of global oil liquids supply in november 2019 including natural gas liquids production of 1 15mbpd market participants are concerned that the tensions between iran and the us could impact the political stability of iraq and the oil production in the second largest opec producer while a number of us oil workers have been evacuated from the iraqi oil fields near basra the iraqi oil ministry has highlighted that production and exports have so far not been affected while neither the us nor iran wish for an escalation in tensions no one knows if when and how iran will respond the analysts said considering these risks markets have added a risk premium on fears tensions could escalate us secretary of state of mike pompeo stated that the us remain committed to de escalation and does not seek war with iran but will not stand by and see american lives put at risk any larger sustained disruption to supply could send prices toward 75 bbl or higher but adequate to ample crude spare capacity opec s and russia s spare capacity is around 3 3mbpd while the return of production from the neutral zone shared between saudi arabian and kuwait could increase that spare capacity by another 0 3mbpd over the next 6 12months in addition to strategic oil reserves held by oecd countries provide a key supply cushion moreover on the back of non opec supply growth driven by the us and norway outpacing modest oil demand growth this year we still expect an oversupplied oil market in 2020 0 3mbpd particularly in 1h20 hence we believe brent price moves above 70 bbl are unlikely to be sustained over several months this was the case in september when saudi oil processing facilities were damaged and prices reversed fully within two weeks we therefore reiterate our bearish price guidance for brent and see oil declining toward 60 bbl during 1h20 with risks skewed to the upside the analysts said given heightened geopolitical tension in the middle east all precious metal prices shifted firmly higher on friday given its safe haven status gold advanced the most within the precious metals complex geopolitical tension in the middle east has the potential to support even higher prices in the very short run however the impact usually fades over a longer period of time so it s possible that some of the gains will be priced out in the latter part of 1q20 but that doesn t mean investors should turn negative on precious metals especially gold we continue to target a gold price move to 1 600 oz in 2020 the underlying drivers are not middle east market uncertainty rather they are increasingly negative us real interest rates and the broad based weakening of the us dollar a renewed rise in the federal reserve s balance sheet and the risk of more fed rate cuts to support a slowing us economy tend to be supportive of precious metals this holds particularly true in a world where interest rates are expected to stay low for longer and with rates in many economies near zero or negative thus we see value in staying long the metal from a thematic angle and the value in the diversification benefits the metal brings to equity oriented investor with risk assets coming under pressure particularly equities industrial metal prices are down up to 3 5 at the time of writing we still believe any bigger setback in base metal prices i e in the mid single digits or more should be used to build some long exposure this stance largely hinges on our view that global capex will recover this year and that economic growth in asia will not be affected by the developments in the middle east in short growth in asia should still accelerate this year in china which is a major consumer of base metals housing activity is expected to hold up in 1h20 and infrastructure investment and industrial production activity should gain greater traction the resulting pick up in industrial metal demand particularly from 2q20 onwards holds the key to another round of lower visible inventories the analysts opined even if market deficits narrow in 2020 we believe the supply side has sufficient pricing power to command higher prices for several reasons a inventory levels stand at low or very low levels b compared to 2019 demand should accelerate next year c higher production costs could be an issue as the global economy reflates d the lack of capex investments in recent years makes the supply side more vulnerable and e we target a broadly weaker us dollar so for now we like to sell the downside risks in nickel and lead for a premium we like strike levels at 13 100 for nickel and 1 800 mt for lead and target maturities of six months pullbacks in copper below 6 000 mt should be used to build longs sg
so what s in store for 2020 it always takes a while for seismic political shifts to feed through into our daily lives and so it is with the scale of the tory victory last month the biggest single influence for britons during the coming year will be what our new self confident government does but there is a lot else going on in the world to try to set the state of the uk in its global context here are my top five themes for the coming year the first three are domestic you have to start with the boris bounce will there be one we surely need it boris is not the only one with a new job the british jobs market has been amazingly strong and for the moment remains so with the lowest unemployment since 1974 we avoided recession last autumn which is good but retail sales and the housing market are at best pretty flat and that feeds through to business confidence big businesses worry about great issues such as access to european markets small businesses which employ a lot more people worry about whether anyone is buying their stuff they need practical evidence of an uplift that leads to theme number two the british jobs market it has been amazingly strong and for the moment remains so but employers face a big hike in the minimum wage and while in many parts of the country they can shrug that off in other regions the 6 2 per cent rise from april onwards may be the difference between making that extra hire or not people take for granted that there are plenty of jobs and with unemployment the lowest since 1974 you can see why the mood could shift rapidly if job growth eases off so theme three what will the government do in the forthcoming budget probably in february they will spend more allowing the deficit to creep up a bit but it won t be much more and one of the things to look for will be how clever they are being at taking money from spending programmes that voters are not keen on foreign aid and shifting it over to areas which will be popular another thing will be the extent to which they can get infrastructure off the government s books we need that investment but we don t need a higher national debt so someone else should carry the risks the big point here is that the uk has got a populist government so it will try to do things that are popular with ordinary voters rather than the so called liberal elite it will be a big change but we don t know how far it will go the other two concern europe and america the eurozone economy is struggling this is bad news for the uk as europe takes more than 40 per cent of our exports but it is good news for trade negotiations meanwhile the us is close to a deal with china once that is done expect it to challenge europe and it won t just be french wine that is under attack it makes no sense to second guess what donald trump will do but we know what he said in november that europe had terrible trade barriers that were in many ways worse than china if the us cuts up rough the eu may want a friend in britain iran matters it matters because it is itself a large oil producer it matters because more than one third of the world s seaborne oil exports go through the strait of hormuz between iran and oman and it matters because of its ability to disrupt middle east oil production more generally witness its attack on saudi aramco facilities in september the political and military commentators will opine about the geopolitical consequences of aggression of iran and the killing of general soleimani and his colleagues in response to that the financial analysts are already calculating what might happen to the oil price and the dollar and which oil shares benefit most and there are fears of what this might do to the economies of the gulf states particularly if tourists stay away for the rest of us i think we simply need to be aware that serious disruption in the middle east means serious disruption to the world at best this is a drag on the prosperity of all at worst this signals the end of the long expansion that most of the world has experienced since 2010 let s hope it doesn t
economists executives and investors are reading the 2020 tea leaves with heightened scrutiny in an effort to divine what this year holds for the u s economy and for ordinary americans here are the events they say are most likely to impact and potentially reshape our economic trajectory the u s presidential election economists say if the 2020 election leads to a divided government like the current one little will change in a meaningful way for businesses and investors if a single party ends up controlling the white house and both chambers of congress though the economic impact could be greater equity markets have traditionally performed better under democrats than republicans when you average it out on a long term basis which defies what most people believe are facts but financial markets are terrified of the far left wing of the democratic party said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management if elizabeth warren or bernie sanders look like they could be the nominee of the democratic party i think that could have very negative impact on financial markets both of these candidates pledges to rein in big companies and raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy would hit banking finance and tech sectors areas that buoyed indexes in 2019 especially hard you never know what would happen but i don t think that would be a positive outcome for the financial markets said heider if the republicans take back the house and maintain control of the senate and we have a second term for president donald trump i think we get a second round of tax cuts said brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network he argued though that a democratic president and congress wouldn t be as destabilizing as some market observers fear on one hand taxes go up everyone assumes it s going to kill the economy but remember government spending is also going to go up significantly he said net net it s a much better result than people are thinking trade tensions with and beyond china although the president announced on tuesday that he would sign a phase one trade deal between the u s and china at the white house on jan 15 this by no means takes worries about tariffs and supply chain disruptions off the table experts say especially with the u s withdrawing from large multilateral agreements and ceding its position as de facto leader in global trade the real thing that s going to change the world over the next decade is the u s is no longer the mainstay of the global free trading system mcmillan said as we look forward into 2020 i think the trade wars are either resolved or they accelerate we ll have to see how that unfolds heider said although great britain is not a major trading partner of the u s brexit also could be potentially disruptive particularly if the country leaves the european union without a plan in place those are both unknowns he added a number of market observers express doubt that the current truce between the u s and china is more than a pause and suggest that real or threatened tariffs could continue to cast a chill on business investment in 2020 i wouldn t be surprised if those tariffs came back into play said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america if the white house revisits its recently rescinded plan to levy sanctions on nearly all consumer goods coming from china spending and confidence would drop that s where it will hurt the economy north predicted in the past trump has pulled back from nearly complete trade deals over the perception of being unfairly treated and could very well do so again observers note the vast majority of the phase one is really centered on agriculture but the question remains what s the enforceability mechanism here it s really unclear at this point said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel fixed income beijing has pledged to operate more fairly but whether or not that promise is kept remains to be seen piegza said they have time and time again promised to crack down on that with no positive outcomes which could derail the prospect of a more significant deal in the future the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies facebook s introduction of its libra cryptocurrency platform is a shot across the bow to gatekeepers of traditional financial and currency systems that will continue to reverberate said lawrence white an economics professor at new york university s stern school of business we ll only know in the next couple of years if it turns out to be a non event but the facebook libra announcement certainly attracted a great deal of attention he said although lawmakers in the u s have broached regulations for cryptocurrency and switzerland s finance minister recently declared that libra had failed white maintained that cryptocurrencies are going to be a big topic of interest and regulatory scrutiny he pointed out that people who dismissed libra s antecedent as a passing fad were proven wrong you wouldn t have seen the facebook libra announcement had there not been the experience of and attention being paid to bitcoin he said governments are thinking how do we regulate this should we be creating our own digital currencies the existence albeit nascent of hundreds of other would be contenders in the space show that cryptocurrencies are going to grow in both visibility and real financial impact white predicted federal reserve rate setting many economists hold the view that ultra low interest rates have helped propel the bull market into unprecedented territory but that could change in 2020 the biggest risk to me is inflation and that s not a risk most people are looking at the cpi figures are starting to creep up a little more said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy i don t know if the federal reserve will be able to hold off if inflation rises in spite of the president s frequent complaints about his handpicked fed chairman jerome powell goldberg said he expected powell to respond to financial not political signals i think eventually if jerome powell needs to raise rates he will he said this has potentially market shifting implications for highly leveraged companies the corporate debt situation because of where rates are is something we have to be mindful of said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial you have half the bloomberg barclays investment grade index literally a step away from junk because interest rates are so low companies have been able to take on debt loads that would otherwise overwhelm them which could happen if rates rise lynch said this could also create a downward spiral for indebted households piegza said i don t know if we ever got to the point where consumers really cleaned off their household balance sheets enough the way the u s economy has grown out of recession is by the consumer taking on new amounts of debt with corporate appetite for investment at a trough thanks to uncertainty over trade issues consumers are the primary force still keeping the economy in drive right now we re relying on the consumer in terms of discretionary purchases but already we re starting to see some red flags she said this maybe a precarious position ballooning u s debt higher interest rates also have implications for how much the u s treasury in other words taxpayers pays to service the nation s swelling debt load one thing that s remarkably forgotten at the moment is our fiscal situation in terms of deficit and debt nobody wants to talk about that right now north said if you look at the congressional budget projections the debt to gdp ratio keeps creeping up nobody has plans to cut back on the debt for all that money we re borrowing i view it like climate change said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics we know it s a problem if we don t do something about it we don t know precisely when it will be a problem or how it will manifest itself it s a big deal it s just not a big deal today zandi pointed out that the unpredictability of when where and how this will emerge as a headwind is precisely what makes it such an ominous threat at some point down the road it s going to be something that s going to weigh very heavily on the economy it s corrosive it s going to wear down the economy over time
three top federal reserve officials said in separate interviews on jan 3 that they have enough confidence in the strength of the u s economy to favor maintaining the central bank s current freeze on further interest rate cuts cleveland federal reserve bank president loretta mester dallas federal reserve bank president robert kaplan and chicago federal reserve bank president charles evans all said they ve seen no justification to drop the central bank s current on hold policy i m pretty happy with where policy is at the moment and we ll have to wait and see mester said on bloomberg cleveland federal reserve president loretta mester l talks with host maria bartiromo on the fox business network on april 1 2016 in new york rob kim getty images i don t think we should be making any moves at this point on interest rates kaplan said on cnbc when asked by bloomberg whether he thought recently published weak factory data showed the economy is in trouble evans said it doesn t shake my confidence federal reserve chairman jerome powell r tours mhub an innovation center with federal reserve bank of chicago president charles evans on april 6 2018 in chicago illinois scott olson getty images mester and kaplan will be voting members on the rate setting federal open market committee fomc this year while evans was a committee member in 2019 weak factory data the u s manufacturing sector fell into its deepest slump in more than a decade in december showing weak factory output orders and employment the institute for supply management ism said its index of national factory activity fell to 47 2 last month from 48 1 in november it was the lowest reading since june 2009 and coupled with readings for both new orders and factory employment at multi year lows thwarted expectations for a leveling off in the pace of decline in a sector buffeted by trade tensions a reading below 50 indicates the sector is in contraction and december s reading marked the fifth straight month below that benchmark level the manufacturing sector had been under pressure for much of the second half of 2019 as tit for tat tariffs by the united states and china slowed the flow of goods between the world s two largest economies and contributed to a cooling in the pace of global economic growth last month the two sides announced they had reached agreement on a phase one trade deal and president donald trump last week said the accord would be signed jan 15 in washington and talks to cement a wider phase two deal would begin shortly global trade remains the most significant cross industry issue but there are signs that several industry sectors will improve as a result of the phase one trade agreement timothy fiore chairman of ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in a statement while ism s overall measure of activity in december was the lowest in more than a decade fiore said on balance the contraction remains relatively shallow it s not super low he said on a conference call we re still in that range of slight contraction to slight expansion typically the index would have to drop below 43 to signal the risk of a wider economic recession weakness in the manufacturing sector was one of the concerns that spurred the u s federal reserve to cut interest rates three times last year although the central bank appears to be done with lowering borrowing costs for now with officials like federal reserve chairman jerome powell satisfied that the economy is in a good place worry about low inflation but no drive to cut rates on jan 3 the fed released the minutes of its december interest rate setting meeting showing that fomc members are concerned about low inflation but confident enough in the u s economy to hold rates steady going forward at a december meeting of the fed s policymaking body officials voted to keep their benchmark interest rate in a range between 1 5 percent and 1 75 percent at three earlier meetings committee members slashed the target federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point each time the minutes and insight into how central bank officials are weighing policy moves in support of higher or lower interest rates pdf show committee members highlighting risks to the economic outlook from global economic softness and below target inflation in the united states global developments related to both persistent uncertainty regarding international trade and weakness in economic growth abroad continued to pose some risks to the outlook and inflation pressures remained muted the committee stated remarks in the document echo those of powell who warned reporters that inflation running too cool for too long could sap sentiment and nudge the economy into a downturn while low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer term inflation expectations drift down pulling actual inflation even lower powell said after december s fomc pdf he complained that inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective federal reserve chairman jerome powell testifies during a house financial services committee hearing on capitol hill on july 10 2019 zach gibson getty images over the 12 months through october a measure of core inflation which doesn t include food and energy prices due to their volatility was 1 6 percent in the united states still the fomc saw enough signs of economic strength to hold the benchmark rate steady the minutes show that members expected sustained economic expansion a resilient labor market and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent goal as likely outcomes real gdp in the united states rose 2 1 percent in the third quarter of 2019 according to the bureau of economic analysis the committee said it would continue to monitor the economic outlook including labor market conditions inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments powell signaled the fed s readiness for decisive steps in case of future softening we re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal he insisted the fed and mortgage rates the fed has a dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment which it aims to achieve through three tools of monetary policy open market operations the discount rate and reserve requirements using the three tools the fed influences the federal funds rate which is the interest rate at which banks and other depository institutions lend balances they keep at the fed to other banks and institutions overnight changes in the federal funds rate trigger a chain of events that affect other short term interest rates foreign exchange rates long term interest rates the amount of money and credit and ultimately a range of economic variables including employment output and prices of goods and services the fed explains it s a misconception that the fed sets or directly affects mortgage rates the federal funds rate has only an indirect impact on the cost of home loans which is moderated by markets a comparison of a decade of federal funds rates u s 10 year treasury maturity rates and mortgage rates shows a high correlation between the latter two in contrast the fed driven interest rate curve has a markedly different shape mortgage rates drop

global economy faces debt death warnings unheeded the guardian the warning signs are clear debt is rising on every continent and especially in the business sector which has spent the past decade ramping up its borrowing to previously unheard of levels in october last year the imf said that almost 40 percent of the corporate debt in eight leading countries the us china japan germany britain france italy and spain would become so expensive during a recession that it would be impossible to service in other words tens of thousands of businesses employing millions of people would have gambled with high levels of borrowing and lost making themselves insolvent worse the imf said the risks were elevated in eight out of 10 countries that boasted systemically important financial sectors adding that this situation was a repeat of the years running up to the previous financial crisis last month the world bank joined in it said that emerging market and developing economies emdes had pushed their borrowing to a record us 55 trillion in 2018 emerging economies unlike the richer nations already mentioned the 100 emdes across africa asia and south america covered by the report were affected by rising private sector debt coupled with higher government borrowing this extra state borrowing is not only larger it has also changed in character first it has gone from being largely directed to investment spending to more recently being used simply to cope with the costs of healthcare education and welfare second it is being more commonly borrowed from international investors hungry to lend developing countries cash at relatively speaking sky high rates of interest there is little evidence that anyone is paying any attention to the dire misgivings expressed by either organization this year the us s p 500 resumed its long term 100 year upward trend following a near 200 percent increase since 2010 likewise the german dax has soared over the past 10 years from 5 500 to more than 13 000 while the paris cac 40 has almost doubled to 6 000 british situation britain s main market in shares has struggled to make any headway over the past three years while brexit uncertainty dominated yet the ftse 100 shows a gain from less than 4 000 in 2009 to 7 600 today some analysts have argued that the imf and world bank are over cooking their analysis after missing the last financial crash seeing danger around every corner others dismiss them as archaic remnants of the post world war ii consensus that fail to understand how the global economy has entered a new phase one that keeps stock markets humming along and bad recessions at bay without higher interest rates everyone can keep merrily borrowing in the short term at least the optimists could be right fed effect that is largely down to the actions of the us federal reserve which was on course to repeat the mistake of 2005 2007 when it matched rising debt levels especially in sub prime mortgage loans with rising interest rates triggering the kind of financial crash that the imf and world bank now fear is around the corner this time the fed retreated after pushing base rates to almost 2 5 percent still well short of the pre crash normality of 4 to 5 percent but higher than almost everywhere else after three rate cuts last year the us economy starts this year with the base rate back to between 1 5 percent and 1 75 percent without higher interest rates everyone can keep merrily borrowing when for most businesses borrowing rates remain below their potential income growth rate even when that is lackluster there is not the usual imperative to boost growth through investment to afford higher debt repayments skewed view however this is a back to front way of discussing the issue most of the problems afflicting the global economy relate to a lack of demand for goods and services at least on average compared with the years prior to the 2008 crash much of the weak demand relates to aging populations which in the main focus more on storing up savings for retirement than on spending they are also in the habit of voting for governments that promise to keep taxes low and property prices high allowing them to accumulate even more wealth through pensions and private investments governments treat companies like cash machines demanding a higher dividend every six months much of the borrowing by companies has been to pay these dividends not to invest baby boomers will pretty much all have retired by the end of this new decade so most will have stopped investing and just be withdrawing funds it is this turn of the wheel of fortune that will wreck the global economy if the accumulation of debt has not got there first

personality and careless work habits as well as his cavalier treatment of employees at the white house and in key institutions such as congress the judiciary and the media he has set records for ousting senior government officials usually because of their inability to work with him or support his policies he makes decisions in a scattershot and superficial fashion without consulting bodies such as the national security council and the intelligence agencies he often uses twitter to convey messages including on sensitive foreign and defense issues in an unprecedented form of online diplomacy he greatly exaggerates his own achievements and frequently raises the concept of fake news he has brutally attacked the media calling them enemies of the people trump benefits from a solid conservative constituency amounting to 40 of the voting public which includes conservative whites factory workers uneducated voters evangelical christians and residents of rural areas during his tenure he has made great efforts to implement his campaign promises and preserve this base of support the democrats claim trump is tarnishing the institution of the presidency and has committed violations of the law grave enough to warrant impeachment in all of american history there have been only two impeachment proceedings for a serving president both failed because conviction requires a two thirds majority in the senate a majority the democrats do not have it is not clear whether the impeachment process will hurt or help trump s chances to win a second term the 2020 elections will determine to what extent trumpism is a passing phenomenon or a deeper trend in american society the election results will be even more consequential if either or both of the democratic presidential and vp candidates is a figure who like senator elizabeth warren represents the more radical wing of the democratic party deep polarization the democratic party has been moving left since this century began the trend was reinforced with the election of barack obama and the passing of the affordable care act which was unprecedented in american history conservative republicans saw the act as a first step toward turning the us into a socialist country and made a great effort to thwart it another more populist reaction was the formation of the tea party movement which took the republicans further to the right in the democratic primaries for the 2016 presidential elections elderly socialist bernie sanders significantly weakened the status of establishment candidate hillary clinton and was able to draw considerable numbers of young people into his camp in the 2018 congressional elections four young radical democratic women won seats in the house of representatives two muslims ilhan omar of somali background and rashida tlaib of palestinian background alexandria ocasio cortez of hispanic origin and an african american ayanna pressley they forged a kind of coalition of minorities the squad which is challenging the party s moderate leadership in an effort to push it more to the left two of the democrats three leading contenders for the 2020 presidential nomination bernie sanders and elizabeth warren belong to the radical wing these developments testify to a movement by the democratic party toward the far left a shift that has not at this stage won the sympathy of the general public this leftward shift by the democrats has contributed to a rightward drift among republicans the american system of government is built on checks and balances moderation and compromise between parties and authorities over the past decade these features have largely disappeared and a profound polarization acrimony and hatred have emerged in american society the likes of which have not been seen since the vietnam war or even according to some the civil war the 2020 presidential and congressional elections will indicate whether this polarization will continue and perhaps intensify in the coming decade or whether leaders will be elected who will put a halt to it and restore balance to the political system as of this writing it appears the elections will deepen the rifts in american society and this process will continue into the coming decade demographics demographic changes in the us will gain steam over the next decade whites will lose a considerable proportion of their share of the population while minorities particularly hispanics americans whose origins are in the latin american countries will increase their share ethnic groups in the american population groups 2010 2020 estimate 2050 estimate whites 65 2 62 47 hispanics 16 3 18 29 african americans 12 6 13 14 asians 4 8 6 9 sources us census bureau pew research center un department of economic and social affairs the percentages of whites in american society will decline consistently at mid century they will still be the largest demographic group but they will lose the decisive majority they have known since the founding of the us constituting only about 47 the hispanic demographic is growing the fastest and by 2050 will not be far from doubling its current strength to about 29 of us society the share of asians will also grow considerably to reach about 9 in some states such as california the most populous in the country with about 40 million residents whites are already a minority they represent 38 of california s population hispanics also amount to 38 there while asians constitute 15 and african americans 6 in the coming decade these demographic changes will have far reaching consequences in all areas of politics society and the economy by building coalitions minority groups could assume control of american politics on both the national and state level minority groups have traditionally supported the democratic party which has been attentive to their needs that however is one of the reasons for trump s victory in the 2016 presidential election he represents a white america that is struggling to maintain its status in american society trump has worked hard to stop illegal immigration primarily from latin america and has accused the democrats of opposing any limits on immigration and of impeding construction of the wall along the us mexican border because they want to bolster their political base through immigration economy and finance trump is a businessman and for him a thriving economy is perhaps more important than any other issue he has put great effort into revamping american industry which lost numerous factories to countries where manpower is cheap he has waged fights to modify trade agreements with countries he believes have caused harm to the american economy including china the american economy is the largest in the world although the population accounts for only 5 of the global population it produces 20 of the world s revenues in recent years all indexes have pointed to a strong economy gnp growth stands at 2 unemployment is at its lowest in 50 years 3 5 interest and inflation rates are low and the capital markets have set new records at the same time the national debt reached 20 trillion for the first time in history and the trade war with china triggered wide fluctuations particularly in the capital markets the forecast for the coming years is not as good results for the last quarter of the decade show a slowing of growth and a decline in the main indexes trump will however try hard to sustain the thriving economy in the election year as it is a serving president s strongest card that is the main reason why he is easing off on the trade war with china and holding talks to reach agreements that will benefit both sides in the year following the elections a slowdown is nevertheless anticipated with output growing at less than 2 if trump wins he is likely to continue current policy if the democrats win they will probably try to make substantial changes in the budget including a tax increase and large allocations for welfare the environment education and health because it is congress that approves budgets the administration s ability to conduct an economic policy will depend in part on who gains control of the two houses foreign relations the twentieth century is known as the american century because it turned the us into the largest most important and most influential superpower in the world the us led the way to decisive victories in three wars world wars i and ii and the cold war which lasted for almost the entire second half of the century the american withdrawal from international affairs between the two world wars contributed to the outbreak of wwii and proved how essential the us is to maintaining peace and security in the world it became the world s policeman a role it took upon itself in that regard obama and trump hold the same view that that global role should come to an end obama began a process of disengagement preferring collaboration with international organizations such as the un other powers such as germany britain and france and multilateral diplomacy such as the process that produced the nuclear agreement with iran trump has continued this trend but without turning to international organizations which he has accused of corruption inefficiency and opposition to american values trump s 2016 campaign slogan america first signaled a desire to focus on domestic issues it is still too early to say whether the international system will shift to a multi power framework that will include the us china russia and the eu but the trend in the us of partial isolationism appears to be entrenched it stems primarily from the us s protracted failed wars in afghanistan and iraq and from the economic burden of acting as the world s policeman the us has always opposed nuclear proliferation particularly when it would enable dictatorships to obtain nuclear weapons and means of delivery such as intercontinental missiles yet neither obama nor his predecessors succeeded in halting the construction of north korea s nuclear infrastructure obama thought he could stop iran s race to the bomb with an international agreement trump has met with north korean ruler kim jong un three times and promised him sizable economic assistance in return for dismantling his nuclear arsenal kim has indeed put a halt to experiments with intercontinental missiles but despite optimistic declarations is not prepared for disarmament trump labeled the nuclear deal with iran the worst in american history withdrew the us from it and imposed heavy sanctions on iran iran in turn renewed its nuclear activity the outcome of which can only be nuclear bombs with both obama and trump having declared that they will not allow iran to go nuclear this issue will occupy the us in the coming decade relations with israel benjamin netanyahu has called trump the best friend israel ever had in the white house the president has indeed made historic decisions on issues important to israel such as transferring the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem recognizing israeli sovereignty on the golan heights affirming that the settlements do not necessarily violate international law withdrawing from the nuclear agreement with iran and levying harsh sanctions on iran trump has also fought hard at the un against one sided anti israeli resolutions accused the palestinians of failing to show up for peace negotiations suspended funding of the palestinian authority and unrwa and closed the plo office in washington he formulated an israeli palestinian peace settlement he calls the deal of the century though he has only revealed its economic part so far on the other hand the pulling of us forces out of northern syria and abandonment of the kurdish fighters the lack of any response to the downing of an american drone by iran or to the attack on the saudi oil facilities and the effort to meet with president rouhani at almost any price have prompted concern about the stability of trump s middle east policy the democrats leftward drift alongside netanyahu s ever closer relations with trump and the republicans have fostered alienation between israel and the democrats and between israel and american jewry most of whom support the democrats presidential candidates of the radical wing have announced that they may use aid to israel to pressure jerusalem to change its policy in the territories and toward the palestinians if the democratic candidate is elected president and the democrats take control of congress while the government in israel does not change the new us administration is likely to get tough toward israel and revert to patterns that prevailed in the obama period because demographic changes are likely to work in the democrats favor any new government in israel will have to rehabilitate relations with them and with american jewry as well prof eytan gilboa is senior fellow at the usc center on public diplomacy in los angeles and a senior research associate at the besa center for strategic studies

ricardo hausmann a former minister of planning of venezuela and former chief economist at the inter american development bank is a professor at the harvard kennedy school and director of the harvard growth lab the scenario is all too familiar a reformist government wants to boost economic growth and employment by implementing market friendly reforms designed to make the country more attractive to often foreign investors policymakers understand that these investors possess the technological prowess organisational capability and market reach that the country desperately needs committees are created to improve the country s performance in the world bank s doing business index the world economic forum s global competitiveness report or other beauty contests promoted by a sprawling array of international rankings the reformist government overcomes gruelling fights with legislators and civil society who accuse it of putting investors interests ahead of those of its own people but with perseverance it successfully adopts reforms that improve the country s rankings and gets glowing coverage in the international press the learned world s impression of the country and even that of money managers changes significantly for the better then the government waits for foreign investment to arrive and waits and as in samuel beckett s famous play the anticipated inflows like godot never show up this problem stems in part from assuming that what needs fixing is captured in international rankings too often it is not worldwide there is zero correlation between improvements in the doing business and competitiveness indexes and growth or investment performance often the focus of such rankings is on reducing red tape which assumes that investors stay away because of some sin of commission which if stopped would release the floodgates but the world is more complicated than that most people who could potentially do well by investing in your country know a lot about their but probably know very little about your country particularly the things about your country that matter for their business including the ones you just reformed more important their business usually depends on things you should be doing but aren t your sins of omission for example manufacturing requires industrial zones with power water security logistics and access to a labour force that can get to the worksite fresh produce requires cold chain logistics certifications a green lane at customs and government negotiated phytosanitary permits eliminating burdensome regulations and cumbersome controls is far easier than establishing these systems given your limited resources you cannot do it all which means you are doomed to choose the areas where you will devote special attention to create the required ecosystem moreover you need to be deeply knowledgeable about these areas you need to understand what potential activities require and what about your country makes them more or less likely to succeed but assuming you do this for some chosen area how do you avoid waiting for godot once again especially after all that costly effort and will you ever recoup those costs to avoid this predicament governments need organisational capabilities that go beyond adam smith s maxim that they must do no more than ensure peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice they need to do at least three additional things first the government needs to engage with existing economic activities to identify what it can do to improve their productivity whether by changing rules infrastructure or other publicly provided goods and services these engagements need to be narrowly focused typically along value chains to enable the identification of sufficiently detailed problems for this reason economy ministries must organise quite a few of them as with the deliberation councils that started over a century ago in japan and have been emulated elsewhere there are more than 200 such councils in japan including for sumo wrestling second the government should mobilise society and domestic and foreign firms to explore the adjacent possible activities that do not exist but for which the requisite ecosystem is almost in place this requires people in and out of government to imagine what is not yet there figure out what is needed to establish it and determine whether it would be both feasible and valuable to society this exploratory process is both costly and risky although recent advances such as the atlas of economic complexity make it less of a crapshoot by revealing relevant information for assessing the feasibility and the attractiveness of potential new industries to implement these strategies governments need to reform their current investment bureaus which often do little more than authorise or handhold investors instead these entities should help promote the government s diversification strategy by identifying foreign firms that are in a desired industry but not yet in the country articulate the business case for investment and lead the negotiations third and most controversially governments often need a corporation to facilitate investment in new strategic areas and manage the activities generated by previous strategic investments these corporations may be set up as holding companies for already existing state owned enterprises that currently report to their respective line ministries the ministries should focus on their regulatory functions leaving the holding company to provide close financial and operational oversight and exercise shareholder rights on behalf of society the holding company can also be capitalised with assets that the government already owns these corporations should use part of their proceeds for pre investment activities in new potential areas and use their knowledge of the country to create joint ventures with firms that have knowledge of targeted industries in fact by being an equity partner the corporation can capture the upside of government efforts to fix the ecosystem the corporation should also explore opportunities for divestment of existing holdings in order to free up capital needed to advance the economic diversification strategy conventional wisdom discourages governments from creating such corporations on the grounds that the risks of poor governance and bad performance are too large a more useful approach would be to develop the tools and mechanisms to ensure good and improving governance published audited financial statements high technical capacity facilitated by salaries and career paths that are competitive with the private sector powerful advisory boards with foreign participation and partnerships with institutions such as the international finance corporation the world bank s private sector lending arm could create the right environment for excellence once governments have taken these steps they may no longer have to wait for godot they may simply go fetch him bm copyright project syndicate 2019

the perspective atlanta georgia january 6 2020 usaid director sara walter the united states agency for international development has awarded a 16m contract to nathan a private international economic and analytics consulting firm to help liberia fight corruption mr jeffrey singer senior vice president of nathan as per nathan website stated that nathan is excited that usaid selected its team to help liberia increase domestic revenue enhance tax administration and reduce inefficiency preceding nathan usaid has been operating in liberia for a long time it was established by us former president john f kennedy of the united states to help reduce conflict support stable and strengthen democratic societies etc in developing countries in explaining its mission on its website usaid states that it has strategized an activity called revenue generation for governance and growth rg3 specifically for liberia rg3 according to its website is designed to build the capacity of the ministry of finance development and planning mfdp and liberia revenue authority lra continuing usaid states that rg3 supports mfdp to develop the capacity to formulate revenue policies and supports lra to become effective and efficient in domestic revenue mobilization well if usaid is advising both mfdp and lra how come the two institutions are giving separate and conflicting information on revenue collection commissioner of lra continues to report that lra is outperforming revenue projections but the minister of mfdp is insisting that there is no revenue for the government to pay salaries liberia s domestic revenue is low not of the lack of policy and or the lack of competent staff but because of administrative decisions in awarding fraudulent concessionary agreements did usaid play a role when former president ellen johnson sirleaf awarded 66 fraudulent concessionary agreements to private capitalists which is reducing revenue collection the moore stephens llp the largest uk accountancy which has now merged into bdo as of 2 4 2019 reported in 2014 that liberia signed 66 fraudulent concessionary agreements further what was the role of usaid when former president sirleaf and governors of the central bank decided and used central bank s depositors money to finance excessive salaries this administrative decision has indebted liberia to the central bank in the amount of 260m in 2016 according to the international monetary fund on june 19 2019 report did usaid fail in its mission therefore it has hired nathan to help liberia let us review a few of the services nathan website offers 1 macroeconomic analyze and forecasting 2 economic policy formulation and reform 3 monetary and capital markets 4 domestic revenue mobilization 5 tax policy and 6 tax administration strengthening from the summaries of the functions of these foreign consultants can either of these consultants fix liberia s economic problems which are primarily rooted in official corruptions 1 was it possible for either of these foreign consultants to have prevented president george weah from using government money to accumulate real estate a loss of government revenue since becoming president in 2018 mr weah has built over 49 buildings 2 was it not the decision of former president ellen johnson sirleaf that had encouraged ebola workers to abandon accountability and transparency which resulted in the loss of excess ebola money the international monetary fund reported that liberia s international partners have withdrawn money from liberia s net international reserves because liberia did not account for excess ebola money 3 was it the lack of policies and or incompetent personnel that allowed mr robert sirleaf former president sirleaf s son not to account for the us 10m a social responsibility fund given to liberia by an oil company chevron no rather it was former president sirleaf who authorized government bureaucrats to forget about auditing the disbursement of the us 10m 4 was it the lack of competent personnel and or lack of policy that prevented officials from infusing the l 16b into liberia currency circulation well everyone knows now that the l 16b was not infused into the commercial banking system because the government has admitted that it has no new banknotes predictably the l 16b new banknotes are at private homes because former president sirleaf and president george weah dictated the transfer of l 16b to private homes or did nothing to infuse the l 16b into liberia currency circulation another foreign consultant kroll hired to investigate and examine the l 16b saga i guess was aware that the l 16b was missing but was encouraged to go along with the government s version that small amount of money was missing but the government should focus on correcting accounting irregularities and personnel negligence assumingly had it not followed the government line kroll would have been compelled to follow the international standards on auditing isa 500 which requires an external auditor to obtain reliable evidence from third parties in this case the nine commercial banks of liberia responding to letters from kroll each of the nine commercial banks would have been required to report the values of new banknotes each received and infused into liberia currency circulation and the values of old banknotes each returned to the central bank this approach would have revealed that no new banknotes were infused into liberia currency circulation which would have confirmed the allegation that officials siphoned the l 16b of course the government was not ready to give the hard truth to the population hence our international partners stakeholders and kroll went along if i may ask can any hired liberian employee or foreign consultant reject president george weah s request to get money for any reasons for reference i recommend a review of the story of president ronald reagan s attempt to assist former president samuel k doe regime with tax policy revenue collection and disbursement in the 1990s and liberia governance economic management assistance program accomplishment if any
bogotá in the 1980s latin america endured a debt crisis so severe that the entire decade was lost to poor economic performance since then other economies most notably japan have endured their own lost decades but today it is again latin america that is facing difficulties in fact it has already lost five years latin america has suffered through a half decade of anemic growth for the second time since the 1980s and its lowest performing quinquennium since world war ii in the region s previous lost half decade after the 1997 east asian crisis annual gdp growth averaged 1 2 per cent in 1980 1985 the worst five years of the debt crisis average growth amounted to 0 7 per cent over the last five years it reached a mere 0 4 per cent this is partly the result of an unfavourable global environment reflected in latin america s deteriorating terms of trade since 2014 the virtual stagnation of international trade overall and two years of renewed financial turbulence in emerging economies but other developing regions have faced the same external headwinds and every one of them has outperformed latin america not only in the last five years but since 1990 a period during which annual gdp growth in the region averaged just 2 7 per cent clearly long term domestic and regional factors are also contributing to latin america s underperformance they have economic origins but also reflect political crises and complex political transitions in several countries nowhere are these political challenges more apparent than in venezuela which despite having the world s largest proven oil reserves is in economic free fall since 2014 venezuela s gdp has contracted by more than 60 per cent one of the sharpest economic contractions in history for a country not at war recent international sanctions have exacerbated venezuela s economic travails but the problems began long ago and have been fuelled by the sharp political polarisation and catastrophic economic policies of president nicolás maduro the late hugo chávez s handpicked successor excluding venezuela latin america s average gdp growth rises but only to 1 per cent per year still worse than the region s last lost half decade this partly reflects the fact that the region s largest economy brazil experienced its deepest recession since wwii in 2015 2016 and has been recovering very slowly in mexico latin america s second largest economy president andrés manuel lópez obrador widely known as amlo pledged upon taking office in december 2018 to achieve 4 per cent annual gdp growth instead the economy has stagnated and even slipped into recession in the first half of 2019 concerns about amlo s economic management have contributed to this outcome elsewhere argentina has struggled with domestic macroeconomic imbalances in addition to global financial turbulence and more recently concerns about the return of a peronist government political turmoil in ecuador and more recently in bolivia and chile has also undermined economic performance but latin america s economic problems began long before the current wave of economic and political instability latin america achieved faster growth a 5 5 per cent average annual rate in the 30 years that preceded the lost decade of the 1980s when state led industrialisation was the order of the day than in the 30 years that followed it the economic orthodoxy that took hold three decades ago derided the state led approach and urged latin american countries to undertake market reforms that so far have failed to fulfill their promise on the contrary countries dismantling of their industrial policies together with the repercussions of the debt crisis the dutch disease effects of the commodity price super cycle after 2003 and rising competition from china led to premature de industrialisation specifically manufacturing s share of gdp has been declining fairly consistently since the 1980s to the point that current levels are similar to those in the 1950s while a shift away from manufacturing is a natural upshot of economic development it began in latin america at much lower income levels than in the developed countries making it far more difficult for the region to escape the middle income trap though chinese demand for latin american commodity exports has boomed over the last decade it remains insufficient to offset manufacturing losses undermining latin america s prospects further are its low levels of investment in research and development about 0 7 per cent of gdp on average that is about one third of what china 2 1 per cent and the oecd countries 2 6 per cent spend in latin america only brazil invests more than 1 per cent of gdp in r d during the 4th industrial revolution no economy can compete let alone rise from middle to high income status without a strong capacity for innovation latin america s lost half decade has had severe social consequences from 2002 to 2014 poverty declined rapidly in the region and inequality which had risen during the 1980s and 1990s was on a downward trend since then progress on inequality has stalled income distribution has remained relatively constant since 2010 2011 and poverty has increased as latin america enters the 2020s it must take steps to ensure that the next five years are not lost yes the international context will make a difference but the region s governments have it within their power to improve economic performance significantly they can foster reindustrialisation including by pursuing greater regional economic integration thereby supporting intra regional trade in manufactured goods and invest in science and technology together with active social policies such growth enhancing measures can enable latin america to regain its economic footing and lay the foundations for a better future for its people josé antonio ocampo is a board member of banco de la república colombia s central bank a professor at columbia university and chair of the un s committee for development policy he was minister of finance of colombia and united nations under secretary general for economic and social affairs he is the author of resetting

by sam pizzigati where in the developed world do rich people pay the least in taxes to americans these days this question would seem to have an obvious answer the most rich people friendly nation at tax time simply must be the united states a land where the mega rich pay taxes at lower rates than their secretaries and a white house hopeful with a quarter billion dollar fortune pays only 13 9 percent of his annual take home in federal income tax but that obvious answer would be wrong the rich people friendliest developed nation in the world just happens to be new zealand so show the latest data from the oecd the industrial world s official economic research agency and so says rob salmond a new zealand born political scientist now at the university of michigan we charge less tax than any comparable country on high incomes dividends and capital gains notes salmond the tax laws that new zealand has locked in place over the last quarter century almost read like a tax reform wish list on steroids from mitt romney and his rivals for the gop presidential nomination abolish taxes on the estates rich people leave behind at death as former governor romney and all his rivals propose the tax law in new zealand exempts all huge private fortunes from any death taxes drop the tax rate on capital gains below the current 15 percent as rick santorum advises or simply eliminate taxes altogether as newt gingrich advocates on asset trade profits new zealand has no tax levy on capital gains income tax no dollar of ordinary income at more than 35 percent the rate the bush tax cuts fixed in the u s tax code back in 2001 all the gop presidential candidates are vowing they ll extend that 35 percent bush era rate in new zealand no dollar of millionaire income faces a tax rate higher than 33 percent don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free cutting taxes on america s most wealthy our gop presidential candidates all claim would bring the united states a broad new prosperity from sea to shining sea new zealand s recent tax history offers a real life test of that claim new zealand s 33 percent top tax rate has been on the books for most of the years since the mid 1980s as have the rest of new zealand s exceedingly rich people friendly tax policies so how are all these policies working out not particularly well rich people friendly tax policies in new zealand have helped turn a society that worked and worked admirably for average new zealanders into an economic deadend for all but the high income set this bleak transformation hit the headlines last week and dramatically so over six straight days new zealand s largest circulation daily newspaper showcased just how unequal new zealand has become and just how brutally that inequality has impacted daily life in auckland the nation s largest metro area the onset of auckland s inequality the new zealand herald series details has been incredibly sudden and swift auckland has changed from an equal city to an unequal one in less than a generation notes herald reporter simon collins indeed back in 1986 auckland ranked as one of the most equal cities in the world over half the metro area s census tracts 52 percent had median incomes within 10 percent of the regional median by the 2006 census this bunching around the middle had largely evaporated only 26 percent of auckland census tracts now have incomes that fall within 10 percent of the region s median the number of auckland tracts with medians more than 30 percent above the metro median has more than tripled what changes has this immense income shift brought some changes have become exceptionally visible auckland s super rich says the herald have built sprawling homes on a scale the city had never dreamed of in the 1980s other visible changes have come at the bottom food charities largely unheard of in 1986 have become a necessary fact of everyday auckland life even for families who are not considered poor the herald observes parents are having to do without to make sure their children are fed and clothed in 1986 new zealand s top 1 percent households were grabbing 5 percent of the nation s income that share has since doubled new zealand s top 1 percenters today do to be sure get a smaller share of national income than top 1 percenters in the united states but new zealand s inequality may be if anything more striking since new zealand before the current inequality surge began had been a more equal place in fact the new zealand that entered the 1980s rated as something of a global middle class haven full of policies that helped poorer people gain middle class status those policies have largely gone by the boards as income and power have concentrated at new zealand s economic summit one example between 1946 and 1985 new zealand s family benefit funneled a weekly allowance to the family of every new zealand child young parents could cash in this benefit for a first home downpayment lawmakers abolished the overall universal family benefit in 1991 the next year lawmakers turned around and gave affluent households a huge new tax break the ability to deduct off their regular income any losses they suffer when rents from the properties they own don t equal their mortgage payments on those properties this new tax subsidy gave the affluent a huge incentive to go out and borrow to buy up homes for renting out if their rental income topped the mortgage outlay due they made money if the rents didn t cover the mortgage they had a tax break either way they won and they won even more when they sold their rental properties and didn t face any capital gains tax on the profits the resulting real estate speculating left much of auckland s housing unaffordable for working families and forced widespread housing overcrowding the overcrowding in turn has exploded hospital admittances for infectious diseases the new zealand herald notes as extended families unable to afford rising auckland house prices and rents double up in houses and garages don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free new zealand is suffering educationally as well the latest education data indicate that no developed country s schools now do a worse job than new zealand at helping students overcome the disadvantages of being born into poor families the reason auckland schools are struggling to serve a vastly expanded poverty population last winter one local principal told the new zealand herald many students came to school in thin shirts and shorts without shoes or sweaters the purchases that hard pressed new zealand families can afford meanwhile come encumbered with a heavy sales tax burden in the developed world as a whole sales taxes cover 59 percent of potential consumer purchases in new zealand sales tax impacts 98 percent of what consumers purchase what can new zealand do to regain a more equitable quality of life one unusual suggestion came last month in an essay contest sponsored by civic action group in the community of whangarei local resident trisha fisk won a 1 000 prize for an essay that proposed a maximum wage society has developed a system where a minimum wage has been legislated for fisk wrote now why can t our system also legislate for a maximum wage does the multi million dollar ceo really earn his keep so many many times more than the worker who actually produces the goods fisk asks would he be worth bobsy die if the individuals at the bottom of the feed chain didn t do their job bobsy die that slang might not be familiar to

november i think we are going to be absolutely looking at how we can bring people together start with a clean slate and good conversations about what we invest in said house speaker sara gideon d freeport any new spending or taxation would likely come in the form of a supplemental budget bill that would have to be offered first by democratic gov janet mills mills like gideon said state government accomplished a lot in 2019 under democratic leadership but there was still much work to be done this coming session i look forward to working with the legislature to continue to tackle health insurance issues to support quality early and adult education to strengthen our economy and expand our workforce and to protect maine people from the impacts of climate change mills said in a written statement by tackling these issues maine can and will continue to make progress for its people and future generations advertisement republican leaders said they would brace against unnecessary spending or adding levels of unsustainable debt instead focusing on key issues such as figuring out sustainable ways to pay for state road and bridge repairs without regularly borrowing money to do that work we are not going to borrow our way into a good economy senate minority leader dana dow r waldoboro said he said republicans would do their best to hold the line on taxes and want to focus on sustainable infrastructure improvements and workforce development but do it in a way that doesn t pinch the state s many small businesses house republicans want to make it clear that maine s most pressing needs should come first house minority leader kathleen dillingham r oxford said in a prepared statement forecasted monies should fund needs not wants they should help people that are struggling with real life needs right now maine s most pressing needs include our roads nursing homes direct care workers and people with disabilities on waitlists house republican members of the appropriations and financial affairs committee warned that 76 million of the budget surplus in the revenue forecast are one time monies which may not be available on an ongoing basis like dow they also said they want to focus on funding highway construction and repair without borrowing for it and without raising additional taxes lamenting the state s current 8 billion two year budget which is 11 percent higher than the state s previous budget we then borrowed 105 million for transportation said rep amy arata r new gloucester we need to set priorities any additional spending of existing tax revenues should go toward true priorities that should have been included in the 8 billion budget advertisement bonding bills the budget writing appropriations and financial affairs committee has january public hearings already scheduled on a half dozen borrowing or bonding packages worth at least 200 million among the bills are measures that would earmark 65 million for research and development for biomedical and biotechnology work focused on helping families dealing with aging dementia and alzheimer s disease 20 million for local food processing facilities 50 million for expanding commercial fishing and aquaculture infrastructure and 50 million to help research labs expand and add new equipment and facilities all of the proposals also require matching funds from other public or private sector sources and if passed by the legislature would go to statewide referendum for voter approval health care prescription drugs democrats have vowed to continue their efforts to reduce health care costs while expanding access advertisement bills to be considered include proposals to set up a new state run health insurance exchange program expand dental care for children on medicaid and curb the price of prescription drugs other bills look to help small businesses provide health insurance to their employees or provide incentives to those that do senate president troy jackson d allagash said a bill meant to provide health insurance consumers with a state run health insurance consumer protection advocacy office was also a top priority information is power jackson said and anyone that feels like they can pull the wool over your eyes by just spouting off a bunch of stuff these individual people who have no idea these insurance people just tell them no you know deny deny deny and they can get nine out of 10 people to go away jackson said maine health care consumers need an advocate in their corner when they are going up against the corporate health insurance industry the bills seek to expand on the accomplishments of 2019 when the legislature and mills moved forward with funding for a voter approved expansion of the state s medicaid program mainecare under the federal affordable care act that expansion which was expected to add about 80 000 to the state s health care benefits program for low income mainers so far has only seen about 40 000 new enrollments but the number is expected to continue to grow advertisement criminal justice and corrections a broad range of criminal justice and correctional issues will also be a top focus of the legislature the appropriations and financial affairs committee will hear wednesday from department of corrections commissioner randall liberty who will brief the panel on department related issues including the status of the downeast correctional facility youth recidivism rates and mental health treatment for incarcerated youth the criminal justice and public safety committee has hearings planned in the weeks ahead on numerous bills these include revisiting state funding of county jails and an ongoing shortage of forensic bed space for those charged with or convicted of crimes who have mental health and substance use disorders or who have been deemed incompetent to stand trial by a court lawmakers are considering a range of policy shifts to reduce the cost of housing prisoners including reducing or eliminating bail requirements for lower risk nonviolent defendants and improving programs that help those leaving jail or prison reintegrate into society with housing job training and health care programs the state s system for providing lawyers to those who are charged with crimes but are unable to afford an attorney the commission on indigent legal services is also expected to face additional scrutiny in 2020 in the wake of a report from the nonpartisan sixth amendment center which found the state s system the only one of its kind in the u s may be falling short in providing adequate legal services to those accused of crimes here advertisement the report also drew into question how private attorneys who are certified to defend indigent clients are paid by the state and highlighted a lack of oversight in billing and payment practices by the state and the attorneys in december the legislature s watchdog government oversight committee ordered its investigative arm the office of program evaluation and government accountability to launch an investigation into the recently reformed commission education bills lawmakers will also consider a series of education bills including measures that create incentives for school districts to buy all electric buses and establish rules limiting how schools can discipline young children another bill in the hopper would permit retired police officers to be hired as school resource officers other bills will continue a focus on higher education student debt one measure offered by senate majority leader nate libby d lewiston would create a student debt forgiveness program for first responders home health care providers and public school teachers in an effort to retain and attract workers to those fields advertisement libby said democrats remained focused on the quality and affordability of health care workforce development and the sustainable development of public infrastructure broadband access libby also said democrats intend to redouble their efforts to improve broadband and high speed internet access for rural maine following a 2019 defeat of a bonding proposal that would have earmarked funds for that instead of a bonding package libby said democrats would try to use state surplus funds for broadband expansion with a requirement for matching investments from the private sector he said in a meeting of senate democrats three weeks ago there was broad support for that approach libby said democrats had promised mainers they would expand access to high speed internet we want to try to make good on that commitment he said advertisement libby also rebuked dow the senate republican leader on state debt saying the current state budget included funds to cover the debt service on the bonding bills that lawmakers failed to send on to voters in 2019 republicans withheld their support for bonds which require a two thirds vote by lawmakers except for those related to roads and bridges which were approved by voters in november it is important people understand we are not talking about new money for bonding libby said the money is there but republicans are just not interested in getting that money out and into the ground for infrastructure improvement and economic development so we are going to try a different way pfas contamination some of the mills administration s top environmental priorities during the 2020 session are expected to focus on a class of chemicals known as pfas that are causing health concerns in maine and across the country commonly used in nonstick cookware and water repellent fabrics as well as firefighting foam some varieties of pfas have been linked to cancer thyroid disorders high cholesterol and other health effects states such as maine are scrambling to identify pfas contamination and regulate the chemicals because federal agencies have been slower to respond the mills administration is preparing a bill to allow the maine department of environmental protection to order responsible parties to clean up pfas contamination or to pay for the remediation if enacted the legislation would give the department the same authority it already has for a host of other contaminants such as mercury but the mills administration is also expected to introduce additional measures based on the recommendations of a pfas task force that examined the issue for more than six months that group s recommendations included requiring all community water systems to test for the chemicals mandating that fire departments notify the dep whenever they use pfas laced firefighting foams and a bond measure to help the state cover the growing costs of dealing with contamination hot spots send questions comments to the editors

last week i asked how high will the markets rise in 2020 assuming the markets rise at all after a record breaking 2019 investors are understandably cautious that the end of this decade long bull run we have enjoyed is imminent the manner in which stocks declined on friday will only accentuate those fears but does it answer the question is the bull run finally over the holiday shortened week didn t end the way investors hoped stocks closed lower on friday with the dow jones industrial average falling 233 92 points or 0 81 to close at 28 634 88 as it stands this is the dow s worst performing trading session in four weeks the s p 500 index declined 0 71 to end the day at 3 234 85 while the tech heavy nasdaq composite which suffered its worst performance since dec 2 closed 0 79 lower at 9 020 77 all three major averages were pressured by rising middle east tensions and weak u s factory data though all three major benchmarks finished friday s session off their lows investors looked for safety after the price of oil surged 3 amid reports late thursday night of the assassination of top iranian military leader gen qasem soleimani via airstrike which the pentagon said was done to supposedly prevent future iranian attacks the question now is how will the markets fare in the coming week particularly amid fears of further escalation between the two countries the likelihood of a targeted retaliation by iran will be an overhang and present a level of uncertainty for investors this is because ayatollah ali khamenei iran s supreme leader who has declared three days of mourning for soleimani s death has also promised that a hard revenge awaits criminals responsible for the attack in the meantime the pentagon said friday afternoon it was dispatching more than 3 000 additional troops to the middle east while the u s embassy in iraq advised u s citizens in the country to leave immediately while the markets can t know when iran will retaliate it s hard to imagine that investors will have any appetite for risk until there is more clarity or some assurance of de escalation this is especially since this scenario is certain to put upward pressure on oil prices accordingly in the coming week we are likely to see a move towards safe havens including gold and u s treasuries and a decline in risky assets some of this was evidenced by the fact that apple aapl shares fell abut 1 friday a day after hitting 300 per share for the first time airline stocks were also under pressure amid the threat of higher oil prices american airlines aal declined about 5 while united airlines ual and delta airlines dal fell 2 05 and 1 66 respectively stocks were also pressured by friday s u s manufacturing data which came in worse than expected which suggests risks to economic growth december s u s manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 47 2 according to the institute for supply management falling short of the 48 8 reading analysts were looking for december s number is a decline from a reading of 48 1 in november and its lowered reading in almost a decade for the closely watched gauge of economic growth to be sure the shortfall does not imply imminent danger but when factored with the tension that is now present in the middle east combined with the effect of rising gas prices it creates an environment of deep uncertainty that was not expected to start the new year particularly as it seems the market was just getting its act together as it relates to the u s china trade war as it stands investors particularly those who have felt uneasy about stocks sitting all time highs should expects some volatility in the in the near term and possibly in the weeks and months ahead with stocks closing out 2019 with such momentum caution should be the recommended approach and with the q4 earnings season right around the corner this puts ceos in a position to justify what some analysts see as lofty valuations by guiding 2020 with even with greater confidence than in 2019 the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
january 05 2020 07 20 pm updated 10 18 pm ist new delhi after walking out of negotiations on the 16 nation regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep free trade agreement the government said it would renegotiate its existing free trade agreements fta and redouble its efforts to conclude other trade negotiations the task is likely to swamp both the commerce and industries ministry cim and the ministry of external affairs mea negotiators in 2020 to begin with the rcep walkout isn t cast in stone yet as the other 15 countries including 10 asean members indonesia thailand singapore the philippines malaysia vietnam brunei cambodia myanmar and laos and their fta partners china japan australia new zealand and south korea will complete legal reviews by june and are only expected to sign the deal in november 2020 in the interim many countries most notably japan australia and even china have said they would be keen to work with india to convince the government to rejoin rcep the issue was due to come up when japanese pm shinzo and his australian counterpart scott morrison both of whom have had to cancel visits to india in the past month reschedule their trips and meet prime minister narendra modi eu india summit while the rcep is being wrapped up india s long pending negotiations with australia for a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement ceca as well as commerce minister piyush goyal s plans to reopen existing ftas with asean japan and south korea will have to take a backseat the next big trade focus for the government will be during the eu india summit expected in march when mr modi is expected to travel to brussels to meet the new european commission president ursula von der leyen and discuss restarting eu india bilateral trade and investment agreement btia talks however this is easier said than done given that the talks that began in 2007 and stalled in 2013 over tariff issues have not been resumed despite several efforts a possible new trade deal with the u k will become a possibility when britain concludes the brexit process this year and talks might start when mr modi travels to glasgow for cop26 in november and meets prime minister boris johnson bridging gap with u s finally the cim and mea will focus on closing talks with u s trade representatives in 2019 president trump rescinded india s gsp special status for exporters which has led to more bitterness over the issue mr modi and mr trump discussed the trade issues on two occasions when they met in 2019 but negotiators have been unable to forge any kind of deal despite visits by mr goyal to the u s in the new year both sides hope that a package of smaller agreements can be announced soon but a free trade agreement could be several years away as it hasn t even been discussed officially yet dedicated team given all the challenges the government is actively considering a sharper and leaner trade negotiating team that merges the best strengths of cim officials and mea diplomats on the lines of countries with a consolidated department of foreign affairs and trade dfat the team will have to contend with the shift in the global economic climate in the face of slowdowns worldwide the dilution of the wto s arbitration powers and the impact of the u s china trade war there is also a perceived increase in anti immigrant sentiments and india will not be able to drive as hard a bargain as it would like on services exports in exchange for allowing more market access to goods imports with the world being carved up into regional trading blocs like eu nafta for north america mercosur south america gcc gulf countries and rcep south east asia and india s only regional bloc for saarc nations safta stalled the odds of concluding more bilateral trading agreements will be that much harder in 2020

bloomberg the already low level of interest rates in the u s and the rest of the industrial world could fall further three senior central bankers said on sunday speaking at the american economic association s annual meeting federal reserve bank of new york president john williams nyse european central bank chief economist philip lane and bank of england deputy governor ben broadbent all saw a possibility that so called r star the neutral level of interest rates that neither spurs nor restricts growth in their economies might drop in the future you could see r star go lower because of demographics williams told the audience in san diego estimates of r star vary widely fed policy makers generally peg it at about 2 5 for the short term federal funds rate that the u s central bank targets the neutral rate in the euro area and japan is commonly thought to be lower a variety of structural forces aging populations and sluggish productivity growth among them are reckoned to have been pushing down the neutral rate in industrial countries for years that doesn t rule out a scenario where it gets even lower lane said while admitting that s possible broadbent voiced hope that equilibrium rates would rise back to levels that have prevailed historically i do hope that over the next decade or two that might happen he said williams who s spent much of his career studying the concept of r star cast some doubt over that optimistic view there are many stages of grief experienced by economists and policy makers who ve been forced over the years to grudgingly accept the downward trend in interest rates williams said
augusta the maine legislature cranks back into gear when it convenes the second session of the biennium on wednesday with a focus on several key issues including health care corrections broadband access and climate change lawmakers are poised to start their work on solid financial ground with an estimated state budget surplus of close to 120 million based on the last revenue forecast in november i think we are going to be absolutely looking at how we can bring people together start with a clean slate and good conversations about what we invest in said house speaker sara gideon d freeport any new spending or taxation would likely come in the form of a supplemental budget bill that would have to be offered first by democratic gov janet mills mills like gideon said state government accomplished a lot in 2019 under democratic leadership but there was still much work to be done this coming session i look forward to working with the legislature to continue to tackle health insurance issues to support quality early and adult education to strengthen our economy and expand our workforce and to protect maine people from the impacts of climate change mills said in a written statement by tackling these issues maine can and will continue to make progress for its people and future generations advertisement republican leaders said they would brace against unnecessary spending or adding levels of unsustainable debt instead focusing on key issues such as figuring out sustainable ways to pay for state road and bridge repairs without regularly borrowing money to do that work we are not going to borrow our way into a good economy senate minority leader dana dow r waldoboro said he said republicans would do their best to hold the line on taxes and want to focus on sustainable infrastructure improvements and workforce development but do it in a way that doesn t pinch the state s many small businesses house republicans want to make it clear that maine s most pressing needs should come first house minority leader kathleen dillingham r oxford said in a prepared statement forecasted monies should fund needs not wants they should help people that are struggling with real life needs right now maine s most pressing needs include our roads nursing homes direct care workers and people with disabilities on waitlists house republican members of the appropriations and financial affairs committee warned that 76 million of the budget surplus in the revenue forecast are one time monies which may not be available on an ongoing basis like dow they also said they want to focus on funding highway construction and repair without borrowing for it and without raising additional taxes lamenting the state s current 8 billion two year budget which is 11 percent higher than the state s previous budget we then borrowed 105 million for transportation said rep amy arata r new gloucester we need to set priorities any additional spending of existing tax revenues should go toward true priorities that should have been included in the 8 billion budget advertisement bonding bills the budget writing appropriations and financial affairs committee has january public hearings already scheduled on a half dozen borrowing or bonding packages worth at least 200 million among the bills are measures that would earmark 65 million for research and development for biomedical and biotechnology work focused on helping families dealing with aging dementia and alzheimer s disease 20 million for local food processing facilities 50 million for expanding commercial fishing and aquaculture infrastructure and 50 million to help research labs expand and add new equipment and facilities all of the proposals also require matching funds from other public or private sector sources and if passed by the legislature would go to statewide referendum for voter approval health care prescription drugs democrats have vowed to continue their efforts to reduce health care costs while expanding access advertisement bills to be considered include proposals to set up a new state run health insurance exchange program expand dental care for children on medicaid and curb the price of prescription drugs other bills look to help small businesses provide health insurance to their employees or provide incentives to those that do senate president troy jackson d allagash said a bill meant to provide health insurance consumers with a state run health insurance consumer protection advocacy office was also a top priority information is power jackson said and anyone that feels like they can pull the wool over your eyes by just spouting off a bunch of stuff these individual people who have no idea these insurance people just tell them no you know deny deny deny and they can get nine out of 10 people to go away jackson said maine health care consumers need an advocate in their corner when they are going up against the corporate health insurance industry the bills seek to expand on the accomplishments of 2019 when the legislature and mills moved forward with funding for a voter approved expansion of the state s medicaid program mainecare under the federal affordable care act that expansion which was expected to add about 80 000 to the state s health care benefits program for low income mainers so far has only seen about 40 000 new enrollments but the number is expected to continue to grow advertisement criminal justice and corrections a broad range of criminal justice and correctional issues will also be a top focus of the legislature the appropriations and financial affairs committee will hear wednesday from department of corrections commissioner randall liberty who will brief the panel on department related issues including the status of the downeast correctional facility youth recidivism rates and mental health treatment for incarcerated youth the criminal justice and public safety committee has hearings planned in the weeks ahead on numerous bills these include revisiting state funding of county jails and an ongoing shortage of forensic bed space for those charged with or convicted of crimes who have mental health and substance use disorders or who have been deemed incompetent to stand trial by a court lawmakers are considering a range of policy shifts to reduce the cost of housing prisoners including reducing or eliminating bail requirements for lower risk nonviolent defendants and improving programs that help those leaving jail or prison reintegrate into society with housing job training and health care programs the state s system for providing lawyers to those who are charged with crimes but are unable to afford an attorney the commission on indigent legal services is also expected to face additional scrutiny in 2020 in the wake of a report from the nonpartisan sixth amendment center which found the state s system the only one of its kind in the u s may be falling short in providing adequate legal services to those accused of crimes here advertisement the report also drew into question how private attorneys who are certified to defend indigent clients are paid by the state and highlighted a lack of oversight in billing and payment practices by the state and the attorneys in december the legislature s watchdog government oversight committee ordered its investigative arm the office of program evaluation and government accountability to launch an investigation into the recently reformed commission education bills lawmakers will also consider a series of education bills including measures that create incentives for school districts to buy all electric buses and establish rules limiting how schools can discipline young children another bill in the hopper would permit retired police officers to be hired as school resource officers other bills will continue a focus on higher education student debt one measure offered by senate majority leader nate libby d lewiston would create a student debt forgiveness program for first responders home health care providers and public school teachers in an effort to retain and attract workers to those fields advertisement libby said democrats remained focused on the quality and affordability of health care workforce development and the sustainable development of public infrastructure broadband access libby also said democrats intend to redouble their efforts to improve broadband and high speed internet access for rural maine following a 2019 defeat of a bonding proposal that would have earmarked funds for that instead of a bonding package libby said democrats would try to use state surplus funds for broadband expansion with a requirement for matching investments from the private sector he said in a meeting of senate democrats three weeks ago there was broad support for that approach libby said democrats had promised mainers they would expand access to high speed internet we want to try to make good on that commitment he said advertisement libby also rebuked dow the senate republican leader on state debt saying the current state budget included funds to cover the debt service on the bonding bills that lawmakers failed to send on to voters in 2019 republicans withheld their support for bonds which require a two thirds vote by lawmakers except for those related to roads and bridges which were approved by voters in november it is important people understand we are not talking about new money for bonding libby said the money is there but republicans are just not interested in getting that money out and into the ground for infrastructure improvement and economic development so we are going to try a different way pfas contamination some of the mills administration s top environmental priorities during the 2020 session are expected to focus on a class of chemicals known as pfas that are causing health concerns in maine and across the country commonly used in nonstick cookware and water repellent fabrics as well as firefighting foam some varieties of pfas have been linked to cancer thyroid disorders high cholesterol and other health effects states such as maine are scrambling to identify pfas contamination and regulate the chemicals because federal agencies have been slower to respond the mills administration is preparing a bill to allow the maine department of environmental protection to order responsible parties to clean up pfas contamination or to pay for the remediation if enacted the legislation would give the department the same authority it already has for a host of other contaminants such as mercury but the mills administration is also expected to introduce additional measures based on the recommendations of a pfas task force that examined the issue for more than six months that group s recommendations included requiring all community water systems to test for the chemicals mandating that fire departments notify the dep whenever they use pfas laced firefighting foams and a bond measure to help the state cover the growing costs of dealing with contamination hot spots send questions comments to the editors

numerous hearings over the last six months legislation to improve access to prevention treatment and recovery will be introduced early in this new session one impactful change we can all make is breaking the stigma of addiction and recognizing it for what it is â a disease state sen james skoufis improving the hudson valleyâ s long neglected crumbling infrastructure the 39th state senate district includes the towns of monroe palm tree and woodbury 1 what do you expect during 2020 in terms of growth and or development are there local projects on the horizon improvements to infrastructure new businesses every year since being elected to state government i have focused on the importance of improving the hudson valleyâ s long neglected crumbling infrastructure in 2020 i will be fighting to advance a number of infrastructure projects that will specifically alleviate the congestion caused by overdevelopment occurring in our area residents are desperate for traffic relief and we must act quickly in order to improve our communitiesâ quality of life itâ s essential that any new residential or commercial development is smart growth and well planned which includes improvements to infrastructure and careful consideration of impacts on the environment this year we have an opportunity because the department of transportationâ s five year capital plan will be negotiated therefore time is of the essence to loudly and strongly advocate for infrastructure projects that weâ ve been waiting for in the hudson valley iâ m proud that we were finally able to get the exit 131 interchange upgraded alleviating an area that is all too familiar with unmanageable traffic thereâ s much more to do however some projects that i will be pushing for are â expanding route 17 to three lanes in each way recently i got a commitment from the senate transportation committeeâ s chairman to publicly support this project and fight for it alongside me â repaving route 17m everyone who drives over route 17m knows that it is riddled with potholes and makes what should be an easy commute a stressful one this year iâ ll be pushing for funds for a full repaving of route 17m â train station at woodbury common last year i secured 5 million from the state s railroad fund for a new train station at woodbury common additionally i secured a commitment from the mta to not only support the project but also provide any technical expertise required to move the train station forward iâ ll be fighting through this entire legislative session to continue moving forward on this project between traffic relief and environmental impacts a train station at woodbury common makes a lot of sense and no further expansion at the mall should be allowed without it 2 what will be the most important and or critical issue or problem you and the residents of your community will face in the new year what can you do about it taxes continue to be the utmost priority facing many of my constituents this year while some of our areaâ s very own state representatives unthinkably voted against the property tax cap i led the successful charge to finally make it permanent ensuring we will always at least have a lid on the increases weâ ve capped our taxes but now we must work towards really cutting them because our families retirees and future generations deserve a livable state to call home thatâ s why i will be advocating to deliver more funding to our schools which is important for our studentsâ education but also relieves pressure on local property taxpayers on state income taxes families making under 300 000 will receive a tax cut making sure more money stays in middle class pockets i strongly supported this effort and will keep pushing for this type of targeted relief ultimately my goal is to completely reform the way we fund local services to move away from property taxes entirely and for the first time albany is having substantive discussions about how exactly to do this alongside the senate education committee chairwoman i participated in roundtables with stakeholders in the hudson valley and across the state to review how to update the way new york funds education i was a strong voice during those discussions and will continue to be one as we head into this yearâ s legislative session finally and importantly amidst the backdrop of an increasingly partisan political environment that is toxic for our country i pledge to continue to work with anyone in any party for our communities and always lead with a firm bipartisan foot forward iâ m ever grateful for monroe woodbury constituents affording me the privilege of representing them in the state senate and i wish everyone a successful 2020
stephen webster american renaissance march 2008 patrick j buchanan day of reckoning how hubris ideology and greed are tearing american apart thomas dunne books 2007 294 pp the united states warns patrick buchanan is on a collision course with history each of three major policies trade immigration strategy is unsustainable and together they imperil the continued existence of the united states such is the grim message of mr buchanan s latest book day of reckoning why do our leaders fail to recognize the risks they are running mr buchanan believes they are blinded by ideology they want the world to conform to their vision and are prepared to use force to make it conform in mr buchanan s view real conservatism is the absence of ideology the willingness to take the world and human nature as they are rather than impose impossible ambitions mr buchanan writes that ideology drives all of our most catastrophic policies multiculturalism sees massive third world immigration as a great benefit rather than the disaster it obviously is and faith in free trade is destroying our industrial infrastructure and beggaring the middle class but in mr buchanan s view the most harmful of the regnant ideologies is what he calls democratism the neoconservative doctrine of imposing democracy on the world by force it is this compulsion to remake the world that has drawn us into the iraq war which mr buchanan calls the worst strategic blunder in american history democratism would never have been a temptation to our rulers were it not for another related american defect hubris even before the younger bush became president george h w bush and bill clinton acted as if there was no limit to america s ability to force its will upon the world the end of the cold war should have been an opportunity to bring our troops home to cut back our commitments to become in the words of the late gene kirkpatrick a normal nation for which foreign policy is a secondary concern mr buchanan reminds us that from the revolution to the end of the second world war we had no peacetime alliances instead of scrapping nato we expanded it to include former warsaw pact nations and even parts of the former soviet union instead of dismantling our foreign bases we have built scores more and now have hundreds of thousands of soldiers in no fewer than 135 of the world s 192 countries this has produced a potentially dangerous confrontation with vladimir putin s russia and has encircled china recreating cold war style containment against a country whose trade according to our elites is essential to our prosperity despite the collapse of the soviet union we are still committed to defending canada europe australia japan south korea thailand the philippines latin america and taiwan worse still we have added eastern europe the balkans central asia and the middle east to our security burdens we are committed to defending most of the countries of the world against attack some with economies stronger than ours yet after six years of fighting we cannot even pacify afghanistan in mr buchanan s view the most dangerous and reprehensible combination of hubris and democratism has been president george w bush as a candidate mr bush preached a more humble foreign policy than that of bill clinton who made war in the balkans on people who did not threaten us after the september 11 terrorist attacks which mr buchanan believes were a consequence of our middle east policies neocons seduced mr bush to their vision of spreading democracy by force mr bush has since become a uniquely reckless and ignorant steward of american power blind to the tragedy his policies have left behind and oblivious to the hatred for america he has stirred up around the world free trade it may be just as well then that the united states is broke and has nothing like the resources for the neocons fantastic military program to remake the entire middle east and why is the world s richest country broke because it has sacrificed its workers and its industrial might to the false lure of free trade ceos who ship american jobs overseas in order to cut costs grow wealthy while the middle class shrinks mr buchanan reports that because our markets are open to the world while so many are closed to us we had a 2006 trade deficit of 764 billion with a deficit in manufactured goods alone of 536 billion we have not run a trade surplus since the early 1970s we had a 233 billion trade deficit with china 88 billion with japan and 60 billion with mexico economically china treats us like a colonial province it had surpluses with us in computers electrical machinery vehicles optical and photographic equipment furniture plastics and iron and steel products we had surpluses with china in soybeans corn wheat animal feed meat cotton ores scrap hides pulp wastepaper cigarettes coal rice tobacco fertilizers and glass mr buchanan sees free trade as an ideological cult just like democratism he argues that it was the economic nationalism preached by alexander hamilton and now practiced by the chinese that made the american economy the greatest in the world while free trade destroyed britain s early preeminence free trade puts the claims of consumers ahead of the duties of citizens he writes adding that history has proven free trade to be a serial killer of manufacturing the world economy now looks to the united states mainly as a market we are consumers rather than producers mr buchanan also calls free trade the trojan horse of transnational government noting that it is the favored ideology of those calling for north american union and an end to the nation state its combined economic and political effect therefore makes it just as pernicious as crusading democratism and the third ideology mr buchanan examines multiculturalism deconstructing america is the title of mr buchanan s chapter on multiculturalism a slashing critique that could have been written by the late sam francis himself since the cultural revolution of the 1960s and the immigration act of 1965 writes mr buchanan the ethnocultural core has begun to dissolve he european ethnic core is shrinking from nearly 90 percent in 1960 it is down to 67 percent today and will be less than 50 percent by 2040 here we come to the heart of the matter quo vadis america where are you going wherever it is going he believes it can never return mr buchanan blames the neoconservatives and the race denying left for dissolving what he calls the essential constituents of nation blood and soil tradition and faith history and heroes deconstructionists have replaced these ancient bonds with a new civic religion based on the new trinity of diversity democracy and equality the result is an artificial shell what enthusiasts call a creedal nation millions of third worlders have but to mouth the creed in order to become authentic americans or even europeans neocons have such a contemptuous view of nation and such a lust for cannon fodder for their imperial wars that they want guaranteed citizenship for anyone who joins uncle sam s legions recruiting centers could be set up all over the third world as mr buchanan notes the creed whatever it is alleged to include can never take the place of blood and soil it has no roots and does not touch the heart he writes americans will not send their sons to fight and die for watery abstractions before it is too late those who have read mr buchanan s earlier books the great betrayal a republic not an empire state of emergency and the death of the west will be familiar with many of his arguments day of reckoning refines these arguments and brings the facts entirely up to date like his previous titles this book glows with passion for its subject the united states of america mr buchanan warns that disaster can take many forms but the result would be the end of what we know as the united states it could for example break apart like yugoslavia or czechoslovakia the southwest is becoming a province of mexico and the country is descending into what teddy roosevelt warned against a tangle of squabbling nationalities alternatively like the soviet union the united states could expire from sheer exhaustion and imperial overreach we are already selling what is left of our economic infrastructure to pay for imports as whole industries leave our shores the dollar could collapse and lose its role as a reserve currency leaving us at the mercy of foreigners who hold our debts if we do the neocons bidding and add to our roster of disastrous wars the end could come quickly the united states could find itself having to choose between taipei and seattle in a showdown with china we would face such a crisis impoverished and with few friends since our hubris has already cost us the goodwill of russia and much of europe outright humiliating defeat is not out of the question and as mr buchanan reminds us empires do not usually survive defeat mr buchanan believes all these disasters can be avoided if our leaders regain their senses his advice is simple come home america lay down the banner of empire put americans and american jobs first control the border before it is too late
by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time no one can say president donald trump wasn t warned two years after his administration passed a massive tax cut for corporations meant to spur economic growth the verdict is in and the results are embarrassing the tax cuts did not unleash animal spirits as the business media is so fond of saying and it did not usher in a period of 3 gdp growth as trump s administration was so fond of echoing this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now have an account log in the plan did not by any stretch of the imagination pay for itself with growth and reduced deductions as treasury secretary steve mnuchin said it would back in 2017 in fact the us budget deficit has grown by 50 since trump took office there was one tax promise the administration did keep and with gusto it dramatically lowered the tax responsibility for big corporations according to analysis by the tax policy center the government s projections for how much revenue it would take in after the law passed were too high across the board but none were as sugar coated as its projection for how much corporate tax revenue it would collect which was off by about 40 advertisement under trump s tax law corporations paid 135 billion less in taxes in 2018 than the year before corporations did not reinvest that lovely payday back into the us economy either another one of the bill s supposed selling points trump and his allies claimed that with this tax windfall corporates would unleash a tide of investment into the economy but that never materialized growth in business investment was lackluster in 2019 and in testimony before congress federal reserve chairman jerome powell pointed to this sluggishness as a contributor to slowing gdp growth in the third quarter of last year related stories in other words once corporate ceos got their sweet sweet tax cut they spent just a little on the actual sorts of investments that could boost the economy and then kept the rest to pour into a record number of stock buybacks we can argue about the value of buybacks another time but they certainly aren t helping substantially boost gdp growth right now advertisement andy kiersz business insider one would think after trump handed his friends in corporate america a big tax windfall they would return the favor and contribute substantially to us economic growth but instead there was almost no boost in investment despite the fact that a study from the center for public integrity found that the number of companies that paid zero in tax about doubled from 2017 to 2018 a swarm locusts a plague of frogs to add insult to injury it isn t just that big business took its gains from the tax cut and didn t reinvest them in the us economy it s that it took them and decided those gains weren t nearly enough the moment the tax law was passed corporate america started demanding even more tax benefits from the trump administration according to a report from the new york times first you have to understand that in theory the law represented something of a deal between the government and corporate america it went like this if the government lowered the corporate rate in the us corporates would bring back a bunch of money they had stashed offshore in lower tax countries to be taxed here but again that deal wasn t enough for corporates after the tax law passed in 2017 their lobbyists descended on the us treasury like a biblical plague you see while congress had written the new law the treasury had to write the rules for actually implementing the tax changes advertisement and according to the times which reviewed the rules as they were finally written on top of interviewing policymakers and tax experts the corporate pressure worked large businesses can now legally avoid tens if not hundreds of billions of taxes that they would have been required to pay treasury is gutting the new law bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston told the times it is largely the top 1 that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world some of the big winners of this effort were some of the most egregious tax dodgers in corporate america pharmaceutical companies tech companies and banks and the whole swamp of washington came together for this effort big foreign banks for example begged not to have to pay taxes on money kept at american subsidiaries to comply with capital regulations and they got that then in an fascinating turn erika nijenhuis the attorney who lobbied on behalf of the institute of international bankers to get this rule passed joined the treasury s office of tax policy in the fall of 2019 advertisement now the rules that were supposed to bring tax revenue home to the united states will bring in much less than projected tax revenue as a share of gdp is already below what one would expect in a healthy economy 16 3 versus 18 4 and according to new data from the congressional budget office income inequality will worsen in 2021 as the richest americans will benefit from the biggest tax cut while the middle class will see the most modest growth in income perhaps this was all just one pathetic bungle of a bill a product of a partisan washington where little work of quality is getting done or perhaps it was intentional a product of a partisan washington where work is being done only for the rich and powerful either way at least publicly big business made a deal with trump and then reneged given his own experience with making deals trump should ve recognized that move coming a mile away
here s a simple truth about bank stocks as goes the economy so go bank stocks that is when the global economy is firing on all cylinders bank stocks roar higher on the flip side when the economy slows bank stocks falter source sundry photography shutterstock com this simple truth is the basis for a 2020 bull thesis on bank of america nyse bac stock from early 2018 to mid 2019 bank of america stock went nowhere because the economy went nowhere as rising geopolitical and trade tensions stifled global expansion in late 2019 however bank of america stock has broken out to new highs as trade tensions have eased and the global economic environment has improved these economic improvements will persist in 2020 the u s and china will put their trade war on hold and central banks across the world will maintain supportive monetary policies this combination will ultimately propel a meaningful economic rebound in 2020 defined by robust corporate and consumer spending trends a healthy lending environment and strong banking activity investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips ultimately this 2020 economic rebound has the potential to propel bank of america stock above 40 for the first time since the 2007 2008 financial crisis bank of america s fundamentals are improving the bull thesis on bank of america stock heading into 2020 is shockingly simple in simple terms it goes something like this the economy is improving so buy bac stock from early 2018 to mid 2019 the global economy slowed meaningfully thanks to escalating u s china trade tensions heading into 2020 though everything is changing course both the u s and china have backed off on upping the ante in the trade war instead both sides seem committed to trade war de escalation for different reasons the u s administration doesn t want to upset the global economic balance in an election year while china s administration doesn t want its economy to keep sinking on trade headwinds story continues consequently throughout 2020 into the u s presidential election global trade tensions will ease that will inject certainty back into the global economy which will provide a lift to corporate and consumer confidence levels as corporations and consumers get more confident they will get more active and spend more money big picture then the global economy appears optimally positioned for a big rebound in 2020 at the same time the federal reserve will likely remain on hold given that inflation remains stubbornly below 2 so the short end of the curve will likely stay low meanwhile the long end will move higher thanks to increasing economic activity that creates a great situation for banks to make money by borrowing short and lending long all in all the operating environment for banks will improve dramatically in 2020 as it does bank of america stock could make a run for 40 bank of america stock is positioned to run above 40 bank of america stock hasn t been above the 40 level since before the financial crisis but in 2020 shares could finally eclipse that mark once again the numbers here are pretty simple bank of america projects to do about 2 80 in earnings per share this year according to sell side estimates the financial sector has historically grown earnings at a fairly consistent single digit rate over the past few years excluding the impact of tax cuts over the next two years profit growth rates should be better than average given the huge fundamental improvements outlined earlier as such bank of america has a visible opportunity to grow profits at a high single digit rate over the next few years in this light the consensus sell side estimate calling for 3 30 in earnings per share by fiscal 2021 seems entirely doable let s assume that by the end of 2020 the forward profit estimate does sit at 3 30 per share let s also assume that because the operating environment will be favorable bank of america stock trades at a financial sector long term average forward price to earnings multiple of 13 that combination 13 times forward earnings on 3 30 in projected 2021 eps implies a 2020 price target for bac stock of over 40 that s exactly where i think bank of america stock will trend over the next 12 months bottom line on bac stock bank of america stock finally has its groove back thanks to easing u s china trade tensions breathing life back into the global economy throughout most of 2020 trade tensions will continue to ease and the global economy will continue to pick up steam as both of those things happen bank of america stock will continue to march higher as of this writing luke lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities more from investorplace the post a global economic rebound will push bank of america stock above 40 appeared first on investorplace
here s a tragic fact the canadian stock index returned 95 over the past decade while a mix of canadian federal municipal and provincial government debt returned 94 over the same period according to bloomberg in other words most investors could have had the same returns with lower risk by investing in canadian bonds rather than stocks which just goes to show just how tepid the domestic stock market is unsurprisingly the local market also routinely under performs the one south of the border the s p 500 has returned an impressive 186 over the same decade could this outperformance continue in the future i believe so the american economy is larger more populated better funded and more tech heavy than our own with that in mind domestic stocks with exposure to the u s could be a great way to add exceptional growth potential at reasonable valuations here are two canadian stocks with u s exposure you should consider tricon capital real estate investment giant tricon capital group tsx tcn manages a 10 5 billion portfolio of single and multifamily residential properties across north america what most investors don t know is that this toronto based company s assets under management are almost entirely based beyond the southern border according to the company s latest filing 92 of underlying property assets are located in the u s the u s housing market has only recently crossed the price levels witnessed before the great financial crisis home sales and prices are expected to increase by another 5 4 in 2020 while the national price to rent ratio is at 17 5 which indicates fair value overall although the u s housing market is starting to heat up it s not nearly as overvalued as that of the canadian market the price to rent ratio in canada s largest cities toronto and vancouver reached 23 9 and 27 9 respectively a ratio above 20 indicates overvaluation it s also no secret that the average canadian household is over leveraged if the local residential market corrects tricon s assets are insulated by their exposure to the u s brookfield asset management alternative investment giant brookfield asset management tsx bam a nyse bam is one of the largest money managers in the world brookfield currently serves over 18 000 institutional clients across more than 30 countries however most of its assets clients and operations are based in the largest economy in the world the u s more than half of the company s assets under management 53 were based here according to its latest quarterly filing the alternative asset space in the u s is arguably more mature than anywhere else on the planet meanwhile the country remains one of the top wealth creation and migration destinations in the world in short brookfield is a proxy for u s wealth creation a bet that has paid off well over the past century at the moment the stock trades at 15 3 times annual earnings per share and roughly twice book value per share that seems appropriate for a company that targets 12 to 15 annual growth with steady recurring cash flows from management fees bottom line in 2020 the u s economy seems better positioned and better valued than the canadian economy stocks like tricon and brookfield should serve as undervalued proxies for investors looking to place a bet on the world s wealthiest nation

like a well intentioned new year s resolution bunge is trying to shed some extra weight and focusing on its core bunge north america sold its series b membership units to southwest iowa renewable energy llc effective december 31 2019 thus ending bunge s 13 year ownership interest in sire but why as we know all too well the u s ethanol industry has struggled with the trump administration s expanded use of small refinery waivers and according to reuters already 13 ethanol plants have shut down since november 2018 with others reducing production at least temporarily but hey trump visited this ethanol plant last summer so didn t that mean something as part of the bunge sire transaction the two series b directors appointed by bunge andrés martín and brett caplice resigned from the sire board in addition the two companies revised commercial agreements sire accessed its existing credit facility to fund the unit purchase transaction in addition to the stock repurchase sire will assume responsibility for originating corn and selling dried distillers grains produced by the plant under a revised agreement bunge will continue to purchase all of the ethanol produced by sire sire will also continue to lease rail cars from bunge under existing lease agreements sire is located on 275 acres in council bluffs iowa operating an ethanol plant that is permitted to produce 140 million gallons per year sire began producing ethanol in february 2009 and sells its ethanol distillers grains corn syrup and corn oil in the continental united states mexico and the pacific rim reaction from the stakeholders karol king sire s chairman stated since we first partnered in 2006 and in the following years through construction and ethanol industry challenges bunge has been an invaluable partner for sire in particular sire benefitted throughout the years from commercial agreements for corn origination and products and in having two bunge board members who provided international agribusiness insight to our business mr king continued sire is very pleased today to be in the position to go forward as an entity wholly owned by our farmer and community members with bunge s ongoing support for our ethanol marketing as bunge focuses our resources on our core businesses selling our shares in sire while maintaining a relationship is an attractive opportunity said andrés martín north america country manager for bunge bunge is proud to have been a partner in building and operating this successful ethanol plant and we look forward to continuing to work with the sire team mike jerke sire s ceo stated while conditions in the ethanol industry are difficult with bunge s capital support and strategic advice over the years sire is and will continue to be a strong participant in the renewable energy industry and low carbon economy we look forward to continuing to work with bunge on a daily basis in managing our ethanol sales and rail car fleet going once going twice sold just weeks ago bunge limited signed an agreement to sell its margarine and mayonnaise assets in brazil to seara alimentos s a this transaction further streamlines our operations in brazil around our core capabilities while providing good value for a solid business it also represents another incremental step in executing a key priority of optimizing our overall portfolio said greg heckman bunge s chief executive officer in october bunge sold a majority of its stake in beyond meat since the lockup ended bunge has significantly decreased its position and will update the status of its investment when it reports its fourth quarter results bunge said in an emailed response to bloomberg bloomberg reported that beyond meat s sell off followed a frenzied rally that drove the stock up as much as 840 back in july helping white plains new york based bunge post a 125 million windfall in the second quarter in the three months ended sept 30 beyond meat shares retreated and bunge booked a 10 million loss on its holding bunge s investment arm held 979 556 shares or a 1 63 stake before beyond meat s ipo in july the firm took advantage of an early secondary offering which allowed it to sell shares months before the lockup expired and sold 72 709 shares at 160 filings show as for their latest third quarter results as reported back in october 2019 bunge had about 1 7 billion of charges related to portfolio initiatives primarily the formation of the joint venture for the brazilian sugar bioenergy business which we ll talk about more in a minute they told investors in their earnings call that their agribusiness managed challenging markets well and benefited from approximately 25 million of net mark to market gains which included 95 million of new gains on forward soy crush margin contraction food ingredients performed well driven by strength in edible oils and progress continues on streamlining global business structure greg heckman bunge s chief executive officer commented we navigated uncertain and deteriorating market conditions well while we expect headwinds to continue we are making progress on our key priorities we have improved our operational execution as well as our discipline around risk management our decision to combine our global and north american headquarters in st louis is an important step in the work underway to streamline our global business structure we will continue to focus on the business drivers within our control as we execute our mission of delivering results and driving increased returns to shareholders check out their soy crush margins grains updates sugarcane milling results and more at their q3 earnings report here what the future holds based on the current agribusiness environment which has become more challenging bunge now expects a decline in earnings versus 2018 according to their latest earnings report this outlook excludes notable items the favorable impact of bunge ventures investment in beyond meat and higher results in sugar bioenergy additionally the company expects the following for 2019 a tax rate in the range of 20 to 24 excluding notable items net interest expense in the range of 290 to 300 million capital expenditures in the range of 520 to 540 million of which approximately 115 million is related to sugarcane milling and depreciation depletion and amortization of approximately 550 million bunge is also moving its headquarters from new york to st louis missouri the company is in the early planning stages of the transition to the new global headquarters which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter 2020 while st louis is already an important hub for bunge and our current north american operations the city is also home to a number of food agriculture animal health and plant science organizations and customers said gregory a heckman bunge s ceo moving the global headquarters to a location where bunge has a major business presence is a big step forward in shifting the company s operating model to align around a more efficient streamlined global business structure we are grateful to have called white plains home for many years and now look forward to the new growth and development opportunities which our expanded st louis presence will provide bp and bunge 50 50 brazilian joint venture as reported in the digest just a month ago in december bp and bunge announced that they have completed the formation of bp bunge bioenergia the brazilian bioenergy joint venture that combines their brazilian bioenergy and sugarcane ethanol businesses bp bunge bioenergia will have 11 biofuels sites in brazil with 32 million metric tonnes of combined crushing capacity per year the joint venture will have the flexibility to produce a mix of ethanol and sugar it will also generate renewable electricity fuelled by waste biomass from the sugar cane through its cogeneration facilities to power all its sites and sell surplus electricity to the brazilian power grid on completion bp will pay bunge 75 million subject to customary closing adjustments and the joint venture will assume 700 million of non recourse debt associated with bunge s assets bp bunge bioenergia is now the second largest operator by effective crushing capacity in the brazilian bioethanol market bp s interest in the new venture will grow its existing biofuels business by more than 50 more on the details about the 50 50 joint venture with bp here bottom line trim the fat cut the carbs shed the extra pounds sounds like bunge is doing just that to start 2020 off as a slimmer trimmer machine while we don t know for sure how much of an impact trump s policies and the small refinery waivers had to do with the iowa decision we do know that bunge is focusing on its core businesses to navigate the challenges ahead
published monday 6 january 2020 print disqus crisis delayed circling the drain tax and spend get ready writing sic planning and more writing welcome to the 2020s some weren t sure we would make it this far but we did now we face a new decade and new challenges how we handle them will determine what kind of conversation we have in 2030 this concern for the future is one of the things that separates humans from animals dogs don t worry about tomorrow much less next year they live completely in the present giving it their all an ability i sometimes envy being human i have to think about the future and being a writer people want to know what i think so today and next week i ll outline what i expect for both the year 2020 and the decade of the 2020s my forthcoming book will have an even more detailed vision so consider this an appetizer crisis delayed in some ways today s decade of living dangerously letter is a continuation of my 2019 forecast the year of living dangerously i think the 2020s in general will be rough but to be clear my view of the decade is not my view of the coming year in summary i expect 2020 will look like a slower version of 2018 and 2019 my base case is for no recession this year with all the usual caveats but it s important to know what we should pay attention to some key events began to unfold last year that i think will continue in 2020 some are hard to grasp as i said in that letter a year ago in a nutshell i expect to spend this year living dangerously yes i m thinking of the 1982 film starring a very youthful mel gibson and sigourney weaver based on an earlier christopher koch novel it has an asian setting and features corrupt politics neophyte journalists international intrigue plus a gender bending chinese dwarf if you aren t sure how all those fit together then welcome to 2019 we are all stuck in this craziness and can only make the best of it reviewing old forecasts can be humbling but i think that mine for 2019 held up well i outlined several risks all of which did in fact pop up during the year fortunately they didn t have dire consequences but they also aren t over yet risk by the way is an often misunderstood word it s the possibility something bad will happen you take risk every time you get in your car and drive somewhere accidents are always possible no matter how careful you are the fact that you didn t crash today doesn t mean you can throw caution to the wind tomorrow the risk is still there similarly the fact we got through the year without crisis x occurring doesn t mean the risk is gone living dangerously tends to catch up with you my top concern for 2019 was a federal reserve policy error the december 2018 rate hike turned out to be that cycle s last one though none of us knew it at the time we saw the fed both raising rates and shrinking its balance sheet and markets not liking it one bit i said they should do one or the other not both simultaneously i said it was going to be tough we are in a serious pickle the extraordinary measures central banks took to get us out of the last crisis could make the next one even worse they seem collectively hellbent on reducing their balance sheets avoiding another liquidity crisis will take some seriously active management by the fomc and central bankers elsewhere too i am not confident they can do it that liquidity crisis i feared actually happened nine months later the repo market seized up causing the fed to launch a qe like asset purchase program that is still in progress today as i explained last month in prelude to crisis the fed s bad choices have compounded to the point where all the options are bad source charles hugh smith i see almost zero chance the fed will end the repo program after the six months it presently plans because i see zero chance the federal deficit will shrink chances are high it will get even bigger oh it s possible they pause for a short time but then we will see another taper tantrum and they ll reopen the spigots the fed s qe forever mode is helping stock and other asset prices for now it may continue into 2020 but not forever market valuations are a little bit stretched to say the least last december we had a 20 correction and the cnn greed and fear index went to 1 a year later it was back at 97 in the meantime the federal reserve reversed its balance sheet reductions cut interest rates and generally accommodated the market s and trump s desires if we get anything like the correction we saw a year ago i think the fed will respond with another interest rate cut or two while continuing the current qe and maybe even increasing it as milton friedman famously said nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program circling the drain another potential 2019 crisis avoided so far but still with us lies in the corporate bond market especially its high yield segment companies continued levering up last year and yield hungry investors helped them do it that might be less worrisome if they were using this borrowed money to make capital investments or otherwise generate additional value instead much of it goes to buybacks that prop up share prices but don t make the company any more valuable it shifts the capital structure away from equity in favor of debt it mainly helps option holding management at the expense of shareholders source the washington post yet another problem is this debt tends to be short term and has to be constantly rolled over this is the same challenge the federal government faces congress and the trump administration are spending more money forcing the treasury to sell more paper this rising demand for liquidity is one factor behind the repo crisis to which the fed is responding with qe or whatever you call it both the treasury and corporate borrowers compete for the same capital each has attractive features it can offer treasury has safety but low yields corporates have credit risk but higher yields low rated corporates have even more credit risk and even higher yields but they all have limits at some point junk bond issuers can t offer high enough yields to compensate for the additional risk they have over treasury debt that s getting harder not easier as the federal deficit sucks up more of the available liquidity and the quality of the debt just keeps getting worse bbb bonds now make up more than 50 of investment grade corporate debt that is worrying enough but the spreads over treasuries are dropping as investors reach for yield with both fists this was dangerous last year and it is just as dangerous this year when not if there is a recession this market is going to break badly investors and index mutual funds chasing this yield could see losses well over 50 source bloomberg i m fairly conversant with the high yield junk bond space but my go to guy is really steve blumenthal he thinks investors in some funds could lose as much as 70 because so much of the paper is either covenant lite or has no covenants at all literally nothing backs this paper except the issuing company s goodwill and promises you know how exits clog when everybody tries to leave the theater at the same time when the bond show ends there will be nobody on the other side of the trade to buy those bonds in anything like a timely fashion it will be one of the ugliest and most devastating investment events of our lifetime that being said the bottom of that market will also be the buying opportunity of a lifetime patience grasshopper the fed is trying to manage this and doing a good job so far its task could suddenly get way harder if we see any major corporate debt defaults as is likely if the economy weakens and possible even if it doesn t rates might rise to a point at which already leveraged companies can t roll over their existing debts much less issue more and then it gets sticky and then think about what happens if we have a recession this chart from the st louis federal reserve fred database shows that during the last recession high yield rates rose to 21 8 when that happens next time source st louis fed let s look at one fund from vanguard i m not picking on them this was literally the first chart i found and dozens of funds would show the same notice the cliff like sheer drop in late 2008 nowhere to run nowhere to hide your nav was down well over 30 buying somewhere close to the bottom would have brought monster returns in a fairly short time as they say timing is everything source yahoo finance where might this start your guess is as good as mine but like a nuclear explosion you don t have to be at ground zero to get hurt the shock waves are hard to escape debt defaults bring layoffs at both the defaulting company and maybe its suppliers losses for bondholders and it gets worse from there recession can easily follow or perhaps it will be the other way around with the recession causing the debt crisis either will be bad corporate credit may well be a bigger risk than the federal government s fiscal woes the fed can help the treasury supporting private companies is trickier both legally and practically they may find ways to do it as we saw in 2008 with tarp etc but that will be tough in the present political environment i know many readers will say we should have let nature take its course in the last debt crisis in a strict free market sense that is the right choice creative destruction is what enables long term growth people and businesses that make bad decisions need to feel market discipline unfortunately that is a tough sell when people and communities are hurting finding the right balance is a big leadership challenge and i m not confident present leaders would handle it well tax and spend all this will happen against two important backdrops first whether we like it or not government and central bank decisions now drive most of what happens in the economy and markets that s not ideal but it s where we are yes over long periods market forces will win but as keynes famously said in the long run we re all dead meanwhile these outside forces will get what they want second what they want is increasingly unclear and subject to change that would be the case even if 2020 weren t an election year but with candidates at all levels whipping up emotions it will be even more so on the key economic issues it doesn t particularly matter who controls congress or the white house they re going to tax and spend regardless differing only in the details but perceptions matter and we will probably see a lot of volatility as investors grapple with how the perceived winners will manage those details wall street is putting a lot of hope in the phase 1 china trade deal to boost growth count me skeptical yes china agreed to some helpful changes the us dropped some not all of its current and planned tariffs but those aren t the real problem the real problem is that businesses still can t be confident policy will remain stable and thus are unable to make growth plans i think we will keep seeing this in capital investment numbers and there s really no good solution the trade war genie is out of the bottle worse this trade war may be producing the opposite of its intent last week tesla tsla delivered the first vehicles made in its new shanghai factory built specifically to avoid trade barriers instead of incentivizing us export production tariffs are making us companies shift what would have been export production to other countries we will see more of this it may be good for those companies but not for american workers profits from overseas operations are one of the primary reasons for sustained and high us stock valuations the chart below courtesy of danielle dimartino booth shows many of the components of said profits are not growing year over year that needs to change if the china deal at least changes the mood for international corporations and global trade flows then we ll have more reasons for a positive outlook continued decline in global trade flows would be a serious headwind this is something we really have to pay attention to it is a top risk for my otherwise rather benign view of 2020 source quill intelligence get ready while 2020 could bring any of several potential crises to a boil i think we will more likely have a lot of noise but little real change i expect more of the same slow but steady gdp growth in the 1 5 to 2 range widespread dissatisfaction and polarized opinions on both the economy and politics next week we ll look further into the coming decade and as you ll see the outlook darkens considerably this is actually good news in one narrow sense we have time to prepare for what s coming i personally intend to use 2020 to realign my portfolio get more liquid and try to get my businesses in position to take advantage of new opportunities we will all be tempted to think that electing our desired candidates will fix everything i assure you whatever your orientation it will not bigger things are happening and at this point most are beyond political solutions the elections will be important in many ways but they won t change the economic trajectory that chance is gone what isn t gone is your chance to get ready my goal this year is to help you do it one important part of preparation i believe is to surround yourself with high quality people that goes for your business circles as well as for your personal life when times get tough having a support system financially and emotionally is priceless that said in a few weeks we ll reopen the alpha society our exclusive members club for a very short time and we ll have some big surprises for those who become members more on that soon writing sic planning and more writing a small request i m looking for an introduction to andrew yang and i wonder if someone out there has a connection if so please contact my staff here that s not an endorsement of his presidential campaign i just think he has some interesting ideas and i want to learn more my travel plans are strangely wide open right now i know i will have to get to new york but have no idea when philadelphia is likely soon and tokyo is becoming a possibility but i am feeling more and more personal pressure to get this book written and off my to do list it s fun but if i ever take on a project this big again i hope someone slaps

of the problem and i will continue to fight for that 2 what will be the most important and or critical issue or problem you and the residents of your community will face in the new year what can you do about it honestly the most critical issue for the residents of the 98th assembly district is the misguided focus of the leadership in the assembly and senate focusing on downstate issues and not

infrastructure new businesses a 2020 offers a lot of promise for my district and our entire region i am advocating for several critical infrastructure projects including the route 17 third lane expansion which is a top bipartisan priority i was able to recently announce significant funding for water infrastructure projects in my district that will have profound impacts on the daily lives of countless local residents in the coming year i also announced regional economic development council awards which will be used for a variety of projects related to economic development tourism agriculture and the arts in our communities i will continue to work with local officials business leaders and school officials to bring our fair share of funding back to our district help relieve our local property tax burden and ensure economic prosperity benefits all residents q what will be the most important and or critical issue or problem you and the residents of your community will face in the new year what can you do about it of paramount importance is protecting our land water and natural resources i am proud to be leading the land preservation efforts for our region in albany as well as fighting for clean water and combating the varied water crises we are facing taxes and cost of living continue to be a significant burden driving many of our friends family and neighbors to leave

protect our farms and rural heritage while diversifying the economyâ the 42nd state senate district which runs from orange county to ulster county includes the towns of tuxedo and warwick q what do you expect during 2020 in terms of growth and or development are there local projects on the horizon improvements to infrastructure new businesses a we have a real economic opportunity in the production of hemp and cbd products and as senate agriculture chair i applaud the efforts of local leaders like town supervisor michael sweeton who have helped position warwick and the region to capitalize on this opportunity for farmers and local businesses up the value chain recently signed into law i sponsored comprehensive hemp legislation that will enable our regionâ s industry to grow and flourish i have also nominated the town of warwick for a 250 000 grant to purchase specialized equipment for hemp production that can be rented to farmers supporting the local economy and tax base by working together we protect our farms and rural heritage while diversifying the economy q what will be the most important and or critical issue or problem you and the residents of your community will face in the new year what can you do about it a the opioid crisis is taking a devastating toll on families and communities and orange county continues to rank high in opioid related deaths statewide addressing this crisis is a top priority of mine and in the senate we established an opioids task force to identify gaps and needs and develop legislative solutions based on input from numerous hearings over the last six months legislation to improve access to prevention treatment and recovery will be introduced early in this new session one impactful change we can all make is breaking the stigma of addiction and recognizing it for what it is â a disease state sen james skoufis improving the hudson valleyâ s long neglected crumbling infrastructure the 39th state senate district includes the towns of monroe palm tree and woodbury 1 what do you expect during 2020 in terms of growth and or development are there local projects on the horizon improvements to infrastructure new businesses every year since being elected to state government i have focused on the importance of improving the hudson valleyâ s long neglected crumbling infrastructure in 2020 i will be fighting to advance a number of infrastructure projects that will specifically alleviate the congestion caused by overdevelopment occurring in our area residents are desperate for traffic relief and we must act quickly in order to improve our communitiesâ quality of life itâ s essential that any new residential or commercial development is smart growth and well planned which includes improvements to infrastructure and careful consideration of impacts on the environment this year we have an opportunity because the department of transportationâ s five year capital plan will be negotiated therefore time is of the essence to loudly and strongly advocate for infrastructure projects that weâ ve been waiting for in the hudson valley iâ m proud that we were finally able to get the exit 131 interchange upgraded alleviating an area that is all too familiar with unmanageable traffic thereâ s much more to do however some projects that i will be pushing for are â expanding route 17 to three lanes in each way recently i got a commitment from the senate transportation committeeâ s chairman to publicly support this project and fight for it alongside me â repaving route 17m everyone who drives over route 17m knows that it is riddled with potholes and makes what should be an easy commute a stressful one this year iâ ll be pushing for funds for a full repaving of route 17m â train station at woodbury common last year i secured 5 million from the state s railroad fund for a new train station at woodbury common additionally i secured a commitment from the mta to not only support the project but also provide any technical expertise required to move the train station forward iâ ll be fighting through this entire legislative session to continue moving forward on this project between traffic relief and environmental impacts a train station at woodbury common makes a lot of sense and no further expansion at the mall should be allowed without it 2 what will be the most important and or critical issue or problem you and the residents of your community will face in the new year what can you do about it taxes continue to be the utmost priority facing many of my constituents this year while some of our areaâ s very own state representatives unthinkably voted against the property tax cap i led the successful charge to finally make it permanent ensuring we will always at least have a lid on the increases weâ ve capped our taxes but now we must work towards really cutting them because our families retirees and future generations deserve a livable state to call home thatâ s why i will be advocating to deliver more funding to our schools which is important for our studentsâ education but also relieves pressure on local property taxpayers on state income taxes families making under 300 000 will receive a tax cut making sure more money stays in middle class pockets i strongly supported this effort and will keep pushing for this type of targeted relief ultimately my goal is to completely reform the way we fund local services to move away from property taxes entirely and for the first time albany is having substantive discussions about how exactly to do this alongside the senate education committee chairwoman i participated in roundtables with stakeholders in the hudson valley and across the state to review how to update the way new york funds education i was a strong voice during those discussions and will continue to be one as we head into this yearâ s legislative session finally and importantly amidst the backdrop of an increasingly partisan political environment that is toxic for our country i pledge to continue to work with anyone in any party for our communities and always lead with a firm bipartisan foot forward iâ m ever grateful for monroe woodbury constituents affording me the privilege of representing them in the state senate and i wish everyone a successful 2020
kcrg tv9 s mary green sat down with massachusetts senator elizabeth warren before a town hall in dubuque on jan 4 for an extended interview about various issues in the lead up to the 2020 iowa caucuses the following is a transcript of the full interview mary green well senator warren thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today elizabeth warren thank you for having me here mary it s good to see you mg we re about a month out from the iowa caucuses ew we are mg yesterday you released your fourth quarter campaign fundraising numbers it s down slightly from what you raised in the third quarter and right now it is trailing your other three main competitors joe biden pete buttigieg and bernie sanders at the same time over the last couple months you have been dropping slightly nationally in the polls how are you feeling at this point in the race ew you know i feel really good and i ll tell you why i made the decision when i got in this race that i was not going to spend my time at closed door fundraisers i wasn t going to spend my time sucking up to millionaires and billionaires and i was really going to do this grassroots all the way and that s exactly what it s been every dollar i ve raised for this campaign has been somebody who came in basically over the website and put in 5 or 20 in fact a couple days ago i was making calls to thank people i called a lady who had given us 2 she s unemployed but she wants to be part of the fight and that s one of the best parts about being here in iowa able to do these town halls that are face to face i tell a little bit about my story about where i grew up how i ended up in a presidential race but then take as many questions from as many people as we possibly can and that way i know i m talking about the things that are most on people s minds and it s a great privilege to have this opportunity to be in this fight for 2020 for how we make our country work not just for rich people at the top but how we make it work for everyone and i feel like there are a lot of people around iowa a lot of people around america who are ready for that fight mg switching gears a little big of course the big story arguably in the entire world right now is the assassination of qassem soleimani you implied in a series of tweets on friday that you would not have taken the same route that president trump did in authorizing that airstrike had you been president in this moment right now what would you have done in this situation and seeing as what s done is done what do you believe the us needs to do right now ew well let s keep in mind this didn t just happen all on its own when donald trump was elected we were in a negotiated deal with iran and all of our allies in which iran had suspended its nuclear program it was working iran had been certified by international inspectors that they were following the deal and tensions were lower in the middle east now iran still bad actor a lot of problems but the nuclear program had really been stopped and we were working with our allies and iran and then donald trump came in and just tore the deal up even though iran was fulfilling its part broke with our allies and has taken one step after another against iran until now donald trump has taken us to the brink of war he ordered an assassination of a high ranking military officer in the iranian government and that puts our troops it put our diplomatic corps in the region at risk it puts our country at risk and it puts the middle east at risk we ve had 20 years of war in the middle east we don t need more war we need to end the war in the region mg so what do you think the us needs to do now ew i think we need to dial down the tension at this point we need to use our back channels we need to use our allies and we need to back away from the edge of war mg we ll switch gears another time here your campaign estimates that your medicare for all plan will result in an estimated around 20 trillion in more federal spending over a period of a decade at the same time the national debt is now more than 22 trillion and expected to keep rising how do you plan to both accomplish and afford your medicare for all plan while tackling the national debt ew well actually you know if you looked at the plan that my medicare for all plan is completely paid for without raising taxes on middle class families by one penny it s paid for by asking the top 1 to pay a little more it s paid for by asking giant corporations like amazon that reported 10 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes to pay and it s paid for my personal favorite by cracking down on the billionaire tax cheats who are not following the law we can pay for it and think what that means for the economy so part one is that it won t add to the national debt but part two all that money that families are spending right now on healthcare for the average family in america last year it was about 12 000 in premiums and out of pockets and deductibles and co pays and things that aren t covered by their health insurance about 12 000 that s 12 000 people can spend right there in their local town 12 000 they can use as a down payment on a home 12 000 that they can spend in local restaurants or to buy cars 12 000 to build this economy up from the grassroots we do that then we have more people employed we have a stronger economy not trickle down economy where those guys avoid paying taxes but a real economy and that s how we can start paying down our national debt mg so it sounds like then you believe that by putting this plan into place it will address the national debt ew it absolutely does along with the two cent wealth tax which would let us provide universal childcare for every baby in this country and again think what that means mamas who can finish their education mamas and daddies who can take full time jobs and not have to devote an entire paycheck to having the babies taken care of that s money to spend in the local economy that two cent wealth tax also will let us cancel student loan debt for 43 million americans again that s money people can spend for houses and cars and restaurant meals and savings in their local economies you know there s a fundamental question in 2020 how do you think we build an economy going forward for nearly 40 years now we ve done trickle down economics which means cut taxes for those at the top cut regulations for those at the top and if the rich get richer somehow it was going to help everyone else that has completely failed it s time to ask the rich just to pay a fair share on their taxes they do that and we invest it down at the grassroots we build a real economy that works for everyone and it helps put our government on a much sounder financial footing mg at some point in the future there will an impeachment trial in the senate for president trump the date of course has not been set yet but you have said that you will be there for it ew yes mg at this point do you believe that that senate impeachment trial will interfere with your campaigning either here in iowa or in other early states and if so how do you plan to fulfill your senate responsibilities while still reaching out to the voters and the caucus goers ew so i don t know mitch mcconnell has the power and he s the one who will call the shots but i do know that i took an oath to uphold the constitution of the united states and that means that if we have a trial i will there because that is my responsibility i m committed on that mg last thing is if you wouldn t mind just looking at the camera if you want to and make a direct appeal to iowans on why they should caucus for elizabeth warren on feb 3 ew great so i m elizabeth warren and here s what i think is wrong in america right now we ve got a country that works great for those at the top it works great for giant drug companies just not for people trying to get a prescription filled it works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us when you see a government that works great for those with money and it s not working so great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple the influence of money in washington is affecting every decision i have a plan to fight that corruption head on to knock back the influence of money of lobbyists of the revolving door and to make this country work not just for a handful at the top but to make this country work for everyone that s why i m running for president and i hope you ll caucus for me and help make that happen

job seekers wait in line for a job fair june 4 2009 in chicago illinois photo by scott olson getty images right now i am attending meetings hosted by the american economic association in san diego a conference that is basically mecca for academic economists disturbingly there are a lot of sessions on whether we are prepared for the next recession if sessions at the annual convention are leading indicators these are signs of a coming recession in a session featuring former treasury secretary larry summers and former budget officers and deputy secretaries and others i heard some great ideas about what to do next time around summers looking back said the government should have done even more to get the economy out of recession in the late 2000s the unemployment rate kept on increasing and stayed high well after the recession was called off in june 2009 the national unemployment rate peaked in october 2009 at 10 one of the most intriguing ideas in this session came from harvard economists karen dynan and douglas elmendorf their recession plan involves an intriguing mix of payroll tax relief and state level targeting but before we get to that it s worth understanding how payroll tax cuts worked in the last recession cutting taxes temporarily helped save the economy last time there are a lot of policies that work to help bring down the unemployment rate job loss in the last recession would ve been a lot higher without much of what the government did including lowering interest rates investing in stimulus projects and quantitative easing one of the government s tools was to cut the social security tax this 2 percentage point social security payroll tax cut for employees was in effect from 2011 through 2012 the benefits were either capped or phased out at high income levels for some taxpayers the policy cost an estimated 108 billion but applying some basic economic methodology okun s law and the multiplier the payroll tax cut reduced unemployment by an estimated 0 18 percentage points according to the dynan and elmendorf talk the policy worked really fast and it was temporary overnight a substantial share of the working population an estimated 121 million workers had higher paychecks it was viewed as fair if it was viewed at all and since most beneficiaries were not rich they spent more money in the american economy on household mortgages paying the light bill putting gas in the car to go to work etc government tax breaks that go to the rich may help fund italian vacations and french wine but that has a smaller effect than local spending in schools and restaurants but here s the problem in some states the unemployment rate was much worse the unemployment rate was much higher in some of the largest states michigan california florida and illinois had much higher unemployment rates than the rest of the country in michigan the unemployment rate peaked at over 14 the payroll tax cut may have helped but it was a one size fits all approach to economic problems that were often quite local balanced budget rules one of the best insights economists have is that even though we have one currency and one national government we really are a country with lots of little interdependent economies that would be obvious if we all used the dollar but they spoke a different language in the state of washington if we look at the country in terms of states we can look at the country in terms of state economies states are not a perfect way to measure economic groups but for now it s good enough to make a point states can t vary spending to fight recessions each state has a weird rule that the budget has to be balanced every year that means that recessions are much worse than they have to be think about it michigan s economy gets whacked by the recession when car demand falls from 17 million units to 11 million because their citizens have lost their jobs the state has to lay off teachers and cops which means the private sector employees and public sector employees are poor together creative ideas to mitigate the harm of the next recession these state level effects mean the cost reverberates when employment falls in a paper presented saturday morning the harvard economists karen dynan and douglas elmendorf asked if there were any way to help states that are worse off get more targeted stimulus to minimize the hardships that come from unemployment they have an intriguing idea to allow the government temporarily to reduce the payroll tax more in states that have the highest unemployment rates this would be an effective way to deliver some help automatically to states that are worse off without risking a political battle over who gets what the rules of the convention make it not possible for me to post the paper yet harvard economist gabriel chodorow reich suggested another small idea but all these plans add up every household making say under 110 000 a year gets a gift card to go to restaurant a restaurant meal is money that stays in a local economy fiscal policy should have been a lot more creative to minimize the devastating cost of unemployment this is a pretty damn good idea and we re going to need a lot more of them stay tuned
