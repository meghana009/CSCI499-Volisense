the central bank of egypt cbe said that emerging markets ems have slightly witnessed the recovery of capital inflows in january after a long period of absence since february 2018 in its quarterly report on monetary policy the cbe said that the capital flows in the coming period will be linked to three main factors the tightening global financial conditions the economic activity forecast and prospects for more tension in international commercial policies it is expected for egypt s gdp to continue recovering supported by ongoing structural reform despite the possible impacts of such procedures to control the state s general finances the cbe explained that the cut off date for the data included in this report is 10 january 2019 some of the presented data are preliminary or subject to revisions there has been new incoming data since the cut off date including but not limited to the release of the inflation statistics for january and february 2019 furthermore the cbe s monetary policy committee decided to cut the cbe s key policy rates by 100 basis points bps in its meeting held on 14 february and kept policy rates unchanged in its meeting held on 28 march initial conditions global economic as well as trade growth continued to slow down while international oil prices continued to decline and ems witnessed net capital inflows for the first time since january 2018 economic growth of egypt s external environment is estimated to have continued to soften for the second consecutive quarter during the fourth quarter q4 of 2018 registering 2 5 down from 2 7 in the previous quarter and from 3 2 in q4 of 2017 the highest pace since 2011 economic growth in advanced economies is estimated to continue its ease for the fourth consecutive quarter to register 1 5 in q4 of 2018 compared to 1 8 in q3 of 2018 as slower growth in the euro region the united kingdom and japan more than offset a stronger growth in the united states on the other hand economic growth in emerging economies continued to inch up registering 4 8 in q4 of 2018 maintaining continuous improvement between q4 of 2015 and q2 of 2018 higher growth in brazil and russia more than offset slower growth in india and china compared to the previous quarter the cbe noted that headline inflation of egypt s external environment declined slightly in q4 of 2018 for the first time since q1of 2018 registering 2 3 compared to 2 5 in q3 of 2018 inflation in several advanced economies declined to register 2 0 in q4 of 2018 down from 2 2 in q3 of 2018 meanwhile inflation in emerging economies dropped slightly to register 2 9 in q4 of 2018 after accelerating to 3 0 in q3 of 2018 the deceleration of the inflation rate in china brazil and india more than offset the acceleration of the inflation rate in russia compared to the previous quarter meanwhile annual growth of global trade continued to slow down for the fourth consecutive quarter in q3 of 2018 to register 3 6 compared to 3 8 in the previous quarter and down from a peak of 5 3 in q3 of 2017 brent crude oil prices continued to decline to register an average of 7 4 per barrel in december 2018 after peaking at 86 1 a barrel in mid october 2018 and before inching up slightly in january 2019 lower oil prices were mainly driven by a more favourable contribution from the supply side which led major producers to agree on implementing a production cut of 1 2m barrels per day starting january 2019 meanwhile a less favourable contribution from the demand side reflected concerns regarding global economic growth international food prices using domestic consumer price index cpi basket weights of core food items continued to decline on annual terms in december 2018 for the sixth consecutive month however by the weakest magnitude since july 2018 at negative 2 4 the cbe attributed the decline to dairy products oils and red meat as production conditions improved the federal reserve fed raised its policy rate by 25 bps in december 2018 marking the fourth policy rate hike in 2018 and bringing the cumulative changes during 2018 to 1 0 percentage point this comes after raising policy rates by 1 25 percentage points during five meetings between december 2015 and december 2017 the bank of england kept its policy rates unchanged in november 2018 after raising it by 25 bps in august 2018 for the second time since november 2017 the european central bank ecb also kept its policy stance unchanged the three central banks made no changes to their asset purchase programmes since the previous monetary policy report the fed maintained its balance sheet unwinding plan which started in october 2017 slowing down the amount of government debt it reinvests meanwhile the ecb maintained its plan for phasing out its asset purchase programme halving monthly purchases since january 2018 to 15bn until the end of december 2018 capital flight from ems which started in february 2018 reversed slightly in january 2019 the direction of net capital flows into ems remains subject to the pace of tightening global financial conditions the growth outlook as well as the prospects of further escalation of trade tensions improvement of the current account continued to slowdown the cbe explained that after improving for seven consecutive quarters the current account deficit stabilised in q3 of 2018 compared to q3 of the previous year a less favourable contribution from the hydrocarbon trade deficit remittances and net income payments have more than offset the more favourable contribution from net services receipts and the non hydrocarbon trade deficit nevertheless the negative net exports of goods and services continued to narrow in q3 of 2018 on annual terms for the seventh consecutive quarter this was due to a more favourable contribution from exports of goods and services which more than offset the less favourable contribution from imports however the pace of annual improvement in net exports of goods and services continued to slowdown for the fourth consecutive quarter the hydrocarbon trade deficit continued to improve on annual terms in q3 of 2018 for the third consecutive quarter however at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter the improvement was mainly driven by higher exports which more than offset the increase in imports the non hydrocarbon trade deficit continued to widen on annual terms in q3 of 2018 for the fourth consecutive quarter however at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter it explained that this was mainly due to slower growth of imports which more than offset the annual decline in exports for the first time since q2 of 2017 the services surplus continued to increase in q3 of 2018 on annual terms and its contribution to the improvement of the current account deficit rose yet its pace of growth stabilised in q3 of 2018 a more favourable contribution from transportation excluding suez canal tolls net government services as well as net receipts from tourism have offset the less favourable contribution from suez canal tolls and net other services meanwhile the annual improvement of remittances declined in q3 of 2018 to its slowest pace since q3 of 2016 after witnessing an annual increase in q2 of 2018 for the first quarter since q2 of 2017 the growth of net foreign direct investment fdi inflows resumed its decline in q3 of 2018 ss the cbe attributed that to lower gross inflows and stronger gross outflows the decline in gross inflows was due to a less favourable contribution from newly issued capital and the oil and gas sector which more than offset the more favourable contribution from non residents purchases of real estate and net purchases of companies and assets by non residents portfolio flows excluding bonds continued to register a net outflow in q3 of 2018 for the second consecutive quarter amid unfavourable global conditions for ems this however was more than offset by net inflows from net foreign assets of commercial banks gross international reserves declined to 42 6bn in december 2018 from the historic peak of 44 5bn which was registered in the previous month annual real gdp growth softened slightly to 5 3 in q3 of 2018 while the unemployment rate inched up slightly to 10 0 after increasing for six consecutive quarters and stabilising in q2 of 2018 at 5 4 real gdp growth softened slightly to 5 3 the decline in the contribution of investments to the gdp has more than offset the improvement in that of net exports and by a lesser extent consumption meanwhile the unemployment rate inched up slightly to 10 0 in q3 of 2018 after declining for seven consecutive quarters the drop in the contribution of investment was mainly driven by the public sector while investments by the private sector contributed positively the improvement in the contribution of net exports was mainly driven by the decrease in real imports as growth of real exports continued to weaken since q4 of 2017 at the sectorial level the cbe added growth softened mainly due to the construction and the non petroleum manufacturing sectors in addition to small weaknesses in other sectors this has more than offset the improvement in tourism communication and natural gas extractions available leading indicators for the non hydrocarbon sector mostly point to weakening activity in q4 of 2018 the purchasing managers index pmi weakened compared to its average level in q3 of 2018 industrial production contracted on annual terms in october and november 2018 compared to an average expansion in q3 of 2018 suez canal net tonnage grew on annual terms at a slower pace in q4 of 2018 compared to q3 of 2018 on the other hand total car sales grew on average at a faster pace in october and november compared to the average pace registered in q3 of 2018 meanwhile natural gas production increased on annual terms at faster pace during october 2018 compared to the average pace in q3 of 2018 broad money growth continued to decline supported by fiscal consolidation following the fading of the exchange rate revaluation effect in q4 of 2017 annual m2 growth continued to decline to average 14 2 in q4 of 2018 supported by fiscal consolidation according to the cbe in q4 of 2018 the contribution of foreign non bank and external financing continued to decline in line with the reversal of net portfolio inflows due to global factors as well as the absence of eurobond issuances together they have more than offset the increase in domestic bank financing in addition to the decline in m2 growth inflationary pressures were further dampened by the drop of broad money velocity in q3 of 2018 after having increased between q3 of 2017 and q2 of 2018 albeit by a weaker momentum since q1 of 2018 meanwhile following its decline between q2 of 2017 and q1 of 2018 the contribution of claims on the private sector to m2 growth continued to increase in q4 of 2018 for the third consecutive quarter supported by initiatives at preferential interest rates similarly inflation adjusted letters of credit l c claims on the private sector began to witness annual increases since q1 of 2018 after recording annual contractions in 2017 the recovery was especially evident for claims on the private business sector while claims on the household sector recovered by a relatively weaker magnitude furthermore the negative contribution of net foreign assets that are not related to fiscal deficit financing continued to ease since the fading of the exchange rate revaluation effect on the other hand the contribution of net claims on public economic authorities declined slightly and claims on public sector companies roughly stabilised in q4 of 2018 within the components of m2 the currency in circulation cic as a percent of l c deposits in m2 declined slightly in q4 of 2018 for the second consecutive quarter recording a ratio below its long term historical average suggesting lessening currency holding behaviour furthermore despite the slight increase in the annual growth of foreign currency f c deposits in us dollar in q4 of 2018 the composition of private sector deposits continued to be increasingly leaning towards l c leading the dollarization ratio of f c deposits to total deposits in m2 to continue falling moreover the structure of household deposits in l c continued to be dominated by deposits more than three years since may 2018 following one and a half years of dominance by deposits less than three years amid the introduction of one and a half year saving certificates at a higher rate compared to longer term saving certificate rates the reversal of the structure of household deposits is consistent with redemptions of these certificates since may 2018 given their cancellation by public banks in late april 2018 annual growth of the monetary base m0 adjusted by total excess liquidity continued to decline in q4 of 2018 for the fifth consecutive quarter due to the cbe balance sheet operations which lowered excess liquidity growth the money multiplier measured as the ratio between local currency components of broad money and m0 as defined above remained broadly stable for the fifth consecutive quarter in q4 of 2018 following its decline between q3 of 2016 and q3 of 2017 real monetary conditions remained tight real monetary conditions remained tight backed by receding inflationary pressures as well as previous policy rate increases notwithstanding the cumulative 200 bps policy rate cuts in the beginning of 2018 excess liquidity declined in december 2018 for the first time since december 2017 to record an average of egp 717 3bn 13 5 of the gdp during the maintenance period ending in 31 december 2018 however the absorption of excess liquidity over the short term via the seven day deposit auction and overnight deposit facility remained relatively stable recording egp 63 6bn 1 3 of the gdp and 8 9 of excess liquidity since mid february 2018 the effective maturity of liquidity withdrawing operations greater than seven days continued to range between 38 and 69 days since april 2018 compared to 21 days on average between october 2017 and march 2018 thus interbank activity and the interbank yield curve remained relatively stable since april 2018 with interbank rates continuing below the policy rate by around 30 bps yields for l c government securities stayed stable at 15 8 net of tax since october 2018 after continuously rising between may and september 2018 this compares to 13 7 in april 2018 and 14 6 on average in q4 of 2017 before the policy rate cuts by the cbe the impact of rising risk aversion toward demand for em assets has more than offset the impact of the cumulative 200 bps policy rate cuts in february and march 2018 notwithstanding the recovery of demand for l c government securities in january 2019 the weighted average cost of finance remained relatively stable during the first two issuances due to a higher acceptance to required ratio meanwhile egyptian eurobond yields declined somewhat in january 2019 in line with the improvement in the risk premium for ems after it has been increasing during most of 2018 moreover egypt s cds spreads remained relatively low compared to most peers with similar sovereign credit rating furthermore egypt s outlook was raised to positive in august 2018 by moody s while s p upgraded egypt s credit rating in may 2018 in the banking sector rates for new deposits remained relatively stable to record 12 8 on average since april 2018 after declining in response to the cumulative 200 bps cut in february and march 2018 concurrently rates for new loans inched up slightly to 17 3 on average during october and november 2018 after receding to 17 0 in q3 of 2018 the pricing of new deposits declined by 1 3x compared to the cumulative 200 bps policy rate cut mainly driven by strong drops of deposit rates in public sector banks while the pricing of new loans decreased by 0 9x in equity markets real prices continued to be affected by the negative sentiment on ems nevertheless the egx 30 usd index continued to outperform the msci ems index since march 2018 despite its drop since june 2018 at the same time real unit prices remained relatively stable in q4 of 2018 after declining in select districts of cairo s residential real estate sector during q3 of 2018 for the first time since q4 of 2016 the demand continued to shift from the secondary market toward the primary market given more flexible payment plans offered by numerous developers headline inflation target for q4 of 2018 has been achieved annual core inflation continued to record single digits for sixth consecutive month annual headline inflation declined to 12 0 in december 2018 from 15 7 in november 2018 thereby leading average inflation during q4 of 2018 to record 15 1 as a result the inflation target of 13 3 percentage points for q4 of 2018 which was announced in may 2017 has been achieved the deviation from the target mid point was due to supply side factors that are outside the scope of monetary policy annual headline inflation has been affected by fiscal consolidation measures which were impacted by a higher than expected increase of international oil prices furthermore headline inflation was affected by temporary supply shocks in select fresh vegetables in september and october 2018 these factors led inflation to rise to 17 7 in october 2018 from the 25 month low of 11 4 in may 2018 the decline of annual inflation in november and december 2018 reflected the reversal of the temporary supply shocks in select fresh vegetables as well as the containment of underlying inflationary pressures in the meantime annual core inflation continued to register single digits for the sixth consecutive month averaging 8 5 between july and december 2018 the lowest rate in over two years this combined with the decline of annual headline inflation in november and december 2018 led the spread between annual headline and core inflation to narrow significantly after peaking in october 2018 monthly headline inflation was mainly driven by food inflation since august 2018 while non food inflation has been contained reflecting only expected seasonal increase in clothing prices in november 2018 inflation of fresh vegetables was the main contributor to food inflation it was elevated between june and october 2018 due to seasonal effects which were heightened by the indirect effects of the fiscal consolidation measures as well as transitory supply shocks related to potatoes and tomatoes which reversed in november and by a larger extent in december 2018 prices of tomatoes declined for the second consecutive month in december 2018 after recording price increases for four consecutive months also prices of potatoes declined after recording price increases for nine consecutive months simultaneously prices of core food items were largely stable except for poultry and eggs which experienced volatility since july 2018 as well as rice which increased in december 2018 for the third consecutive month the largely stable core food inflation witnessed domestically since august 2018 led to divergence between domestic and international core food price developments international core food inflation recorded its first positive monthly rate in december 2018 after consistently recording negative monthly rates since june 2018 driven mainly by prices of poultry red meat and dairy products this comes after domestic and international core food price developments have been largely consistent in the first half of the year except in june 2018 due to domestic fiscal consolidation measures outlook the cbe stated that policy rates and the inflation outlook remain consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation path this includes achieving the 9 3 percentage points inflation target for q4 of 2020 which was announced in december 2018 down from the 13 3 percentage points inflation target for q4 of 2018 announced in may 2017 which has been successfully achieved declared the cbe real gdp growth is expected to continue recovering benefiting from continued structural reforms despite being affected by potential fiscal consolidation measures it added the cbe explained that the primary fiscal balance is targeted to record a surplus of 2 0 of the gdp in 2018 19 compared to an estimated surplus of 0 1 of the gdp in 2017 18 and a deficit of 1 8 of the gdp in 2016 17 and is targeted to maintain this surplus thereafter meanwhile the overall fiscal deficit is targeted to decline to 8 4 and 7 2 of the gdp in 2018 19 and 2019 20 respectively compared to an expected 9 8 in 2017 18 and 10 9 in 2016 17 and is targeted to continue declining subsequently the outlook for brent crude oil prices incorporated in the domestic inflation outlook remained broadly unchanged following its downward revision yet spot prices remained subject to volatility due to potential supply side factors cost recovery for most fuel products is expected to be reached by mid 2019 and automatic fuel price indexation is expected to be implemented meanwhile international food price forecasts relevant to egypt s consumption basket are expected to be stable during 2019 before increasing in 2020 in addition to international commodity price developments risks surrounding the inflation outlook from the global economy continue to include trade tensions economic growth developments as well as the pace of tightening financial conditions meanwhile domestic risks continue to include the timing and magnitude of potential fiscal consolidation measures and the evolution of inflation expectations it concluded
published monday 15 april 2019 print disqus losing decades too much too fast a 6 trillion 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet mastering private markets living on puerto rico time regular readers may have noticed me slowly losing confidence in the economy your impression is correct and there s a good reason for it as i will explain today the facts have changed so my conclusions are changing too i still think the economy is okay for now i still see recession odds rising considerably in 2020 maybe it will get pushed back another year or two but at some point this growth phase will end either in recession or an extended flat period even flatter than the last decade which says a lot and i still think we are headed toward a global credit crisis i ve dubbed the great reset what s evolved is my judgment on the coming slowdown s severity and duration i think the rest of the world will enter a period something like japan endured following 1990 and is still grappling with today it won t be the end of the world japan is still there but the little growth it s had was due mainly to exports that won t work when every major economy is in the same position describing this decline as japanification may be unfair to japan but it s the best paradigm we have the good news is it will spread slowly the bad news is it will end slowly too i believe we will avoid literal blood in the streets but it will be a challenging time we ll be discussing how to get through it more specifically at the strategic investment conference next month it is now sold out but you can still buy a virtual pass that includes audio and video of almost the whole event click here for information losing decades before i explain why we will follow japan i want to briefly explain how japan got to where it is it was a long slow process that like the proverbial frog in boiling water wasn t fully obvious in real time japan experienced rapid growth following world war ii as the us and others helped rebuild its economy that wasn t all out of generosity the country was geopolitically important as a western bulwark against russia and china we didn t want it to fall under the other side s influence this eventually led to a roaring expansion that culminated in the 1980s japanese asset bubble which popped in the early 1990s there followed what came to be called the lost decade it was really more than a decade as the early 2000s brought only mild recovery gdp shrank wages fell and asset prices dropped or went sideways at best the lost decade had monetary roots namely the 1985 plaza accord that drove the yen higher and inflated the asset bubble the bank of japan tried to pop the bubble with a series of rate hikes beginning in 1989 this chart shows the boj s benchmark rate source tradingeconomics com upon reaching 6 in 1992 the boj began cutting rates and eventually reached zero a few years later since then it has made two short lived tightening attempts shown in the red circles neither worked and that was it no more rate hikes period the boj has now kept its policy rate at or near zero for 20 years making conventional monetary policy essentially irrelevant the boj resorted to increasingly large qe like programs that also had little effect meanwhile the government tried assorted fiscal policies infrastructure projects deregulation tax cuts etc they had little effect too gdp growth has been stuck near zero plus or minus a couple of points so has inflation the only thing that really helped was driving down the yen s exchange rate which successive governments and central bank governors have done enthusiastically which i kind of understand when your only tool is a hammer you treat everything as a nail that said the boj s asset purchases certainly had an effect they more or less bought everything that isn t nailed down including stock etfs and other private assets japan is a prime example of the faux capitalism i described last week all this capital is going into businesses not because they have innovative profit generating ideas but simply because they exist that s how you get zombie companies the result at least so far has been neither boom nor depression japan has its problems but people aren t standing in soup lines the bigger issue is that the population is aging rapidly many say the present situation can t go on indefinitely but there s no exit in sight the bank of japan has bought every bond it can except those the government will create to fund future deficits which is why they are buying stocks not just in japan but in the us as well they are trying to put yen into the system in an effort to generate inflation it simply hasn t worked when you don t have a better answer the default is to do more of the same that s the case in japan europe and soon the us charles hugh smith described it pretty well recently the other dynamic of zombification japanification is past success shackles the power elites to a failed model the greater the past glory the stronger its hold on the national identity and the power elites and so the power elites do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses if lowering interest rates sparked secular growth then the power elites will lower interest rates to zero when that fails to move the needle they lower rates below zero i e negative interest rates when this too fails to move the needle they rig statistics to make it appear that all is well in the immortal words of mr junker when it becomes serious you have to lie and it s now serious all the time do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses is also a good description of federal reserve policy from 2008 through 2016 zero rates having had little effect the fed launched qe and continued it despite the limited success and harmful side effects the european central bank did the same in even larger amounts than the federal reserve also with little effect which brings us to the next point why europe and the us will follow japan too much too fast as noted in the introduction i change when the facts change and in the last few months they did the federal reserve spent 2017 and 2018 trying to exit from its various extraordinary stimulus policies it began raising short term interest rates and reversing the qe program i think it should have done both sooner and not at the same time but both needed to happen in hindsight it now appears the fed tried to do too much too fast which was my point when they started the process either raise rates slowly or reduce the balance sheet but not both at the same time reducing the balance sheet has an effect on effective rates just as actually raising rates does but not as obvious my friend samuel rines calculated that when you include the qe tapering this fed tightening cycle was the most aggressive since paul volcker s draconian rate hikes in the early 1980s they should have started sooner and tightened more gradually for whatever reason they didn t and so the complaints began wall street wasn t happy but more important president trump wasn t pleased with the rate hikes why it surprised him i don t know jerome powell s hawkish bent was no secret when trump made him fed chair whatever the reason the president has made his displeasure with fed policy clear but the real deal breaker may have been the late 2018 market tantrum lenders and borrowers alike grew increasingly and vocally distressed as the yield curve flattened and threatened to invert then this year it did invert at several points along the curve coincident with weakening economic data that was probably the last straw the fed hasn t exactly loosened but there s a good chance it will later this year meanwhile across the pond mario draghi had one foot out the door and until a short while ago had a tightening plan in place that plan is now out the door before draghi is even close to gone so on both sides of the atlantic plans to exit from extraordinarily loose money now look disturbingly like those two little circles in the boj rate chart when it tried to hike and found it could not worse we are also replicating japan s fiscal policy with rapidly growing deficit spending in fact this year we will be exceeding it the japanese deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected to be below 4 while the us is closer to 5 and given the ever widening unfunded liabilities gap the us deficit will grow even larger in the future turning japanese i think we re turning japanese i really think so with a musical nod to the vapors a 6 trillion 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet let me give you the cliffs notes version of how i think the next decade will play out more or less kinda sorta we already see the major developed economies beginning to slow and likely enter a global recession before the end of the year that will drag the us into a recession soon after unless the federal reserve quickly loosens policy enough to prolong the current growth cycle other central banks will respond with lower rates and ever larger rounds of quantitative easing let s look again at a chart courtesy of my friend jim bianco that i showed three weeks ago showing roughly 20 trillion of cumulative central bank balance sheets as of today if i had told you back in 2006 this would happen by 2019 you would have first questioned my sanity and then said no way and even if it did happen you would expect the economic world would be coming to an end well it happened and the world is still here source jim bianco before 2008 no one expected zero rates in the us negative rates for 11 trillion worth of government bonds globally negative rates out of the ecb and the swiss national bank etc things like tarp qe and zirp were nowhere on the radar just months before they happened numerous times markets closed on friday only to open in a whole new world on monday in the next crisis central banks and governments in an effort to be seen to be doing something will again resort to heretofore unprecedented balance sheet expansions and it will have less effect than they want those reserves will simply pile up on the balance sheets of commercial banks which will put them right back into reserves at their respective central banks during the worldwide recession there will be few qualified borrowers but a great demand for liquidity as corporate debt goes from investment grade to junk seemingly en masse which will disqualify them from being bought by pensions insurance companies and many other purchasers normally looking for yield the inverted yield curve is a classic sign that the central bank in this case the federal reserve has tightened monetary conditions too much which is why trump wants the fed to lower rates now plus he doesn t want a recession in an election year and powell and the fed turned so dovish i will admit the fed s 4 trillion balance sheet expansion surprised me at the time fool me once shame on you we ve now seen the new playbook at a minimum they will keep the balance sheet at its present barely diminished size and eventually add a lot more when we go into recession i think 10 trillion is almost a sure thing by the mid 2020s by which point we will have been through our second recession why because we will see a new government at some point that raises taxes enough to actually send a still weak economy into another recession that s pure speculation on my part but is what i foresee what assets will the fed buy under current law that s pretty predictable treasury securities and a few other government backed issues like certain mortgage bonds that s all the law allows but laws can change and i think there is a real chance they will regardless of which party holds the white house and congress in a crisis people act in previously unthinkable ways think 2008 2009 they will think the unthinkable in the next crisis and try everything including the kitchen sink but it will just increase government debt and as lacy hunt has shown us from numerous sources in the academic literature and i ve tried to explain that debt will be a drag on future growth another reason to expect a 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet is that us government debt will be north of 30 trillion on top of that in the next five years the credit markets have to fund 5 trillion of corporate debt rollovers plus new debt plus state and local debt it won t be coming from outside the us and there is only so much that banks and big pension funds and individuals can do unless the federal reserve steps in interest rates will soar and the crisis will become much worse it will have little choice but to step in and buy us government debt yes i know this is a self fulfilling prophecy and it has to end but the question is when we re already seeing serious analysts say it really doesn t have to end this from none other than goldman sachs daan struyven and david mericle economists at goldman sachs said the example of japan could prove instructive as the world s third largest economy had not suffered a debt crisis even though it arguably has the most public debt as a share of its gdp in the world japan s government debt to gdp ratio sits at 236 in 2017 more than double that of the us which stands at 108 according to the international monetary fund source marketwatch i could spend the entire letter giving you quotes like that from mainstream economists note you can quibble with the exact numbers but in any case the bank of japan holds at least 100 of japanese gdp in debt plus an enormous amount of japanese stocks not to mention global stocks the federal reserve holds roughly 35 give or take of us government debt can we even imagine the federal reserve at some point holding 20 trillion of us government debt i don t think the japanese imagined that 20 years ago i keep saying we have to think the unthinkable as we plan for our futures because i can guarantee you that future leaders will when there is a true crisis they whoever they may be will be looking for action and do nothing will not be an option maybe it should be but that is a metaphysical argument for another day they will do something quantitative easing is now on the table and i think will be almost a reflexive move during the next recession crisis so will we have japan like flat markets and low growth for years on end will we create a demographic crisis by limiting immigration public pensions and insurers are already struggling to meet obligations after years of low rates those betting on 7 returns and many are won t make anything close to that this will make government debt and state local pension fund obligations a massive problem that the federal reserve and the us government right now are not politically or legally capable of handling will we change the rules in the future tell me who s going to be in charge during that crisis and then let s ask the question but will it play out over a longer period of time than we might think now almost surely yet the world will not end and for those paying attention will be a better world stay tuned and stay with me mastering private markets i recently did a podcast for my friends at smh interviewing fellow rice graduate mike novelli about his real estate investing experiences over the last 20 years i learned a lot and think you will find it interesting too income producing real estate will have value in almost any future monetary environment simply click here give us a little information about who you are and you can either listen or read the transcript please note that i am president and a registered representative of mauldin securities llc member finra and sipc let me know what you think too if you like it i will gladly do more living on puerto rico time shane and i will have 10 days on puerto rico time until i travel back to dallas to see the dentist then to cleveland to see the eye doctor then to chicago to do a speech for brian lockhart and my

in the big picture we argue that the dollar s appreciation is part of the third significant dollar rally since the end of bretton woods the first was the reagan volcker dollar rally spurred by a policy mix of tight monetary and loose fiscal policies the rally ended with g7 intervention to knock it down in september 1985 after a ten year bear market a second dollar rally took place it can be linked to the tech bubble and the shift to a strong dollar policy the carving out of the internet drew capital into the us and induced americans to keep their savings here it may or may not have been sufficient to fuel a multi year dollar advance rubin replaced bentsen at the helm of treasury and nearly immediately articulated a shift in policy no longer would the us use the dollar as a trade weapon as previous administrations and officials did the us would not engineer a weaker dollar to reduce its debt burden this is the essence of the strong dollar policy the us first unilaterally disarmed and then succeeded in convincing the g7 and g20 that de weaponizing the foreign exchange market was the best practice however old habits die hard during the clinton dollar rally the euro was born and immediately depreciated it fell from around 1 19 to below 0 85 they cried quit picking on our euro though the market was really accumulating us assets in october 2000 after summers replaced rubin and at the request of europe there was coordinated intervention to buy the euro and sell the dollar the official action and the popping of the tech bubble marked the end of the clinton dollar rally the greenback went into another multi year bear market the obama dollar rally began from extreme levels in 2008 the euro reached 1 60 sterling was above 2 00 the australian dollar was near 1 00 and the canadian dollar was above parity in the face of the great financial crisis and despite the slowness to recognize the magnitude of the problem the us acted relatively early and relatively aggressively this unleashed the key fuel for the obama dollar rally divergence the us economy recovered sooner and stronger than most of the other major centers europe was hit not only by the financial shock that emanated from the us and their bank exposures but it paralyzed the relationship between creditors and debtors in europe the european phase of the crisis began in greece and despite the geography lessons by various officials every debtor country became greece japan already had very low interest rates before the great financial crisis the yen s role as a financing currency gave it the appearance of a safe haven when its strength largely a function of short covering retail investors mostly focus on the appreciation of the asset they buy institutional investors also seek to lower their funding costs and borrowing the low yielding yen to finance equity or bond purchases is a common tactic by leveraged accounts leave aside the japanese investors themselves japanese officials seemed to dawdle until abe was elected and kuroda became the governor of the bank of japan the second phase of the obama dollar rally began with the election of trump in 2016 both leading candidate in the presidential election promise fiscal expansion the federal reserve had begun the gradual process toward policy normalization the combination of expanding fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy was a repeat though on a smaller scale of the reagan volcker policy mix with the fiscal stimulus winding down the dollar may enter the third phase of its super cycle a return to divergence recall that the global slowdown began in h2 18 but the fiscal stimulus that is saddling the us with more a trillion dollar a year deficit helped mitigate the pressure it grew at an average pace of 3 8 in the middle two quarters last year the german and japanese contracted in q3 and q4 was only a little better the italian economy contracted in both quarters the european central bank s policy response has to been to push out its commitment not to raise interest rates and prepare for a new long term loan facility tltro iii the bank of japan unlike the ecb continues to buy a range of assets including corporate bonds and equities abe has appointed a couple of members to the boj board that dissent in favor of new measures to reach in the inflation target but there seems to be little appetite for more asset purchases or deeper negative interest rates pressure is building to postpone again the sales tax increase that is to kick in october 1 the government has already enacted measures that are hoped to offset the economic impact of the tax increase abe campaigned for his third term last year backing the tax increase over opposition that wanted to abolish it entirely the us economy began the year on soft footing it appeared to have nearly stagnated the atlanta fed s gdp tracker started the quarter with a sub 0 5 projection it now stands at 2 3 a touch above q4 18 s 2 2 pace this is a little above what most fed official see as the long term non inflationary pace the high frequency data in the coming days should depict an economy that is on the mend a return to the status quo ante the pre stimulus pace of growth the us average quarterly growth annualized in 2017 of 2 5 and 1 9 in 2016 manufacturing output likely increased for the first time this year the broader measure of industrial production may have also accelerated the american consumer likely made up for lost time retail sales fell at an annualized rate of about 4 5 the december through february period march retail sales rose by 0 9 according to the median forecast in the bloomberg survey the components used for gdp calculations are expected to rise by 0 5 after falling 0 2 in february the leading economic indicator averaged 0 5 in q3 18 and fell to 0 1 in the fourth quarter it may have risen by 0 4 in march which would be the strongest since last september it lends credence to our hypothesis that the economy did hit a soft patch but it is resilient and is already emerging the most important data point from the euro area will be the flash april pmi on april 18 recall that in march france s manufacturing and service pmi were below the 50 boom bust level the german manufacturing pmi was below 50 a small to modest improvement is unlikely to change the ecb s assessment that risks to its outlook remain on the downside three headwinds impacting the us have lifted the drop in equities has been reversed and bond prices are higher the government re opened and the weather is less extreme europe is not as fortunate its headwinds have barely lifted the uncertainties over brexit continue the disruption from turkey has not been fully absorbed policy initiatives seem frozen ahead of european parliament election at the end of next month the us announced 11 bln in tariffs on european goods for subsidies to airbus that the wto ruled illegal this was a shot across the bow and warns of difficult trade talks that lie ahead the us continues to threaten 25 tariffs on auto imports which would be a significant blow especially at a time when european industry is already challenged japan moves into the spotlight next week as the bilateral trade talks with the us formally begin in washington prime minister abe is expected to visit the us later this month before trump visits tokyo next month and meets the new emperor by pulling out of the trans pacific partnership trump has the us playing catch up other agriculture surplus countries like canada and australia have better access to the japanese market now the us is defending a little more than a 20 market share of japan s agriculture imports japan cannot give the us better terms than it conceded in tpp negotiations which ironically the us played an important role japan enjoys around a 65 bln trade merchandise surplus with the us the us runs a chronic surplus in services with japan it is almost 15 the us is fond of citing the merchandise imbalance while forgetting the service surplus tariffs on autos and auto parts like the us threatens would be a shock for an economy that seems to be barely growing us japan talks could have two parts the first is to pick the low hanging fruit like granting the us the same terms as the tpp this would give trump a success while not distracting japan ahead of the upper house election in july and the g20 meeting its hosts for the first time in late june
trump s easy to win trade war drags on despite intensive efforts to make a deal the us china trade war began in july 2018 with the imposition of tariffs on chinese imports by president trump s government and immediate tit for tat retaliation by china this is the biggest trade war since the 1930s and is increasingly taking its toll on the global economy imf chief christine lagarde reflecting the fears of global capitalism recently warned that 70 percent of the world economy is expected to see a slowdown in growth over the next two years urging governments not to aggravate matters with the self inflicted damage of trade wars currently the chinese and us governments are locked in negotiations which are widely expected to produce a deal socialist magazine asked vincent kolo of marxist website chinaworker info to explain the impact of the conflict and the likely outcome of the trade talks will the us and chinese governments reach a deal to end their trade war a deal is the most likely but the real question is what kind of deal i think it will be a largely cosmetic deal with elements that allow both sides to save some face rather than leading to significant changes in the economic relationship between the us and china it won t live up to trump s rhetoric about a historic and epic deal and in particular it won t result in fundamental structural changes in china s economy which is what the anti china hawks in the us ruling class are demanding the trick that trump s team are trying to pull off in the negotiations and a major reason they are dragging on for so long they ve now had nine rounds of talks is to squeeze enough concessions out of china so that it looks like fundamental changes have been agreed without this trump will face a lynch mob from within his own party and from the democrats who ll accuse him of a sell out over china xi jinping s bottom line is that china s state capitalist economic model is untouchable beyond this beijing can take a flexible approach as has been shown over the type and scope of concessions it offers but a deal won t touch on the real roots of this conflict which is a battle for economic and great power pre eminence will china or the us be number one that struggle is not going to be negotiated out of existence that s not how capitalism and imperialism work there can be a deal which for political reasons both sides will proclaim as a great victory but in reality it will be a kind of ceasefire with the economic conflict shifting from tariffs and trade into other actually more decisive fields such as technology investments and geopolitics we re already seeing a tug of war between the us and china but also the eu india russia and japan over china s belt and road initiative bri the biggest global infrastructure project in history trump and his negotiators are under pressure to get a deal but the chinese regime is also under pressure yes but even at this stage with both sides pushing hard for a deal we can t rule out that there won t be a deal however what s pushing them towards a deal is the faltering global economy and the political risks associated with a recession which would completely blow trump s re election hopes but could be even more costly for xi jinping we re talking about unprecedented mass unrest in china in the event of the first recession in living memory both sides dread the prospect of fresh stock market turmoil which erased 13 trillion us dollars from global markets last year around half of that in the us hence the stream of reassuring statements about the talks going very well and making progress all designed to boost stock prices and keep the momentum going for more talks this is an indication of how much more financialised capitalism has become much greater even than in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis because the policies followed by governments and central banks since then have had a much bigger impact on stock markets than on the real economy in the short term the economic confidence of the capitalists has been restored but this rests on precarious foundations a new stock market crash could by itself plunge the world economy into recession because the stock markets have become too big to fail something of a contradiction in terms trump s position has changed since the trade war began has he gone soft on china he s had to pull back at least partly from a disaster of his own making in july when trump imposed the first set of tariffs against china he bragged trade wars are easy to win the tone from washington was very aggressive and provocative now the us economy is hurting just as much as china s the us trade deficit initially the issue trump went to war over grew to an all time high last year us 891 3 billion with the whole world and a record us 419 2 billion with china an increase of 11 6 percent from the year before these figures are a spectacular refutation of trump s easy to win bravado at the outset trump s administration imagined they could achieve quick results they slapped an even bigger set of tariffs in september and trump threatened that if beijing retaliated he d double down extending tariffs to everything china exports to the us this extravagant approach was heavily influenced by the us midterms with trump wanting to show he was a tough president since then he s been outflanked by politicians on all sides of congress who ve jumped on the anti china bandwagon this is now complicating the government s attempts to de escalate the conflict while xi realises he may have to deal with an even more hardline us regime in the future another factor pushing beijing to make a deal now the increasing economic toll and the risk things will get much worse in 2019 forced trump to hit the pause button at his december meeting with xi jinping in buenos aires this meant keeping the original tariffs in place but postponing the increases set to take effect on 1 january this delay has since been further extended as the talks drag on the original deadline for a deal which trump laid down in argentina was 1 march the latest reports suggest the talks can go on for weeks possibly until the osaka g20 summit at the end of june clearly the two sides are not as close as they want people to think but they are also under pressure to de escalate without losing face this last point is what s mainly causing the negotiations to drag out what strategy has the chinese regime followed in the trade war initially beijing was wrong footed by the tariffs they thought they could avoid this by offering limited concessions basically to buy more from the us especially energy and farm produce they looked at the issue mainly as an economic problem and underestimated the political dimensions on the us side trump s need to show a tough hand xi s regime underestimated how far trump was prepared to go and the support he had for confronting china a year ago xi had consolidated his dictatorship and abolished term limits on his rule increasing state repression to unprecedented levels there was overconfidence within the ruling group a domestic backlash against xi s authoritarianism was then able to draw some encouragement from the trade war not in terms of any pro us sentiment but rather a feeling of satisfaction that the regime s all powerful image had taken a knock xi had clearly miscalculated on how to manage relations with the us china s single biggest foreign policy issue another miscalculation was that xi s people thought they could count on pressure from wall street and china s friends within us finance capital to avert a trade war us multinationals have been a powerful lobby for greater economic ties with china over several decades but last year we saw a decisive shift it was something that took the chinese regime by surprise wall street which has made mega profits from china and us led globalisation policies in china has increasingly adapted to the trumpian doctrine of demanding more radical concessions and punishing china s alleged economic cheating this is part of a wider strategic shift within the us ruling class of which the trade war is just one symptom towards a fundamentally confrontational approach to prevent china from usurping the dominant position of us imperialism we saw this with a recent speech by jamie dimon ceo of j p morgan chase the largest us bank he said it was absolutely right for the us to enter a trade war with china saying we re better off dealing with it now whatever that means for the economy when a us banker is saying this it s clear there s been a major shake up in the outlook of the ruling class but the nature of this conflict is long term with no easy wins à la trump xi s regime are now in no doubt that the ground has shifted in the us china relationship that it s not just a question of an unpredictable us president but rather a historic turning point with the engagement policies of the past 40 years giving way to open strategic rivalry beijing s counterstrategy is shifting accordingly the concessions china s negotiators are offering in the latest talks are more substantial than one year ago but the difference is not huge the chinese side have a bottom line in terms of what they are prepared to concede beyond which they won t go they know there is big pressure on trump not to abandon the talks this ironically explains why trump walked out of his talks in vietnam with north korea s dictator kim jong un the two sets of talks are superficially unrelated but actually trump s korean denuclearisation strategy has always ultimately been about increasing the pressure on china and the struggle for political and military hegemony in the asia pacific trump s walkout was partly to pressure kim over too little progress but was also a warning to beijing that the us side is also prepared to walk away from a trade deal unless more concessions are made what are the remaining obstacles to a deal the most significant development so far is the agreement that both sides will set up enforcement offices to make sure they each honour the terms of the deal this issue was a potential deal breaker because trump s team need to show their deal is different and china will be held to account meanwhile china s negotiators would not agree to any one sided enforcement mechanism as first proposed by the us side or the idea of current us tariffs remaining in place to ensure chinese compliance either of those alternatives would have been politically unacceptable to china leaving xi s regime open to charges it had accepted interference in china s internal affairs and reviving memories of the unequal treaties of pre revolutionary china but the proposed enforcement offices seem to be a façade that may look impressive but won t make much difference in concrete terms as it stands both governments can impose tariffs against the other even if these are in breach of wto rules which is the case with trump s current tariffs in fact the whole deal that is emerging will probably be in breach of wto rules because the deal is about managed trade rather than free trade which also shows the wto is a dying force the creation of us and chinese enforcement offices is an act of showmanship on one hand to convince sceptics in the us congress that the deal has teeth and to remove the stigma on the chinese side of accepting anything that isn t mutual and reciprocal there are other potential obstacles to a deal the us side has reportedly drawn up 150 pages of agreements to be signed including detailed agreements in six contentious areas forced technology transfer and cyber theft intellectual property rights services currency agriculture and non tariff barriers on currency for example there are reports the chinese side has agreed not to use devaluation to counteract the effect of tariffs and to give more information to the us about its currency policies but actually this is in line with beijing s own interests which are to broadly maintain the current exchange rate beijing is far more concerned at this stage about yuan depreciation triggering capital flight than the upside of this which would be increased exports likewise in agriculture the chinese side has promised huge additional purchases of us farm goods as part of a trade deal more politically sensitive and state media have begun preparing domestic opinion for this trump s people are demanding a lowering of chinese farm tariffs which potentially could be a heavy blow for many of china s poor farmers beijing will surely announce subsidies and other support measures to cushion the impact of this concession but it conforms to a wider pattern with china s concessions falling broadly into two categories they are either things the chinese regime can afford buying more soybeans and oil from the us will cost countries like brazil and iran more than it costs beijing or they are rather vague commitments to reform that can be haggled over and dragged out that s of course a well honed tactic of the chinese regime but xi s regime won t sacrifice core areas which are anything vital to their state capitalist economic model such as state subsidies protection of key state monopolies and creation of national champions this is not primarily an economic but a political question xi who represents the billionaire princelings within the chinese regime state and economy is fully aware that the regime s future as a one party dictatorship rests on its ability to bend the economy with the police club to use leon trotsky s term to the needs of regime survival and not become a hostage of the market as is the case with western capitalist regimes and politically the chinese side won t sign up for any deal that makes it look like they caved to us pressure they can dress up many of their trade concessions as reforms that while corresponding with us demands actually came from within china what affect will a us china deal have on the world economy and will it mean an end to confrontation on the economy it could give a temporary boost mainly in terms of financial froth a new surge on stock markets but even that s not a certainty markets which have soared since the start of the year have largely priced in a us china deal a breakdown in the talks on the other hand could unleash havoc for the real economy it s debateable what a deal would mean the us china and other major economies are all slowing in 2019 parts of europe are in outright recession the chinese regime s new stimulus measures the biggest tax cuts in ten years and an explosion of new debt are having some effect a partial steadying of the economy but the effects get smaller and smaller every time with beijing s stimulus while the debt problem gets bigger companies that began relocating their production out of china even before trump s tariffs are likely to continue doing so unless the deal is much stronger than we expect it won t coax these companies back to china because the uncertainties mean they want to hedge moving factories to vietnam and other parts of asia but almost in no case back to the us on the us china relationship a trade deal won t represent a re set or a return to the pre 2018 situation that s gone forever instead as economist stephen roach says what is posed is a protracted struggle what he called cold war 2 0 roach also argued that the us economy is in far worse shape due to higher debt levels and slower growth to wage a cold war today than it was in the period 1947 to 1991 another crucial difference is that in the previous cold war between a capitalist us and stalinist ussr the latter s state owned and bureaucratically mis managed economy was far less integrated into the global economy than china s state capitalist economy is today china is the largest trading partner for 124 countries compared to 76 for the us there are 120 chinese companies in the fortune 500 just behind the us with 126 and well ahead of japan with 52 in third place conflicts over the bri huawei and 5g technology especially the south china sea and other territorial disputes are all likely to worsen the global times recognised this when it recently warned it is a bad idea to assume that the two sides can sort out their trade matters and then to focus on fierce political and security rivalry but in reality this is the most probable outcome what is the socialist alternative to the trade war and economic nationalism the events of the past year the escalating conflict between the us and china but also tensions with the eu and other major powers are symptoms of a chronic condition afflicting global capitalism the system cannot shake itself free from the crisis that began more than ten years ago governments fear mass upheavals as we are again seeing in the arab world with the uprisings in algeria and sudan against brutal dictatorships the capitalists are increasingly forced to look for national solutions variants of trump s america first doctrine capitalist globalisation with its mega profits for the billionaires has given way to slowbalisation as the economist magazine called it with each capitalist government protecting their own companies and markets and resorting to economic and geopolitical bullying in the sphere of international relations from 1987 to 2007 world trade averaged 7 percent growth every year but this slowed to just 3 percent from 2008 to 2014 and has slowed further since then for the working class both these phases of capitalist development pre and post 2008 have resulted in greater exploitation and poverty economic environmental and even military disasters the workers movement needs an independent approach refusing to line up behind the economic nationalism of right wing politicians like trump or the neo liberal globalisation policies of liberals but instead demanding policies that strengthen workers rights jobs and the ability to organise freely we fight for the nationalisation under workers control and management of companies that threaten to relocate close or outsource production blaming foreign competition organisational links need to be built between unions and workers organisations internationally unions in the us and other countries should demand trade union rights in china while also fighting to democratise their own unions and turn them into fighting organisations international solidarity is needed to support chinese workers against the chinese regime s ban on independent unions and the right to strike this is the socialist alternative to stand independently of the capitalists but in united struggle with the working class everywhere rejecting all capitalist solutions and fighting instead for democratic public ownership and control of the major companies to facilitate democratic planning and socialist trade policies this is how to prevent the working class being divided by nationalism and politicians like trump and xi which would be the road to defeat
over the past year the treasures of the afghan national museum were on exhibition in major cities in china the visitors for the exhibition were crowded and the event was unprecedented people were shocked and impressed by the glorious civilization of ancient afghanistan the time span of these cultural relics was from the 2nd century bc to the 12th century ad according to archaeological discoveries and chinese ancient books afghanistan was the center of commodity distribution in the eurasian continent at that period during which the afghan people were rich well organized and relatively peaceful so when the chinese envoy zhang qiang invited the then afghan king to jointly fight against their common rivals the afghan side said they had no intention of fighting anymore and would like to enjoy their peaceful lives over more than 1 500 years since the 1st century ad afghanistan had been the pearl of the ancient silk road many historians pointed out that the fate of afghanistan and many asian countries were closely related to the rise and fall of the silk road this is also supported by economic theory the british philosopher francis bacon has a famous saying there be three things which make a nation great and prosperous a fertile soil busy workshops easy conveyance for men and goods from place to place he pointed out three major elements of a country s economic surge agriculture industry and transportation a strong and stable country cannot live without its own agriculture as foundation the rice bowl must be firmly held in its own hands the farmers must be rich and have extra grain for sale the spared labor could make living in other ways this is the primary source of capitals and manpower needed for urban economic and industrialization both afghanistan and china were agricultural powers in their early stage and our agricultural tools and irrigation system were the most advanced across the world the main products china exported to afghanistan were silk and tea the most important products china imported from afghanistan and central asian countries were war horse these commodities were all agricultural and livestock products the state organized water projects supported farming protected the small peasant economy and regulated food prices to balance the interests of farmers and urban strata such national governance was always strong and delicate without agriculture there would be no political stability of the big powers without sustainable trade there will be no silk road and the prosperity of countries along the silk road talking to the industry there is a chinese proverb without industry you could not be rich in not only the ancient but also the present silk road the best selling and most profitable commodities were often not the agricultural products and raw materials but fine processed products and industrial products in ancient times it was chinese silk porcelain and afghan glaze at present it s mobile phones and airplanes the price for one iphone 7 smart phone is 650 equivalent to an afghan farmer s annual income the chinese makes only 8 46 by assembling the phone japan and south korea get 68 and 17 each through specialized materials and designs about 283 goes directly into apple s pocket because of their monopolized patents technology and sales channels this is the harsh reality of modern industry and its benefit distribution a boeing plane costs an average of 100 million u s dollars equivalent to 120 thousand afghan farmers annual income equivalent to 10 million shirts made by the chinese this is what president ghani called the scissors gap caused by the position gap in the global value chain finally let s talk about transportation generally speaking if agricultural products are carried by people and livestock as long as the distance exceeds 100 kilometers the transportation cost will often exceed its own value and the products will not be competitive the land transportation of the ancient silk road mainly relied on camels and horses a camel could carry 200 kilograms of goods to 1000 miles away but its own and human consumption often surpasses the half value of the goods shipping is different a 1000 ton sailing boat can carry as much as 5000 camels at a cost of only a dozen dollars per ton this is also an important background for the fading of silk roads on land after the age of european navigation even today the disadvantage of land transportation is obvious compared with that of sea transportation the distance from kabul to urumqi is 3000 kilometer away but the transport of a standard container requiring road rail transportation which costs a total of 7100 u s dollars while a container shipped from karachi to tianjin with a distance of thousands of miles away costs only 1000 u s dollars but if the container was transported to china from kabul via karachi the total cost will increase to 6000 u s dollars with the land transportation costs and transfer costs in karachi included a container costs will be more than 10 thousand u s dollars if you add the 6000 to 7000 u s dollars transportation fee to an average tax of 3000 u s dollars depending on the type of goods this will exceed the value of many goods which is the main reason for why many afghan specialties cannot be exported and competes with other countries and leave the farmers live in poverty it should also be noted although it was very difficult for marco polo to travel from venice through afghanistan to china but at that time the whole silk route was ruled by the mongolian empire the businessmen can travel without passports and visas or too much tax and were even provided with food accommodation and security so marco polo s team is profitable since modern times the costs for customs clearance transition and security among european and asian counties have remained high which has greatly affected the afghan economy afghanistan is a landlocked country without sea ports from the perspective of factor endowment and economic development stage if afghanistan cannot develop its advanced manufacturing and financial industries as switzerland and luxembourg nor has enough residence deposit or foreign investment it must accumulate capitals from its own agriculture mining handicrafts tourism and transit trade and gradually realize its industrialization and modernization this is why it is important imperative and urgent for afghanistan to participate in regional economic cooperation the glory of afghanistan in the ancient silk road relies on its own distinctive products national peace adherence to openness promoting the connectivity and good relations with its neighbors afghanistan can get illusion from the history i believe afghanistan s efforts in advocating recca participating in carec and saac promoting casa 1000 and tapi lapis lazuli corridor and air corridor are all based the on past achievements and lessons and reflects the ancient silk road spirit of opening up to the future commitment of shaping comparative advantages smooth flow of trade and reduction of transportation costs today there is an initiative or mechanism that can help afghanistan achieve the goal of fully participating in regional economic cooperation develop its country from landlocked into land linked and from the economic lowland to highland promote its agriculture industry and trade this is the bri early this year dr mariam safi founder and executive director of afghan think tank drops published her research report integrating afghanistan into the bri review analysis and prospects it is the first report by an afghan scholar that systematically focuses on the bri dr safi said that afghan people from all walks of life appreciated the china s invitation to jointly build the bri while the afghan situation is still not peaceful the move gave afghanistan a cardio tonic it is aligned with the fundamental interests of afghanistan and its people and will be conducive to afghanistan s fully tapping its development potentials and regain the glories as the heart of asia eurasian crossroads and a trade hub along the silk road the bri is a general term of silk road economic belt and 21st century maritime silk road which were announced by chinese president xi jinping during his respective visits to kazakhstan and indonesia in 2013 the bri also got the support from h e president ghani and all folks of afghan people presently it is the warmest project for people s well being the largest blue print for infrastructure the best development plan and the most sincere idea for international cooperation in the world this magnificent initiative may be briefly summarized from number 1 to number 8 1 jointly build one community of shared future the community is different from european union which is characterized by transfer of sovereignty and high level institutionalization but is based on respect for sovereignty of countries uphold the principles of openness equality and a step by step approach and accommodate each others comfort level in order to achieve regional integration lasting peace and development 2 take asian and european continents and their adjacent seas as the core land and sea as the two wings and plug two wings for the asia garuda 3 uphold the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration achieve the objective of high quality high standard and high level the bri was proposed but not led by china the relationship of its participants is equal development partnership rather than donor and recipient it is totally different from the marshall plan in nature 4 the bri will directly benefit 4 billion people in eurasia over 140 countries have announced the participation or support to the initiative these countries include not only developing countries such as tajikistan nepal kenya but also developed ones such as italy germany and france on april 9th china and eu leaders published the joint statement and all agreed to seek greater synergy between the bri and the eu development plans including the eu strategy on connecting europe and asia the trans european transport networks 5 to promote policy coordination infrastructure connectivity unimpeded trade financial integration and people to people bonds are the five major goals of the bri 6 the bri will focus on developing six economic corridors and six pathways six economic corridors include china central asia west asia new eurasian land bridge china mongolia russia china indochina peninsula china pakistan and bangladesh china india myanmar economic corridors six pathways means railway highway waterway airway pipeline and information express way 7 the bri mainly covers 7 plates northeast asia southeast asia south asia central asia west asia and north africa russia and europe other areas the bri is open to all sharing similar goals it mainly focuses on the eurasian continent yet is not limited to the area of the ancient silk road and eurasian countries 8 facilities connectivity industrialization exploration of energy sources economic and trade cooperation financial cooperation cultural exchanges eco environment protection and maritime cooperation are 8 priority areas for implementing the bri why does china initiate the bri there are various speculations outside some say that this is china s geopolitical strategy to counter us asia pacific re balance strategy or indo pacific strategy and promote its excessive capacity in fact all those concerns are unnecessary the bri is neither a trap nor a tip or tactics it s a team work and also indeed a test to the major country diplomacy with chinese characteristics there are at least four reasons for china s proposal of the bri first in order to realize more balanced comprehensive and higher quality development china needs to develop its west give full play to the advantages of west change the situation that economic development heavily relies on the performance of eastern coastal cities and promote land and marine development in a coordinated way and all round opening up second under the backdrop of sluggish world economy and trade and increased economic pressure in asia many research institutions have lowered their growth forecasts since the beginning of this year at this time it particularly requires effective investment infrastructure financing and supply side reforms to stimulate economic growth third the economic sunken situation in the asia inland and the hinterland of central asia should be changed as we can see from the satellite photo taken at night the brightly lit places that is the economically developed cities are mostly located in the coastal areas of eurasia which is subject to both economic rules and colonialism now we should work to make every corners of eurasia developed and central asia become the new growth engine the international economic authority had a data analysis indicating that the center of the world economy was near afghanistan around ad 1600 thereafter gradually shifted westward to the atlantic ocean and turned back to the east around 1950 when people s republic of china was founded and king zahir shah was in power is now accelerating the shift to the east and approaching afghanistan soon chance favors only the prepared mind i hope we can jointly grasp this historical trend fourth the world now really needs multilateralism free trade and great power responsibilities as well as direction confidence and certainty it s really necessary to eliminate terrorism and extremism from the source that is a lasting and dignified peace reducing poverty and increasing employment these are urgent needs of afghanistan and it is precisely the initial intention of the bri in the past five years since the launch of the bri the volume of trade in goods between china and the relevant countries has exceeded 5 trillion us dollars with an annual growth rate of 1 1 against the backdrop of world trade decline and negative growth chinese direct investments in those countries have exceeded 70 billion dollars with an annual growth of 7 2 the 82 economic and trade cooperation zones constructed by china all over the world have paid over 2 billion us dollars in taxes and fees to the host countries and created more than 300 000 local jobs let me give you a few examples of neighboring countries that are familiar to afghan friends first benefiting from the bri with the help of the chinese government and enterprises tajikistan has achieved the unification of the national road network and the power grid the road tunnel railway and natural gas pipeline projects undertaken by the chinese side either successfully completed or rapidly pushing forward the dushanbe no 2 thermal power station aided by the chinese government has met the needs of more than 700 000 residents in the capital dushanbe and surrounding areas for winter power supply and heating the bilateral trade volume between china and tajikistan increased from 2 75 million u s dollars in 1992 to 1 5 billion u s dollars in 2018 at present there are more than 400 chinese funded enterprises investing in tajikistan becoming the largest taxpayer in tajikistan china and tajikistan signed a local currency swap agreement totaling 3 billion yuan the rmb loan and trade settlement business of the two countries steadily advanced and the aiib actively supported the financing of the project within tajikistan two sides are also exploring the possibility of establishing a joint investment fund second benefiting from the bri kazakhstan the world s largest inland country has found the pacific ocean estuary in lianyungang port of china the logistics cooperation base built by china and kazakhstan has become the platform of cross border transport and warehousing logistics of many central asia countries third on april 8th the first new railway was opened to traffic after the independence of sri lanka in 1948 this is also the early harvest of the bri in sri lanka what kind of benefits can afghanistan get from the bri construction this is the most concerned issue of all walks of life of afghanistan to put is simple for afghanistan a landlocked country at the heart of the eurasian continent the bri offers not only roads in all directions but also unprecedented attention and investment by the international community on its development according to the latest research by international organizations such as the world bank the jointly building of the bri will promote the global economic growth rate by at least 0 1 cut the global trade cost and transportation time by 2 2 and 2 5 and reduce the trade cost in the china central asia west asia economic corridor adjacent to afghanistan by 10 2 from an economic point of view afghanistan s participation in the bri can take advantage of its own geography resources demographic structure connections and international attention and avoid a lack of funds industrial base and coastal ports it gives afghanistan the most convenient and cost effective way to connect the world s emerging markets and the largest market reduce the threshold and cost it links afghanistan s major cities key enterprises to transportation lines which will form an agglomeration effect from one point to the whole region forming a platform for economic take off it will simultaneously stimulate afghan investment consumption and exports simultaneously explore domestic and international markets and strive to create jobs and help afghanistan get rid of the current passive situation that the three wagons pull the economics can t move forward and restrain each other afghanistan was among the first explicitly supported the bri signed the relevant memorandum of understanding and established relevant security cooperation mechanism with china the chinese side attaches importance to and appreciates the positive attitude of afghan leaders government departments and people from all walks of life and regards afghanistan as an important partner in bri and for early harvest afghanistan s active participation in the joint construction of the bri has already and will continue benefit afghanistan in six aspects which can be summed up as six promoting first promoting trade in just 4 months afghanistan has exported more than 15 million us dollar pine nuts to china through 64 cargo flights after launching the program charted cargo flight for afghan pine nuts exporting to china in last november although the global trade declined last year china afghanistan goods trade volume maintained the 1 1 billion us dollars and afghan carpets marble and saffron are all selling very well in china second promoting chinese investment in afghanistan although the security situation in afghanistan is not good china still invested some projects with nearly us 500 million accumulative investment in afghanistan recently a chinese private company invested in bamyan province to help the local people grow and sell saffron dozens of families benefited directly third promoting education opportunities afghanistan is an important partner to china on the joint construction of bri to this end china provides more than 150 scholarships and about 1000 training opportunities to afghan every year which is very helpful to youth and professionals in afghanistan last year protocol staff from the palace and mofa of afghanistan were trained at the diaoyutai state guesthouse in china right this moment a senior officials delegation of afghan mofa is visiting henan province of china due to the bri the three party cooperation related to afghanistan is increasing which is conducive to the complementary advantages of all parties and the cooperation of major powers in afghanistan china and india are discussing to provide training for the afghan police officers china and the united states are also discussing to help afghanistan improve the education supervision system fourth promoting the sense of security of the afghan people china s economic and trade cooperation with afghanistan and all kinds of donation to afghanistan have increased employment helped afghanistan in poverty alleviation and are conducive to eradicating the social soil of terrorism and extremism the security cooperation between china and afghanistan under the bri has also protected the people and struck the evils fifth promoting afghanistan s international visibility and cultural influence 1300 years ago chinese great monk xuanzang went to india for studying buddhism through afghanistan he paid tribute to the giant bamyan buddha and made the only authoritative record of the buddha in the world nowadays because of the bri the study of gandhara civilization and the bamyan buddha has become a prominent school in china chinese archaeologists have come to afghanistan and afghan treasures and scholars have also visited dunhuang buddhist relics from mes aynak are expected to be exhibited on the asian civilization exhibition which will be held at the same time as the bri summit sixth promoting afghanistan s international access and diplomatic options this is crucial for afghanistan and other landlocked countries the chinese and our afghan friends have both heard of the proverb it takes two hands to clap early harvests in bri will required concerted efforts from china and afghanistan including efforts by the afghan side to give better play to the role of afghan business people and chamber of commerce in china in promoting afghan products and brands supporting chinese language programs and train more professional matchmakers for china afghanistan economic and trade cooperation as a man sows so he shall reap so long as the afghan side earnestly engages itself in the bri it will for sure happily benefit from it while advancing the bri the chinese side attaches equal importance treats as equals and engages with equal enthusiasm to all participating countries we are all members of the same band and every one of us is important and indispensable based on cost accounting infrastructure conditions and trade practices afghanistan is currently promoting air cargo corridors it is good but can only be supplementary to land and sea transportation the importance of karachi port to afghanistan s foreign trade is unlikely to be reduced in the short term of course the future of gwadar port is also an attractive choice this is exactly the significance of the china pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan as we cannot choose our neighbors good neighborliness and friendship are invaluable the chinese side sincerely hopes that afghanistan and pakistan will increase mutual trust and improve relations the trilateral foreign ministers dialogue successfully held in december last year expressed the desire to jointly advance the bri develop virtuous interactions between afghanistan and pakistan and promote connectivity between the two countries and others in the region at present the three government are studying the feasibility of enhance the connectivity of afghanistan and pakistan through railway and highway afghanistan is located between the china central asia west asia economic corridor and china pakistan economic corridor cpec if relations with neighbors in the north and south are improved and trade is better facilitated afghanistan s position in the bri will be further consolidated with its geographic comparative advantage and pivotal position on the regional value chain more prominent if the security situation improved the infrastructure upgraded and the business environment improved i believe that afghanistan will attract more international investors including chinese the biggest challenge at the moment is security there is a common proverb in china and afghanistan one flower does not make a spring the bri and regional economic cooperation is dedicated to make a spring full of the beauty of all flowers today it is the high speed railway instead of the camels that lead the fast advancement of the bri in the words of chairman mao zedong ten thousand years are too long seize the day and seize the hour it is hoped that together we will seize the current opportunity for peace and reconciliation in afghanistan and jointly advance the bri so that the afghan people will bathe in the sunshine of peace and development at an early date
in the big picture we argue that the s appreciation is part of the third significant dollar rally since the end of bretton woods the first was the reagan volcker dollar rally spurred by a policy mix of tight monetary and loose fiscal policies the rally ended with g7 intervention to knock it down in september 1985 after a ten year bear market a second dollar rally took place it can be linked to the tech bubble and the shift to a strong dollar policy the carving out of the internet drew capital into the u s and induced americans to keep their savings here it may or may not have been sufficient to fuel a multi year dollar advance rubin replaced bentsen at the helm of treasury and nearly immediately articulated a shift in policy no longer would the u s use the dollar as a trade weapon as previous administrations and officials did the u s would not engineer a weaker dollar to reduce its debt burden this is the essence of the strong dollar policy the u s first unilaterally disarmed and then succeeded in convincing the g7 and g20 that de weaponizing the foreign exchange market was the best practice however old habits die hard during the clinton dollar rally the was born and immediately depreciated it fell from around 1 19 to below 0 85 they cried quit picking on our euro though the market was really accumulating u s assets in october 2000 after summers replaced rubin and at the request of europe there was coordinated intervention to buy the euro and sell the dollar the official action and the popping of the tech bubble marked the end of the clinton dollar rally the greenback went into another multi year bear market the obama dollar rally began from extreme levels in 2008 the euro reached 1 60 was above 2 00 the was near 1 00 and the was above parity in the face of the great financial crisis and despite the slowness to recognize the magnitude of the problem the u s acted relatively early and relatively aggressively this unleashed the key fuel for the obama dollar rally divergence the u s economy recovered sooner and stronger than most of the other major centers europe was hit not only by the financial shock that emanated from the u s and their bank exposures but it paralyzed the relationship between creditors and debtors in europe the european phase of the crisis began in greece and despite the geography lessons by various officials every debtor country became greece japan already had very low interest rates before the great financial crisis the s role as a financing currency gave it the appearance of a safe haven when its strength was largely a function of short covering retail investors mostly focus on the appreciation of the asset they buy institutional investors also seek to lower their funding costs and borrowing the low yielding yen to finance equity or bond purchases is a common tactic by leveraged accounts leaving aside the japanese investors themselves japanese officials seemed to dawdle until abe was elected and kuroda became the governor of the bank of japan the second phase of the obama dollar rally began with the election of trump in 2016 both leading candidates in the presidential election promised fiscal expansion the federal reserve had begun the gradual process toward policy normalization the combination of expanding fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy was a repeat though on a smaller scale of the reagan volcker policy mix with the fiscal stimulus winding down the dollar may enter the third phase of its super cycle a return to divergence recall that the global slowdown began in h2 18 but the fiscal stimulus that is saddling the u s with more than a trillion dollar a year deficit helped mitigate the pressure it grew at an average pace of 3 8 in the middle two quarters last year the german and japanese economies contracted in q3 and q4 was only a little better the italian economy contracted in both quarters the european central bank s policy response has to been to push out its commitment not to raise interest rates and prepare for a new long term loan facility tltro iii the bank of japan unlike the ecb continues to buy a range of assets including corporate bonds and equities abe has appointed a couple of members to the boj board that dissent in favor of new measures to reach in the inflation target but there seems to be little appetite for more asset purchases or deeper negative interest rates pressure is building to postpone again the japanese sales tax increase that is to kick in october 1 the government has already enacted measures that are hoped to offset the economic impact of the tax increase abe campaigned for his third term last year backing the tax increase over opposition that wanted to abolish it entirely the u s economy began the year on soft footing it appeared to have nearly stagnated the atlanta fed s tracker started the quarter with a sub 0 5 projection it now stands at 2 3 a touch above q4 18 s 2 2 pace this is a little above what most fed official see as the long term non inflationary pace the high frequency data in the coming days should depict an economy that is on the mend a return to the status quo ante the pre stimulus pace of growth the u s average quarterly growth annualized in 2017 of 2 5 and 1 9 in 2016 likely increased for the first time this year the broader measure of industrial production may have also accelerated the american consumer likely made up for lost time fell at an annualized rate of about 4 5 the december through february period march retail sales rose by 0 9 according to the median forecast in the bloomberg survey the components used for gdp calculations are expected to rise by 0 5 after falling 0 2 in february the leading economic indicator averaged 0 5 in q3 18 and fell to 0 1 in the fourth quarter it may have risen by 0 4 in march which would be the strongest since last september it lends credence to our hypothesis that the economy did hit a soft patch but it is resilient and is already emerging the most important data point from the euro area will be the flash april on april 18 recall that in march france s and pmi were below the 50 boom bust level the was below 50 a small to modest improvement is unlikely to change the ecb s assessment that risks to its outlook remain on the downside three headwinds impacting the u s have lifted the drop in equities has been reversed and bond prices are higher the government re opened and the weather is less extreme europe is not as fortunate its headwinds have barely lifted the uncertainties over brexit continue the disruption from turkey has not been fully absorbed policy initiatives seem frozen ahead of european parliament election at the end of next month the u s announced 11 bln in tariffs on european goods for subsidies to airbus pa that the wto ruled illegal this was a shot across the bow and warns of difficult trade talks that lie ahead the u s continues to threaten 25 tariffs on auto imports which would be a significant blow especially at a time when european industry is already challenged japan moves into the spotlight next week as the bilateral trade talks with the u s formally begin in washington prime minister abe is expected to visit the u s later this month before trump visits tokyo next month and meets the new emperor by pulling out of the trans pacific partnership trump has the u s playing catch up other agriculture surplus countries like canada and australia have better access to the japanese market now the u s is defending a little more than a 20 market share of japan s agriculture imports japan cannot give the u s better terms than it conceded in tpp negotiations which ironically the u s played an important role japan enjoys around a 65 bln trade merchandise surplus with the u s the u s runs a chronic surplus in services with japan it is almost 15 the u s is fond of citing the merchandise imbalance while forgetting the service surplus tariffs on autos and auto parts like the u s threatens would be a shock for an economy that seems to be barely growing u s japan talks could have two parts the first is to pick the low hanging fruit like granting the u s the same terms as the tpp this would give trump a success while not distracting japan ahead of the upper house election in july and the g20 meeting its hosts for the first time in late june
why gold price will â just explodeâ in the blink of an eyeâ welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up frank holmes of u s global investors joins me to update us on some of the best value propositions he sees in the markets he also reveals why he s very bullish on the metals right now and why he expects the next leg higher to happen in the blink of an eye don t miss another wonderful conversation with the man the mining journal named america s best fund manager frank holmes coming up after this week s market update precious metals markets are struggling to gain ground as gold prices continue to oscillate around the 1 300 level for a 7th straight week gold traded into or out of 1 300 per ounce earlier in the week gold climbed above that key level but got pulled back below it thursday on heavy selling as of this friday morning the yellow metal checks in at 1 293 per ounce essentially unchanged for the second week in a row now despite the weakness in gold the gold to silver ratio rose to a new multi decade high of 87 to 1 on thursday as the white metal got pounded to register its lowest close of the year spot silver prices currently trade at 15 11 an ounce and are posting a weekly decline of 0 5 platinum prices are down 0 6 this week to trade at 899 and finally palladium is off 0 3 on the week to trade at 1 383 the ounce metals bulls are currently feeling disappointed that these markets aren t getting any boost from the dovishly postured fed minutes from the federal reserve s march meeting were released on wednesday policymakers telegraphed a pause on rate hikes for the rest of the year however they did not give any indication that rate cuts as advocated by president donald trump will be on the table the fed also telegraphed an end to quantitative tightening by september in the meantime the central bank continues to unload billions of dollars in assets off its balance sheet every month effectively trimming back growth in the currency supply perhaps that is weighing on precious metals markets and the broader inflation trade last friday president trump called for the fed to reverse course and re start quantitative easing steve liesman cnbc president trump s substantially raising the ante in his comments and criticism of the fed not only does he think the fed should cut rates he also today for the first time advocated new quantitative easing that s the emergency measure from the financial crisis where the fed buys bonds and increases its balance sheet to push down interest rates donald trump i personally think the fed should drop rates i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing a new qe deployment probably won t happen until the economy takes a dramatic turn for the worse but the odds of some form of fed easing in the months ahead are growing as economic indicators soften this week the international monetary fund downgraded its growth forecasts for the global and u s economies the imf forecasts the american economy will grow 2 3 in 2019 down from a previous projection of 2 5 wall street analysts are also downgrading their outlook for corporate earnings lower profits and lower growth rates will mean lower tax revenues for the government the already ballooning federal budget deficit would then become a much bigger problem and could serve as impetus for the fed to resume purchasing treasury bonds well speaking of taxes the filing deadline is just around the corner for some it may not be too late to take advantage of some last minute tax reduction strategies for others it s not too early to begin making smart tax moves for the current year unfortunately for precious metals investors tax laws are rigged against them under current irs rules capital gains on all forms of bullion are arbitrarily treated as collectibles the irs taxes collectibles at a rate of 28 instead of the lower rates that apply to stocks and other financial assets fortunately there are legal ways to shelter your gold and silver gains from taxation one of the most straightforward and effective ways is through an ira you can hold certain types of tangible assets including irs approved gold silver platinum and palladium bullion products inside a self directed ira within the ira you can sell some or all of your holdings trade one metal for another or even switch the account back to conventional financial assets when you think metals markets have peaked none of your precious metals ira gains are taxable until you actually take withdrawals in the form of cash or the physical metal itself an ira backed by hard assets can be a powerful way to preserve wealth during times of rising inflation inflation may not be on most investors radar at this point but there is a danger in the fed s recent statements essentially declaring it will do nothing more this year to fight inflation once the inflation genie is let out of the bottle it becomes hard to control it can give the illusion of rising prosperity through rising asset prices on the one hand while on the other acting as an oppressive tax on workers and savers whose wealth is stuck in depreciating dollars to learn more about funding a precious metals ira and selecting a reputable account custodian just click on the ira section of moneymetals com or give one of our knowledgeable no pressure specialists a call at 1 800 800 1865 well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer at us global investors mr holmes has received various honors over the years including being named america s best fund manager by the mining journal he is also the co author of the book the gold watcher demystifying gold investing and is a regular guest on cnbc bloomberg fox business and also right here on the money metals podcast frank welcome back and thanks for joining us again frank holmes it s great to be back in a day that the market is up and it s all good for us mike gleason yeah exactly we ll get into that well frank we focus a lot on federal debt around here of course the numbers there command a lot of attention the national debt is 22 trillion and has grown exponentially as we both know particularly over the past two decades but you wrote about something recently in your frank talk blog that probably isn t getting enough attention corporate debt is also a serious problem can you talk a little bit about corporate debt and why metals investors might want to keep an eye on that as well frank holmes just to add to that what was interesting that came up this morning is that the number of small cap russell 2000 stocks have almost a record of deteriorating earnings in cash flow and it s the highest percentage of b rated debt so there s a train wreck coming on those stocks in those industries according to these two dynamics but i think that the debt in the business element one thing about business they sort of adapt and adjust and they go through this cleansing process and i don t think that that is as big of a worry as when you have some of these quant funds that are leveraged 8 to 1 so you got a guy with a billion dollars and he is able to leverage himself 8 to 1 because their gamma of their information is good for three days to seven days so this is a big issue when you get these unwinds so all of a sudden you have 200 billion dollars getting unwound and the underlying capital behind it is 20 billion so you have 180 billion dollar hitting bids everywhere and i think that is probably for me a scary thing because i feel that in the markets every day up and down days so that s my thoughts on the debt mike gleason you ve also been keeping an eye on brexit and that s a topic we ve been interested in since the referendum was passed nearly three years ago unfortunately we find it almost impossible to predict what will happen the machinations of british parliament are hard to follow it looks just like the politicians there are wringing their hands perhaps hoping to wear people out if we had to guess the british will wind up throwing in the towel on brexit though we hope we re wrong on that but we re hoping you might venture a guess on what to expect with regards to brexit is the eu still in trouble or are they going to weather the storm that started a few years back frank holmes well the eu blames england for everything and the big difference is common law so the success of canada america singapore hong kong they re all based on common law same thing with new zealand and australia and so europe is civil law and that s where you seem to get the hardest core socialists it always surprises me that most the media is pro that and that s what happened with chavez getting into power and destroying venezuela so one has sit back and say where s the media where s the real thoughts etcetera and england is the second biggest contributor to the eu they were unfair and unreasonable and they used bully tactics with them and so the brits finally got fed up and are leaving so i think that the eu is going to have negative real interest rates that s why i think the bank of international settlements is concerned enough that they are now saying the banks don t have to have discounts on their gold holdings and so they re not treated as illiquid assets it in fact gold is the fourth most liquid asset in the world but we re seeing something that s really significant and that is a 5 year high in new central bank buying of gold poland czech republic hungary they re buying six tons at a whack and we saw gold get stumped a couple of weeks ago and basically the thoughts were maybe that was turkey because they had a financial crisis the day before and they ll sell the gold to try to stem it and then they ll be buying it back later so they use gold on a regular basis and last time they blew up their gold and knocked gold down it was the hungarians that bought it all so we re having a new phase of bankers central bankers around the world very attracted to gold and then we have the rising gdp per capita the rising gdp per capita of china and india is really significant because collectively those two countries are 40 of the world s population the gdp per capita the purchasing power parity right now of china and india and america is impacting the world and if you look at these market forces the chinese and the indians and then you got the middle east etcetera they all get gold for gifts and they buy 24 carat gold and this has led me into an investment in north america called mene gold and mene is listed in toronto but you can buy and go the website mene com and you can buy 24 carat gold for your loved one and then you want to buy some gold coins and silver coins and so to me what you re seeing with companies like this they re disruptive but we have such a big chinese and indian population now of young professionals and they want to buy 24 carat gold jewelry and so i think this idea of how much chindia is growing globally and it s highly correlated to gold jewelry demand and that is 60 of gold demand so i m very bullish mike gleason sticking with china here we d like to get an update from you with regards to trade it will soon be a year since the trump administration imposed tariffs and began earnestly trying to force the chinese and others to renegotiate trade deals it s pretty hard to gauge the actual progress in these negotiations rumors of a trade deal being imminent float out periodically that s been going on for months now but as yet nothing has been inked that hasn t kept stock prices from rallying each time one of those rumors appear what are you expecting in terms of a trade deal and what do you think it will mean for markets frank frank holmes well it s really a great question because where i was talking about earlier was some of these big numbers you have to look at macro forces i call them china and america are 40 of the world s gdp so them in a spat is very significant and the more impact that a china slowdown has and what they start doing is printing money like ferociously and staging the rules that anyone could borrow in january and all of a sudden we saw a trough in pmi now why is pmi important purchasing manufacturers index is a great predictor of rising commodities or falling commodities there are lots of highly correlated research has been done on that by us and we report on it so what we saw is a huge surge in pmi and whenever the one month is above the three month then you start seeing oil up so oil s up coppers up so this is very very bullish and you re seeing gold up too so i think the trade war what it s really about is a level playing field tech gets a lot of concern but it s just unlevel we have the biggest economy in the world to sell consumers of 13 trillion dollars they want to sell to us but we can t sell to them and i think that s pretty fair what trump has done he has taken the task he did it to the germans and said look if you want to be able to sell mercedes and bmws here then you re hurting gm and ford selling into germany then we re putting a tariff on you and then immediately they changed the rules over there so i think this is some of the positive parts of what s going on for the global trade i feel very confident that the second half is going to much stronger than what happened last year in the selloff in gold mike gleason getting back to metals here for a little bit gold and silver got off to a pretty start in 2019 it s fallen back in recent weeks somewhat but they ve been pretty fickle frank positive developments for gold such as the fed doing an about face on interest rates hasn t really provided the bump that many thought it would what do you make of the recent action in the metals where do you think they might be headed in the months ahead will we finally get a sustained upside move and take out some of these major overhead resistance levels say 1 350 1 375 in gold and 16 50 17 in silver what are your thoughts there frank frank holmes i think it happens in a new york second and then it s going to go sideways for a while but it s just going to surprise everyone and just explode and find that new level and hang around 1 400 that s my thoughts on it and it will surprise in the blink of an eye how that happens there will be some type of event and i believe that the peak gold is here so if we have rising in the amount of printing money and gdp per capita is rising around the world and with the cultural affinity for gold we have peak mine supply i remain pretty constructively bullish mike gleason you obviously talk a lot about the negative real interest rate environment that can be very bullish for precious metals is that what you re kind of looking for moving forward do you see those coming back in spates here and it being a good tailwind for gold frank holmes what s interesting is that rates peaked last october and then the market really sold off rates started coming down and had been falling since october but what really hurt the market last year in the fourth quarter was the unwinding of qe3 and the selling of bonds that was very destructive even though the rates were coming lower impacted bids everywhere i think the worst of that is behind us and so i think that that s why we have got more stability in the capital markets and inflation came down so it was allowed for these rates to come down but what really makes it is that europeans they re at big negative and they should be backing up the truck and just loading up on the bullion and the quality gold stocks and that s what i think you ll start to see that as we go further in the year mike gleason well finally frank as we begin to wrap up can you give us any final thoughts here as we look toward the middle part of 2019 and maybe any other comments that you d like to share that maybe we haven t covered as we conclude today frank holmes we have a great product called near term it s short term munis and it s around a 2 dollar nav it s very stable hardly any fluctuations and you get a higher yield than you re going to get in any bank account for money fund and i think investors have to look at making sure that they have a good cushion of cash in the muni space not like when we talked earlier where you brought up and highlighted the small businesses in mid cap stocks that have debt deterioration and they have greater risk no that muni s are in great financial shape and that s where you get some of the best relative attractive returns so from that end that s something for investors and if you re going to go into the gold space there s a note on the toronto stock exchange called grand columbia which is the largest gold producer in columbia 200 000 ounces very high grade and they have a gold note just under a hundred million it pays just under 10 yield and pays monthly and as the price of gold goes up they pay out a higher monthly dividend those are

why gold price will â just explodeâ in the blink of an eyeâ welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up frank holmes of u s global investors joins me to update us on some of the best value propositions he sees in the markets he also reveals why he s very bullish on the metals right now and why he expects the next leg higher to happen in the blink of an eye don t miss another wonderful conversation with the man the mining journal named america s best fund manager frank holmes coming up after this week s market update precious metals markets are struggling to gain ground as gold prices continue to oscillate around the 1 300 level for a 7th straight week gold traded into or out of 1 300 per ounce earlier in the week gold climbed above that key level but got pulled back below it thursday on heavy selling as of this friday morning the yellow metal checks in at 1 293 per ounce essentially unchanged for the second week in a row now despite the weakness in gold the gold to silver ratio rose to a new multi decade high of 87 to 1 on thursday as the white metal got pounded to register its lowest close of the year spot silver prices currently trade at 15 11 an ounce and are posting a weekly decline of 0 5 platinum prices are down 0 6 this week to trade at 899 and finally palladium is off 0 3 on the week to trade at 1 383 the ounce metals bulls are currently feeling disappointed that these markets aren t getting any boost from the dovishly postured fed minutes from the federal reserve s march meeting were released on wednesday policymakers telegraphed a pause on rate hikes for the rest of the year however they did not give any indication that rate cuts as advocated by president donald trump will be on the table the fed also telegraphed an end to quantitative tightening by september in the meantime the central bank continues to unload billions of dollars in assets off its balance sheet every month effectively trimming back growth in the currency supply perhaps that is weighing on precious metals markets and the broader inflation trade last friday president trump called for the fed to reverse course and re start quantitative easing steve liesman cnbc president trump s substantially raising the ante in his comments and criticism of the fed not only does he think the fed should cut rates he also today for the first time advocated new quantitative easing that s the emergency measure from the financial crisis where the fed buys bonds and increases its balance sheet to push down interest rates donald trump i personally think the fed should drop rates i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing a new qe deployment probably won t happen until the economy takes a dramatic turn for the worse but the odds of some form of fed easing in the months ahead are growing as economic indicators soften this week the international monetary fund downgraded its growth forecasts for the global and u s economies the imf forecasts the american economy will grow 2 3 in 2019 down from a previous projection of 2 5 wall street analysts are also downgrading their outlook for corporate earnings lower profits and lower growth rates will mean lower tax revenues for the government the already ballooning federal budget deficit would then become a much bigger problem and could serve as impetus for the fed to resume purchasing treasury bonds well speaking of taxes the filing deadline is just around the corner for some it may not be too late to take advantage of some last minute tax reduction strategies for others it s not too early to begin making smart tax moves for the current year unfortunately for precious metals investors tax laws are rigged against them under current irs rules capital gains on all forms of bullion are arbitrarily treated as collectibles the irs taxes collectibles at a rate of 28 instead of the lower rates that apply to stocks and other financial assets fortunately there are legal ways to shelter your gold and silver gains from taxation one of the most straightforward and effective ways is through an ira you can hold certain types of tangible assets including irs approved gold silver platinum and palladium bullion products inside a self directed ira within the ira you can sell some or all of your holdings trade one metal for another or even switch the account back to conventional financial assets when you think metals markets have peaked none of your precious metals ira gains are taxable until you actually take withdrawals in the form of cash or the physical metal itself an ira backed by hard assets can be a powerful way to preserve wealth during times of rising inflation inflation may not be on most investors radar at this point but there is a danger in the fed s recent statements essentially declaring it will do nothing more this year to fight inflation once the inflation genie is let out of the bottle it becomes hard to control it can give the illusion of rising prosperity through rising asset prices on the one hand while on the other acting as an oppressive tax on workers and savers whose wealth is stuck in depreciating dollars to learn more about funding a precious metals ira and selecting a reputable account custodian just click

interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer at us global investors mr holmes has received various honors over the years including being named america s best fund manager by the mining journal he is also the co author of the book the gold watcher demystifying gold investing and is a regular guest on cnbc bloomberg fox business and also right here on the money metals podcast frank welcome back and thanks for joining us again frank holmes it s great to be back in a day that the market is up and it s all good for us mike gleason yeah exactly we ll get into that well frank we focus a lot on federal debt around here of course the numbers there command a lot of attention the national debt is 22 trillion and has grown exponentially as we both know particularly over the past two decades but you wrote about something recently in your frank talk blog that probably isn t getting enough attention corporate debt is also a serious problem can you talk a little bit about corporate debt and why metals investors might want to keep an eye on that as well frank holmes just to add to that what was interesting that came up this morning is that the number of small cap russell 2000 stocks have almost a record of deteriorating earnings in cash flow and it s the highest percentage of b rated debt so there s a train wreck coming on those stocks in those industries according to these two dynamics but i think that the debt in the business element one thing about business they sort of adapt and adjust and they go through this cleansing process and i don t think that that is as big of a worry as when you have some of these quant funds that are leveraged 8 to 1 so you got a guy with a billion dollars and he is able to leverage himself 8 to 1 because their gamma of their information is good for three days to seven days so this is a big issue when you get these unwinds so all of a sudden you have 200 billion dollars getting unwound and the underlying capital behind it is 20 billion so you have 180 billion dollar hitting bids everywhere and i think that is probably for me a scary thing because i feel that in the markets every day up and down days so that s my thoughts on the debt mike gleason you ve also been keeping an eye on brexit and that s a topic we ve been interested in since the referendum was passed nearly three years ago unfortunately we find it almost impossible to predict what will happen the machinations of british parliament are hard to follow it looks just like the politicians there are wringing their hands perhaps hoping to wear people out if we had to guess the british will wind up throwing in the towel on brexit though we hope we re wrong on that but we re hoping you might venture a guess on what to expect with regards to brexit is the eu still in trouble or are they going to weather the storm that started a few years back frank holmes well the eu blames england for everything and the big difference is common law so the success of canada america singapore hong kong they re all based on common law same thing with new zealand and australia and so europe is civil law and that s where you seem to get the hardest core socialists it always surprises me that most the media is pro that and that s what happened with chavez getting into power and destroying venezuela so one has sit back and say where s the media where s the real thoughts etcetera and england is the second biggest contributor to the eu they were unfair and unreasonable and they used bully tactics with them and so the brits finally got fed up and are leaving so i think that the eu is going to have negative real interest rates that s why i think the bank of international settlements is concerned enough that they are now saying the banks don t have to have discounts on their gold holdings and so they re not treated as illiquid assets it in fact gold is the fourth most liquid asset in the world but we re seeing something that s really significant and that is a 5 year high in new central bank buying of gold poland czech republic hungary they re buying six tons at a whack and we saw gold get stumped a couple of weeks ago and basically the thoughts were maybe that was turkey because they had a financial crisis the day before and they ll sell the gold to try to stem it and then they ll be buying it back later so they use gold on a regular basis and last time they blew up their gold and knocked gold down it was the hungarians that bought it all so we re having a new phase of bankers central bankers around the world very attracted to gold and then we have the rising gdp per capita the rising gdp per capita of china and india is really significant because collectively those two countries are 40 of the world s population the gdp per capita the purchasing power parity right now of china and india and america is impacting the world and if you look at these market forces the chinese and the indians and then you got the middle east etcetera they all get gold for gifts and they buy 24 carat gold and this has led me into an investment in north america called mene gold and mene is listed in toronto but you can buy and go the website mene com and you can buy 24 carat gold for your loved one and then you want to buy some gold coins and silver coins and so to me what you re seeing with companies like this they re disruptive but we have such a big chinese and indian population now of young professionals and they want to buy 24 carat gold jewelry and so i think this idea of how much chindia is growing globally and it s highly correlated to gold jewelry demand and that is 60 of gold demand so i m very bullish mike gleason sticking with china here we d like to get an update from you with regards to trade it will soon be a year since the trump administration imposed tariffs and began earnestly trying to force the chinese and others to renegotiate trade deals it s pretty hard to gauge the actual progress in these negotiations rumors of a trade deal being imminent float out periodically that s been going on for months now but as yet nothing has been inked that hasn t kept stock prices from rallying each time one of those rumors appear what are you expecting in terms of a trade deal and what do you think it will mean for markets frank frank holmes well it s really a great question because where i was talking about earlier was some of these big numbers you have to look at macro forces i call them china and america are 40 of the world s gdp so them in a spat is very significant and the more impact that a china slowdown has and what they start doing is printing money like ferociously and staging the rules that anyone could borrow in january and all of a sudden we saw a trough in pmi now why is pmi important purchasing manufacturers index is a great predictor of rising commodities or falling commodities there are lots of highly correlated research has been done on that by us and we report on it so what we saw is a huge surge in pmi and whenever the one month is above the three month then you start seeing oil up so oil s up coppers up so this is very very bullish and you re seeing gold up too so i think the trade war what it s really about is a level playing field tech gets a lot of concern but it s just unlevel we have the biggest economy in the world to sell consumers of 13 trillion dollars they want to sell to us but we can t sell to them and i think that s pretty fair what trump has done he has taken the task he did it to the germans and said look if you want to be able to sell mercedes and bmws here then you re hurting gm and ford selling into germany then we re putting a tariff on you and then immediately they changed the rules over there so i think this is some of the positive parts of what s going on for the global trade i feel very confident that the second half is going to much stronger than what happened last year in the selloff in gold mike gleason getting back to metals here for a little bit gold and silver got off to a pretty start in 2019 it s fallen back in recent weeks somewhat but they ve been pretty fickle frank positive developments for gold such as the fed doing an about face on interest rates hasn t really provided the bump that many thought it would what do you make of the recent action in the metals where do you think they might be headed in the months ahead will we finally get a sustained upside move and take out some of these major overhead resistance levels say 1 350 1 375 in gold and 16 50 17 in silver what are your thoughts there frank frank holmes i think it happens in a new york second and then it s going to go sideways for a while but it s just going to surprise everyone and just explode and find that new level and hang around 1 400 that s my thoughts on it and it will surprise in the blink of an eye how that happens there will be some type of event and i believe that the peak gold is here so if we have rising in the amount of printing money and gdp per capita is rising around the world and with the cultural affinity for gold we have peak mine supply i remain pretty constructively bullish mike gleason you obviously talk a lot about the negative real interest rate environment that can be very bullish for precious metals is that what you re kind of looking for moving forward do you see those coming back in spates here and it being a good tailwind for gold frank holmes what s interesting is that rates peaked last october and then the market really sold off rates started coming down and had been falling since october but what really hurt the market last year in the fourth quarter was the unwinding of qe3 and the selling of bonds that was very destructive even though the rates were coming lower impacted bids everywhere i think the worst of that is behind us and so i think that that s why we have got more stability in the capital markets and inflation came down so it was allowed for these rates to come down but what really makes it is that europeans they re at big negative and they should be backing up the truck and just loading up on the bullion and the quality gold stocks and that s what i think you ll start to see that as we go further in the year mike gleason well finally frank as we begin to wrap up can you give us any final thoughts here as we look toward the middle part of 2019 and maybe any other comments that you d like to share that maybe we haven t covered as we conclude today frank holmes we have a great product called near term it s short term munis and it s around a 2 dollar nav it s very stable hardly any fluctuations and you get a higher yield than you re going to get in any bank account for money fund and i think investors have to look at making sure that they have a good cushion of cash in the muni space not like when we talked earlier where you brought up and highlighted the small businesses in mid cap stocks that have debt deterioration and they have greater risk no that muni s are in great financial shape and that s where you get some of the best relative attractive returns so from that end that s something for investors and if you re going to go into the gold space there s a note on the toronto stock exchange called grand columbia which is the largest gold producer in columbia 200 000 ounces very high grade and they have a gold note just under a hundred million it pays just under 10 yield and pays monthly and as the price of gold goes up they pay out a higher monthly dividend those are sort of the unique investments and the most recent invest i made is a micro cap space that s called gold spot and that s with nine phds who are doing artificial intelligence for major mining companies and juniors who they take a royalty from and do work on it so i love having all these young scientists that are just changing the world with ai and then goau our smart beta gold etf it s demonstrated what it said it would do it would perform the gdxj 92 of the time on a rolling twelve month basis and it s done that so we re very proud of that and since the new york go gold goau if you re into buying gold equities otherwise stick with you and get those beautiful gold coins mike gleason well thanks as always frank we ll look forward to catching up with you again later this year in the meantime keep up the good work with those frank talk pieces and of course before we sign off please tell listeners more about your firm and your services and anything else that they ought to know

ways to boost the euro as a reserve currency on views the oversized influence of the dollar in global markets leaves europe vulnerable to u s political decisions advertisement poor history for politicized fed both moore and cain have yet to be nominated formally and cain s prospects look bleak fed governors must be approved by the u s senate and enough republican lawmakers have come out against cain to scuttle his chances moore meanwhile has sent mixed signals about his policies but in general has criticized the fed flooding markets with dollars during the crisis and its aftermath he has favoured tying the fed to a strict rule based on commodity prices critics of rule based monetary policy cite its lack of flexibility to respond to unexpected events the fed has had deeply political governors before perhaps most notably in the 1980s when a group loyal to then president ronald reagan opposed policy set by then chairman paul volcker said william english the former head of the fed s monetary affairs division and now a professor at yale advertisement they didn t succeed english said evidence of the influence of a strong fed chair and of the limits an individual governor has in an institution with a strong technocratic bent and on a policy panel that at peak strength includes 19 people twelve of them moreover are appointed by regional banks outside the president s reach but before volcker he said the fed did mold policy around the demands of presidents lyndon johnson and richard nixon and arguably contributed to the runaway inflation of the 1970s we did that experiment the outcome was bad he said for the imf and other global institutions there s a broader issue if the world s dominant economy steers away from the norms recommended for other countries as the trump administration has already done on trade whether it is the potential for unhindered government borrowing or a politicized central bank the united states may be writing a script that other less resilient countries may be tempted to follow the fund likes to live in a world where all of its members are treated evenhandedly said nathan sheets former under secretary of the treasury for international affairs and now chief economist at pgim fixed income if the united states starts opening the fed to partisan politics or shifting away from other norms that is a risk for them

via the market once again the expedition to go back to normal has been postponed after the big market scare at the end of 2018 central banks have abolished their plans to tighten interest rates further wall street loves it the first quarter has been the best one for risk assets in a decade and after lyft s successful going public a record year for ipos seems to be in sight jim grant observes the madding crowd from a sober distance interest rates are the traffic signals of a market economy turn them all green and errors and pileups abound says the sharp thinking editor of the iconic wall street newsletter grant s interest rate observer he states that a decade after the financial crisis many companies are so heavily addicted to easy monetary policies that they wouldn t be able to survive on their own consequentially the proficient value seeker has a hard time to find attractive investments in today s markets where he spots rare opportunities he tells the market in this extended interview mr grant once again the federal reserve is giving investors the green light us equities are off to their best start since 1998 what s your take on the current state of the global financial markets stocks are up bond yields are down and economists are speaking of full employment everything seems perfect and improving but i remain a non believer in these modern monetary methods if it were this easy mankind would have solved the economic problems a long time ago for quite some time you have been warning that extreme measures like negative interest rates and quantitative easing will get us into trouble but so far the central banks remain confident that their policies are working what we see is an attempt to make things smooth and to forestall crises through keeping interest rates very low but central banks are arsonists and firemen they are arsonists because they strike the matches which set off the fire it s like an underground fire in a coal mine you can see the smoke seeping up out of the ground and the ground is warm under foot but you can t see the flames then time passes and the fire spreads and becomes more fierce and hotter finally it bursts out of the ground that s in some way what happens in the credit markets what do you mean by that robert kaplan the president of the dallas federal reserve for instance recently came out and said he is worried about the buildup of corporate debt especially the lower rated portions of that debt he s concerned about the risk that this debt is coming on the market in great waves during a recession therefore the fed should be very careful with raising rates he argues so basically what he is saying is that the fed must keep rates low to perpetuate the debt cycle which has given us an excess of debt about which he is worried this is crazy right how concerning is the situation in corporate credit really in a recent issue of grant s interest rate observer we have a story concluding that many companies would get into trouble if the real interest rate on ten year treasuries rises over 1 these businesses are so leveraged that they can t cover their debt payments at levels even as humble and as low as a 1 real interest rate on ten year treasuries as it translates into corporate borrowing just look at the growth in the herd of listed zombies companies whose average operating income has fallen short of covering the average interest rate expense over three consecutive years as it turns out the corporate living dead as a share of the broad s p 1500 index are close to 14 former fed chairman ben bernanke once tried to reassure everyone that the fed could raise rates in 15 minutes if it wanted to well it turns out the fed cannot do that so it s a brave new world we re living in then again bernanke and other central bankers claim that their low interest rate policies have preserved the world from an economic depression what s your conclusion when you look back on the last decade since the financial crisis i m of the view that the world wide suppression of interest rates over the past ten years has been not only inadvisable but on moral grounds something very near to a crime that s a tough judgement by that i mean that the suppression of interest rates has served to advantage one class of people the savers have been disadvantaged whereas big banks have been very greatly advantaged and the financial community has been advantaged in short the saver s loss has been the speculators gain so the ordinary working person has been disadvantaged and that is apolitical to speak metaphorically but i still think truthfully that kind of policy is bordering on criminal and i stand by that now the fed wants to pause raising interest rates at least until 2020 and the trump administration even demands a rate cut of 50 basis points what does it mean when nearly a decade after the end of the recession the us economy can t stand short term interest rates of more than 2 5 to me the economy is one of these abstract concepts it doesn t really exist except in our minds but people talk about it as if it were their cousin or their next door neighbor the economy is going to grow 3 2 in nominal terms in the next nine months adjusted for seasonal factors they say for example but how do you really know that so i have become a little bit agnostic about these big macroeconomic concepts not to depreciate their importance but to acknowledge one s ignorance in the face of the unmeasurable then how do you get an overview of the big economic picture we tend to focus on individual securities and on credit broadly defined that is to say on the capacity of incumbent businesses to make good on their debts we look at the bond market we look at the track of interest rates and we look at the zeitgeist to see how people are positioned we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us there are all sorts of crazy stuff the craziest of course is that around 20 or 11 trillion worth of bonds worldwide are priced to yield less than zero and what do you observe there is a lot of spoken or rhetorical worry people say that there is a risk of recession and they talk about the difficulties facing america in the context of the still unresolved trade dispute with china but the way they invest seems to be not so very worried for instance the stock market is close to its all time high and the recovery from the lows of december has been most dramatic what does this say about today s zeitgeist here s one indicator of the zeitgeist uber is expected to become public this year now uber is unprofitable and it is unit unprofitable meaning that the company doesn t make money on a micro economic basis and it seems as if a larger scale of operations will not make it profitable that s why we think uber is doomed to be unprofitable so what is a perpetually unprofitable business worth here at grant s our bid for such a company is zero but at wall street the ask price the offering price for uber is estimated to be as much as 120 billion dollars that s called a wide market where else do you spot things that make you go hmmm there are all sorts of crazy stuff the craziest of course is that around 20 or 11 trillion worth of bonds worldwide are priced to yield less than zero this is the greatest non sequitur in finance david hume the great scottish philosopher of the mid 18th century observed that no man will settle for low interest when he can have high profits or for low profits when he can have high interest but today at least in the us profit margins are very fat and the ratio of equity market capitalization to gdp is very elevated and yet interest rates are very very low not so low as they are in europe or japan but the ten year treasury yield which is meant to be the benchmark sits at around 2 4 so after inflation and tax there is nothing left there is no real yield available at least until the ten year point of the treasury curve what does this mean for a country like switzerland where interest rates are deeper in negative territory than anywhere else in the world the swiss have let us know and in no uncertain terms that they want the franc to be a currency which allows them to compete internationally and to reach the desired exchange rate the swiss national bank will create immense amounts of new francs with which to suppress the unwanted appreciation of the franc that s the message but is this a hard currency sure the franc is a relatively stable currency against the euro but is that the standard keeping up with mario draghi i don t think so point taken so what would you advise the swiss national bank to do let me not advise the swiss national bank the snb has difficulties regarding the exchange rate of the franc which are rather more complex than perhaps i appreciate it s obvious that negative interest rates are destroying the bond market but i m not sure what the consequences might be in switzerland of doing what i would have the snb do so let me advise the federal reserve instead sure what would you do if you were at the helm of the world s most powerful central bank i fear it might be too late but to start with i m in favor of interest rates which are discovered in the marketplace and at the very short end interest rates ought to be pitched at a level that provides some premium to the inflation rate so my first order would be to give a speech saying that we are out of the business of manipulating expectations we are out of the business of manipulating the stock market the stock market is going where it wants to go and if it goes down a lot so be it that s not our line of work we are in the business of securing a currency which holds its value and which provides a good medium of exchange the fed is expected to intervene when things go badly and what this has given us is immense distortions sounds straightforward but how would the financial markets react they would consider it as very radical and very unhelpful but the way forward is to somehow reinstitute the interaction of supply and demand on wall street and to get the fed out of the business of wholesale manipulation of values because today the fed is expected to intervene when things go badly and what this has given us is immense distortions so here s the real question would someone actually be prepared to absorb a deep recession and be blamed for it it would be hard to do wouldn t it that s why i wonder whether it s not too late what should investors do in this market environment we don t make portfolio recommendations we analyze security by security based on graham and dodd s investing principle on the margin of safety you can t help but notice that there is very little margin of safety in today s world but there are certain securities which meet this requirement for example we are bullish on genco shipping and eagle bulk shipping since there is hardly anything else in global markets approaching the pessimism and fear embedded in these very cheap stocks this means there is an attractive asymmetry of the return profile when things turn out better than people expect also we know that many of our readers are income seeking investors therefore we recently have recommended some closed end bond funds which are trading at a discount to their net asset value so there is some safety there although if the fed does decide to raise rates you re at risk that the cost of financing those portfolios would go up and your total return would go down you re also known to be a loyal admirer of gold what s your outlook for the precious metal here is the best thing about gold it yields more than 11 trillion dollars worth of bonds so it s a high yield asset then again there doesn t seem to be much love for gold right now i know it s a little bit of a disappointment it seems as if gold were not reading the newspapers but seriously i really wish gold had done better and i wish it were doing better yet i m as convinced as ever that gold is an attractive and rational alternative to these monetary shenanigans and to the consequences of ten years of artificially imposed ultra low interest rates unfortunately when this great bet pays off is hard to say and how about gold mining stocks at this point i would just recommend a basket of gold mining stocks i don t want to get into specific names since we haven t written about mining stocks for some time that s because i don t want to wear out the patience of my readers on gold i ration myself in this regard because the only thing which is worse than being wrong is being repetitively wrong so before we get back to picking individual mining shares i want to see gold breaking out first i want see it prove itself above 1350 or 1400 per ounce

economy steers away from the norms recommended for other countries as the trump administration has already done on trade whether it is the potential for unhindered government borrowing or a politicized central bank the united states may be writing a script that other less resilient countries may be tempted to follow the fund likes to live in a world where all of its members are treated evenhandedly said nathan sheets former under secretary of the treasury for international affairs and now chief economist at pgim fixed income if the united states starts opening the fed to partisan politics or shifting away from other norms that is a risk for them additional reporting by balazs koranyi editing by andrea ricci
originally published on april 5 2019 gold market sees several course reversals in march after six months of gains in which the gold price rose by 175 per ounce to 1 345 march saw some profit taking gold fell to its monthly low of 1 280 on march 7 amid near term u s dollar strength however the gold market quickly reversed course when the u s department of labor reported non farm payrolls increased by just 20 000 compared to median expectations of 180 000 on the same day the european central bank ecb announced a policy reversal offering cheap loans to banks and keeping interest rates at record lows for longer than planned this caused recessionary fears to re emerge as long term treasury yields fell to 15 month lows the yield curve inverted slightly for the first time since 2007 and gold trended to its monthly high of 1 324 on march 25 as the month ended there was broad weakness among precious metals due to a sharp fall in palladium prices there were also reports of heavy official selling from turkey to prop up the lira ahead of local elections on march 31 gold ended the month at 1 292 30 for a loss of 21 01 per ounce down 1 6 after about two years without reporting any purchases the people s bank of china pboc reported its third consecutive month of gold buying with a february inflow of 9 95 tonnes this suggests the chinese are again consistent buyers which bodes well for central bank demand in 2019 gold stocks more or less matched gold s performance in march with a 0 74 gain in the nyse arca gold miners index gdm 1 and a 2 3 loss for the mvis global junior gold miners index 2 merger mania subsides first quarter merger and acquisition m a activity among the supermajors has nearly reached a conclusion barrick gold gold 7 of net assets withdrew its hostile offer for newmont mining nem 6 2 of net assets on march 11 when the companies announced a joint venture jv agreement to unitize their nevada operations their combined nevada operations produce four million ounces per year and barrick as jv operator estimates it will generate about 5 billion in synergies after years of debating such a deal at the urging of shareholders these two rivals hammered out a jv in just two weeks investors then turned their attention to the friendly newmont goldcorp gg merger announced in january it stood to reason that goldcorp 2 of net assets shareholders were not entitled to the nevada jv synergies which did not exist at the time the deal with newmont was announced again at the urging of investors newmont decided to award a 2 5 special dividend to its shareholders as a partial upfront payment for future nevada synergies the dividend will be distributed if the newmont goldcorp deal is approved by shareholders in april all of this supermajor m a activity has been aimed at creating value for shareholders by combining companies managements and properties with the goal of mining more efficiently and generating higher returns on capital we hope the majors mid tiers and juniors are able to replicate what the supermajors have done according to pollitt co inc 3 just four companies account for 50 of iron ore production while it takes ten companies to account for 50 of copper production contrast this with gold where twenty five companies account for 45 of production mining is risky business and not all of these companies have an a team management risk can be mitigated by joining good managements with good properties thereby enabling companies to optimize operations m a also allows smaller companies to gain the critical mass needed to efficiently access capital markets and strike better deals for materials equipment and services diverging macro signals hint at risks ahead successful investing involves making the right call at the right time a great investment idea can fail if the timing is off we have been warning of the risks of recession for several years as such our fund has been positioned aggressively for a stronger gold market while gold and gold stocks have exhibited positive returns in two of the last three calendar years driven perhaps by any number of the global systemic risks that currently exist we were certainly much too early on the recession call two years ago we shared this chart as a compelling indicator of a coming recession we update it here and now find it even more compelling divergence between sentiment and consumption precedes recessions source st louis federal reserve bank bloomberg data as of march 2019 notice the divergence between the hard consumption data and the soft consumer confidence data ahead of each recession sentiment remains strong before a recession while actual economic indicators are weakening and this time the divergence has become more pronounced we believe this chart combined with other late cycle indicators stock market volatility bond market action and central bank behavior all suggest a recession remains in the forecast and probably may occur sooner than many expect if the economy tumbles into recession we expect financial risks to escalate that drive gold higher u s federal debt is growing fast federal debt totals about 75 of u s gross domestic product gdp and is growing rapidly trillion dollar annual deficits were first seen in the obama administration and now president donald trump s policies will again drive deficits through the trillion dollar mark 4 5 of gdp beginning in 2022 according to the congressional budget office cbo unlike in the obama years we rarely hear politicians complaining about the debt level spending more is easy while cutting budgets seems politically impossible in washington because of this we believe a debt crisis is imminent although the breaking point is difficult to forecast it may come in the next recession or at a time when rates spike as foreign holders of u s treasuries lose confidence in washington if cutting spending is impossible growth is weak and raising revenue by hiking taxes even higher is limited then we see only two options for handling u s debt default or monetization modern monetary theory is not the answer some politicians have begun to prepare the nation for debt monetization so far no adverse consequences of the sovereign debt build up have shown up in the financial system meanwhile easy monetary and fiscal policies have not ignited inflationary pressures in consumer prices as a result a radical form of financial thinking has emerged called modern monetary theory mmt key characteristics of mmt include any country that prints its own currency can do so to pay national debts or finance deficits deficits don t matter as long as interest rates remain below gdp growth the natural rate of interest in a fiat currency world is 0 inflation can be controlled through taxation rate increases and regulation of big business economies should be guided by fiscal policy i e government spending and taxation the central bank would essentially be controlled by the treasury prominent economists and financial leaders have characterized mmt as fallacious garbage and just wrong we agree with these characterizations and suspect that those reading this update intuitively understand why if adopted mmt would likely lead to currency debasement and hyper inflation on a scale seen in weimar germany almost 100 years ago or in modern day venezuela bond prices might collapse with the u s dollar and a financial crisis would probably ensue long before mmt is implemented in its full form unfortunately there are fewer and fewer americans who are familiar with the level of financial risk that we currently face including even those within government held roles at the highest levels furthermore less than half of young adults now have a positive view of capitalism according to a deutsche bank report the percentage of americans who say reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority has shrunk from 71 in 2013 to 48 in 2019 amid this complacency towards debt disdain of capitalism and changing political ideas it is not hard to imagine mmt gaining in popularity and acceptance as the next presidential cycle unfolds americans regardless of political ideology may find the lure of free money irresistible in addition to purportedly taking care of our indebtedness mmt can supposedly help pay for a progressive agenda of healthcare and employment for all abandonment of fossil fuels and free college tuition what might be a more viable option how about an investment in a reasonably valued preexisting asset class with a proven track record as an alternative store of value and negative correlation to the u s dollar for that one need not look any further than gold and gold shares important definitions and disclosures all company

if you wish to boil an ocean do not ask for ways because there aren t any with the federal investigation agency s entry into the forex market pakistanis are soon likely to witness a market failure turning into a government failure the demand for us dollar the reserve currency always increases whenever a local currency faces volatility and there are scant opportunities for business and investment when people with money lose trust in a market it is a gloomy scenario economies on the verge of default or hyperinflation tend to behave in this fashion argentina and brazil have long wrestled with the problem pakistan has seen the best of times and the worst of times today it is probably best to describe the situation as bizarre nothing the government has done so far has eased the plight of the people the usd is currently in short supply in the open market it is available in the black market at a higher rate why are people resorting to dollar hoarding first people are buying dollars to conserve the value of their money the inflation appears poised to touch the double digit hardly can a currency absorb such inflationary pressures without losing value interestingingly the first probable cause of the ongoing inflationary trend is none other than devaluation in november 2018 the state bank pricked the bubble of our over valued currency hoping thereby to boost exports the great expectations did not materialize many argue that our exports heavily rely on imported inputs while our exports failed to budge in the wake of devaluation we succeeded in importing inflation which is currently driving the commodities market government inspectors may enter the open market without a legal basis or justification and make headlines however they will do this at the cost of leading it into a shadow economy in today s digital age of cryptocurrencies and block chain technologies one should be cautious about deploying simple policing tactics to symptoms of complex economic issues second a central bank having a hands on exchange rate and interest rate can easily lose precision in capital markets this is also known as an impossible trinity economics 101 this factor too has contributed to aggravating the situation the shortage of dollars in the open market can cause capital to take off or go underground there is more to it than mere dollar hoarding third the market is rife with speculation ensuing primarily from certain economic indicators people in financial markets are known to be intelligent enough to broadly perdict the future course of events the media meanwhile is reporting confusing statements by political leaders sometimes these reports are quoted out of context occasionally there is a sheer lack of responsibility the speculation bubble is sucking in more and more of stable reserves as people expect smart gains over a short span fourth spending cuts introduced early to reduce the fiscal deficit have slowed down economic activity finished stocks are piling up while wait and buyers are indecisive those in control of money are perplexed only a few years ago real estate offered a good investment opportunity this is no more the case so what options are left to the people having some savings at hand should they wait idly and watch their savings lose value or cause the government more head ache by buying dollars or move their assets abroad ideally none of this should happen but the onus for acting responsibly is the heaviest on on the government the central bank needs to be granted complete autonomy and robust accountability mechanism installed it should immediately establish its credibility and transparency of its operations in the short run it should curb the seemingly abnormal incentive in dollar hoarding by categorically denying the rumors of devaluation after all urs is not an open float so there is no harm in issuing a policy statement to the effect that the usd will remain in the float band to complement monetary initiatives the government should also make fiscal adjustments on the expenditure side in order to create investment opportunities people with money cannot just sit and wait time is a great driver money makes its way a government cannot control public behaviour if it is unable to provide choices latin american countries have tried it they learned the lesson the hard way we should take a leaf from their book government inspectors can enter the open market without a legal basis and make headlines but they do so at the cost of leading the trade into shadow economy in this age of cryptocurrencies and block chain technologies one should be cautious while deploying simple policing tactics to deal with symptoms of complex economic issues the writer is a public policy scholar at lee kuan yew school of public policy singapore
the us dollar fell against most of the major currencies over the past week the yen and the swiss franc were the exceptions the technical correction we anticipated last week may have some more room to run however we do view it as a counter trend move and expect the data to show the us economy picked up some momentum going into the end of q1 if recession fears are exaggerated so too are expectations that the federal reserve will cut rates an adjustment of such expectations can be the fuel of the next leg up for the dollar dollar index the dollar index tried one more time to push through the 97 50 area at the start of last week and gave up and retreated to about 96 75 where the 50 day moving average is found ahead of the weekend it traded below its 20 day moving average 96 90 for the first time this month but managed to close just above it the move that we think is being corrected began ironically with the low on march 20 when the fomc last met and the dollar index posted an outside down day but there was no follow through and before the past week it had risen in the nine of the 12 sessions after the fomc meeting it had retraced 38 2 of the move by the middle of last week 96 85 but before the weekend made a push lower toward the 50 retracement 96 65 the 61 8 retracement is found about 20 ticks lower the five day moving average 97 02 is poised to fall below the 20 day moving average 96 90 which may be a useful proxy for some models the technical indicators we look at also suggest scope for more declines waiting for some sign of a reversal may be preferable to trying to catch the falling knife that said on a risk reward basis a dip below 96 50 would look attractive euro the single currency was capped near 1 1285 it looked as if the market was about to give up and then talk of a large direct investment related euro yen trade propelled it higher as stops were triggered it was the first time in nearly three weeks that the euro traded back into its old range 1 1300 1 1500 the technical condition is still constructive although it was disappointing that it failed to close above 1 13 the 5 and 20 day moving averages are set to cross and many of the late shorts are in weak hands the next target is 1 1350 which is retracement target and the 100 day moving average above there the 1 1400 area would beckon on the downside a convincing break of 1 1280 would be a warning sign that the correction may be flagging while a move below 1 1250 would suggest the upper end of the new range has been found yen in the middle of last week the dollar tested trendline support that connects the flash crash low january 3 a little below jpy105 and the march lows jpy109 75 it was near jpy110 85 in the middle of last week and the dollar sprung higher it pushed through jpy112 00 for the first time ahead of the weekend and the highest close since a week before last christmas although we look for the dollar to head toward jpy114 jpy115 the charts suggest caution the upper bollinger band is nearby jpy112 20 the slow stochastics have not confirmed the new highs setting up a potential bearish divergence and the macds have not generated a strong signal a setback toward jpy111 60 may provide a new opportunity to play for a breakout sterling for two and a half weeks sterling has bounced between 1 30 and 1 32 but from a slightly larger vantage point it is carving out a triangle this is most commonly seen as a continuation pattern in this case that is bullish the top of the triangle is drawn from the march 13 high near 1 3380 and late march high and early april high it came in near 1 3135 ahead of the weekend and arguably held sterling back from strong gains the lower part of the triangle begins with the march 11 low of about 1 2950 and connects the march 29 and april 4 lows it is found a little below 1 3010 at the end of next week the technicals have not turned but pullbacks to the lower end of the triangle may offer good risk reward canadian dollar in january and february the us dollar traded between cad1 3100 and cad1 3300 with a few exceptions it moved into a higher range in march it now seems to be in a cad1 3300 and cad1 3440 the market seems comfortable in that range and the three month implied volatility is at five year lows 5 2 outside of a few months in 2014 the implied volatility has not been below 5 since 2000 australian dollar the australian dollar advanced nearly 1 last week to extend its streak to three weeks ahead of the weekend it almost reached 0 7200 for the first time since late february a trendline from last november and late january highs comes in near there as does the 200 day moving average the aussie has not closed above its 200 day moving average in a little over a year the technical indicators suggest there is near term to push through it the next hurdle is near 0 7250 positive news from china seemed to offset news of potentially large layoffs and branch reduction by australia s largest lender mexican peso the mexican peso was the second strongest currency in the world last week only bested by the argentine peso 1 7 vs 4 1 the dollar had its lowest close so far this year ahead of the weekend mxn18 75 it appears the high interest rates are drawing capital offsetting the talk that many domestics are bringing savings offshore the next technical target is near mxn18 40 but a move toward mxn18 00 cannot be ruled out it is not a tail risk given the current volatility there is a reasonably good chance it may be seen in the coming months peso strength will add pressure on the central bank to cut rates which explains the appeal to many levered accounts and the attractiveness of the mexican cetes oil every day wti for june delivery bumped up against resistance near 65 a barrel it is primarily a supply story opec cuts are deeper than the commitments venezuela and libyan supply have been compromised and the us has yet to decide on the waivers from the embargo against iran the price of wti has risen for the past six consecutive weeks and has only fallen three weeks of this year s first 15 weeks the technical indicators are stretched of course but they have not turned down us rates for only the second time this year the us 10 year yield rose in back to back weeks it was virtually flat coming into the end of the week and despite the softer university of michigan inflation expectations the yield jumped six basis points rising oil and stock prices and the data that made gave credence to ideas that it too is finding better traction were thought to have spurred the sales the next important target is near 2 60 that had been the floor through most of the first quarter the june note futures closed at its lowest level since march 20 a break of 122 26 could signal losses toward 122 00 in the first two weeks of april the implied yield of the january 2020 fed funds futures fell 13 basis points to about 2 285 given the current average effective rate is 2 41 there is scope for more adjustment

for a country that its total debt profile has risen to n24 387t where subsidy for imported petrol stood at n10t between 2006 and 2018 and where the number of poor nigerians stands at 91 million while unemployment figure settles at 20 9 million the federal government is only rubbing salt in the wound if yearly losses of over n132 5b from its four refineries are allowed to continue kingsley jeremiah writes on the challenges of the refineries and the way forward everywhere in the world particularly in oil producing countries the business of refining crude oil is an elixir for improved economic performance provision of jobs for a large number of people reduction of capital flight and the building of a new set of industries especially petrochemicals but in the case of nigeria africa s largest oil producer refineries are more of a drainpipe and a means through which few individuals enrich themselves at the detriment of the masses while the slogan of the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc operator of the nation s refineries is we touch your life in many possible ways the operations of the refineries located in port harcourt warri and kaduna have affected the country in so many negative ways to be more specific while analysis from nnpc financial records show that the corporation recorded losses in the region of n551 46b from january 2015 to december 2018 refineries top the reasons why loses were not abating indeed the country s refineries made a total loss of n132 5b in 2018 alone that is a 39 per cent increase from the n95 09b losses it incurred in 2017 while the refineries remained dormant budgit a public finance focused non governmental organisation state that the federal government spent about n10tn on the payment of subsidy on imported fuel between 2006 and 2018 these developments put immense pressure on the country s foreign exchange national reserves standard of living infrastructural development as well as lead to unemployment and import of by products of petroleum etc this year alone a princely sum of n1 149 385t is estimated to go into the payment of subsidy on petrol imported with the provision of a mere 1b for what which is about n305b in the 2019 budget year the country has been projected to run into a massive budget deficit if nothing is done about the development the breakdown shows that at the prevailing 2 54 per gallon of fuel in the united states which translates to n774 7 at the official exchange rate of n305 to 1 a litre of petrol in the country costs n193 68 on the average going by the last pricing template released in 2018 by the petroleum products pricing regulatory agency pppra additional cost elements of n14 3 per litre is required to cover retailers margin bridging fund dealers cost and transporters pay similarly with daily crude oil allocation to these refineries the nation s education health security agricultural sectors are collapsing while the country remains the world s poverty capital apart from importing more than 80 per cent of needed petroleum products the multiplier effects of this development forces the country to import common products like toothpick indeed nigeria is reportedly one of the largest consumer of refined products in africa after egypt south africa algeria and morocco with the development the country accounts for over seven per cent of africa s refined products consumption in 2015 alone the refined products consumption was estimated to be about 24 billion litres and products consumed include premium motor spirit pms automotive gas oil ago dual purpose kerosene dpk and aviation turbine kerosene atk to the detriment of national earnings these products are majorly imported from the united states north western europe and other sources as the development in nigeria has been a serious debate there is a paradigm shift for other national oil companies noc across the world an international oil and energy market expert and economist stephen george chief economist americas kbc in a paper tilted the noc on effect how national oil companies are changing the face of the industry showed how noc are increasingly flexing their commercial muscles in refined oil product markets to them while nigeria is unable to turn around its refineries the next few years would see new capacity start ups in kuwait oman saudi arabia and other middle eastern and asian countries this is coming at a time when the middle east moves to even greater product surpluses the expectations were that differences in inter regional margins will narrow and asian and european competition will intensify on the back of their recent project start ups both saudi s aramco and abu dhabi national oil company adnoc are demonstrating new commercial acumen with aramco now streamlining its businesses and opening itself for scrutiny ahead of a planned initial public offering ipo similarly parts of adnoc are being privatised and the company is seeking a strategic

current state of the refineries with a combined installed capacity of 445 000 barrels per day the refineries have for many years performed far below the installed capacity most of the refineries have been in a roller coaster mode especially throughout 2018 the refineries have not been working at up to 15 per cent capacity as of today in 2018 the port harcourt refinery despite being idle almost throughout the year posts the biggest loss of n59 96b the kaduna refinery recorded n31b losses while the warri refinery recorded a deficit of n41 71b in total the n13 58b was lost in january n8 05b in february n11 88b in march n20 08b in may n14 51b in june n10 45b in july n10 79b in august n6 97b in september n9 32b in october n9 58b in november and n17 31b in december the refineries made a profit of n6 32bn in april for the first time in 10 months the warri refinery was idle in january september and october 2018 why refineries are performing poorly according to most experts poor maintenance is one of the key reasons why all the refineries are currently performing far below expectation the last time some of the refineries were maintained was in 2013 without significant improvement over 20b has already been spent on turn around maintenance tam of these refineries since inception operating under the worst form of bureaucracy and opacity decisions for repairs of technical faults as small as bolts and nuts require approval from abuja professor of petroleum economics and policy research omowumi iledare insists that corruption tribalism funding and sundry mundane factors were responsible for the perennially poor state of the refineries iledare sees no transparency and accountability in the manner which government runs these refineries especially the funds allegedly spent on them i think the way the government spends money to maintain the refineries leaves a lot to be desired as far as i am concerned the government is not particular about getting optimum value from the money it is investing in the refinery that has been the case from one government to the other for adenikinju apart from the bureaucratic nature of the operations of the refineries foundational downstream challenges were enough to keep the refineries as they are for example government instead of deregulated and competitive markets is controlling prices of petroleum products i think the whole pricing policy frameworks needs to be changed if we want the downstream petroleum sector to be virile and efficient i am appalled at the continuous poor performance of the refineries and the drain on the lean fiscal resources of the government the poor performance has become endemic and in my view it has come to a time for the government to take a decisive position on the refineries under the current pricing regime for gasoline and the ownership structure of the refineries they cannot be profitable adenikinju said the current state of the refineries is embarrassing to ekpo and that is why he insists that mismanagement and corruption were part of the key issues affecting the facilities he believes that the elites in the oil business who prefer to import products with government subsidy than to allow the refineries to work in the interest of the economy were responsible for the woes the refineries have not worked to near capacity for several years millions of dollars have been spent on repairs and turnaround maintenance yet the country still imports refined petroleum products he said chairman of tricontinental group and former president of the nigerian american chamber of commerce chief olabintan famutimi is of the view that challenges facing the refineries are man made and designed to benefit a few individuals particularly people who are benefiting from oil subsidy he added that government has no business in doing business even as he fingered the ownership structure as a main challenge like famutimi the director general infrastructure concession regulatory commission icrc chidi izuwah said that government must let go of its dominance in the downstream sector and bring in the private sector as this is the only way to go when you bring in the private sector you must change the incentive structure when the issue of the poor performance of refineries was tabled at the recent nigerian international petroleum summit an industry stakeholder who works for the dangote group babajide soyode insisted that there were no justifiable reasons for the country s refineries to be dilapidated why can t the nnpc reactivate or upgrade its refineries they are not old upgrading as any engineer would tell you is standard in our industry all these collocation and others are nonsense follow the industry standard and upgrade what you have we are talking of nnpc being efficient those refineries were built at an average of 1m warri for n357m kaduna was n377m that is roughly 1m 1 3m now if you have been subsidising you have not accrued enough to maintain the refineries not to talk of upgrading or expanding then it is shameful that nnpc would be looking for 1m to pay consultants for a study it s a shame for nigeria subsidy payment was introduced in 1986 and the aim was to alleviate poverty now it is 32 33 years of subsidy can anybody tell me one poor person whose live has been made better by this it is the elite that have been enjoying the subsidy he said but as far as nape chief adesanya is concerned the lack of transparency and accountability are compounding challenges faced by the refineries i know that it is not lack of what needs to be done that is creating the problem but the commitment to doing something transparent and honourable president muhammadu buhari must ensure that these negative performances are reversed i don t see why we cannot run profitably adesanya stated eromosele on his part stated that government s interference and lack of transparency were the major factors hindering profitability of the refineries insisting that the performance of the subsidiaries was shameful when compared with others across the world speaking specifically on the kaduna refinery and challenges such as pipeline vandalism which hinder the flow of crude head energy research ecobank dolapo oni said that refinery will constantly have problems because of its distance from any crude oil field the refinery depends on pipeline from the niger delta laid up to the north it is also equipped with only one month storage capacity the implication is that even if crude oil flow stops for only three weeks the refinery is out of supply those are the disadvantages we have to battle with gainers and losers in current rot earlier in the year the group managing director of the nigerian national petroleum corporation maikanti baru let out the most shocking fact about the refineries according to him the nation s refineries had not undergone turn around maintenance tam for an aggregate of 42 years combined this is a direct revelation indicating that about 2b which was reportedly spent on the asset ended in the pockets of a few nigerians the house of representatives had earlier alleged mismanagement of fund in maintaining these assets and turned down an application requesting for additional 1 8b for a fresh tam a lot of experts who insisted that tam remains a major scam that must be investigated noted that oil marketers and some elite were indeed frustrating the operation of the refineries to their gains famutimi described the current performance of the refineries as an organised sabotage orchestrated by high ranking government officers and business owners who prefer personal gains to national interest importing refined oil means nigerians would have to pay more to access petroleum products which creates daily hardship for the nigerian people also if the refineries were functioning at full capacity they would create more jobs and economic opportunities for the people he said possible solutions given the current state of the refineries most analysts insist that the government must find a way to either sell the assets off commercialise them by raising money from ipo or return them to the original operators shell for proper maintenance commercialisation may be preferred one is referring to a situation where the public holds majority ownership but privately managed if privatisation must be undertaken then it must be through public offer with limit on how much an individual can buy there must be complete transparency ekpo said while evidence from other sectors such as telecommunications education and transportation show that the nigerian economy as a whole stands to benefit from private participation and investment in deregulating the downstream sector olawuyi noted that the sector needed to be opened up experts like iledare were hopeful that the new nnpc expected to be born from the pibg would manage the refineries properly since the corporation would ordinarily run as a commercial entity he equally raised concerns over the delay in the passage of the bill which has been debated over the past two decades
cislac boss suggests fixing refineries to block wastages funke olaode from washington dc onyebuchi ezigbo and chineme okafor in abuja the nigeria labour congress nlc has cautioned the federal government against heeding the advice of the international monetary fund imf to remove subsidy on petroleum products because the move would result in astronomical increase in the pump price of petroleum and cost of other goods and services instead the president of nlc ayuba wabba who spoke during the inauguration of the local organising committee for 6th african meeting of solidarity with cuba in abuja said the federal government should do something urgently to revamp the local refineries which are presently in camotose due to high level conspiracies but the nigerian association of energy economists naee was rather in support of the recent call on nigeria by imf to end subsidy on petrol saying it was beneficial only to elites in the country also the executive director of civil society legislative advocacy centre a not for profit organization based in abuja mr auwal musa rafsanjani has called on the nigeria government to yield to imf s call on the need to end subsidy by fixing the refineries and by extension prevent avoidable wastages that have continued to stymie the nation s economy but the nlc which disagreed with the imf maintained that among the agenda usually set for any president that emerges in the country are the devaluation of currency removal of subsidy and opening of the country s borders to free trade wabba said the meaning of fuel subsidy in the understanding of the nlc is nothing but funding inefficiency in the downstream sector according to him the solution to the problem of subsidy is local refining of products which will drive down cost of products and end the corruption associated with the present subsidy regime in nigeria the removal of subsidy is synonymous with price increase and all of us know that the system is shrouded in corruption so clearly that recommendations is not only faulty it is wrong nlc consistently said that what needs to be done is to refine products for domestic use so naturally you will kill subsidy and corruption and do what imf is prescribing is to transfer the corrupt tendencies of the so called subsidy now to the citizens the fact of the matter is that nigerians are so impoverished that any price increase certainly cannot be pushed down the throat of every nigerian and so let s tell our government that they should be wary of this decision he said speaking further he claimed that the issue of whether there is indeed fuel subsidy as president muhammadu buhari had queried some years back that question has not been answered we are actually corroborating what the president said in the past that subsidy is corruption who subsidising what this has remained the position of the nlc for many years he said arguing that refining the crude locally was not rocket science the nlc president said that the union would soon submit a documented position on how to solve the troublesome issue of fuel subsidy in the country he said from the findings of the nlc nothing was wrong with the country s refineries other than conspiracies by the beneficiaries of the fuel subsidy scam there is nothing wrong with our refineries the existing refineries can be upgraded from one capacity to another even the four refineries that we have if the service are upgraded they could serve the entire west african sub region and beyond but because it pays more for corrupt tendencies that is why we prefer importation than refining products locally for domestic use he posited that countries like venezuela is being celebrated for their principled stand on implementing policies that support local refining of petroleum products we knew that venezuela is our counterpart among the oil producing countries in the world before the conspiracy against venezuela the country refined products for domestic consumption and among the opec countries fuel sold the cheapest in venezuela he added earlier the cuban ambassador carlos trejo said his country made various strides in the field of education medicine and technology adding that nigeria and other african countries have benefited from her unique products and multilateral assistance but the group of energy economists was of the view that nigeria s continuous structuring of her national budget around oil prices and production benchmarks were inimical to her economic development adding that as long as she has no control over global oil price movements her budgets with such benchmarks would remain unstable speaking to journalists in abuja on the upcoming annual conference of the association holding this week naee s president prof wumi iledare explained that nigeria could not go on with the practice of subsiding petrol noting that the conference would focus on energy access and efficiency imperatives for sustainable development in emerging economies iledare suggested that the practice was wasteful and often done to the detriment of other key sectors of the country such as infrastructure health and education he also claimed that nigeria s petrol subsidy expenditure in 2018 was way more than she budgeted for education health and defence in the same year the benefits of petroleum subsidy is far less than the cost of petroleum subsidy anytime a government has a policy there is need for it to be reviewed to see whether the benefits that come from the policy is more than the cost and all you need to do is look around the roads are bad schools are bad hospitals and infrastructure are bad or not there i have not added it together but do a check when you look at the budget for health education and defence they are not up to the petroleum subsidy in 2018 is it not time for the government to look at it iledare however buttressed this saying do you know what a litre of petrol is in ghana it is one dollar equivalent and you have porous countries around you nigeria which you are not even protecting and you don t even have the actual amount of petrol because you are subsiding what you bring in and not what you actually consume government must review this he said he understood the government might be scared of public uproar if it stopped petrol subsidy but encouraged it to go ahead because according to him the most recipients of the scheme were elites that could afford petrol at market based prices i understand the social unrest is scary but it will be for a while especially if there is enough public education on the subsidy we are losing the capacity that we have because we are actually giving the elites who are capable of paying for their petrol to drive their car at a giveaway price added iledare on structuring the national budget around oil price benchmarks he explained that the combination of pricing and production volumes to calculate the oil revenue expected to fund the budget was wrong and unwise one of it which is price is highly unstable and that means you base your budget over the year on a price that in three months will change and that is why you see every year we scramble we have budgeted on price that we have no control government sources of revenue for project in any part of the world is taxation and that means paying your taxes demonstrates you are a citizen government has no other source of money except taxes and when they want to invest they take dividends but the moment you start taking your money from the gross revenue that you have without thinking about putting something back to build the equity is when you have depleted reserves he explained according to him most governments of nigeria have adopted energy policies that are based on woolly thinking and regional sentiments woolly thinking is when you have policies that have no thread and that is why when one government comes it abandons things that are not intellectually debatable and reinvent the wheel as per regional sentiment is there any policy in nigeria that is not regional based depending on which region of the country the person governing comes from politicians cannot solve professional problems using sentiments he stated rafsanjani in an exclusive interview with thisday said the call became imperative looking at the alarming rate at which the nation s resources are being wasted on subsidy which has not reflected or added any value to the life of an ordinary nigerian the international monetary fund call was right this is worrisome looking at huge amount of money spent annually on subsidy nigeria should have done away with the subsidy long time ago the present administration while coming promised to stop paying subsidy because they discovered at that time that it is a scam it is fraud and nothing is being subsidized unfortunately we have not seen that commitment being fulfilled by the government the government is spending a lot of money on subsidy for me and many nigerians the problem is not about subsidy the problem is about corruption it is about inefficiency in the management of so called subsidy because once some people imported petroleum to nigeria they claimed to have brought certain amount of tones of petroleum which is not being verified or authenticated and yet they get their payment in a recent report over n5 trillion has been spent on subsidy in the last four years it is scary the only way out for the federal government of nigeria is to fix the refineries so that money being spent on subsidy can be channeled towards education health and infrastructure he said commenting on the concerns raised on the state of the nigerian economy he said nigeria had found itself in zero economic stagnation in which the world bank has rated us because of absence of sound economic team that would help drive the nation it is very disturbing to see the world bank situation and analysis of nigeria economy i think it is also very clear because of the absence of sound economic team that is why we are not making necessary progress in terms of consolidating and strengthening our economy in nigeria therefore it is not surprising given the fact that nigeria has not made appreciable progress in terms of diversification of economy in terms of effective economic management which is as a result of sound policy or legislative framework that would deal with the economy particularly oil and gas sector you would recall that we have been advocating for the nigerian government to ensure that we have petroleum industry law in the country which has been languishing in the national assembly which would have helped to ensure the economy is strengthened would have eliminated corruption duplication of responsibility as well as inefficiency there are other institutions that have warned nigerian government in terms of ensuring that it should have been more focused with more productive way of improving the economy because once the economy is not rolling well definitely the issue of poverty employment issues of living and decency in the living condition would have been too much i will advise the federal government to fix the economy first on the illicit financial flow he noted that it was a serious issue because in the region nigeria account for over 70 per cent of the illicit financial flow in west africa and this is an alarming rate which he said has not stopped it is still happening therefore there is no way a nation can have vibrant and productive financial system once people are deliberate and consciously siphoning public funds abroad i think government s anti corruption should intensify more effort to block these leakages and we must make sure that people that are found guilty or caught in the act are interrogated and prosecuted and recovered money can be injected back into the economy so that the issues of poverty and employment can be reduced unfortunately we have not seen that drastic measure or action happening he lamented expressing his view on poverty which the world finance body claimed was like a time bomb ready to explode by 2030 cislac boss said nigeria doesn t have to wait until 2030 because poverty has already exploded in nigeria when you have a large percentage of the population that is living in abject poverty and cannot afford descent living they cannot afford education and so on they are already in abject poverty and that is why you see a lot of crises going on in nigeria the crises is going on unabated because of lack of government s plan to come up with programmes that would deal with poverty by expanding economic base that would encourage diversification more investment from local and international investors that would help create jobs that would address the issue of unemployment a lot of nigerian youths are idle they cannot feed themselves and you need to go round and see how poverty is walking naked although nigerian government claimed it has achieved so much in the area of agriculture particularly in rice production he said it was a claim which to him was not backed by any statistics well just last week there was a report of an alleged tons of rice being smuggled into the country so if we are actually producing that the issue of smuggling would have stopped i think government should stop propaganda and actually focus on work that international community would appreciate because there is a limit at which one can blow obvious lies so i will advise government at local state and federal levels to focus more on work and stop propaganda that would not take us anywhere and will be raising a false hope and because one state is producing rice does not mean that the entire 36 states in the federation is producing rice and shouldn t be used as a measure of complete success he therefore called on the nigerian government that it should be more focused block leakages and stop making exaggeration put sound economy team in place create economic diversification that would encourage private sector to drive the nation s economy
fragile and delicate the adjectives said it all the mood at the spring meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank was sombre the global economy has weakened in the past six months and the fund thinks the risks are skewed to the downside the caution is justified even though in some respects the outlook is less gloomy than the fund suggests for a start there are some tentative signs that activity has bottomed out the removal of the threat of higher interest rates from central banks has provided a boost to confidence a substantial package of tax cuts and spending increases has arrested the growth deceleration in china two of the threats highlighted by the imf in its world economic outlook a full blown trade war between china and the us and a disruptive brexit look less serious than they did a month ago the imf has some extremely smart economists but its short term forecasting record is not impressive it is possible things will turn out better than it expects so why the uncertain mood there are three big reasons worth looking at in ascending order of importance first the finance ministers and central bank governors who gathered in washington know they lack policy space if things go wrong there is a sense quite justified that measures taken to stave off recessionary pressures now will simply lead to even bigger problems later on when that moment comes interest rates will be low central banks will be stuffed full of bonds acquired in the last round of quantitative easing and public debt will be high the imf gives short shrift to modern monetary theory the idea that countries with their own currencies don t have to worry about accumulating debt because they can print money to pay for public spending but there are not that many options available one option suggested by ken rogoff of harvard university in an imf lecture is negative interest rates which he argued was made more feasible by the move towards cashless economies another way out would be a coordinated global expansion of fiscal policy mirroring the tax cuts and spending increases that the strategically important countries implemented in the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago but this leads on to a second reason to be worried international cooperation is much weaker than it was in 2008 09 and multilateralism is under threat sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk this is primarily an american problem which began under barack obama s presidency and has become a lot worse under donald trump the us is reluctant to show global leadership but is extremely hostile to the idea that another country china might fill the vacuum as a result the us approach is to be tactically aggressive imposing tariffs and threatening to gum up the works at the world trade organisation but strategically defensive an isolationist us objects to beijing s belt and road initiative but is offering nothing positive itself the us and china may well piece together an agreement that will prevent a new round of tit for tat tariffs but the underlying tension will remain finally there s climate change which has moved up the agenda at the imf and the world bank the best soundbite of the week came from sir david attenborough when explaining the real and growing threat of a new era of extinction sweeping through the natural world it s hard to exaggerate the peril we are in those responsible for running the global economy have belatedly woken up to the need to act on global warming and they now know all the right things to say growth needs to be sustainable growth needs to be decarbonised growth needs to be compatible with meeting the commitments to reduce greenhouse gases made at the 2015 paris conference translating these words into action is another matter and the problems are many the pushback from a fossil fuel industry resistant to change years of austerity that have made it much harder for governments to raise taxes on petrol and diesel as witnessed by the yellow vest protests in france the demands of the developing world for power and political systems that provide incentives to kick the can down the road history provides a lesson of what ought to happen seventy five years ago this summer a gathering at a hotel in new hampshire led to the creation of the imf and the world bank and helped shape the global economy for decades to come the bretton woods conference essentially took the principles of the new deal full employment shared prosperity government intervention and internationalised them the summits at yalta and potsdam established the framework for postwar international politics bretton woods did the same for economics a new pamphlet by kevin gallagher of the global development policy center in boston and richard kozul wright director of the globalisation and development strategies division at the united nations conference on trade and development unctad argues the case for a new multilateralism that would update the principles that underpinned the bretton woods settlement with the need for environmental sustainability the authors call for public investment in clean energy and transport systems a green industrial policy raising wages in line with productivity so that labour gets its fair share of the fruits of growth regulating private financial flows and ending predatory financial practices to be sure it s the sort of manifesto the original architects of bretton woods would be coming up with if they were still around that s the good news the bad news is that the chances of the international community rallying round the idea of a global green new deal in the near future look pretty remote and as attenborough noted time is running out
adb economists said myanmar s ongoing economic reforms known as the sustainable development plan could boost development of the country s manufacturing and services sectors allowing myanmar to diversify its sources of economic growth for its part the imf also expressed a modestly positive view of the nation s economy in the medium term despite the mounting pressure of overseas risks the fund s economists said governmental spending has been subdued over the past few years but could increase in 2019 contributing to the widening fiscal deficit still the ongoing reforms could generate additional budget revenues particularly in the tourism and services sectors i hope that it is now obvious that myanmar is committed to creating not only a favourable but also a predictable facilitative and friendly investment environment myanmar state counselor aung san suu kyi said yet experts say these industries require additional investment and as private sector investors have yet to gain appetite for myanmar s assets the government could step up its efforts to improve national infrastructure european officials meanwhile are urging a greater openness of myanmar to international companies which they say could boost investment in the country due to its cheap workforce and loose regulations they say the years of political isolation along with the 2017 security crisis in rakhine state have hindered the nation s economic development read more gold extends gains amid weaker dollar higher oil prices in ministries there are a lot of people who really do want to change things but they are still stuck in the inheritance of years of isolation filip lauwerysen of the european chamber of commerce in myanmar said

the international monetary fund imf unveiled its most recent forecast for the world economic trends and potential risks in april s outlook tuesday based on the concerns already mentioned in january s world economic outlook such as the china u s trade tension and brexit the global economy is projected to grow by only 3 3 percent this year after the forecast was revised down from 3 5 percent in january projected growth of advanced economies including the united states the eurozone japan and the united kingdom and emerging economies such as india and brazil has been trimmed by 0 1 to 0 4 percentage point as the silver lining behind the dark clouds china is the only economy to be raised by a tenth of a percentage point in the 2019 growth forecast this subtle fine tuning is a vote of confidence for the chinese government s remarkable fiscal efforts to counter the internal and external downturn pressure in the medium term the imf may be deeply impressed one more time by the strong will of the chinese government to stabilize the economy with powerful implementation after the 2008 2009 four trillion yuan 595 52 billion u s dollars investment plan during the two sessions in march the government announced astonishing tax and operational cost cuts for the manufacturing sector by two trillion yuan 297 75 billion u s dollars only three weeks later the ministry of finance presented the budget details for the chinese fiscal year 2019 announcing the collection of value added tax and personal income tax will be reduced by 2 3 percent and 7 percent respectively compared with 9 percent and 15 9 percent actual increase in 2018 theoretically the new tax code could reduce the corporate and households financial burden by 1 02 trillion yuan 151 58 billion u s dollars per year equivalent to 1 06 percent of estimated gdp this year this severe cut could outshine president trump s tax cut and jobs act 2017 which was supposed to save 144 5 billion u s dollars or 0 7 percent of gdp in 2018 for american households and enterprises annually the passage of the new act prompted the imf to revise the u s growth forecast from 2 3 percent to 2 7 percent in 2018 when the actual growth was 2 9 percent we might argue that the imf could be a little more conservative in the chinese case the bold and creative monetary policy could be another significant reason for the imf s relatively optimistic stance which has repeatedly urged an accommodative policy since 2018 the people s bank of china china s central bank upon sensing the potential threats of a liquidity shortage and increased funding cost has lowered decisively the required rate of reserve for the commercial banks by 300 basis points enabling theoretically 4 trillion yuan 595 52 billion u s dollars to be utilized by the economy thanks to the easy policy the newly issued bank loan for the first two months has reached 4 12 trillion yuan 613 39 billion u s dollars an unprecedented record in history even exceeding the level in the same period of 2009 by 53 percent amazingly the quick credit expansion has not brought new troubles so far the overall debt ratio of industrial companies was 56 9 percent in february only 0 6 percentage point higher year on year unlike a conventional leveraging process china s central bank has been trying different means to sterilize the leverage added the most important tactics are to replace shadow banking with compliant leverage which can be easily monitored and managed from february 2018 to february 2019 the balance of newly issued loans summed to 17 32 trillion yuan 2 58 trillion u s dollars up 13 7 percent over the same period of the previous year while the balance of newly issued client entrusted loans and institutional trust loans two major types of the shadow banking business declined by 623 percent and 134 percent respectively secondly the regulator managed to keep most of the incremental liquidity from the property market so that no imminent threats of asset bubbles are in sight by the end of 2018 the outstanding personal home loans accounted for 18 9 percent of the total outstanding loan comparing to 18 2 percent in 2017 the 100 city home price index recorded a flat growth of 4 43 percent in march compared to 17 67 percent two years ago finally more leverage is guided to the neglected and disadvantageous groups small and micro businesses their access to financing channels has been made easier and less expensive by the end of 2018 bank loans for such enterprises reached 33 5 trillion yuan 4 99 trillion u s dollars the inclusive loan totaled 8 trillion yuan 1 19 trillion u s dollars growing by 18 percent over 2017 comparing the overall credit growth of 13 5 percent the financing cost could be as low as 3 15 percent targeted medium term lending facilities rate in the future the quantity and quality of financial service to the small and micro businesses will be included in the performance evaluation system for state owned commercial banks source cgtn
news analysis china has opened the credit spigot credit growth in march exceeded all estimates after a slowdown in february according to official central bank data on april 12 total social financing tsf a broad measure of credit within the chinese economy grew by a net 2 86 trillion yuan 426 billion in march compared to the previous month after a relatively modest increase of 703 billion yuan in february tsf includes financing that is outside of traditional banking loans such as loans issued by trust companies initial public offerings and bond offerings while beijing has pulled out all the stops to ensure economic growth are stable in the short term first quarter gdp gross domestic product figures will arrive next week it s exacerbating longer term leverage issues march s credit growth was broad based with financial institutions underwriting 1 69 trillion yuan 252 billion of new loans in march bank loans and m2 money supply a measure of cash in circulation also grew during the month this credit growth and an uptick in manufacturing purchasing managers index for march are signs that recent policy easing is bearing some fruit since last year beijing authorities and the people s bank of china have taken a series of measures to combat economic slowdown triggered by the 2017 deleveraging campaign and a debilitating trade war with the united states the easing measures included five cuts to banks reserve requirement ratios allowance of perpetual bond issuances and infrastructure spending in its dramatic shift to amplify infrastructure spending beijing has lifted debt quotas on local governments local authorities issued debt at a record pace during the first three months of the year most of the debt were special purpose for the financing of infrastructure projects such as subways and bridges timing is critical this round of stimulus measures and the resulting credit growth seems different unlike previous periods this series of policy easing isn t attempting to invigorate growth but to combat an ongoing growth slowdown march s credit growth will be seen as extremely helpful beijing is set to release its gdp growth rate for the first quarter next week all eyes are fixated on the first quarter gdp metric which will determine the course of action for the rest of the year at a macro level 2019 is an especially fraught year economically and politically the chinese communist party ccp leader xi jinping kicked off the year in january with a meeting to address extraordinary risks facing the economy and by extension china s political ideological and social stability various degrees of political anxiety will last the entire year april 15 will mark the 30th anniversary of the passing of former party leader hu yaobang a reformist whose death in 1989 was seen as one of the triggers for the tiananmen square student protests next month marks the 100th anniversary of the may 4th reformist movement and june brings the 30th anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre later in the year the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china will be commemorated needless to say a stable economy could go a long way towards mitigating political and social anxiety which will be a focal point for the ccp during 2019 trading future for present but china s longer term issues will likely worsen going forward beijing has essentially traded longer term economic health for near term stability the international monetary fund imf recently warned that china will face a sharp slowdown in the future if it continues to loosen monetary policy or engage in massive infrastructure spending to shore up growth according to imf s semi annual global financial stability report further monetary and credit support may exacerbate the existing financial vulnerabilities as faster credit growth will make it harder for smaller banks to clean up their balance sheets said imf s tobias adrian director of monetary and capital markets department during an april 10 press conference beijing has essentially abandoned its recent efforts to deleverage the economy and instead is doubling down on infrastructure and real estate two already overleveraged sectors regulators have also delayed reforms over china s sprawling asset management industry and instead are creating more potentially bad debts china s national audit office recently found that some banks in central henan province had registered 40 percent of their loan books as bad debt at the end of 2018 according to an april 8 financial times report in addition while recent tax cut measures are temporarily boosting consumption they come at the expense of putting pressure on local and regional budgets it s important to remember that the united states and european economies are still on solid footing so if china uses up all of its ammunition to stabilize economic growth during 2019 what will it do when the global economy really falters and demand slows

global economic growth is slowing according to the international monetary fund policymakers and hundreds of economists polled by reuters but that downturn is coming at a time when central banks arsenals are running on empty on tuesday the imf cut its expectations for world growth to its lowest level since 2016 its third downgrade since october and said risks to the global financial system have grown over the past six months this is a delicate moment for the global economy imf chief economist gita gopinath told a news conference major central banks have reined in their forecasts and in recent months economists in reuters polls have repeatedly trimmed their expectations for the countries they cover last week s releases provide some reassurance that the world economy is not falling off a cliff which had seemed a plausible if relatively small risk as recently as a month or so ago this is clearly good news said neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics but we remain in the late stages of this global economic expansion springtime inevitably brings with it an air of optimism for the future but in the case of the world economy at least we expect growth to remain subdued rising trade protectionism and tighter financial conditions have been blamed for the slowdown uncertainty over how to practically implement britain s june 2016 decision to quit the european union has also played its part trade conflict with the united states and sluggish demand means china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year a reuters poll showed on friday while still waging a trade war against china that is widely regarded as harmful to global growth u s president donald trump has now threatened to slap tariffs on 11 billion 8 4 billion pounds of products from the eu those threats come as british politicians continue to struggle to agree on a way to leave the eu a messy exit would almost certainly further damage the economies of both sides in the divorce with the impact likely spreading further afield in the early hours of thursday eu leaders gave britain six more months to leave the bloc but the latest extension still offers little clarity on when how or even if brexit will happen british prime minister theresa may has so far failed to build support in the uk parliament for the withdrawal terms she agreed with the eu last year but she now has until oct 31 to do that or find an alternative course brexit was originally supposed to have occurred two weeks ago but the intractability of the problem coupled with political incompetence on the part of the uk means that it has been postponed yet again said peter dixon an economist at commerzbank the scope for lifting brexit related uncertainty is thus limited which suggests little prospect of a sustainable rebound in either the economy or sterling the cupboard was bare what appears to be a globally synchronised economic slowdown comes as central banks run out of tools for supporting growth after the 2008 financial crisis policymakers slashed interest rates sometimes below zero and also turned to more unconventional measures to boost growth such as pumping trillions of dollars into economies but as inflation has never really picked up many of them have yet to change tack and start tightening the u s federal reserve led the pack and has hiked rates nine times in the current cycle but it is probably now done with increases until at least the end of next year the bank of england has lifted bank rate twice since the june 2016 referendum but borrowing costs remain very close to record lows and expectations for a rate hike later this year are far from set in stone the european central bank already on its longest break from changing interest rates may have missed its chance to raise them this time around altogether according to a median forecast in a reuters poll the first increase won t come until after june next year on wednesday ecb president mario draghi even raised the prospect of more support for the struggling euro zone economy if its slowdown persisted saying the central bank had plenty of instruments with which to react however one problem is that after pushing borrowing costs to record lows and taking 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds out of the market the ecb s options are limited and there are fears what it has will not be enough market pricing is expressing more anxiety that the ecb is either too slow to use whatever is left in its policy toolbox or worse that it thinks the tools won t do much anyway said laurence mutkin global head of g10 rates strategy at bnp paribas source reuters reporting by jonathan cable editing by hugh lawson

the u s economy is chugging toward a new record for longest expansion and middle class families finally are seeing decent wage gains yet our political leaders as if stuck in a time warp keep peddling a bleak narrative of economic victimhood and defeatism populists tell u s workers global capitalism is rigged against them sen elizabeth warren calls for breaking up big tech america s most innovative companies because they are well just too big among millennials socialism s stock is soaring even some prominent libertarians are defecting from the free market camp and learning to love the welfare state what a change from the 1990s when nearly everyone seemed certain that socialism was dead and buried and democratic capitalism reigned supreme around the world the economic gloom enveloping the nation s political academic and media elites trickles down to the public at large according to a new pew survey americans today are strikingly pessimistic about the future they see the united states as declining economically growing more unequal and becoming even more divided politically whatever happened to americans native optimism they ve been sideswiped by three disruptive developments the first is the advent of a globally connected knowledge economy which has taken a toll on blue collar america second market democracies in this century got stuck in a slow growth high inequality rut while autocratic china surged ahead the rancid cherry on top of these structural changes was the great recession of 2007 2009 intensified by the housing crisis and wall street s near meltdown this perfect economic storm has swept away middle income jobs slowed productivity and wage gains and undermined the traditional foundations of working and middle class security especially in the rust belt and rural communities it s also created a ton of new technology and wealth while delivering lopsided rewards to highly educated and cosmopolitan elites mix in the combustible new politics of immigration and identity and you have a surefire formula for political radicalization from the tea party and trumpean nationalism on the right to sen bernie sanders and the neo socialist left buffeted by these ideological crosscurrents it s easy to lose your political bearings yet while donald trump may hate free trade and millennials may get a transgressive rush from posturing as democratic socialists most americans haven t lost their deep rooted faith in economic freedom individual enterprise and market competition a gallup poll last year for example found that the public overwhelmingly 79 percent expresses a favorable view of free enterprise capitalism doesn t fare so well especially among young people nearly half of millennial and generation z respondents in a recent axios survey said they prefer living in a socialist country such attitudes likely are a spasm of protest against the diminished economic prospects facing young americans especially the 60 percent who don t have a college degree they ve experienced a shrinking pool of stable middle income jobs stagnant or falling wage growth escalating student debt and exorbitantly high college and housing costs but let s keep things in perspective previous generations endured much harder economic times yet they didn t jettison the foundational beliefs in economic liberty individual initiative and free markets that have made america the world s wealthiest country the great depression hit america like an asteroid after the stock market crashed in 1929 production plunged and the nation s economic output was cut almost in half in 1932 nearly 2 300 banks failed the following year as franklin d roosevelt took office the jobless rate hit nearly 25 percent legions of hobos roamed the nation desperate for work and discouraged immigrants steamed back to europe it took nearly a decade for the economy to recover mainly due to america s entry into world war ii the recent downturn and financial crisis was no picnic but it pales in comparison nonetheless both calamities shook public confidence in prevailing economic orthodoxy the gop s laissez faire policies of the 1920s gave way to the new deal s prolific federal interventions on behalf of the jobless farmers wage earners depositors retirees and poor mothers some of fdr s advisors urged him to replace free market chaos with planned economy sen huey long and father coughlin lead protest movements demanding that washington share the wealth and combat the machinations of international bankers roosevelt himself however neither succumbed to populist rage nor the collectivist doctrines spreading across europe instead he radiated a jaunty confidence that prosperity would soon return and he always insisted his goal was to restore free enterprise not replace it by creating a public counterbalance to private economic power that s why fdr is a better model for today s progressives than bernie sanders democrats won t build national majorities by rote business bashing or prattling about socialism which has never captured americans political imagination yet the berniecrats and demsocs flay the private sector as a squalid den of greed to redeem capitalism s moral failings they propose a stupendous program of top down redistribution medicare for all the green new deal free college guaranteed government jobs and they insist that all democrats walk the plank such sectarian purity tests are a real problem because ideas that may electrify activists in deep blue brooklyn may repel moderate and independent voters in swing districts in michigan or iowa the left s equation of boldness with statism is equally oblivious to another political reality most americans mistrust the federal government in a recent ppi expedition strategies poll for example only 20 percent of voters expressed confidence in washington s responsiveness to their concerns or problem solving abilities if they want to deny trump a second term democrats should disabuse themselves of the pernicious myth that neoliberalism has destroyed the american dream the anti capitalism narrative contains some elements of truth but vastly understates the role of technologically driven economic change while overstating the role of policy all the west s advanced economies have experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs and union membership slow productivity and economic growth and rising inequality this suggests deep structural forces are at work not a sinister plot by global elites to plunder the proletariat the neoliberal trope also mushes together republican and democratic presidents whose policies differed in intent and result if ronald reagan the two bushes bill clinton and barack obama can all be lumped together as capitalist tools what does calling them neoliberals convey beyond a general antipathy to free markets the truth is all u s presidents going back to fdr supported trade liberalizing treaties paid at least lip service to fiscal discipline tried to strike reasonable balances between economic innovation and regulation preferred work to the dole and extolled private enterprise as the mighty engine of u s prosperity u s voters especially in the key battleground states of the midwest are hungry for economic hope they want to see the middle of the middle class grow again and don t want to be forced to choose between growth and equity vibrant markets and reasonable redistribution how can democrats speak to the public s economic aspirations not by giving up on growth and painting a dreary picture of a future in which robots steal our jobs workers can t live on what they earn america can t compete with china and politics degenerates into battles over how to carve up a stagnant economic pie demsocs want democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left wing version of trump s splenetic and divisive populism instead democrats in 2020 should present voters with radically pragmatic ideas for helping americans get ahead for example let s give working people tax relief by eliminating the regressive payroll tax and replacing it with carbon and consumption taxes instead of promising free college tuition create a robust system of career education and upskilling for the 70 percent of young americans who don t go to or finish college instead of a fanciful green new deal democrats should accelerate the mass production of electric cars which would link carbon reduction to the creation of high wage jobs for working people instead of breaking up tech companies we should speed up digitizing the physical industries and create incubators for 3 d enabled manufacturing startups across the rust belt democrats in short have an opportunity in 2020 to seize the high ground of economic optimism and innovation donald trump has vacated that ground by embracing an odd amalgam of conservative and populist stances including tariffs that hurt u s producers and consumers closed borders false promises to bring back old factory jobs tax cuts skewed to the rich and paid for by huge public deficits not to mention his perverse crusade to strip millions of americans of health insurance on the other side the demsocs want democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left wing version of trump s splenetic and divisive populism instead democrats should channel the spirit of fdr and present voters with a hope inspiring plan for how a reinvigorated private sector and government can work together to restore shared prosperity
it s nice to have more money in your pocket and thanks to the 2017 tax cuts the typical american is now paying less in taxes but that s not to say we re not still sending a hefty sum of money to washington tally up all the payroll and other taxes on earnings and income and you ll find that the average american household forks over more than 26 000 to the feds each year last year washington collected more than 3 3 trillion in taxes so where exactly does all that money go some believe most of it goes to foreign aid and defense others think corporate subsidies dominate the budget in reality health entitlements medicare medicaid obamacare and social security are the largest and fastest growing programs unless congress fixes these four programs they and the ever growing interest payments on the national debt will consume every dollar of taxes paid by 2041 that leaves no money for anything else uncle sam couldn t spend a penny on defense food assistance highways or education without driving the country further into debt right now medicare medicaid and obamacare subsidies account for more than a quarter 28 8 of all federal spending ten years from now they re projected to gobble up more than a third of the budget meanwhile social security the single largest federal program accounts for roughly a quarter of all federal spending all by itself its trust funds already pay out more than they take in and its finances will only deteriorate faster as more and more boomers retire the social security trustees project that unless congress implements much needed reforms the program will run out of reserve funds by 2034 potentially triggering a 23 cut in benefits other income security programs veterans benefits food and housing assistance federal employee retirement and disability account for 16 of the budget that s more than we spend on national defense and the defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations overseas to the research development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment at 15 of the federal budget defense spending is the last major category of federal spending most of what is left goes to people and corporations who hold washington s ious currently 8 of the budget goes to interest payments on this debt over the coming decade u s debt held by the public is projected to balloon to nearly 93 of gross domestic product but don t blame that on inadequate taxation by 2024 the pro growth tax enacted in 2017 will actually raise more revenue yearly than the old system no the culprit here is runaway spending driven primarily by huge increases in health and social security outlays and the long term consequences of deficit spending are dire economic growth tends to slow in countries with debts that are as big as their economy the u s is quickly joining this group as the debt increases so does the cost of the interest we must pay to those who hold the debt china is currently the largest foreign holder of u s debt left unchecked growing government spending and historically high levels of debt will ultimately require higher taxes and just jacking up taxes on the rich won t cut it paying for big government requires high taxes on middle class americans too eventually rising debt will leave lawmakers with few options to avoid a financial crisis unless we can reverse course it is only a matter of time before every american will be forced to pay higher income and payroll taxes on tax day 2019 be thankful for the extra money the 2017 tax cuts deposited in your pocket but know that unless we insist that lawmakers suppress their seemingly insatiable appetite to spend we could all soon be paying much much more distributed by tribune content agency llc

in december macron s proposals were endorsed by german chancellor angela merkel and several other eu leaders however some northern european countries are still opposed to the idea citing the difference between their tight fiscal frameworks and the traditionally loose budget policies across the nations of southern europe some experts say countries such as spain italy and greece have been reliant on elevated levels of budget spending to support economic growth for decades meanwhile northern european nations have traditionally relied on foreign trade as the main source of growth while keeping taxes high and spending low the concern is that this difference in approach to fiscal policies could produce tensions within the future single budget area read more farage launches brexit party slams politicians in power as donkeys however moscovici says the eu has no choice but to advance integration in the face of mounting risks in the global economy he believes a single budget would level the playing field for private sector companies within the eu while allocating public sector investment where it needs to be regardless of national borders we are discussing a slowdown downside risks a possible next crisis we are seeing that all our countries struggle with inequalities that there is a rise of nationalism we cannot wait for five more years moscovici said i am quite sure that the economic social and political circumstances will lead us back to this greater ambition sooner rather than later the debate of a single budget comes as several southern european nations mainly greece still owe almost 300 bln euros to northern european primarily german lenders between the european debt crisis of 2011 and the greek fiscal meltdown of 2015 the german public has been predominantly opposed to bailouts and loans provided by berlin to countries such as portugal italy and greece
with the 2020 presidential election on the horizon there are currently over 15 serious democratic contenders competing for the party s nomination some candidates like andrew yang have detailed policy proposals they are consistent about others seem to keep maneuvering left with their positions in order to outflank their competitors while a few seem content to be like weather vanes ready to move in whatever direction the winds of populism are blowing it s a diverse group but the one thing they have in common is that they are running on the platform that capitalism is broken and only politicians can fix it we re told that income inequality is a great threat to american society that the gap between rich and poor has been widening for almost 50 years and that if it keeps on going like this the bottom half will grab the pitchforks and society will collapse according to them the only solution to save the middle class is the implementation of massive government social programs that can redistribute wealth to make everything fairer monetary policy with 22 trillion dollars in federal government debt that is now adding 1 trillion more to the pile every year a sane person can recognize that more massive spending is not a good idea because we can t even properly manage our already massive spending to be fair republicans are also guilty of not practicing what they preach when it comes to fiscal conservatism since 2000 we have had 12 years of republican presidents and 14 years of republicans controlling the house of representatives and the debt increased by more than 15 trillion dollars in that time assuming that defaulting on the debt is not an acceptable solution the united states needs to reverse spending and pay down the debt one tool in their box to silently do this without causing much attention is through manipulating monetary policy deflation and inflation are two disastrous consequences of poor monetary policy however this has the unintended consequence of hurting the poor and middle classes deflation and inflation are two consequences of poor monetary policy that can have disastrous effects since 1913 the federal reserve has been charged with managing the monetary supply of the united states with the goal of maintaining financial stability deflation can ruin economies there are many causes that contributed to turning the recession of 1929 into the great depression and one of those factors was deflation the amount of money in the us economy decreased as stock market losses wiped out wealth banks failed and lost their depositors savings and people chose to keep money stashed in their houses rather than invest it prices and wages dropped though not together with each other which contributed to people being out of work and not having enough money to satisfy basic needs people with mortgages were still expected to make their fixed monthly mortgage payment with less monthly income which led to widespread defaults and then more bank failures inflation can ruin individuals inflation happens when the monetary supply grows at a faster pace than the supply of goods in the market which leads to price increases during the 1970s many americans saw the purchasing power of their life savings shrink thanks to out of control inflation that was eventually reigned in with high interest rates this process began when president nixon took the united states off the gold standard which meant the supply of money was no longer restricted to a physical item inflation is a silent tax everyone knows it s there but not many people feel threatened by it because it seems like it s under control maintaining inflation at a rate of two percent is the official policy of the federal reserve on paper this seems like a small amount but two percent every year adds up and it lowers the value of money sitting in individual bank accounts because bank interest has been a lot less than two percent for quite a few years now inflation is also called the silent tax everyone knows it s there but not many people feel threatened by it because it seems like it s under control governments like a little inflation because it helps reduce the actual value of the debt they owe all they need to do is fire up the printing press but inflation is dangerous to individuals because it has the power to erode retirement savings along with the savings that younger people make for future down payments on assets like houses inflation s effects are not equal inflation can be harmful when wage increases lag behind housing and food increases it can be harmful when your only asset is the money in your savings account it can be helpful if you own stocks and their value increases it s helpful when you increase the rent on property you own and it s even helpful to the middle class homeowner who sells their home for more than they paid for it it can also be harmful because it creates the illusion that asset prices always increase which in turn causes bubbles if you have assets you re not as vulnerable to inflation as others because your wealth has transferred from money to a physical object that can hold its value but if your only source of wealth is cash and it loses value every year you become poorer wealth inequality s relationship with inflation there are many studies that claim wages have not kept up with inflation and that this has contributed to growing wealth inequality while this is true for some industries and occupations a lot of people are blaming the people paying the wages for this instead of blaming inflation itself many academics and commentators point the finger at technological innovations loss of union power and globalism while they ignore how inflation spiked after the gold standard officially ended it s hard to build a nest egg when the value of that egg gets lower and lower each year getting out of debt the 22 trillion national debt is one of the biggest threats to the future of american prosperity to put into perspective how serious it is according to the federal reserve there is only 1 7 trillion of us currency circulating in the world gdp for 2017 was 19 4 trillion the value of the entire us economy is approximately 120 trillion if 15 percent of the assets in the united states disappeared overnight to pay off the debt it would create a new economic disaster there are only three ways to reverse this trend cut spending drastically raise taxes and print money out of thin air to pay this down inflation printing more money to get out of debt is not a revolutionary idea though paul krugman would like you to think otherwise politicians avoid the first two solutions because they fear it would be unpopular and get them voted out of office although that seems to be changing on the democratic side but inflation is the silent tax that most people hardly think about printing more money to get out of debt is not a revolutionary idea though paul krugman would like you to think otherwise it has been done before and devastating results have often followed in germany after world war i inflation spiraled out of control as the government printed more money to pay its war debt and the country entered a process called hyperinflation by 1920 prices on average were 12 times higher than they were before the war many people who were not rich with assets were economically ruined and this policy would help lead to the rise of the nazis and world war ii the first step to solving a problem is to admit it exists if inflation contributes to the poor getting poorer and inflation is caused in part by the government as a way to decrease their out of control debt then programs that add additional debt to the debt will hurt the poor three quarters of us debt has accrued over the past 20 years serious reforms need to be applied to government spending and the budget needs to be completely overhauled so that surpluses are happening instead of deficits politicians have a well earned stereotype for being dishonest while there are some people in the field who do believe in civic duty and serving their country s best interests they are greatly outnumbered by a permanent political government class whose primary interest is to increase their own power they will say and promise many things in order to secure votes but history shows that those who propose new massive government programs in addition to the already existing ones we can t afford in the name of fighting inequality are deeply misguided bad policies lead to bad results regardless of the intentions behind them
google is praising the internet trade provisions in the new north american trade pact as a framework for the digital age the tech giant published a statement earlier this week lauding the deal s digital trade chapter following a series of discussions between u s president donald trump and google ceo sundar pichai we need trade agreements that reflect the reality of today s economy nafta references telegrams multiple times but doesn t even mention the internet in contrast the new includes a comprehensive set of digital trade provisions that keep the internet open and protect the businesses and consumers that rely on it the statement read bringing digital trade back into the spotlight story continues below advertisement watch trump threatens usmca over border security with mexico 1 44 trump threatens usmca over border security with mexico while it s true that the cusma s predecessor the north american free trade agreement nafta did not discuss e commerce there have been mixed reactions about the effectiveness of the cusma s known as the usmca in the u s digital trade provisions outlined in chapter 19 of the document while many experts have come out as advocates for chapter 19 some argue that it threatens the security of canadian data what are digital trade provisions anupam chander a georgetown university professor specializing in communications and technology law explained that digital trade refers to the wide range of e commerce activities involving tangible and non tangible products which may include anything from basic e commerce to streaming a netflix series story continues below advertisement it could be traditional e commerce which would be something like ebay or alibaba selling you a hard good that s shipped across borders or it could be live streaming of a show so that you can now watch a tv show from the united states being broadcast directly said chander while e commerce provisions have begun to make their way into recent trade agreements including the trans pacific partnership tpp chander said digital commerce wasn t nearly developed enough to have been included when nafta was drawn up in 1994 four key components of digital trade are regulated in the cusma 1 customs on digital products 2 data localization laws 3 civil liability for content creators and 4 cooperation on matters of cybersecurity spam prevention and consumer protection breaking news from canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens the most direct impact to consumers likely comes from the restrictions on taxation the agreement prohibits customs and other charges on digital products though parties may continue to impose internal taxes such as hst chapter 19 essentially ensures tax free transfers of movies e books videos etc across north american borders the rules protect against discriminatory or extra special internet taxation but essentially if you re doing a tax that s generally applicable and it covers the internet version of the same service then it should be acceptable under the international trade rules chander explained story continues below advertisement in addition the agreement establishes that platforms cannot be held liable for the actions of content producers prohibits businesses from requiring that data be stored domestically and establishes a groundwork for cooperation when protecting personal information and consumer well being online how do they impact canada while many areas of canadians digital lives are impacted by the cusma the most direct changes will result from the restrictions on taxation of digital products and prohibition of local data housing chander used the example of the netflix tax debate of 2017 as a scenario that would have benefited from the usmca s digital taxation guidelines deliberations began in 2017 between streaming giant netflix and the canadian government over whether canadians should pay a gst sales tax on their monthly subscription fees at the time netflix s lack of a local office created a tax loophole where the company could offer its service to canadians for the same price in canadian dollars at which it offered it to americans watch facebook

largely unprecedented and warranted a discussion at the time chander explained that under the cusma netflix would have been obligated to pay any sales tax required of domestic service providers story continues below advertisement i don t see any reason why netflix shouldn t just be taxed as if it were a canadian vendor of the same service that doesn t seem discriminatory against netflix as long as they re treated equally there s nothing wrong in a more recent debate however the data localization provisions apply directly to some canadian provinces including british columbia and nova scotia

law professor at the university of ottawa and expert in internet policy criticized the data localization clause shortly after the deal was finalized the digital trade chapter also bans restrictions on

it s nice to have more money in your pocket and thanks to the 2017 tax cuts the typical american is now paying less in taxes but that s not to say we re not still sending a hefty sum of money to washington tally up all the payroll and other taxes on earnings and income and you ll find that the average american household forks over more than 26 000 to the feds each year last year washington collected more than 3 3 trillion in taxes so where exactly does all that money go some believe most of it goes to foreign aid and defense others think corporate subsidies dominate the budget in reality health entitlements medicare medicaid obamacare and social security are the largest and fastest growing programs unless congress fixes these four programs they and the ever growing interest payments on the national debt will consume every dollar of taxes paid by 2041 that leaves no money for anything else uncle sam couldn t spend a penny on defense food assistance highways or education without driving the country further into debt right now medicare medicaid and obamacare subsidies account for more than a quarter 28 8 of all federal spending ten years from now they re projected to gobble up more than a third of the budget meanwhile social security the single largest federal program accounts for roughly a quarter of all federal spending all by itself its trust funds already pay out more than they take in and its finances will only deteriorate faster as more and more boomers retire the social security trustees project that unless congress implements much needed reforms the program will run out of reserve funds by 2034 potentially triggering a 23 cut in benefits other income security programs veterans benefits food and housing assistance federal employee retirement and disability account for 16 of the budget that s more than we spend on national defense and the defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations overseas to the research development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment at 15 of the federal budget defense spending is the last major category of federal spending most of what is left goes to people and corporations who hold washington s ious currently 8 of the budget goes to interest payments on this debt over the coming decade u s debt held by the public is projected to balloon to nearly 93 of gross domestic product but don t blame that on inadequate taxation by 2024 the pro growth tax enacted in 2017 will actually raise more revenue yearly than the old system no the culprit here is runaway spending driven primarily by huge increases in health and social security outlays and the long term consequences of deficit spending are dire economic growth tends to slow in countries with debts that are as big as their economy the u s is quickly joining this group as the debt increases so does the cost of the interest we must pay to those who hold the debt china is currently the largest foreign holder of u s debt left unchecked growing government spending and historically high levels of debt will ultimately require higher taxes and just jacking up taxes on the rich won t cut it paying for big government requires high taxes on middle class americans too eventually rising debt will leave lawmakers with few options to avoid a financial crisis unless we can reverse course it is only a matter of time before every american will be forced to pay higher income and payroll taxes on tax day 2019 be thankful for the extra money the 2017 tax cuts deposited in your pocket but know that unless we insist that lawmakers suppress their seemingly insatiable appetite to spend we could all soon be paying much much more distributed by tribune content agency llc
the u s economy is chugging toward a new record for longest expansion and middle class families finally are seeing decent wage gains yet our political leaders as if stuck in a time warp keep peddling a bleak narrative of economic victimhood and defeatism populists tell u s workers global capitalism is rigged against them sen elizabeth warren calls for breaking up big tech america s most innovative companies because they are well just too big among millennials socialism s stock is soaring even some prominent libertarians are defecting from the free market camp and learning to love the welfare state what a change from the 1990s when nearly everyone seemed certain that socialism was dead and buried and democratic capitalism reigned supreme around the world the economic gloom enveloping the nation s political academic and media elites trickles down to the public at large according to a new pew survey americans today are strikingly pessimistic about the future they see the united states as declining economically growing more unequal and becoming even more divided politically whatever happened to americans native optimism they ve been sideswiped by three disruptive developments the first is the advent of a globally connected knowledge economy which has taken a toll on blue collar america second market democracies in this century got stuck in a slow growth high inequality rut while autocratic china surged ahead the rancid cherry on top of these structural changes was the great recession of 2007 2009 intensified by the housing crisis and wall street s near meltdown this perfect economic storm has swept away middle income jobs slowed productivity and wage gains and undermined the traditional foundations of working and middle class security especially in the rust belt and rural communities it s also created a ton of new technology and wealth while delivering lopsided rewards to highly educated and cosmopolitan elites mix in the combustible new politics of immigration and identity and you have a surefire formula for political radicalization from the tea party and trumpean nationalism on the right to sen bernie sanders and the neo socialist left buffeted by these ideological crosscurrents it s easy to lose your political bearings yet while donald trump may hate free trade and millennials may get a transgressive rush from posturing as democratic socialists most americans haven t lost their deep rooted faith in economic freedom individual enterprise and market competition a gallup poll last year for example found that the public overwhelmingly 79 percent expresses a favorable view of free enterprise capitalism doesn t fare so well especially among young people nearly half of millennial and generation z respondents in a recent axios survey said they prefer living in a socialist country such attitudes likely are a spasm of protest against the diminished economic prospects facing young americans especially the 60 percent who don t have a college degree they ve experienced a shrinking pool of stable middle income jobs stagnant or falling wage growth escalating student debt and exorbitantly high college and housing costs but let s keep things in perspective previous generations endured much harder economic times yet they didn t jettison the foundational beliefs in economic liberty individual initiative and free markets that have made america the world s wealthiest country the great depression hit america like an asteroid after the stock market crashed in 1929 production plunged and the nation s economic output was cut almost in half in 1932 nearly 2 300 banks failed the following year as franklin d roosevelt took office the jobless rate hit nearly 25 percent legions of hobos roamed the nation desperate for work and discouraged immigrants steamed back to europe it took nearly a decade for the economy to recover mainly due to america s entry into world war ii the recent downturn and financial crisis was no picnic but it pales in comparison nonetheless both calamities shook public confidence in prevailing economic orthodoxy the gop s laissez faire policies of the 1920s gave way to the new deal s prolific federal interventions on behalf of the jobless farmers wage earners depositors retirees and poor mothers some of fdr s advisors urged him to replace free market chaos with planned economy sen huey long and father coughlin lead protest movements demanding that washington share the wealth and combat the machinations of international bankers roosevelt himself however neither succumbed to populist rage nor the collectivist doctrines spreading across europe instead he radiated a jaunty confidence that prosperity would soon return and he always insisted his goal was to restore free enterprise not replace it by creating a public counterbalance to private economic power that s why fdr is a better model for today s progressives than bernie sanders democrats won t build national majorities by rote business bashing or prattling about socialism which has never captured americans political imagination yet the berniecrats and demsocs flay the private sector as a squalid den of greed to redeem capitalism s moral failings they propose a stupendous program of top down redistribution medicare for all the green new deal free college guaranteed government jobs and they insist that all democrats walk the plank such sectarian purity tests are a real problem because ideas that may electrify activists in deep blue brooklyn may repel moderate and independent voters in swing districts in michigan or iowa the left s equation of boldness with statism is equally oblivious to another political reality most americans mistrust the federal government in a recent ppi expedition strategies poll for example only 20 percent of voters expressed confidence in washington s responsiveness to their concerns or problem solving abilities if they want to deny trump a second term democrats should disabuse themselves of the pernicious myth that neoliberalism has destroyed the american dream the anti capitalism narrative contains some elements of truth but vastly understates the role of technologically driven economic change while overstating the role of policy all the west s advanced economies have experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs and union membership slow productivity and economic growth and rising inequality this suggests deep structural forces are at work not a sinister plot by global elites to plunder the proletariat the neoliberal trope also mushes together republican and democratic presidents whose policies differed in intent and result if ronald reagan the two bushes bill clinton and barack obama can all be lumped together as capitalist tools what does calling them neoliberals convey beyond a general antipathy to free markets the truth is all u s presidents going back to fdr supported trade liberalizing treaties paid at least lip service to fiscal discipline tried to strike reasonable balances between economic innovation and regulation preferred work to the dole and extolled private enterprise as the mighty engine of u s prosperity u s voters especially in the key battleground states of the midwest are hungry for economic hope they want to see the middle of the middle class grow again and don t want to be forced to choose between growth and equity vibrant markets and reasonable redistribution how can democrats speak to the public s economic aspirations not by giving up on growth and painting a dreary picture of a future in which robots steal our jobs workers can t live on what they earn america can t compete with china and politics degenerates into battles over how to carve up a stagnant economic pie demsocs want democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left wing version of trump s splenetic and divisive populism instead democrats in 2020 should present voters with radically pragmatic ideas for helping americans get ahead for example let s give working people tax relief by eliminating the regressive payroll tax and replacing it with carbon and consumption taxes instead of promising free college tuition create a robust system of career education and upskilling for the 70 percent of young americans who don t go to or finish college instead of a fanciful green new deal democrats should accelerate the mass production of electric cars which would link carbon reduction to the creation of high wage jobs for working people instead of breaking up tech companies we should speed up digitizing the physical industries and create incubators for 3 d enabled manufacturing startups across the rust belt democrats in short have an opportunity in 2020 to seize the high ground of economic optimism and innovation donald trump has vacated that ground by embracing an odd amalgam of conservative and populist stances including tariffs that hurt u s producers and consumers closed borders false promises to bring back old factory jobs tax cuts skewed to the rich and paid for by huge public deficits not to mention his perverse crusade to strip millions of americans of health insurance on the other side the demsocs want democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left wing version of trump s splenetic and divisive populism instead democrats should channel the spirit of fdr and present voters with a hope inspiring plan for how a reinvigorated private sector and government can work together to restore shared prosperity
the new runway of the velana international airport constructed by beijing urban construction group co ltd is seen in male the maldives on september 14 2018 xinhua when the belt and road initiative was first put forward in 2013 few might have imagined that it would encompass more than 150 countries and international organizations in collaborative projects in a matter of years the initiative proposed by chinese president xi jinping and consisting of the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road aims to boost connectivity along and beyond the routes of the ancient silk road with a view to enhancing both china s development and its cooperation with global partners it focuses on cementing links in five key areas policies infrastructure trade finance and people to people bonds chinese and laotian technicians at a steel structure processing plant of the china railway no 5 engineering group s china laos railway project division in luang namtha laos on march 21 xinhua policy coordination the number of cooperation documents signed between china and other countries has increased substantially as the circle of participants in the belt and road initiative widens italy became the first member of the group of seven to sign a memorandum of understanding on the initiative with china in march italian prime minister giuseppe conte said italy is glad to seize this historic opportunity to join the belt and road initiative with its special geographical advantage in building connectivity to date china has signed 173 cooperation documents with 125 countries and 29 international organizations according to building the belt and road concept practice and china s contribution issued in may 2017 there were only 46 agreements with 39 countries and international organizations at the time meanwhile the belt and road vision has been incorporated into the documents of major international institutions including the un the group of 20 the asia pacific economic cooperation and the shanghai cooperation organization third party market cooperation was put forward for the first time by china and france in 2015 using this concept china aims to cooperate with developed countries to promote the development of the belt and road initiative over the past years many projects have been carried out in third party markets and tangible results have been achieved japan previously reluctant to participate in the initiative has changed its attitude and begun to work together with china in third party markets in october 2018 during the first forum on china japan third party market cooperation a total of 52 agreements with a combined value of 18 billion were concluded by the two sides these covered fields such as infrastructure finance and logistics and information technology the results of third party market cooperation have effectively responded to the doubts and prejudices some countries have about the initiative various forms of the china plus model have been proposed promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation in different fields in october 2018 china and 17 other countries announced the building of the belt and road energy partnership a forum on international commercial mediation for the belt and road was held in the same month in italy where a joint declaration was issued by 21 institutions from 12 countries in may 2018 china and member countries of the eurasian economic union signed an agreement to cut trade barriers and facilitate economic activities representing a new stage of enhanced cooperation connecting countries china has continued to work with relevant countries to create a transport infrastructure network connecting the sub regions in asia and linking asia africa and europe to enhance connectivity and boost the efficiency of regional and sub regional logistics over the past two years the mombasa nairobi railway and the addis ababa djibouti railway have started commercial operations while the construction of the china laos railway the hungary serbia railway the china thailand railway and the jakarta bandung high speed railway in indonesia has begun moreover the moscow kazan high speed railway and transportation corridors between china and russia have both emerged as promising projects among all the projects the china europe railway express is the most striking in 2018 trips made by cargo trains traveling between china and europe totaled 6 363 a year on year increase of 73 percent the number of return trips from europe to china was 2 690 an increase of 111 percent over 2017 plenty of high quality products from other countries participating in the belt and road initiative enter the chinese market this way the building of a silk road in the air between luxembourg and zhengzhou capital of central china s henan province is another highlight the role of this airborne silk road should not be underestimated the total volume of cargo handled at zhengzhou s airport reached 500 000 tons in 2017 of which shipments to and from luxembourg accounted for nearly a third on 789 flights achievements have been made in the construction of free trade areas on january 1 2018 the free trade agreement fta between china and georgia took effect the first of its kind since the belt and road initiative was proposed subsequently china completed fta negotiations with the maldives and mauritius the agreement with the maldives is the first bilateral fta for the country while mauritius is the first african country to sign an fta with china as of march 2019 china had signed 17 ftas with 25 countries and regions while nine more are under negotiations involving more than 30 countries recent years have also witnessed the flourishing of new business models such as e commerce the electronic world trade platform launched by chinese e commerce giant alibaba is accelerating its construction china and 75 other members of the world trade organization wto including japan the united states the european union and russia released a joint statement in january intending to initiate wto negotiations on trade related aspects of e commerce effective implementation production capacity cooperation under the framework of the belt and road initiative fits participating countries economic diversification and modernization strategies industrial parks and the china kazakhstan model are two representatives of this by the beginning this year 82 industrial parks had been built by chinese enterprises in 24 countries with a total investment of 30 45 billion a total of 4 098 enterprises had been attracted to these parks china kazakhstan cooperation in production capacity is quite different where there are no geographical restrictions and governments play an obvious guiding role intergovernmental discussions have brought about the establishment of funds and special loans enabling the projects to be carried out in november 2018 the 15th discussion on production capacity and investment was held during which 55 key projects were agreed upon with a total investment of about 27 4 billion this model has been applied to other countries for instance china and saudi arabia signed a memorandum of understanding on key projects concerning capacity cooperation in february which identified 18 projects in recent years the belt and road initiative has been facing critical questions by some countries as the number of projects carried out under the initiative increases it is a fact that they might be implemented with varying quality china is making significant policy shifts to ensure high quality implementation the emphasis is on guidance for chinese enterprises for example in august 2017 the national development and reform commission the ministry of commerce the people s bank of china and the ministry of foreign affairs issued a joint circular to provide further guidance and regulation on overseas investment which drew a clear line between the do s and don ts other documents include a code of conduct on private enterprises overseas investment and operation promulgated in january 2018 and guidelines on compliance management of enterprises operating overseas issued in december the same year these are intended to guide enterprises to operate in compliance with laws and regulations another focus is put on services to these enterprises examples include the guidelines on taxation for enterprises going global issued by the state taxation administration in october 2017 and an overview of foreign exchange management policies in belt and road participating countries issued by the state administration of foreign exchange a year later these documents are designed to help enterprises operating overseas become better equipped to cope with uncertainties in foreign markets the reason why the initiative has grown in popularity is that it focuses on development the biggest concern for many countries this means it is in line with the strategic interests of these countries in most participating countries there is a large development gap and much remains to be done regarding infrastructure and urban construction with a full range of industries strong capacity and high efficiency china can cooperate with them in a broad array of areas in addition given burgeoning cooperation between china and developed countries in third party markets an even stronger synergy will be forged the author is deputy director of the center for the belt and road initiative china institute of international studies copyedited by craig crowther

california taxpayers jason and june cao jarvis with their 15 month old son kellar outside their home in inglewood photo by iris schneider for calmatters for communications professor jason jarvis and his wife jun california just got more expensive the inglewood couple who last year paid 16 000 in state and local taxes were only able to deduct 10 000 of it from their federal taxes this year the federal tax cuts and jobs act signed last year by president donald trump and cheered by republicans in congress cost the jarvis family between 4 500 and 5 000 in deductions raising their bill from the internal revenue service even after a larger child tax credit for their 15 month old son kellar the financial hit came with political bruises for jarvis a 45 year old democrat who disliked how the republican plan slashed taxes for corporations and people making a lot more than he does the federal government really jacked us he said i don t have a problem with my tax dollars going toward education homelessness i m in favor of all that but a tax cut for billionaires off my back that s too much while millions of california families saw their federal taxes fall this tax season the jarvis family is among an estimated 1 million households who are paying more actually some 12 billion more according to the franchise tax board that s because the cap on state and local tax salt deductions disproportionately impacted progressive states with high taxes by limiting the amount residents used to be able to deduct from their federal filings now as the golden state s first tax day without the old salt break approaches that dear departed deduction has been topic a in california as taxpayers are filing their returns this month many of them are discovering the bite the federally imposed salt cap is taking out of their wallet state controller betty yee a democrat noted in fact the topic recently and randomly popped up in the middle of a discussion on the state economy sponsored by the sacramento press club featuring yee state treasurer fiona ma and lt gov eleni kounalakis it s just scandalous that the trump administration did away with our salt deduction kounalakis declared to a round of hearty applause from the capitol audience who took the salt hit california ranks 10th in overall taxation and has the highest personal income tax rate at 13 3 for millionaires it used to be that affluent californians could salve that wound by capitalizing on unlimited salt deductions to lower their federal obligations no more now as the lieutenant governor noted at the press club conversation that lost haven has not only set off statewide grousing but also could give wealthier people an incentive to flee threatening california s finances since the state relies for half of its personal income taxes on people making 500 000 or more this is a real existential threat to our ability to ensure that our tax collection is going to result in what we need to fund our general fund said kounalakis steve levy director and senior economist of the center for continuing study of the california economy begs to differ the overall federal personal income tax changes aren t really that dramatic and the households paying more in 2018 can afford to pay more he said this is true california s progressive tax structure means about 43 000 top bracket residents earning more than 1 million a year will pay the lion s share of the salt cap by contributing 9 billion more to uncle sam according to ftb levy said he and his wife paid more this year because they were hurt by the salt cap however his son paid less as a result of the increased child tax credit and benefited from a 20 deduction on self employed income overall levy said the personal income tax changes are not a big deal however there s a band of 619 000 taxpayers earning between 100 000 and 250 000 who are being particularly hurt by the loss of the full deduction especially those who purchased in recent years during a strong real estate market the median home price in california is 534 140 compared to 249 500 nationally according to the national association of realtors this upper middle group is relatively affluent but california is a high cost state and members of the cohort not only pay a significant amount to the state through income taxes but contribute the most of any group on property taxes since they tend to be homeowners according to the ftb 5 9 million taxpayers reported itemized deductions on federal income taxes in 2015 of them 2 1 million made between 100 000 and 250 000 this group claimed 11 billion in real estate tax deductions more than any other group why them asks darien shanske a law professor at the university of california davis it s hard to understand why they should be the ones to get a big tax increase a very wealthy real estate investor in texas doesn t get a tax increase and that s the arbitrariness of it right shanske was among a group of legal experts supportive of a state workaround former senate president pro tem kevin de león proposed legislation last year that would have sidestepped the 10 000 limit by offering state tax credits in such a way that california taxpayers could then claim charitable deductions on their federal filings the tax maneuver was nixed by former gov jerry brown as too complex at the same time the internal revenue service proposed regulations banning such state workarounds currently the salt cap will expire at the end of 2025 meaning the loss of the full deduction is temporary if political winds shift and there s an effort to make it permanent the professor says california may need to rethink its own tax structure if it s temporary i don t know there s much to be done shanske said if it s permanent then it is something that california has to take seriously who s getting the blame new york gov andrew cuomo has suggested that changes to the federal tax code are causing some high income earners to flee that high cost state however a new report from moody s this week says it hasn t found the salt cap is causing new yorkers or californians to flee just yet the impact of the salt cap enacted in 2017 will be felt widely for the first time this tax season and possibly spur some out migration but jobs and demographic trends will continue to influence relocation patterns more than tax burdens moody s stated professor shanske said one way to give this upper middle group relief is to raise the salt cap to 20 000 this would allow the federal government to continue reaping taxes from the very wealthy the jarvis family is typical of this band of people who feel middle class even if they don t fit the description of middle class last year the pew research center pinpointed the middle of the middle class as 78 442 for a household of three by comparison jarvis and his wife jun a buyer for a tool importing company made a combined 125 000 last year they have an 800 square foot home in inglewood to be close to jarvis work at loyola marymount university still they are on a budget the tax changes hurt us said jarvis between mortgage child care paying off student loans the credit cards look there s plenty of people in this state who are way worse off than we are but that money mattered indeed many families who purchased homes in recent years say they factored the tax deductions into their monthly finances darrel lawrence 43 and his wife rolled all the equity they gained on a two bedroom starter home in poway that they bought for 315 000 in 2011 into a 750 000 home four years later in an unincorporated part of san diego county once their daughter arrived we wanted something a little newer and nicer so we rolled everything into a bigger house knowing it would be a big mortgage payment but the interest was all deductible said the technology worker we had property taxes and mello roos fees but that was all deductible i always assumed that it would be grandfathered in i just never thought they would change the rules on us when everybody budgets for this lawrence a democrat said he places blame squarely on republicans the thing that drives me bananas about this is not only did my tax bill go up 2 000 services are getting slashed and the federal deficit is exploding he said it just feels like there s this incredible graft going on where you re taking more money from me you re giving it away to these really wealthy people and you re increasing the debt where the votes are californians could be voting their pocketbooks on this issue polling data suggested the 10 000 salt deduction along with the 750 000 cap on mortgage interest deduction factored into republican losses when democrats swept all seven u s house seats in orange county then again a state with 18 5 million personal income tax returns each household has a different experience peter antonell a 64 year old retired cal fire captain who lives in north monterey county said his partner made 30 000 more last year than in 2017 but their marginal tax rate fell to 24 from 28 causing them to pay the same amount of taxes as last year in dollar terms the federal taxes for 2018 were almost identical even though we made considerably more money antonell said the couple also made large charitable donations in the aftermath of the camp fire in butte county so they were able to itemize deductions rather than take the 24 000 standard deduction for joint filers antonell said it wasn t fair of congressional republicans to target california for revenue by limiting the salt deduction but he also doesn t like california s high income and sales taxes the new law certainly accentuates that taxes in blue states are pretty high he said as a republican retiree who left his presidential vote blank in 2016 antonell said he entertains the idea of moving to carson valley nevada where there s no state income tax if we end up determining that the tax burden at the state and local level becomes too burdensome then we ll leave he said

this article was first published 4 years ago shaktikanta das said in washington dc that there was nothing sacrosanct about the 25 bps rate cut and that monetary policy could be well served by calibrating the size of the policy rate to the dynamics of the situation and the size of the change itself could convey the stance of policy image rbi governor shaktikanta das addresses a meeting of the imf in washington dc on april 12 2019 photograph courtesy shaktikanta das on twitter reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das has asked central banks across the world to think out of the box and suggested for example that changing policy rates by 25 basis points bps or multiples thereof is not sacrosanct and just a convention he said monetary policy could be well served by calibrating the size of the policy rate to the dynamics of the situation and the size of the change itself could convey the stance of policy if the easing of monetary policy is required but the central bank prefers to be cautious in its accommodation a 10 bps reduction in the policy rate would perhaps communicate the intent of authorities more clearly than two separate moves one on the policy rate wasting 15 bps of valuable rate action to rounding off and the other on the stance which in a sense binds future policy action to a pre committed direction das explained while speaking at the governor talks programme on the sidelines of the international monetary fund imf world bank spring meetings in washington likewise in a situation in which the central bank prefers to be accommodative but not overly so it could announce a cut in the policy rate by 35 bps if it has judged that the standard 25 bps is too little but its multiple i e 50 bps is too much he added later in a chat with changyong rhee director of the imf s asia and pacific department das said he would rather wait for more reactions comments and observations from other central banks on the idea asked about structural reforms in india in the past few years he listed the implementation of the gst and the insolvency and bankruptcy code among others areas that require attention in terms of reforms would be labour and land many steps have been taken already at the provincial level but much more needs to be done he said one major area where reforms are necessary in india again that is something that lies in the domain of the state government is agricultural marketing we have certain laws related to agricultural marketing which act as impediments in getting private investments in creation of agricultural markets as a result the flow of private capital into creating a value chain in agricultural products from the farm to consumers is getting hampered the laws are in the domain of the state governments and they need to be completely overhauled the rbi governor said das said india s average growth rate of 7 5 per cent over the last few years was very good but the country needed to grow at over 7 5 per cent in fact india needs to grow at about 8 per cent to eliminate poverty there is still a large number of poor people living in india there are still many challenges in social and other development sectors so india needs to grow faster he said i don t want to start a debate on what should be the potential growth rate of india but by and large let me say 7 5 per cent plus should be the reasonable growth rate that india can expect he cautioned that global spillovers of loose monetary policy measures in the absence of a financial safety net could be unintentionally forcing emerging market economies emes to break out and challenge the hegemony of dominant reserve currencies managing such spillovers he said was a formidable challenge for emes we live in a world of mobile capital flows where consequences of their arrivals sudden stops and reversals are to be borne nationally he said adding that while a safety net remained elusive the strengthening of resources of the imf got pushed out into time whenever emes came together for the spring or annual meetings under these conditions emes which are typically at the receiving end when global spillovers flare up have no recourse but to build their own forex reserve buffers paradoxically the accumulation of reserves has become stigmatised including with labels such as currency manipulation das said there was a need for greater understanding on both sides and assured that the rbi was not contemplating leading the pack of break out nations das s comments come at a time when the imf has warned that 70 per cent of the global economy was slowing down while the rest led mainly by emes was expected to grow according to estimates by bank of england emes contribute 60 per cent to the global growth at over 7 per cent india remains the fastest growing large economy in the world according to the imf as growth slows down and the fiscal space gets squeezed monetary policy is going to be the focus of both emes and advanced economies as the first line of defence he said therefore central banks may once again be expected to assume the mantle of guardians of the world economy das also called for greater cooperation among emes in this high flux and uncertain environment emes could perhaps be better off by stepping up cooperation on all fronts while recognising multi polarity one area of cooperation could be to put in place an institutional mechanism which balances the concerns of both oil exporting and importing countries to ensure stability in energy prices he emphasised the importance of interacting closely with financial markets for transmission of monetary policy impulses which required a sound and efficient payment and settlement system on the impact of rising oil prices on inflation he said they played a significant role in the current account deficit and over a period of time inflationary impact was felt but the inflationary impact of oil prices sometimes is exaggerated

inglewood taxpayers jason and june cao jarvis shown here at home with their 15 month old son kellar say the federal tax cut actually increased their tax bill by judy lin calmatters for communications professor jason jarvis and his wife jun california just got more expensive the inglewood couple who last year paid 16 000 in state and local taxes were only able to deduct 10 000 of it from their federal taxes this year the federal tax cuts and jobs act signed last year by president donald trump and cheered by republicans in congress cost the jarvis family between 4 500 and 5 000 in deductions raising their bill from the internal revenue service even after a larger child tax credit for their 15 month old son kellar the financial hit came with political bruises for jarvis a 45 year old democrat who disliked how the republican plan slashed taxes for corporations and people making a lot more than he does the federal government really jacked us he said i don t have a problem with my tax dollars going toward education homelessness i m in favor of all that but a tax cut for billionaires off my back that s too much while millions of california families saw their federal taxes fall this tax season the jarvis family is among an estimated 1 million households who are paying more actually some 12 billion more according to the franchise tax board that s because the cap on state and local tax salt deductions disproportionately impacted progressive states with high taxes by limiting the amount residents used to be able to deduct from their federal filings now as the golden state s first tax day without the old salt break approaches that dear departed deduction has been topic a in california as taxpayers are filing their returns this month many of them are discovering the bite the federally imposed salt cap is taking out of their wallet state controller betty yee a democrat noted in fact the topic recently and randomly popped up in the middle of a discussion on the state economy sponsored by the sacramento press club featuring yee state treasurer fiona ma and lt gov eleni kounalakis it s just scandalous that the trump administration did away with our salt deduction kounalakis declared to a round of hearty applause from the capitol audience who took the salt hit california ranks 10th in overall taxation and has the highest personal income tax rate at 13 3 for millionaires it used to be that affluent californians could salve that wound by capitalizing on unlimited salt deductions to lower their federal obligations no more now as the lieutenant governor noted at the press club conversation that lost haven has not only set off statewide grousing but also could give wealthier people an incentive to flee threatening california s finances since the state relies for half of its personal income taxes on people making 500 000 or more this is a real existential threat to our ability to ensure that our tax collection is going to result in what we need to fund our general fund said kounalakis steve levy director and senior economist of the center for continuing study of the california economy begs to differ the overall federal personal income tax changes aren t really that dramatic and the households paying more in 2018 can afford to pay more he said this is true california s progressive tax structure means about 43 000 top bracket residents earning more than 1 million a year will pay the lion s share of the salt cap by contributing 9 billion more to uncle sam according to ftb levy said he and his wife paid more this year because they were hurt by the salt cap however his son paid less as a result of the increased child tax credit and benefited from a 20 deduction on self employed income overall levy said the personal income tax changes are not a big deal however there s a band of 619 000 taxpayers earning between 100 000 and 250 000 who are being particularly hurt by the loss of the full deduction especially those who purchased in recent years during a strong real estate market the median home price in california is 534 140 compared to 249 500 nationally according to the national association of realtors this upper middle group is relatively affluent but california is a high cost state and members of the cohort not only pay a significant amount to the state through income taxes but contribute the most of any group on property taxes since they tend to be homeowners according to the ftb 5 9 million taxpayers reported itemized deductions on federal income taxes in 2015 of them 2 1 million made between 100 000 and 250 000 this group claimed 11 billion in real estate tax deductions more than any other group why them asks darien shanske a law professor at the university of california davis it s hard to understand why they should be the ones to get a big tax increase a very wealthy real estate investor in texas doesn t get a tax increase and that s the arbitrariness of it right shanske was among a group of legal experts supportive of a state workaround former senate president pro tem kevin de león proposed legislation last year that would have sidestepped the 10 000 limit by offering state tax credits in such a way that california taxpayers could then claim charitable deductions on their federal filings the tax maneuver was nixed by former gov jerry brown as too complex at the same time the internal revenue service proposed regulations banning such state workarounds currently the salt cap will expire at the end of 2025 meaning the loss of the full deduction is temporary if political winds shift and there s an effort to make it permanent the professor says california may need to rethink its own tax structure if it s temporary i don t know there s much to be done shanske said if it s permanent then it is something that california has to take seriously who s getting the blame new york gov andrew cuomo has suggested that changes to the federal tax code are causing some high income earners to flee that high cost state however a new report from moody s this week says it hasn t found the salt cap is causing new yorkers or californians to flee just yet the impact of the salt cap enacted in 2017 will be felt widely for the first time this tax season and possibly spur some out migration but jobs and demographic trends will continue to influence relocation patterns more than tax burdens moody s stated professor shanske said one way to give this upper middle group relief is to raise the salt cap to 20 000 this would allow the federal government to continue reaping taxes from the very wealthy the jarvis family is typical of this band of people who feel middle class even if they don t fit the description of middle class last year the pew research center pinpointed the middle of the middle class as 78 442 for a household of three by comparison jarvis and his wife jun a buyer for a tool importing company made a combined 125 000 last year they have an 800 square foot home in inglewood to be close to jarvis work at loyola marymount university still they are on a budget the tax changes hurt us said jarvis between mortgage child care paying off student loans the credit cards look there s plenty of people in this state who are way worse off than we are but that money mattered indeed many families who purchased homes in recent years say they factored the tax deductions into their monthly finances darrel lawrence 43 and his wife rolled all the equity they gained on a two bedroom starter home in poway that they bought for 315 000 in 2011 into a 750 000 home four years later in an unincorporated part of san diego county once their daughter arrived we wanted something a little newer and nicer so we rolled everything into a bigger house knowing it would be a big mortgage payment but the interest was all deductible said the technology worker we had property taxes and mello roos fees but that was all deductible i always assumed that it would be grandfathered in i just never thought they would change the rules on us when everybody budgets for this lawrence a democrat said he places blame squarely on republicans the thing that drives me bananas about this is not only did my tax bill go up 2 000 services are getting slashed and the federal deficit is exploding he said it just feels like there s this incredible graft going on where you re taking more money from me you re giving it away to these really wealthy people and you re increasing the debt where the votes are californians could be voting their pocketbooks on this issue polling data suggested the 10 000 salt deduction along with the 750 000 cap on mortgage interest deduction factored into republican losses when democrats swept all seven u s house seats in orange county then again a state with 18 5 million personal income tax returns each household has a different experience peter antonell a 64 year old retired cal fire captain who lives in north monterey county said his partner made 30 000 more last year than in 2017 but their marginal tax rate fell to 24 from 28 causing them to pay the same amount of taxes as last year in dollar terms the federal taxes for 2018 were almost identical even though we made considerably more money antonell said the couple also made large charitable donations in the aftermath of the camp fire in butte county so they were able to itemize deductions rather than take the 24 000 standard deduction for joint filers antonell said it wasn t fair of congressional republicans to target california for revenue by limiting the salt deduction but he also doesn t like california s high income and sales taxes the new law certainly accentuates that taxes in blue states are pretty high he said as a republican retiree who

on april 15 1865 president lincoln died he was shot the night before in ford s theater on april 15 1912 the titanic sank it struck an iceberg the night before 1 514 lives were lost including millionaires john jacob astor iv benjamin guggenheim and isa strauss all of whom were vocal opponents of the federal reserve act in 1954 april 15 became the deadline for filing income tax returns originally article i section 9 of the u s constitution prohibited a direct federal income tax on american citizens no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken the federal government s revenue was derived from excise taxes on specific items like salt tea tobacco etc and tariff taxes on imports prior to the civil war most tariff taxes were collected at southern ports like charleston south carolina tariffs made foreign goods more expensive motivating people to buy domestically produced goods made mostly in northern factories the south had few factories as its economy was based on agricultural crops mostly cotton and rice which unfortunately relied heavily on slave labor thus the tariff taxes that helped the north hurt the south during the civil war republican president abraham lincoln passed an emergency revenue income tax to raise 750 million to help fund the union it was repealed in 1873 the first non emergency peacetime income tax was attempted in 1894 but the supreme court declared it unconstitutional in pollock v farmers loan justice stephen j field concurred the income tax law under consideration is class legislation whenever a distinction is made in the burdens a law imposes or in the benefits it confers on any citizens by reason of their birth or wealth or religion it is class legislation and leads inevitably to oppression and abuses justice field continued it is the same in essential character as that of the english income statute of 1691 which taxed protestants at a certain rate catholics as a class at double the rate of protestants and jews at another and separate rate industrialists helped bring about the greatest rise in the standard of living for the average person with more goods at cheaper prices than ever before in world history industrialists then began to create monopolies influence political parties and plot to gain control of the banking system republican president theodore roosevelt attempted to limit their power with an inheritance tax republican president william taft yielded to mounting public pressure to tax these rich industrialists by placing a two percent tax on corporate profits as only the wealthiest owned corporate stock with the emergency of world war i threatening democrat president woodrow wilson naively thought there would be world peace if tariff taxes between countries were eliminated wilson proposed replacing the lost tariff revenue with an income tax on the wealthy this was passed in 1913 with the 16th amendment originally the income tax was a one percent tax on the top one percent richest people it was a type of soak the rich tax only intended for industrialists such as rockefeller carnegie vanderbilt fisk flagler gould harriman mellon j p morgan and schwab industrialists strategically avoided paying the income tax by transferring their assets into tax exempt charitable and educational foundations such as the rockefeller foundation and carnegie foundation this tax exempt category had previously been for churches which historically were the providers of social welfare through their hospitals medical clinics orphanages schools soup kitchens where they cared for orphans widows maimed soldiers prisoners unwed mothers widows shut ins homeless juvenile delinquents and immigrants churches also provided a significant social service by instilling morals and virtues into the nation s population this helped reduce crime child abuse broken homes derelicts and other social ills since the relinquishing of these responsibility to government these have become an immense financial burden on taxpayers being in many cases the largest items on state budgets in 1942 with world war ii democrat president franklin roosevelt increased and expanded the federal income tax with the greatest tax bill in american history even instituting paycheck withholding john f kennedy stated april 20 1961 in meeting the demands of war finance the individual income tax moved from a selective tax imposed on the wealthy to the means by which the great majority of our citizens participate in paying beardsley ruml chairman of macy s department store became director of the new york federal reserve bank where he promoted the idea of withholding taxes from people s paychecks kennedy explained april 20 1961 withholding on wages and salaries was introduced during the war when the income tax was extended to millions of new taxpayers businesses gradually became subject to higher taxes higher wages and benefits more lawsuits more governmental bureaucracy more environmental restrictions political favoritism or cronyism toward some companies at the expense of others businesses that did not receive this favoritism began to be faced with the alternative of going out of the country or going out of business as companies outsourced jobs to stay competitive in the growing global market patriotic attachments diminished giving rise to financial globalists john f kennedy noticed feb 6 1961 i have asked the secretary of the treasury to report on whether present tax laws may be stimulating in undue amounts the flow of american capital to the industrial countries abroad kennedy told congress april 20 1961 in those countries where income taxes are lower than in the united states the ability to defer the payment of u s tax by retaining income in the subsidiary companies provides a tax advantage for companies operating through overseas subsidiaries that is not available to companies operating solely in the united states to remedy this democrat president john f kennedy proposed a stimulus plan of lowering taxes across the board as he stated sept 18 1963 a tax cut means higher family income and higher business profits and a balanced federal budget every taxpayer and his family will have more money left over after taxes for a new car a new home new conveniences education and investment every businessman can keep a higher percentage of his profits in his cash register or put it to work expanding or improving his business and as the national income grows the federal government will ultimately end up with more revenues kennedy stated jan 17 1963 lower rates of taxation will stimulate economic activity and so raise the levels of personal and corporate income as to yield within a few years an increased not a reduced flow of revenues to the federal government kennedy stated nov 20 1962 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus john f kennedy stated in his annual message jan 21 1963 in today s economy fiscal prudence and responsibility call for tax reduction even if it temporarily enlarges the federal deficit why reducing taxes is the best way open to us to increase revenues it is no contradiction the most important single thing we can do to stimulate investment in today s economy is to raise consumption by major reduction of individual income tax rates jfk mentioned in his message to congress on tax reduction jan 24 1963 our tax system still siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power and reduces the incentive for risk investment and effort thereby aborting our recoveries and stifling our national growth rate whereas kennedy wanted to reduce taxes to stimulate the economy economist john maynard keynes had proposed stimulating the economy by going in debt john maynard keynes reasoned that if the government went in debt spending money in the private sector to create jobs those jobs would pay taxes and pay off the debt unfortunately politicians were tempted to continually increase debt in order to funnel money to their districts and constituencies to help them get reelected hoping the next congress would be responsible and pay it off james buchanan jr received the nobel prize in economics in 1986 for his examination of how politicians make economic policy decisions he discovered politicians tend to vote to increase debt so they can funnel money to their districts as this will help their reelection but they will not vote for corresponding tax increases to pay for it as this will hurt their reelection buchanan indicated that rather than being disinterested public servants most career bureaucrats are primary interested in getting re elected self preservation is a powerful motivator it is natural for people to want to keep their jobs but when millions of people work for the government this results in them wanting the government to get bigger and bigger as job security this grows into an enormous deep state bureaucracy of individuals who are tempted to use their positions to perpetuate their jobs while harassing auditing and prosecuting those threatening to eliminate their job the keynesian debt stimulated economy has resulted in an unsustainable 22 trillion u s national debt ronald reagan bankrupted the soviet union with the arms race the u s spent money increasing its military and when the soviet union tried to keep up it bankrupted their economy and the berlin wall came down it is an ironic twist that in the decades since the fall of the soviet union the united states has instituted policies to bankrupt itself regarding socialism president gerald ford later stated in rock hill south carolina oct 19 1974 what they don t tell us when they propose all these benefits that they are going to give you from our government that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have similarly president donald j trump stated feb 18 2019 the more power they get the more they crave they want to run healthcare transportation finance energy education socialism is not about justice it s not about equality it s not about lifting up the poor it s about one thing only power for the ruling class world war i fighter ace eddie rickenbacker who later was owner the indianapolis speedway and eastern airlines wanted to repeal woodrow wilson s 16th amendment income tax stating when woodrow wilson told us of the evils of concentrated power less than 9 percent of our entire national income was enough to keep all of the federal and local governments going by 1960 taxes took one third of all our earnings and the federal government spent 70 percent of that the entire gross income of every american is subject to complete federal confiscation rickenbacker continued every time the liberals discover a brand new misinterpretation of the constitution every time they invent a new way to circumvent the constitutional limits of the federal power they pile up more power in washington at the expense of individual liberty across the land instead of advocating freedom modern liberals were striving to pile up the power of government in washington on the other side of the world vladimir lenin s plan to institute socialism included eliminating business owners called bourgeoisie the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation after the 1917 bolshevik revolution in russia communist labor organizers community organizers agitators and agent provocateurs provoking agents infiltrated other countries including the united states lenin stated the goal of socialism is communism they utilized the tactic of psychological projection or blame shifting where the attacker blames the victim sigmund freud wrote in case histories ii pfl 9 p 132 of psychological projection where humans resort to the defensive mechanism of denying in themselves the existence of unpleasant behavior while attributing that exact behavior to others a rude person constantly accuses others of being rude marx is attributed with the phrase accuse the victim of what you do or accuse your opponent of what you are guilty of if you are lying accuse your opponent it if you are racist accuse your opponent it if you are sexually immoral accuse your opponent it if you are engaging in voter fraud accuse your opponent it if you are disseminating fake news accuse your opponent of

on april 15 1865 president lincoln died he was shot the night before in ford s theater on april 15 1912 the titanic sank it struck an iceberg the night before 1 514 lives were lost including millionaires john jacob astor iv benjamin guggenheim and isa strauss all of whom were vocal opponents of the federal reserve act in 1954 april 15 became the deadline for filing income tax returns originally article i section 9 of the u s constitution prohibited a direct federal income tax on american citizens no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken the federal government s revenue was derived from excise taxes on specific items like salt tea tobacco etc and tariff taxes on imports prior to the civil war most tariff taxes were collected at southern ports like charleston south carolina tariffs made foreign goods more expensive motivating people to buy domestically produced goods made mostly in northern factories the south had few factories as its economy was based on agricultural crops mostly cotton and rice which unfortunately relied heavily on slave labor thus the tariff taxes that helped the north hurt the south during the civil war republican president abraham lincoln passed an emergency revenue income tax to raise 750 million to help fund the union it was repealed in 1873 the first non emergency peacetime income tax was attempted in 1894 but the supreme court declared it unconstitutional in pollock v farmers loan justice stephen j field concurred the income tax law under consideration is class legislation whenever a distinction is made in the burdens a law imposes or in the benefits it confers on any citizens by reason of their birth or wealth or religion it is class legislation and leads inevitably to oppression and abuses justice field continued it is the same in essential character as that of the english income statute of 1691 which taxed protestants at a certain rate catholics as a class at double the rate of protestants and jews at another and separate rate industrialists helped bring about the greatest rise in the standard of living for the average person with more goods at cheaper prices than ever before in world history industrialists then began to create monopolies influence political parties and plot to gain control of the banking system republican president theodore roosevelt attempted to limit their power with an inheritance tax republican president william taft yielded to mounting public pressure to tax these rich industrialists by placing a two percent tax on corporate profits as only the wealthiest owned corporate stock with the emergency of world war i threatening democrat president woodrow wilson naively thought there would be world peace if tariff taxes between countries were eliminated wilson proposed replacing the lost tariff revenue with an income tax on the wealthy this was passed in 1913 with the 16th amendment originally the income tax was a one percent tax on the top one percent richest people it was a type of soak the rich tax only intended for industrialists such as rockefeller carnegie vanderbilt fisk flagler gould harriman mellon j p morgan and schwab industrialists strategically avoided paying the income tax by transferring their assets into tax exempt charitable and educational foundations such as the rockefeller foundation and carnegie foundation this tax exempt category had previously been for churches which historically were the providers of social welfare through their hospitals medical clinics orphanages schools soup kitchens where they cared for orphans widows maimed soldiers prisoners unwed mothers widows shut ins homeless juvenile delinquents and immigrants churches also provided a significant social service by instilling morals and virtues into the nation s population this helped reduce crime child abuse broken homes derelicts and other social ills since the relinquishing of these responsibility to government these have become an immense financial burden on taxpayers being in many cases the largest items on state budgets in 1942 with world war ii democrat president franklin roosevelt increased and expanded the federal income tax with the greatest tax bill in american history even instituting paycheck withholding john f kennedy stated april 20 1961 in meeting the demands of war finance the individual income tax moved from a selective tax imposed on the wealthy to the means by which the great majority of our citizens participate in paying beardsley ruml chairman of macy s department store became director of the new york federal reserve bank where he promoted the idea of withholding taxes from people s paychecks kennedy explained april 20 1961 withholding on wages and salaries was introduced during the war when the income tax was extended to millions of new taxpayers businesses gradually became subject to higher taxes higher wages and benefits more lawsuits more governmental bureaucracy more environmental restrictions political favoritism or cronyism toward some companies at the expense of others businesses that did not receive this favoritism began to be faced with the alternative of going out of the country or going out of business as companies outsourced jobs to stay competitive in the growing global market patriotic attachments diminished giving rise to financial globalists john f kennedy noticed feb 6 1961 i have asked the secretary of the treasury to report on whether present tax laws may be stimulating in undue amounts the flow of american capital to the industrial countries abroad kennedy told congress april 20 1961 in those countries where income taxes are lower than in the united states the ability to defer the payment of u s tax by retaining income in the subsidiary companies provides a tax advantage for companies operating through overseas subsidiaries that is not available to companies operating solely in the united states to remedy this democrat president john f kennedy proposed a stimulus plan of lowering taxes across the board as he stated sept 18 1963 a tax cut means higher family income and higher business profits and a balanced federal budget every taxpayer and his family will have more money left over after taxes for a new car a new home new conveniences education and investment every businessman can keep a higher percentage of his profits in his cash register or put it to work expanding or improving his business and as the national income grows the federal government will ultimately end up with more revenues kennedy stated jan 17 1963 lower rates of taxation will stimulate economic activity and so raise the levels of personal and corporate income as to yield within a few years an increased not a reduced flow of revenues to the federal government kennedy stated nov 20 1962 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus john f kennedy stated in his annual message jan 21 1963 in today s economy fiscal prudence and responsibility call for tax reduction even if it temporarily enlarges the federal deficit why reducing taxes is the best way open to us to increase revenues it is no contradiction the most important single thing we can do to stimulate investment in today s economy is to raise consumption by major reduction of individual income tax rates jfk mentioned in his message to congress on tax reduction jan 24 1963 our tax system still siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power and reduces the incentive for risk investment and effort thereby aborting our recoveries and stifling our national growth rate whereas kennedy wanted to reduce taxes to stimulate the economy economist john maynard keynes had proposed stimulating the economy by going in debt john maynard keynes reasoned that if the government went in debt spending money in the private sector to create jobs those jobs would pay taxes and pay off the debt unfortunately politicians were tempted to continually increase debt in order to funnel money to their districts and constituencies to help them get reelected hoping the next congress would be responsible and pay it off james buchanan jr received the nobel prize in economics in 1986 for his examination of how politicians make economic policy decisions he discovered politicians tend to vote to increase debt so they can funnel money to their districts as this will help their reelection but they will not vote for corresponding tax increases to pay for it as this will hurt their reelection buchanan indicated that rather than being disinterested public servants most career bureaucrats are primary interested in getting re elected self preservation is a powerful motivator it is natural for people to want to keep their jobs but when millions of people work for the government this results in them wanting the government to get bigger and bigger as job security this grows into an enormous deep state bureaucracy of individuals who are tempted to use their positions to perpetuate their jobs while harassing auditing and prosecuting those threatening to eliminate their job the keynesian debt stimulated economy has resulted in an unsustainable 22 trillion u s national debt ronald reagan bankrupted the soviet union with the arms race the u s spent money increasing its military and when the soviet union tried to keep up it bankrupted their economy and the berlin wall came down it is an ironic twist that in the decades since the fall of the soviet union the united states has instituted policies to bankrupt itself regarding socialism president gerald ford later stated in rock hill south carolina oct 19 1974 what they don t tell us when they propose all these benefits that they are going to give you from our government that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have similarly president donald j trump stated feb 18 2019 the more power they get the more they crave they want to run healthcare transportation finance energy education socialism is not about justice it s not about equality it s not about lifting up the poor it s about one thing only power for the ruling class world war i fighter ace eddie rickenbacker who later was owner the indianapolis speedway and eastern airlines wanted to repeal woodrow wilson s 16th amendment income tax stating when woodrow wilson told us of the evils of concentrated power less than 9 percent of our entire national income was enough to keep all of the federal and local governments going by 1960 taxes took one third of all our earnings and the federal government spent 70 percent of that the entire gross income of every american is subject to complete federal confiscation rickenbacker continued every time the liberals discover a brand new misinterpretation of the constitution every time they invent a new way to circumvent the constitutional limits of the federal power they pile up more power in washington at the expense of individual liberty across the land instead of advocating freedom modern liberals were striving to pile up the power of government in washington on the other side of the world vladimir lenin s plan to institute socialism included eliminating business owners called bourgeoisie the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation after the 1917 bolshevik revolution in russia communist labor organizers community organizers agitators and agent provocateurs provoking agents infiltrated other countries including the united states lenin stated the goal of socialism is communism they utilized the tactic of psychological projection or blame shifting where the attacker blames the victim sigmund freud wrote in case histories ii pfl 9 p 132 of psychological projection where humans resort to the defensive mechanism of denying in themselves the existence of unpleasant behavior while attributing that exact behavior to others a rude person constantly accuses others of being rude marx is attributed with the phrase accuse the victim of what you do or accuse your opponent of what you are guilty of if you are lying accuse your opponent it if you are racist

the era of fiat currencies and central bank printing presses has desensitized us to massive leverage and its implications so when it is reported for instance that china s private sector borrowing has risen to levels that are unprecedented in financial history this is greeted with a collective yawn it shouldn t be though because no society can continue to borrow this kind of money without spinning out of control some details china issues record new loans in the first quarter of 2019 as beijing battles slowing economy amid trade war china s efforts to battle its slowing economy amid the trade war with the united states gathered pace at the start of 2019 with banks issuing a record amount of new loans in the first quarter of the year banks issued 5 81 trillion yuan us 865 billion of new loans between january to march beating last year s previous high of 4 86 trillion yuan the people s bank of china said on friday in march alone banks issued 1 69 trillion yuan us 251 billion in loans which was the second highest behind only march 2009 when china was at the peak of rolling out an all out stimulus programme which engineered a rebound in china s economic growth but also left the country with a huge debt hangover aggregate financing the broadest measure of credit supply that include bond issuance initial public offering and off balance sheet lending jumped to 2 86 trillion yuan us 425 billion last month while the january march amount was 8 18 trillion yuan us 1 2 trillion up by 2 34 trillion yuan from a year ago the central bank data showed the following chart shows the year over year percentage growth in chinese private sector borrowing assuming generously given the trade war and long in the tooth expansion that chinese gdp growth will average 6 in coming years debt growing at twice that rate is just a tad aggressive especially for an economy that more than quadrupled its debt in the previous decade source tradingeconomics com some comments on the subject from credit bubble bulletin s doug noland beijing has become the poster child for stop and go stimulus measures china employed massive stimulus measures a decade ago to counteract the effects of the global crisis officials have employed various measures over the years to restrain credit and speculative excess while attempting to suppress inflating apartment and real estate bubbles when china s currency and markets faltered in late 2015 early 2016 beijing backed away from tightening measures and was again compelled to aggressively engage the accelerator timid tightening measures were unsuccessful and the bubble rages on china now has the largest banking system in the world and by far the greatest credit expansion the fed s dovish u turn along with a more dovish global central bank community get credit for resuscitating global markets don t however underestimate the impact of booming chinese credit on global financial markets the emerging markets recovery in particular is an upshot of the chinese credit surge booming credit is viewed as ensuring another year of at least 6 0 chinese gdp expansion growth that reverberates throughout em and the global economy more generally the resurgent global bubble has me pondering bubble analysis i often refer to the late cycle terminal phase of excess and how much damage that can be wrought by rapid growth of increasingly risky credit dangerous asset bubbles resource misallocation economic imbalances structural maladjustment inequitable wealth redistribution etc in china and globally we re deep into uncharted territory why can t extremely fast credit growth continue forever because at any given time there are only so many borrowers capable of paying back big loans and most of them have already borrowed what they consider wise for their legitimate needs in order to move the amount of borrowing beyond this natural equilibrium lenders have to find new by definition less creditworthy borrowers let the process continue for a while and an economy ends up with mostly junk credit that is loans unlikely to be repaid which is a pretty good description of today s world
the new runway of the velana international airport constructed by beijing urban construction group co ltd is seen in male the maldives on september 14 2018 xinhua when the belt and road initiative was first put forward in 2013 few might have imagined that it would encompass more than 150 countries and international organizations in collaborative projects in a matter of years the initiative proposed by chinese president xi jinping and consisting of the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road aims to boost connectivity along and beyond the routes of the ancient silk road with a view to enhancing both china s development and its cooperation with global partners it focuses on cementing links in five key areas policies infrastructure trade finance and people to people bonds chinese and laotian technicians at a steel structure processing plant of the china railway no 5 engineering group s china laos railway project division in luang namtha laos on march 21 xinhua policy coordination the number of cooperation documents signed between china and other countries has increased substantially as the circle of participants in the belt and road initiative widens italy became the first member of the group of seven to sign a memorandum of understanding on the initiative with china in march italian prime minister giuseppe conte said italy is glad to seize this historic opportunity to join the belt and road initiative with its special geographical advantage in building connectivity to date china has signed 173 cooperation documents with 125 countries and 29 international organizations according to building the belt and road concept practice and china s contribution issued in may 2017 there were only 46 agreements with 39 countries and international organizations at the time meanwhile the belt and road vision has been incorporated into the documents of major international institutions including the un the group of 20 the asia pacific economic cooperation and the shanghai cooperation organization third party market cooperation was put forward for the first time by china and france in 2015 using this concept china aims to cooperate with developed countries to promote the development of the belt and road initiative over the past years many projects have been carried out in third party markets and tangible results have been achieved japan previously reluctant to participate in the initiative has changed its attitude and begun to work together with china in third party markets in october 2018 during the first forum on china japan third party market cooperation a total of 52 agreements with a combined value of 18 billion were concluded by the two sides these covered fields such as infrastructure finance and logistics and information technology the results of third party market cooperation have effectively responded to the doubts and prejudices some countries have about the initiative various forms of the china plus model have been proposed promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation in different fields in october 2018 china and 17 other countries announced the building of the belt and road energy partnership a forum on international commercial mediation for the belt and road was held in the same month in italy where a joint declaration was issued by 21 institutions from 12 countries in may 2018 china and member countries of the eurasian economic union signed an agreement to cut trade barriers and facilitate economic activities representing a new stage of enhanced cooperation connecting countries china has continued to work with relevant countries to create a transport infrastructure network connecting the sub regions in asia and linking asia africa and europe to enhance connectivity and boost the efficiency of regional and sub regional logistics over the past two years the mombasa nairobi railway and the addis ababa djibouti railway have started commercial operations while the construction of the china laos railway the hungary serbia railway the china thailand railway and the jakarta bandung high speed railway in indonesia has begun moreover the moscow kazan high speed railway and transportation corridors between china and russia have both emerged as promising projects among all the projects the china europe railway express is the most striking in 2018 trips made by cargo trains traveling between china and europe totaled 6 363 a year on year increase of 73 percent the number of return trips from europe to china was 2 690 an increase of 111 percent over 2017 plenty of high quality products from other countries participating in the belt and road initiative enter the chinese market this way the building of a silk road in the air between luxembourg and zhengzhou capital of central china s henan province is another highlight the role of this airborne silk road should not be underestimated the total volume of cargo handled at zhengzhou s airport reached 500 000 tons in 2017 of which shipments to and from luxembourg accounted for nearly a third on 789 flights achievements have been made in the construction of free trade areas on january 1 2018 the free trade agreement fta between china and georgia took effect the first of its kind since the belt and road initiative was proposed subsequently china completed fta negotiations with the maldives and mauritius the agreement with the maldives is the first bilateral fta for the country while mauritius is the first african country to sign an fta with china as of march 2019 china had signed 17 ftas with 25 countries and regions while nine more are under negotiations involving more than 30 countries recent years have also witnessed the flourishing of new business models such as e commerce the electronic world trade platform launched by chinese e commerce giant alibaba is accelerating its construction china and 75 other members of the world trade organization wto including japan the united states the european union and russia released a joint statement in january intending to initiate wto negotiations on trade related aspects of e commerce effective implementation production capacity cooperation under the framework of the belt and road initiative fits participating countries economic diversification and modernization strategies industrial parks and the china kazakhstan model are two representatives of this by the beginning this year 82 industrial parks had been built by chinese enterprises in 24 countries with a total investment of 30 45 billion a total of 4 098 enterprises had been attracted to these parks china kazakhstan cooperation in production capacity is quite different where there are no geographical restrictions and governments play an obvious guiding role intergovernmental discussions have brought about the establishment of funds and special loans enabling the projects to be carried out in november 2018 the 15th discussion on production capacity and investment was held during which 55 key projects were agreed upon with a total investment of about 27 4 billion this model has been applied to other countries for instance china and saudi arabia signed a memorandum of understanding on key projects concerning capacity cooperation in february which identified 18 projects in recent years the belt and road initiative has been facing critical questions by some countries as the number of projects carried out under the initiative increases it is a fact that they might be implemented with varying quality china is making significant policy shifts to ensure high quality implementation the emphasis is on guidance for chinese enterprises for example in august 2017 the national development and reform commission the ministry of commerce the people s bank of china and the ministry of foreign affairs issued a joint circular to provide further guidance and regulation on overseas investment which drew a clear line between the do s and don ts other documents include a code of conduct on private enterprises overseas investment and operation promulgated in january 2018 and guidelines on compliance management of enterprises operating overseas issued in december the same year these are intended to guide enterprises to operate in compliance with laws and regulations another focus is put on services to these enterprises examples include the guidelines on taxation for enterprises going global issued by the state taxation administration in october 2017 and an overview of foreign exchange management policies in belt and road participating countries issued by the state administration of foreign exchange a year later these documents are designed to help enterprises operating overseas become better equipped to cope with uncertainties in foreign markets the reason why the initiative has grown in popularity is that it focuses on development the biggest concern for many countries this means it is in line with the strategic interests of these countries in most participating countries there is a large development gap and much remains to be done regarding infrastructure and urban construction with a full range of industries strong capacity and high efficiency china can cooperate with them in a broad array of areas in addition given burgeoning cooperation between china and developed countries in third party markets an even stronger synergy will be forged the author is deputy director of the center for the belt and road initiative china institute of international studies copyedited by craig crowther

most forecasts expect the economy to stagger forward nigeria s gross domestic product gdp grew by 2 38 per cent in fourth quarter 2018 from 1 81 per cent in third quarter 2018 the international monetary fund imf projects nigeria s growth at 2 1 per cent in 2019 to rise to 2 5 per cent in 2020 if the crude oil price rises and non oil revenue picks up growth rate could be higher for nigeria what s very important is the oil price so to the extent that other global risks transmit into a weaker oil price or there are other developments that are oil market specific this would be a factor weighing on nigeria we expect a growth recovery growth was reasonably strong last year and we think that things will improve a bit going forward we cut our forecasts for 2019 precisely because oil prices are going to be a bit weaker than we expected last time we did the forecast division chief research department international monetary fund imf oya celasun said related posts stock market reinforces identity management to forestall illegal funds imf had earlier predicted growth rate of 2 02 per cent for nigeria in 2019 it however raised the need for major policy decisions to boost revenue position and reduce operational inefficiencies including removal of subsidy increase in tax revenue through increase in value added tax vat and excise duties and removal of tax incentives major decisions with serious political implications the idea of an increase in vat has already been generating strong opposition including from some stalwarts in the ruling political party will the government have the will to push through the reforms many believe the composition of the new cabinet will determine the direction of economic policy managing director apt securities funds limited mallam kasimu kurfi said investors especially foreign investors that contribute more than half of transactions at the nigerian stock market are waiting for clear economic direction to determine their investment priorities financial derivatives company fdc limited noted that the stock market performance appeared to be weighed down by macro concerns rather than the valuation and performance of quoted companies market sentiment has been driven by profit taking and sell pressures despite positive earnings typically there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and asset prices a reduction in interest rates would push up price of assets such as bonds and equities fdc said on the back of continuing price decline after the central bank of nigeria cbn reduced the monetary policy rate mpr by 50 basis points from 14 00 per cent to 13 50 per cent sentiment remains fundamentally weak in the equities market this is not anticipated to change in the immediate as a result of rate cut the gradual recovery in the economy is slow paced and may not support an overtly bullish earnings expectation in the short term afrinvest securities stated waiting for the next push there is almost analysts consensus that the continuing decline at the stock market is a reflection of the macro economic uncertainties despite reduced political risk kurfi noted that foreign investors are waiting for the composition of the executive cabinet the completion of the tenure of the cbn governor and renewal or appointment of a new cbn governor the policy direction of the new cbn administration and the passage of the 2019 national budget these are very important for the direction of the economy especially the capital market these are the reasons our stocks are still going down after elections we need the blueprint on economic policy for the next level as well as the drivers for the economy together with the president s statement these will promote market activities kurfi said chief executive officer sofunix investment and communications mr sola oni said many investors that offloaded out of fear that the last general elections would lead to breakdown of law and order are possibly adopting wait and see attitude especially foreign portfolio investors that are so risk averse according to him the state of the economy is also still tenuous despite the positive gradual recovery indicated by many forecasts as long as quoted companies are operating in a weak economy the market shall continue to serve as barometer of the underlying concerns oni said noting that investors sometimes look beyond corporate earnings in making their investment decisions national president constance shareholders association of nigeria mikail shehu said that political risk remains a major consideration as post election activities have not given strong comfort about political stability a situation compounded by spate of insecurity across the country every investor will like to look at all these factors before taking decision we can only expect the bulls back after may 29 after the inauguration of the president when we start to know the direction of the new government shehu said he noted that the major drivers for economic growth and capital market recovery are political stability capable hands stable policies and generally enabling environment when will the bulls return the outlook for the market in the immediate to short term remains uncertain most pundits see a tepid performance in the second quarter but the strength of the recovery lies in key macro economic decisions the outlook for second quarter largely depends on the state of economy this is more reason why the government should address the issue of infrastructure gap and create enabling environment for the economy to bounce back oni said the second quarter will not be different from the first quarter it could even be worse kurfi said analysts at cordros securities said the market needs positive catalysts to sustain a rebound opting for a cautious trading in the meantime afrinvest securities said the outlook in the near term remains bearish fdc noted that given the quantum of foreign portfolio investors in the nigerian market the ongoing monetary normalisation in developed economies such as united states us could further trigger capital flow reversals in emerging markets including nigeria managing director trust yields securities limited alhaji rasheed yussuf said there is need to develop the trading capability of the domestic investors to enhance liquidity and reduce the vulnerability of the stock market to foreign portfolio fluctuations he urged the securities and exchange commission sec and the cbn to work with the market operators for the reintroduction of margin loans in order to address current liquidity challenge according to him one fundamental problem of the stock market apart from structural issues is liquidity and the market may not witness any meaningful growth until the issue of liquidity is resolved shehu said the government needs to constitute the board of sec and appoint substantive management for the apex capital market regulator to demonstrate its seriousness about the market but there is a consensus on the attractiveness of the nigerian stocks afrinvest securities said nigerian equities are the most attractive among the major african markets yet we believe the market has been far compressed and remains attractive for equity investors although we expect foreign investors to chair this effort we are convinced the next phase is a bullish run afrinvest stated cordros securities stated that stable macro economic fundamentals and compelling valuation remain supportive of recovery in the mid to long term oni said the long running depreciation in share prices has opened up opportunities for discerning investors to build up their portfolios the bull is always at the back of the door oni quipped noting that the market at every point presents opportunities for a discerning investor head corporate communications nse mr olumide orojimi said the exchange is committed to long term growth of the market through financial literacy and investors education according to him the exchange is committed to helping to grow a financially responsible generation through various initiatives and collaborations vice chairman and chief executive officer capital assets limited mr ariyo olushekun said nigerian equities are undervalued and attractive adding that the fundamentals are supportive of a rebound this year as the market totters hither thither the bulls may be behind the door but it will take concerted efforts by all to tickle the bulls to sustained rally
as part of a prospective deal on trade the u s and china have agreed to measures that american officials say will deter beijing from currency manipulation by requiring greater disclosure of economic actions according to current and former officials familiar with the negotiations the deal could also include penalties for china if it manipulates its currency to increase exports which is in violation of international guidelines these people say the fundamental issue on currency across the board is we want to make sure people meet their obligations that they don t devalue their currency for competitive purposes treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in an interview that s the objective the trade deal is still under negotiation and american officials caution that nothing will be final until both sides agree on all points even so an enforceable currency measure would be significant and would represent a further step forward into bringing discipline to the currency manipulation issue said fred bergsten a former top treasury department official and co founder of the peterson institute for international economics the measures for greater economic disclosure are aimed at spotlighting monetary policies that fit the pattern of currency manipulation beijing doesn t disclose the composition of its foreign exchange reserves which at 3 trillion as of last month are the world s largest or its purchases in currency markets that makes it difficult to assess whether beijing is manipulating the yuan china s central bank governor yi gang indicated at a news conference last month that better disclosure of the central bank s forex operations would be part of the deal the currency provisions and the overall deal s enforcement system have already been hammered out as a part of the sprawling u s china trade agreement a work in progress that is meant to end the dispute u s officials say treasury officials declined to provide more information on the currency enforcement rules and a spokeswoman for u s trade representative robert lighthizer declined to comment a spokesman for the chinese embassy in washington didn t immediately respond to a request for comment a senior treasury official said the u s china agreement on currency has similarities to the north american free trade agreement revamp that the trump administration signed last year with canada and mexico the forex deal also has certain aspects that go beyond the new unratified nafta deal known as the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca economists and politicians in recent years have grown more worried about countries manipulating their currencies to favor exports over imports effectively reducing or eliminating the gains that companies operating in one currency get from lower tariffs negotiated in trade agreements such currency manipulation isn t allowed under the guidelines of international organizations including the group of 20 leading global economies but these organizations don t have enforcement mechanisms to hold countries to account major economies and their central banks have been reluctant to tie their own hands when it comes to monetary tools seeing it as a key part of economic sovereignty in 2016 president trump said he would formally declare china a currency manipulator when he took office but his administration backed down on that promise administration officials say china hasn t intervened recently to cheapen its currency but could do so in the future many u s lawmakers and some exporting industries have long pressed for currency rules in trade agreements the obama administration in 2015 spearheaded a nonbinding currency understanding among the u s and 11 pacific countries included in the trans pacific partnership but mr trump withdrew from that agreement then last year the trump administration included an currency portion in the usmca which awaits congressional approval the usmca language was seen as a deterrent to manipulation still only a section on transparency will be enforceable if the new north american deal enters into force economists say some expect the china pact to go further on enforcement than just requiring transparency with penalties for violating international economic principles in ways that cheapen a national currency mr bertsten said there is a possibility that the enforcement mechanism may have broader coverage which would be significant and would represent a further step forward into bringing discipline to the currency manipulation issue mr bergsten said the u s and china would likely solve currency disputes in similar fashion to strictly trade related issues perhaps with sets of consultations among economic or treasury officials from the two nations with tariffs and perhaps other sanctions allowed as penalties as a so called executive agreement that wouldn t be submitted to congress for ratification the u s china deal wouldn t have the same legal structure as a free trade agreement some members of congress worry the pact could improperly change u s trade policies without their approval source dow jones
the new runway of the velana international airport constructed by beijing urban construction group co ltd is seen in male the maldives on september 14 2018 xinhua when the belt and road initiative was first put forward in 2013 few might have imagined that it would encompass more than 150 countries and international organizations in collaborative projects in a matter of years the initiative proposed by chinese president xi jinping and consisting of the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road aims to boost connectivity along and beyond the routes of the ancient silk road with a view to enhancing both china s development and its cooperation with global partners it focuses on cementing links in five key areas policies infrastructure trade finance and people to people

policy coordination the number of cooperation documents signed between china and other countries has increased substantially as the circle of participants in the belt and road initiative widens italy became the first member of the group of seven to sign a memorandum of understanding on the initiative with china in march italian prime minister giuseppe conte said italy is glad to seize this historic opportunity to join the belt and road initiative with its special geographical advantage in building connectivity to date china has signed 173 cooperation documents with 125 countries and 29 international organizations according to building the belt and road concept practice and china s contribution issued in may 2017 there were only 46 agreements with 39 countries and international organizations at the time meanwhile the belt and road vision has been incorporated into the documents of major international institutions including the un the group of 20 the asia pacific economic cooperation and the shanghai cooperation organization third party market cooperation was put forward for the first time by china and france in 2015 using this concept china aims to cooperate with developed countries to promote the development of the belt and road initiative over the past years many projects have been carried out in third party markets and tangible results have been achieved japan previously reluctant to participate in the initiative has changed its attitude and begun to work together with china in third party markets in october 2018 during the first forum on china japan third party market cooperation a total of 52 agreements with a combined value of 18 billion were concluded by the two sides these covered fields such as infrastructure finance and logistics and information technology the results of third party market cooperation have effectively responded to the doubts and prejudices some countries have about the initiative various forms of the china plus model have been proposed promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation in different fields in october 2018 china and 17 other countries announced the building of the belt and road energy partnership a forum on international commercial mediation for the belt and road was held in the same month in italy where a joint declaration was issued by 21 institutions from 12 countries in may 2018 china and member countries of the eurasian economic union signed an agreement to cut trade barriers and facilitate economic activities representing a new stage of enhanced cooperation connecting countries china has continued to work with relevant countries to create a transport infrastructure network connecting the sub regions in asia and linking asia africa and europe to enhance connectivity and boost the efficiency of regional and sub regional logistics over the past two years the mombasa nairobi railway and the addis ababa djibouti railway have started commercial operations while the construction of the china laos railway the hungary serbia railway the china thailand railway and the jakarta bandung high speed railway in indonesia has begun moreover the moscow kazan high speed railway and transportation corridors between china and russia have both emerged as promising projects among all the projects the china europe railway express is the most striking in 2018 trips made by cargo trains traveling between china and europe totaled 6 363 a year on year increase of 73 percent the number of return trips from europe to china was 2 690 an increase of 111 percent over 2017 plenty of high quality products from other countries participating in the belt and road initiative enter the chinese market this way the building of a silk road in the air between luxembourg and zhengzhou capital of central china s henan province is another highlight the role of this airborne silk road should not be underestimated the total volume of cargo handled at zhengzhou s airport reached 500 000 tons in 2017 of which shipments to and from luxembourg accounted for nearly a third on 789 flights achievements have been made in the construction of free trade areas on january 1 2018 the free trade agreement fta between china and georgia took effect the first of its kind since the belt and road initiative was proposed subsequently china completed fta negotiations with the maldives and mauritius the agreement with the maldives is the first bilateral fta for the country while mauritius is the first african country to sign an fta with china as of march 2019 china had signed 17 ftas with 25 countries and regions while nine more are under negotiations involving more than 30 countries recent years have also witnessed the flourishing of new business models such as e commerce the electronic world trade platform launched by chinese e commerce giant alibaba is accelerating its construction china and 75 other members of the world trade organization wto including japan the united states the european union and russia released a joint statement in january intending to initiate wto negotiations on trade related aspects of e commerce effective implementation production capacity cooperation under the framework of the belt and road initiative fits participating countries economic diversification and modernization strategies industrial parks and the china kazakhstan model are two representatives of this by the beginning this year 82 industrial parks had been built by chinese enterprises in 24 countries with a total investment of 30 45 billion a total of 4 098 enterprises had been attracted to these parks china kazakhstan cooperation in production capacity is quite different where there are no geographical restrictions and governments play an obvious guiding role intergovernmental discussions have brought about the establishment of funds and special loans enabling the projects to be carried out in november 2018 the 15th discussion on production capacity and investment was held during which 55 key projects were agreed upon with a total investment of about 27 4 billion this model has been applied to other countries for instance china and saudi arabia signed a memorandum of understanding on key projects concerning capacity cooperation in february which identified 18 projects in recent years the belt and road initiative has been facing critical questions by some countries as the number of projects carried out under the initiative increases it is a fact that they might be implemented with varying quality china is making significant policy shifts to ensure high quality implementation the emphasis is on guidance for chinese enterprises for example in august 2017 the national development and reform commission the ministry of commerce the people s bank of china and the ministry of foreign affairs issued a joint circular to provide further guidance and regulation on overseas investment which drew a clear line between the do s and don ts other documents include a code of conduct on private enterprises overseas investment and operation promulgated in january 2018 and guidelines on compliance management of enterprises operating overseas issued in december the same year these are intended to guide enterprises to operate in compliance with laws and regulations another focus is put on services to these enterprises examples include the guidelines on taxation for enterprises going global issued by the state taxation administration in october 2017 and an overview of foreign exchange management policies in belt and road participating countries issued by the state administration of foreign exchange a year later these documents are designed to help enterprises operating overseas become better equipped to cope with uncertainties in foreign markets the reason why the initiative has grown in popularity is that it focuses on development the biggest concern for many countries this means it is in line with the strategic interests of these countries in most participating countries there is a large development gap and much remains to be done regarding infrastructure and urban construction with a full range of

how singapore conquered corruption in the words of lky this is a chapter from lyk s from third world to first the singapore story 1965 2000 keeping the government clean when the pap government took office in 1959 we set out to have a clean administration we were sickened by the greed corruption and decadence of many asian leaders fighters for freedom for their oppressed peoples had become plunderers of their wealth their societies slid backward we were swept up by the wave of revolution in asia determined to get rid of colonial rule but angry at and ashamed of the asian nationalist leaders whose failure to live up to their ideals had disillusioned us in england after the war i met students from china whose burning ambition was to rid china of the corruption and incompetence of the nationalist chinese leaders hyperinflation and wholesale looting had led to their ignominious defeat and retreat to taiwan it was disgust with the venality greed and immorality of those men that made so many chinese school students in singapore pro communists the students saw the communists as exemplars of dedication sacrifice and selflessness the revolutionary virtues displayed in the spartan lives of the chinese communist leaders those were the prevailing beliefs of the time one important decision we made before the may 1959 general election highlighted our position on corruption lim yew hock s government 1956 1959 had started to go corrupt his education minister chew swee kee had received s 1 million money from an american source to fight the communists in the coming elections there was widespread market talk of smaller amounts paid for less ideological reasons we had grave reservations over fighting the election to win because we felt unprepared and not sufficiently organized to take on the communists whom we expected to turn on us once we were the government but to allow this group of scoundrels another five year term would corrupt the public servants who were on the whole still honest and once this happened we would not be able to work the system we decided to fight to win there were temptations everywhere not only in singapore for example the first official contacts foreigners have when entering a country are immigration and customs officers at many airports in southeast asia travellers often find themselves delayed at customs clearance until a suitable inducement often hard cash is forthcoming the same tiresome practice is found among traffic police when stopped for alleged speeding drivers have to hand over their driving license together with the ongoing rate in dollars to avoid further action the superior officers do not set a good example in many cities in the region even hospital admission after a traffic accident needs a bribe to get prompt attention petty power invested in men who cannot live on their salaries is an invitation to misuse that power we had a deep sense of mission to establish a clean and effective government when we took the oath of office at the ceremony in the city council chamber in june 1959 we all wore white shirts and white slacks to symbolize purity and honesty in our personal behavior and our public life the people expected this of us and we were determined to live up to their expectations the pro communists paraded their working class credentials in their dress style rumpled shirt sleeves and slacks travel mode buses and taxis sleeping quarters back rooms of unions offices and chinese school education they derided my air conditioned office and home my large american studebaker car my golf and beer drinking my bourgeois family background and my cambridge education but they could not accuse my colleagues and me of making money out of the workers and unions we helped all my ministers except one were university graduates out of office we were confident of getting by and professionals like myself had every expectation of doing so there was no need to put by something extra for that eventuality more important most of us had working wives who could support the family if we were imprisoned or not around this shaped the attitudes of my ministers and their wives when ministers commanded the respect and confidence of the people public servants were also able to hold their heads high and make decisions with confidence it made a critical difference in our battle against the communists we made sure from the day we took office in june 1959 that every dollar in revenue would be properly accounted for and would reach the beneficiaries at the grass roots as one dollar without being siphoned off along the way so from the very beginning we gave special attention to the areas where discretionary powers had been exploited for personal gain and sharpened the instruments that could prevent detect or deter such practices the principal agency charged with this task was the corrupt practices investigation bureau cpib set up by the british in 1952 to deal with increasing corruption especially at lower and middle levels of the police hawker inspectors and land bailiffs who had to take action against the many who broke the law by occupying public roads for illegal hawking or state land for building their squatter huts these inspectors could either issue a summons or look the other way for an appropriate bribe we decided to concentrate on the big takers in the higher echelons and directed the cpib on our priorities for the smaller fish we set out to simplify procedures and remove discretion by having clear published guidelines even doing away with the need for permits or approvals in less important areas as we ran into problems in securing convictions in prosecutions we tightened the law in stages in 1960 we changed the outdated 1937 anticorruption law and widened the definition of gratuity to include anything of value the amendments gave wide powers to investigators including arrest and search and investigation of bank accounts and bank books of suspected persons and their wives children or agents it became unnecessary to prove that the person who accepted a bribe was in a position to carry out the required favor the comptroller of income tax was obliged to give information concerning anyone investigated the existing law that the evidence of an accomplice was unworthy of credit unless corroborated was changed to allow the judge to accept the evidence of an accomplice the most effective change we made in 1960 was to allow the courts to treat proof that an accused was living beyond his or her means or had property his or her income could not explain as corroborating evidence that the accused had accepted or obtained a bribe with a keen nose to the ground and the power to investigate every officer and every minister the director of the cpib working from the prime minister s office developed a justly formidable reputation for sniffing out those betraying the public trust in 1963 we made it compulsory for witnesses summoned by the cpib to present themselves to give information in 1989 we increased the maximum fine for corruption from s 10 000 to s 100 000 giving false or misleading information to the cpib became an offense subject to imprisonment and a fine of up to s 10 000 and the courts were empowered to confiscate the benefits derived from corruption corruption used to be organized on a large scale in certain areas in 1971 the cpib broke up a syndicate of over 250 mobile squad policemen who received payments ranging from s 5 to s 10 per month from truck owners whose vehicles they recognized by the addresses painted on the sides of the trucks those owners who refused to pay would be constantly harassed by having summonses issued against them customs officers would receive bribes to speed up the checking of vehicles smuggling in prohibited goods personnel in the central supplies office the government s procurement department provided information on tender bids for a fee officers in the import and export department received bribes to hasten the issue of permits contractors bribed clerks of works to allow short piling public health laborers were paid by shopkeepers and residents to do their job of clearing refuse principals and teachers in some chinese schools received commissions from stationery suppliers human ingenuity is infinite when translating power and discretion into personal gain it was not too difficult to clean up these organized rackets isolated opportunistic acts of corruption were more difficult to detect and when discovered had to be squashed high profile cases made the headlines several ministers were guilty of corruption one in each of the decades from the 1960s to the 1980s tan kia gan was the minister for national development until he lost the 1963 election we were close colleagues from the early 1950s when he was the leader of the malayan airways engineers union and i was its legal adviser we appointed him a director on the board of malaysian airways at a board meeting of the company in august 1966 tan took strong objection to the purchase of boeing aircraft a few days later a mr lim contacted first national city bank boeing s bankers to offer his services for a consideration he was tan kia gan s business friend the bank knew of the government s strict stand against corruption and reported the matter lim refused to implicate tan kia gan and tan could not be prosecuted but i was convinced tan was behind it unpleasant and painful as the decision was i issued a statement to say that as the government s representative on the board of malaysian airways he had not discharged his duties beyond reproach i removed him from the board and from all his other appointments kim san told me later that tan was down at heel unable to do much because he was ostracized i was sad but there was no other course i could have taken wee toon boon was minister of state in the ministry of the environment in 1975 when he took a free trip to indonesia for himself and his family members paid for by a housing developer on whose behalf he made representations to civil servants he also accepted a bungalow worth s 500 000 from this developer and took two overdrafts totalling s 300 000 in his father s name against the personal guarantee of the developer to speculate in shares he was a loyal noncommunist trade union leader from the 1950s it was painful to confront him and hear his unconvincing protestations of innocence he was charged convicted and sentenced to four years and six months in jail he appealed the convictions were upheld but the sentence was reduced by 18 months in december 1979 we suddenly faced a serious setback phey yew kok then president of the ntuc and a pap mp was charged on four counts of criminal breach of trust involving a total sum of s 83 000 he was also charged on two counts under the trade unions act for investing s 18 000 of trade union money in a private supermarket without the approval of the minister as was normal in such cases he was released on bail devan nair as secretary general of the ntuc was close to phey yew kok and believed in his innocence he wanted the cpib to review the case saying that an innocent man was being destroyed on false charges i did not agree because i had seen the investigation reports and had allowed the cpib to proceed he was so convinced of phey s innocence and concerned at losing a valuable aide in the trade union movement that he spoke vehemently to me over lunch one saturday in his presence i rang up the director of the cpib and told him to show devan nair in strict confidence the evidence he had against phey yew kok immediately after that lunch after he read the evidence devan did not contact me phey yew kok decided to jump bail and his two sureties lost their s 50 000 when he never returned he was last heard of in thailand eking out a miserable existence as a fugitive subject to blackmail by immigration and police authorities the most dramatic downfall was that of teh cheang wan then minister for national development in november 1986 one of his old associates admitted under questioning by the cpib that he had given teh two cash payments of s 400 000 each in one case to allow a development company to retain part of its land which had been earmarked for compulsory government acquisition and in the second to assist a developer in the purchase of state land for private development these bribes had taken place in 1981 and 1982 he denied receiving the money and tried to bargain with the senior assistant director of the cpib for the case not to be pursued the cabinet secretary reported this and said teh had asked to see me i replied that i could not until the investigations were over a week later on the morning of 15 december 1986 my security officer reported that teh had died and left me a letter prime minister i have been feeling very sad and depressed for the last two weeks i feel responsible for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident and i feel i should accept full responsibility as an honourable oriental gentleman i feel it is only right that i should pay the highest penalty for my mistake yours faithfully teh cheang wan i visited the widow and viewed his body lying in his bed she said he had served the government all his life and wanted to preserve his honor she asked if it was possible not to have a coroner s inquiry that was only possible if she got a death certificate from his doctor that he had died of natural causes inevitably there was a coroner s inquiry that found he had taken his life with a massive overdose of sodium amytal the opposition took it up in parliament and demanded a commission of inquiry i immediately agreed this created more painful publicity for his wife and daughter soon afterward they left singapore and never returned they had lost too much face we had established a climate of opinion that looked upon corruption in public office as a threat to society teh preferred to take his life rather than face disgrace and ostracism i never understood why he took this s 800 000 he was an able and resourceful architect and could have made many millions honestly in private practice it is easy to start off with high moral standards strong convictions and determination to beat down corruption but it is difficult to live up to these good intentions unless the leaders are strong and determined enough to deal with all transgressors and without exceptions cpib officers must be supported without fear or favor to enforce the rules the institute of management development s world competitiveness yearbook 1997 ranked the least corrupt countries in the whole world giving 10 points as the perfect score for the country with no corruption singapore was ranked as the least corrupt country in asia with a score of 9 18 ahead of hong kong japan and taiwan transparency international based in berlin placed singapore in seventh place worldwide in 1998 for absence of corruption the percentage kickback baksheesh slush or whatever the local euphemism is a way of life in asia people openly accept it as a part of their culture ministers and officials cannot live on their salaries to the standard of their office the higher they are the bigger their homes and more numerous their wives concubines or mistresses all bedecked in jewelry appropriate to the power and position of their men singaporeans who do business in these countries have to take care not to bring home such practices when the chinese communists came to power they made a great play of their total honesty and dedication waiters and chambermaids in the china of the 1950s and 1960s would return every scrap of property left behind in the hotel even things the guests had intended to discard it was an ostentatious display of their total disinterest in material possessions but during the height of the cultural revolution 1966 1976 the system broke down favoritism nepotism and covert corruption infected high places the whole society was degraded as opportunists masqueraded as revolutionaries and achieved helicopter promotions by betraying and persecuting their peers or superiors corruption became worse when china embarked on its open door policy in 1978 many communist activists who felt they had been deceived and had wasted the best years of their lives set out to make up for lost time and enrich themselves in every way they could the same happened with communists in vietnam after they opened up to foreign investments and the free market in the late 1980s corruption infected the communist party both regimes once justly proud of their total selflessness and dedication to the communist cause are bedeviled by worse corruption than the decadent capitalist asian countries they used to revile and despise a precondition for an honest government is that candidates must not need large sums of money to get elected or it must trigger off the cycle of corruption the bane of most countries in asia has been the high cost of elections having spent a lot to get elected winners must recover their costs and also accumulate funds for the next election the system is self perpetuating to be elected to taiwan s legislative yuan in the 1990s some kmt candidates spent as much as us l 0 20 million once elected they had to recoup and prepare for the next round by using their influence with government ministers and officials to get contracts awarded or to convert land use from agricultural to industrial or urban development in thailand a former government minister described it as commercial democracy the purchased mandate in 1996 some 2 000 candidates spent about 30 billion bahts us l 2 billion one prime minister was called mr atm automatic teller machine because he was renowned for dispensing cash to candidates and voters he retorted that he was not the only atm in malaysia umno leaders call it money politics in his speech to party delegates in october 1996 prime minister dr mahathir mohamad noted that some candidates vying for higher positions had been offering bribes and gifts to delegates in exchange for votes dr mahathir deplored the practice of money politics and was moved to tears as he urged party delegates not to let bribery destroy the malay race religion and nation according to malaysian news reports bank negara ran out of rm 1 000 and rm5 000 notes at the height of the campaign leading to the umno party delegates conference in 1993 indonesia was a celebrated example of corruption on such a grand scale that indonesian media coined the acronym kkn for kolusi collusion korupsi corruption and nepotisme nepotism president suharto s children friends and cronies set examples that made kkn an irreducible part of indonesian culture the american media assessed the suharto family to be worth us 42 billion before the financial crisis reduced their value corruption was worse under president habibie ministers and officials uncertain of their positions after the election for a new president made the most of the time left habibie s aides accumulated huge funds to buy votes in the mpr people s consultative assembly to get elected the going rate reportedly was more than a quarter million u s dollars for each vote the most expensive of all election systems is japan s japanese ministers and diet members mps are paid modest salaries and allowances a japanese mp requires over us l million a year to maintain his support staff both in tokyo and in his constituency as well as to provide gifts to voters for birthdays births marriages and funerals in an election year the candidate needs over us 5 million he depends on his faction leader for funds since a leader s power depends on the number of diet members who support and depend on him he has to amass vast sums to finance his followers during and between elections singapore has avoided the use of money to win elections as leader of the opposition i had persuaded chief minister lim yew hock in 1959 to make voting compulsory and prohibit the practice of using cars to take voters to the polls after winning power we cleaned up triad secret society influence from politics our most formidable opponents the communists did not use money to win voters our own election expenses were small well below the amount allowed by law there was no need for the party to replenish its coffers after elections and between elections there were no gifts for voters we got them to vote for us again and again by providing jobs building schools hospitals community centers and most important of all homes which they owned these are substantial benefits that changed their lives and convinced them that their children s future lay with the pap opposition parties also did not need money they defeated our candidates because the electorate wanted an opposition mp to pressure the government for more concessions western liberals have argued that a completely unfettered press will expose corruption and make for clean honest government yet uninhibited and freewheeling press and television in india the philippines thailand taiwan south korea and japan have not stopped the pervasive and deeply embedded corruption in these countries while the most telling example of a free media being part and parcel of its owner s corruption is former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi he owns a large media network but was himself investigated and charged for corrupt practices committed before he became prime minister on the other hand singapore has shown that a system of clean no money elections helps to preserve an honest government but singapore will remain clean and honest only if honest and able men are willing to fight elections and assume office they must be paid a wage commensurate with what men of their ability and integrity are earning for managing a big corporation or a successful legal or other professional practice they have to manage a singapore economy that yielded an annual growth rate of 8 to 9 percent in the last two decades giving its citizens a per capita gdp that the world bank rated in 1995 as the ninth highest in the world with the founder generation of leaders honesty had become a habit my colleagues would spurn any attempt to suborn them they had put their lives in jeopardy to achieve power not to enrich themselves but to change society however this group could not be replicated because it was not possible to recreate the conditions that made them different our successors have become ministers as one of many career options and not the most attractive one if we underpay men of quality as ministers we cannot expect them to stay long in office earning a fraction of what they could outside with high economic growth and higher earnings in the private sector ministers salaries have to match their counterparts in the private sector underpaid ministers and public officials have ruined many governments in asia adequate remuneration is vital for high standards of probity in political leaders and high officials in a debate on the budget in march 1985 i took the opposition to task for opposing ministerial pay increases j b jeyaretnam of the workers party had contrasted my monthly salary of s 29 000 with that of the prime minister of malaysia who was paid s 10 000 but took only s 9 000 i went further to compare the salaries of philippines president marcos at 100 000 pesos yearly or just over s 1 000 a month and the president of indonesia governing 150 million people at a monthly salary of 1 2 million rupiahs or s 2 500 however they were all wealthier than i was an indonesian leader retained his official residence on retirement a malaysian prime minister was given a house or land to build his private residence my official residence belonged to the government i had no perks no cars with chauffeurs thrown in or ministerial quarters with gardeners cooks and other servants in attendance my practice was to have all benefits expressed in a lump sum and let the prime minister and ministers themselves decide what they wanted to spend it on i referred to the wage scales of the people s republic of china their lowest wage was 18 yuan and the highest 560 yuan a ratio of 1 31 but this did not reflect the difference in the quality of life between the lowest and the highest in the land who lived behind the walls of the zhongnanhai near the forbidden city nor did it take into account the access to different foods and goods with cooks other domestic staff and medical services that made for a different quality of life ostentatious egalitarianism is good politics for decades in mao s china the people wore the same style mao jacket and trousers ostensibly of the same material with the same ill fitting cut in fact there were different grades of mao jackets a provincial leader in charge of tourism explained to one of my ministers that while they might look alike they were of different quality cloth to emphasize his point he unbuttoned his jacket to show that it was fur lined the need for popular support makes governments who have to be elected into office as a rule underpay ministers in their official salaries but semihidden perks in housing an expense account a car travel children s education and other allowances often make up more than their salaries in successive debates in parliament in the 1980s and 1990s i pointed out that the remuneration of ministers and political appointees in britain the united states and most countries in the west had not kept pace with their economic growth they had assumed that people who went into politics were gentlemen with private means indeed in prewar britain people without private incomes were seldom found in parliament while this is no longer the case in britain or the united states most successful people are too busy and doing too well to want to be in government in the united states highly paid persons from the private sector are appointed by the president for brief periods of one or two terms then they return to their private sector occupations as lawyers company chairpersons or lobbyists with enhanced value because they now enjoy easy access to key people in the administration i thought this revolving door system undesirable after independence i had frozen ministerial salaries and kept public service wage increases at a low level to be sure that we would cope with the expected unemployment and slowdown in the economy and to set an example of restraint when we had no serious unemployment by 1970 and everybody breathed a little easier i increased ministers salaries from s 2 500 to s 4 500 per month but kept my own fixed at s 3 500 to remind the public service that some restraint was still necessary every few years i had to increase ministerial salaries to narrow the widening gap with private sector rewards in 1978 dr tony tan was general manager of the oversea chinese banking corporation a big local bank on a salary scale that would have taken him to s 950 000 per year i had persuaded him to resign to become minister of state for which he was paid less than a third of his former salary apart from losing his perks the most valuable of which was a car with a driver ong teng cheong the minister for communications had also made a sacrifice by giving up a successful practice as an architect during a building boom when i was senior minister i proposed in parliament in 1994 that the government settle a formula so that revisions to salaries of ministers judges and top civil servants were automatic linked to the income tax returns of the private sector with the singapore economy growing at 7 to 10 percent per annum for over two decades public sector salaries were always lagging two or three years behind the private sector in 1995 prime minister goh decided on a formula i had proposed that would peg the salaries of ministers and senior public officers to those of their private sector counterparts this would automatically entitle them to an increase as incomes in the private sector increased this change to a formula pegged at two thirds of the earnings of their private sector equivalents as disclosed in their income tax returns caused an enormous stir especially with the professionals who felt that it was completely out of proportion to what ministers were paid in advanced countries people had for so long been accustomed to having public servants paid modest salaries that the idea that ministers not only exercised power but were also paid in accordance with the importance of the job upset their sense of propriety i was able to help the prime minister justify this change and rebut the arguments that ministers were more than adequately compensated by the honor of high office and the power they wielded and that public service should entail sacrifice of income i believed this high minded approach was unrealistic and the surest way to make ministers serve only briefly whereas continuity in office and the experience thus gained have been a great advantage and strength in the singapore government our ministers have provided the experience and judgment the government has shown in its decisions the result of their ability to think and plan long term in the general election 18 months later the prime minister carried the electorate although the opposition made ministerial salaries an issue people want a good honest clean government that produced results that was what the pap provided it is now less difficult to recruit talent from the private sector before the salary formula was implemented top litigation lawyers were earning s 1 to 2 million a year while judges were paid less than s 300 000 without this change we would never have been able to appoint some of our best practicing lawyers to the judiciary we also had the salaries of doctors and other professionals in government service linked to the incomes of their counterparts in private practice this salary formula does not mean increments every year because the private sector incomes go up and down when they went down in 1995 the salaries of all ministers and senior officials were reduced accordingly in 1997 to guard against a freak election of a less than honorable and honest group into government i had proposed at a national day rally in august 1984 that we have an elected president to safeguard the nation s reserves he would also have powers to override a prime minister who held up investigations for corruption against himself his ministers or senior officials and to veto unsuitable appointments to high positions like chief justice chief of defense staff or commissioner of police such a president would need an independent mandate from the electorate many believed i was preparing a position for myself after i stepped down as prime minister in fact i had no interest in this high office as it would be too passive for my temperament this proposal and its implications were debated as a white paper in parliament in 1988 several years later in 1992 the constitution was amended by prime minister goh chok tong to provide for an elected president we had to keep the right balance between the president s powers and the legitimate discretionary powers of the prime minister and his cabinet when the countries of east asia from south korea to indonesia were devastated by the financial crisis in 1997 corruption and cronyism aggravated their woes singapore weathered the crisis better because there was no corruption and cronyism that had cost the other countries many billions in losses it was the high standards we maintained that made prime minister goh chok tong order an investigation into purchases in 1995 of two properties each made by my wife on my behalf and by my son lee hsien loong the deputy prime minister they had both enjoyed discounts for the property purchases the developer had given the same unsolicited 5 to 7 percent discounts on these purchases as he had given to 5 to 10 percent of his other buyers at a soft launch to test the market immediately after their purchase in the heat of the property boom the properties escalated in price those who had not been given a chance to buy at the soft launch made complaints to the committee of the stock exchange of singapore ses the developer was a public listed company after investigations the ses found that the developer had acted within its rights because my brother was a nonexecutive director of the company a rumor went around that my son and i had gained an unfair advantage when purchasing these properties the monetary authority of singapore investigated and reported to prime minister goh that there was nothing improper in the discounts given to us choo was indignant at the charge of impropriety she had been a conveyancing lawyer for 40 years and knew that giving discounts in sales was a common practice by all developers i was equally angry and decided to scotch suspicions of improper dealings by going public with our purchases and the unsolicited discounts we paid over the value of the discounts which amounted to a total of s l million to the finance minister i e the government the prime minister ordered this sum to be returned to us because he agreed there had been no impropriety and the government was not entitled to the money loong and i did not want to appear to have benefited from my brother being a director of the developer company and decided to give the s l million to charity i asked the prime minister to take the matter to parliament for a thorough airing of the issue in the debate opposition mps including two lawyers one of them the leader of the opposition said that in their experience the giving of such discounts was standard marketing practice and there was nothing improper in our purchases this open and complete disclosure of a perceived unfair advantage made it a nonissue in the general election a year later as i told the house the fact that the system i had set in place could investigate and report upon my conduct proved that it was

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news of upbeat data downbeat expectations firstly ecb boss mario draghi took the rare step of criticising donald trump for trying to undermine the independence of the us federal reserve speaking to reporters at the imf meeting in washington draghi said he was certainly worried about central bank independence and especially in the most important jurisdiction in the world equity markets ended last week in a risk on mood while the s p500 was only up about 0 7 on the day that cements in an almost 16 gain for 2019 and takes it to within a whisker of an all time high in october 2018 driving the market are good earnings reports especially from us banks retailers are struggling however especially bricks and mortar retailers that risk on mood is also pushing up benchmark bond yields among american consumers however the mood is tailing off a bit the latest sentiment survey in the university of michigan poll saw a 1 5 point retreat in china their equity markets closed unchanged on friday and that is a 29 gain for 2019 so far china s march trade balance swelled to almost nz ½ tln as exports recovered after the big dip in february march imports however were quite restrained china s merchandise trade surplus in march with the us seems to have been huge as much as us 200 bln in the month but seasonal factors are likely to have played a big part in these unusual numbers still it is the import fall that has analysts worried meanwhile china s new bank loans jumped in march rising far more than expected as policymakers pushed lenders to support struggling smaller companies and shore up the slowing economy an even greater worry are the huge debts of local authorities that still haven t fully been quantified or the assets they back fully valued central government agencies are now involved trying to sort things out but the prognosis in not great there are dozens of organisations involved the worry is compounded because 2019 marks the beginning of a three year peak debt repayment period it has the possibility of getting very messy china s passenger car sales fell for the tenth month in a row last month dropping 12 from the same month a year ago their whole vehicle industry is in reverse except perhaps for the still small ev segment in brussels they are reported to have drawn up a tariff response on about us 12 bln of us goods if the trump administration goes ahead with its penalty against airbus and the move comes after the wto ruled boeing failed to comply with previous aid rulings in australia the data is relatively upbeat but expectations are not it is similar in new zealand and that poses a puzzle for monetary policy officials what they see in the economy is different to what they hear from voices claiming to be at the coalface in a property dominated economy property voices are loudest but as usual not really in tune with the underlying drivers of economic activity it s a tussle between facts and feelings the wealth effect at play the ust 10yr yield rose strongly at the end of the wall street session and is now at 2 56 which is a 15 bps shift up in the past two weeks a third of that in the final session last week their 2 10 curve is little changed however at 17 bps but their negative 1 5 curve is narrower at 6 bps the aussie govt 10yr is sharply higher at 1 97 and a final session rise of 9 bps the china govt 10yr is up 1 bp at 3 33 while the nz govt 10 yr is at 2 04 and down 1 bp gold is little changed at us 1 290 us oil prices are also little changed now just on us 63 50 bbl while the brent benchmark is at us 71 50 bbl the kiwi dollar will start the week at 67 7 usc on the cross rates we are at 94 4 auc against the euro we are at 59 8 euro cents that puts the twi 5 at 72 2 bitcoin is at us 5 091 and almost exactly 2 lower than this time last week this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here
zimbabwe has been recording a budget surplus since december 2018 but the economic situation in the country is still dire with the ordinary citizen struggling to afford a decent living by mthandazo nyoni zimbabwe has been recording a budget surplus since december 2018 but the economic situation in the country is still dire with the ordinary citizen struggling to afford a decent living finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube revealed that the monthly budget deficit declined from 242 million in november 2018 to a surplus of 733 million in december 2018 a similar trend continued in january 2019 with the government having indicated a provisional surplus of 113 million in fact the country has been running a surplus of 100 million in the last four months according to ncube the surplus is being attributed to ncube s emphasis on cutting spending and an increase in taxes in its latest report the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development zimcodd indicated that the budget surplus was not congruent to the socioeconomic situation in the country where an ordinary citizen s life has not improved it is however ironic that surplus announcement comes at a time when the country is grappling with socio economic woes characterised by deplorable public social service delivery and where 70 of the country s population is languishing in poverty the report reads surplus should be a reflection of the general population s decent social and economic being nevertheless this is a different case in zimbabwe given that the november 2018 to january 2019 period was marred with socioeconomic instability characterised by public hospitals doctors strike and social unrests that loomed in january 2019 following fuel price hikes the surplus speaks more to the increased tax base rather than fiscal discipline as may be purported by the tax authorities zimcodd said ncube s re basing of the economy from 18 billion to 24 8 billion provides the government more room to borrow and increase the tax base meanwhile zimcodd said considering that tobacco was the second largest foreign currency earner after gold the golden leaf producers were entitled to foreign currency zimbabwe s tobacco export earning closed 2018 at us 892 million from 184 1 million kilogrammes exported farmers should be paid their hard earned currency and allowed to voluntarily participate in the foreign exchange market zimcodd said the organisation said farmers always struggle to access inputs which are sold in foreign currency hence their demand to be paid in united states dollars was justified this will cushion them against market distortions characterised by high inflation and fluctuating exchange rate zimcodd added despite this farmers retention of foreign currency for their sales will help them prepare for the upcoming 2019 2020 farming season as they will be in a position to purchase inputs such as tractors and other implements ignoring the demands by tobacco farmers will not only undermine the capacity of tobacco farmers but further widen the trust deficit between government and citizens zimcodd said government should consistently implement policies that safeguard people s livelihoods the obtaining situation in the 2019 tobacco marketing season is undermining the agricultural sector which is the backbone of the economy the report said policy consistency and clarity is key if zimbabwe s economy is to be resuscitated

while gas prices fluctuate one charge at the pump has stayed the same since 1990 illinoisans have paid the same gas tax the charge per gallon the state collects but that could soon change lawmakers are considering at least one proposal that would double the tax from the current 19 cents and then increase it automatically by small amounts every year it s sometimes referred to as a variable rate and proponents of the change say it will create a more sustainable funding source for fixing the state s interstates roads railways and bridges but opponents argue the legislature should negotiate and vote on each increase incrementally versus letting the increases happen automatically the debate comes as lawmakers are putting together a plan to deal with years of backlogged maintenance on not only its transportation infrastructure but also buildings and facilities at state universities schools and prisons gov j b pritzker has said he wants a plan done by may when the spring legislative session ends state sen martin sandoval the chicago democrat who heads of the senate transportation committee filed the proposal it s one of two measures in springfield that would up the gas tax and other license and registration fees to pay for repairs to the transportation infrastructure a more expansive deal that includes funding for state buildings and facilities could be negotiated by may under the variable rate proposal the per gallon charge would double to 38 cents and be tied to the consumer pricing index and income growth in the state so each year the rate would be evaluated and could be bumped up by up to a penny indiana instituted similar changes last year when it hiked the gas tax by 10 cents eight states in the last five years have adopted variable gas tax rates according to research from the washington d c based institute on taxation and economic policy itep if illinois had had a variable rate in place over the last ten years the per gallon charge would have increased by 8 cents without any action by the legislature that s according to carl davis research director at itep he said the varying rate addresses two challenges first as more people are buying cars with better fuel efficiency they re paying less at the pump and therefore less money is going toward road maintenance davis said the small bump in the gas tax could help offset that the indexed gas tax ensures budgets for road improvements rise over time as costs rise basically you can think of the gas tax as the price people are being charged to use roads and bridges and infrastructure davis said and if roads and bridges become more expensive over time because asphalt costs more diesel fuel to run machinery costs more then charging people that same flat gas tax is going to become a problem stagnant fuel taxes crumbling roads that has been a problem for craig fink engineer for tazewell county and former head of the illinois association of county engineers he oversees the county highway system there and said the revenue tazewell gets from the motor fuel tax to maintain the highways hasn t changed since 2000 meanwhile our costs have more than tripled he said that means he can t fill potholes or resurface the same miles of road he would have 20 years ago so the system is deteriorating he said indexing the gas tax rate could avoid the huge increase lawmakers are looking at right now by not having it indexed we ve created a huge shortfall he said but andrew nelms illinois state director for the group americans for prosperity said tying the gas tax to inflation results in an automatic tax hike every year that legislators don t have to take a tough vote on and own up to come election day we see tax increases crop up with some regularity here in illinois he said if more dollars are needed then it seems that folks would be able to make a credible case of that and pass that tax hike rather than people incurring an automatic annual tax hike he also pointed out that proposals to raise the state s gas tax come as federal lawmakers are again considering raising the federal gas tax by 25 cents other ideas meanwhile the illinois chamber of commerce offered its own proposal for a statewide infrastructure plan and how to pay for it last month the proposal included a gradual gas tax increase of 25 cents while phasing out the sales tax on gas the state collects the 6 25 sales tax on motor fuel by itep s standards illinois has a variable gas tax rate because of this sales tax but the money goes to the state s general fund and not to pay for infrastructure repairs todd maisch president of the illinois chamber of commerce said getting rid of the sales tax on gas would ease the burden of the per gallon hike on taxpayers he said their proposal did not include the variable rate but that they wouldn t rule it out still he sees two challenges with it first he said having consumers pay more at the pump then support increases in perpetuity is a big ask and second with more electric and fuel efficient vehicles the gas tax alone won t be a sustainable revenue source in the long run the reality is that the gas tax revenues are going to continue to decline even if you index he said we ve got to have a more diverse mix of funding sources for transportation lawmakers left springfield friday for a two week recess before the end of session push in may when they ll continue negotiations on how to pay for a capital plan

china denounces protectionism in swipe at us trade policy photo credit thinkstock washington dc protectionism has harmed mutual trust among countries and limited the scope for multilateral cooperation a vice governor of china s central bank said on saturday taking a swipe at the trump administration s america first trade policies chen yulu a vice governor at the people s bank of china pboc urged the international monetary fund to continue supporting a rules based multilateral trade system as tariffs play only a limited role in fixing bilateral trade imbalances the protectionism of some countries has harmed mutual trust among countries limited the scope for multilateral cooperation and impeded the willingness to achieve it chen said in a statement to the imf s steering committee during the imf and world bank spring meetings in washington unilateralism and protectionism can only exacerbate domestic imbalances and impair necessary structural adjustments which can negatively affect the countries concerned as well as global growth he said chen also said china will continue to implement prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policy to ensure its economic growth remains stable the comments came as beijing and washington seek a deal to end a bitter trade war marked by tit for tat tariffs that have cost the world s two largest economies billions of dollars disrupted supply chains and rattled financial markets rising hopes of an agreement recently have lifted global stock prices though the imf has warned that failure to reach an agreement could trigger a big market backlash uncertainties from trade frictions the negative impact of tariff increases on trade and the disruptions of global supply chains have gradually emerged chen said trade friction can also dampen market confidence which in turn amplifies financial market volatility and has an impact on economic growth he said
authored by kit knightly via off guardian org the us has been planning to have julian assange handed over for a longtime that much is obvious mike pence the vice president was visiting ecuador last year notionally to discuss the venezuela situation and trade but it was fairly obvious at the time and even more so now that they were discussing the details of assange being handed over to uk authorities and eventually extradited to the us trade indeed in terms of quid pro quo the situation is clear cut in february ecuador got a 4 2 billion loan approved by the international monetary fund amongst other pay outs reuters reported on february 19th of this year ecuador has reached a 4 2 billion staff level financing deal with the international monetary fund imf president lenin moreno said on wednesday as the andean country grapples with a large fiscal deficit and heavy external debt the country will also receive 6 billion in loans from multilateral institutions including the world bank the inter american development bank and the caf andean development bank so less than 2 months ago it was announced ecuador was going to receive over 10 billion dollars of loans where all that money will eventually end up is anyone s guess it certainly isn tbeing spent on infrastructure or state enterprise moreno has begun to implement an austerity plan that includes layoffs of workers at state owned companies and cuts to gasoline subsidies also plans to find a private operator for state run telecoms company cnt and other state owned firms president moreno has already been the subject of numerous corruption accusations so these loans nominally for work opportunities for those who have not yet found something stable could more realistically be described as a pay off more than just money lenin moreno has been gifted something all insecure third world leaders crave western approval the economist ran a story on april 12th the day after assange was arrested praising lenin moreno s economic policies and blaming the previous administration for the mess that moreno has to clear ups of course the idea that moreno is handling the economy brilliantly but somehow also needs over 10 billion dollars in loans is never addressed a tiny logical contradiction compared with the nonsense the msm dish up on a daily basis the basic structure of the give and take of this situation is fairly obvious less on the nose but still definitely present is the slow burn media based campaign of defamation and smears directed at assange a campaign designed to weaken public support for him and lessen the potential outcry if when the uk handed him to us authorities who famously use enhanced interrogation on suspects last october just three months after pence s ecuador visit an ecuadorian government memo was leaked claiming that assange had bad personal hygiene habits was hacking people s electrical devices and neglecting his cat these charges cynically designed to make assange a figure of ridicule got massive play in the media the guardian ever at the vanguard of sticking the boot in on assange ran a gleeful opinion piece mocking him as did many other publications assange who had his internet access shut off in march of last year was unable to defend himself to this day we have no way of knowing if there is any veracity to this leaked memo but real or not it served both to belittle assange in the public mind and provide ecuador with an excuse to get rid of him they set up rules claim assange wasn t following them and that s why they kicked him out not the 10 billion dollars they got from international financial institutions the media are of course complicit in this lie various outlets from the guardian to cnn to the australian have written explainer articles with headlines such as rude ungrateful and meddling why ecuador turned on assange because you know rude and ungrateful people don t deserve to have their human rights respected there s probably a clause in the un charter to that effect every step of this ignoble process so far has been based on lies let s list them lie 1 assange hs been and is attacked as a russian agent and putin s stooge a breaking news story for the guardian written by an erstwhile plagiarist and a convicted forger claimed assange had worked with paul manafort to swing the us election for trump no evidence for these claims has been supplied it remains to date nothing more than a baseless allegation and wikileaks is in the process of suing the guardian over it this lie paints assange as an enemy combatant and will be used to justify whatever happens to him lie 2 let s all recall that for months we were told the us didn t want assange that the only barrier to him leaving the embassy was pride wikileaks claims that us had sealed indictments waiting for assange were dismissed as conspiracy theories not true not any of it the secret indictments were leaked proving wikileaks correct ecuador is shocking claiming that they weren t aware there any extradition orders for mr assange before they released him to the uk police this risible assertion has gone totally unchallenged in the mainstream media lie 3 just one week ago the ecuadorian government claimed they had no plans to kick assange out and that wikileaks lied when they claimed as much they released assange to uk police just six days later equally obnoxious and dishonest is the corporate concern trolling that allows faux liberals to take up the craven position of qualified support such as you can think assange is a liar fascist and misogynist but still think he shouldn t be extradited this is the stance adopted by folks like owen jones in the guardian a position which claims to support one course of action but is actually covertly arguing for the opposite damning assange with the pretence of faint praise and identity politics is also playing its part here displaying its usefulness in clogging up public debate with shallow finger pointing and crucible esque accusations of moral impurity jones labels anyone who doesn t believe the accusations against assange a misogynist suzanne moore the epitome of the liberal hypocrite wrote a column for the new statesmentalking quite a lot about totally unproven accusations of molestation but breezing over the very much proven crimes against humanity meanwhile seventy uk mps including people s champion jess philips and john woodcock who quit labour over accusations of sexually inappropriate behaviour signed a letter to sajid javiddemanding assange be handed over to sweden to face justice a position marred only by the fact that sweden haven t actually asked for him yet this was aimed at corbyn and diane abbott whose support for assange will be turned against them and used to label labour as being soft on sexual predators or not supporting women etc but this is all distraction and obfuscation keeping the totally discredited accusations in the headlines whilst avoiding the actual truth which is julian assange was arrested for publishing evidence of us war crimes after the us government bribed the ecuadorian government to break international law that is what happened and anyone who uses lies

washington japanese finance minister taro aso on saturday pledged to global finance leaders that tokyo will forge ahead with a scheduled sales tax hike in october even as weakening global growth darkened the outlook for the export reliant economy there is simmering speculation that prime minister shinzo abe may put off the twice postponed increase in the sales tax as he faces an upper house election later this year amid increasing signs of weakness in the economy the premier has repeatedly said the hike will proceed this time unless japan is hit by a shock to the scale of the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 mr aso made no such qualification in pledging to hike the rate we will increase the consumption tax rate from 8 per cent to 10 per cent this october mr aso said in a statement delivered to the international monetary fund s steering committee through this tax rate hike we will not only achieve fiscal consolidation over the medium to long term but also realise inclusive growth by using some of the proceeds to provide free early childhood education while the slowdown in global growth is weighing on japan s economy its fundamentals remain robust as a tight job market and strong corporate earnings underpin private consumption and capital expenditure mr aso said the japanese economy as a whole continues to recover moderately primarily led by domestic demand he said raising the sales tax rate is considered important for japan to rein in its huge public debt which is twice the size of its economy and pay for the rising cost of financing welfare for a rapidly ageing population the imf has proposed that japan should increase fiscal spending instead of putting off the tax hike if risks to the economy materialise a recent reuters poll showed that most economists expect japan to go ahead with the higher levy reuters
although every april 15 is an important day for the american taxpayer this one holds special attention that s because the 2018 tax year was the first under a new tax law congress and the administration passed and the real effect of that law for small business has become clear the picture is not pretty the law had no effect on the profitability or success of small business coupled with complex returns that cost more money to prepare the results are official now but the reality of the tax law for small business owners arrived long before tax day tax reform focused on giving a huge permanent tax rate cut to large corporations corporate tax rates were slashed by 40 percent from 35 percent to 21 percent with the stated purpose of benefiting the whole economy without increasing the national debt the tax cuts would pay for themselves with higher government revenue from a growing economy we were told by comparison most small businesses but not all were given a temporary smaller tax deduction that was said to enable them to hire more workers pay higher wages and grow their businesses proponents of the tax law said the average family would have an additional 4 000 in income the trump administration forecast 3 percent annual growth for the nation well into the future unfortunately after nearly 16 months the hype of the economic promises has been exposed as the fraud many suspected unemployment and local economies are essentially unchanged from before the law family incomes are stagnant the u s economy started out strong in the beginning of 2018 but slowed to only a 2 2 percent annual growth rate and there are reports that it will be even worse this year the tax law of failed to deliver on promised economic growth despite dramatically increasing the budget deficit by 77 percent in the first four months of this fiscal year due to a steep drop in corporate tax revenue we are well on our way to increasing the national debt by 2 trillion over the next nine years a poll in early 2018 by businesses for responsible tax reform showed that 69 percent of small business owners didn t think they would be able to hire as a result of the new law and 59 percent said they would not give raises a just released national poll by businesses for responsible tax reform confirms the expectations of small business owners from one year ago among those polled 48 percent said the new law had no effect on the growth or profitability of their business 74 percent said they were not able to hire new employees and 66 percent said they were not able to give raises because of the law as for corporations they gave their tax cuts primarily to their wealthy investors in the form of stock buybacks the reality is that there was never a profit crisis holding corporations back from growing our economy that warranted this enormous tax cut however there was and is a serious business crisis in this country it is the lack of growth in small business startups that traditionally account for most net new jobs the senate has now recognized our nation s small business crisis by forming an entrepreneurship caucus with bipartisan leadership to develop solutions clearly this is an economic problem that the tax code can be used to address the recent poll found two thirds of small business owners support partly rolling back the tax cut corporations received to fund policies that help small businesses it also found tax policies small business owners support included making the first 25 000 in profit for a small business tax free simplifying the tax code and giving small businesses some relief on payroll taxes a new tax reform bill is needed that supports and rewards the main street entrepreneurs who create jobs and invest in our communities the voice of small business was not heard in 2017 for the good of our country it must be heard now frank knapp jr is the co chair of businesses for responsible tax reform and president ceo of the south carolina small business chamber of commerce he wrote this for insidesources com internal revenue service irs 1040 individual income tax forms in new york on feb 17 2016 michael nagle bloomberg tns opinion content represents the viewpoint of the author or the gazette editorial board you can join the conversation by submitting a letter to the editor or guest column or by suggesting a topic for an editorial to editorial thegazette com

president donald trump s selections for the federal reserve board conservative pundit stephen moore and former pizza chain executive herman cain have created a media firestorm cain a republican who ran for president in 2012 may be set to withdraw from consideration in the face of opposition from senate republicans according to an abc news report friday though moore was still in the running trump s plans to nominate the two political allies followed his repeated criticism of the fed for raising interest rates last year and his reported musings about whether he could fire fed chairman jerome powell usa today reporters paul davidson michael collins break down why the potential nominations of moore and cain have caused such an uproar trump has made many unorthodox picks for cabinet and other posts why have these two generated such controversy simply put the fed is a different species than say the department of education or environmental protection agency it s an independent agency that has a long tradition of remaining insulated from politics so it can do what s best for the economy the fed lowers interest rates to stimulate a sluggish economy and raises rates to head off excessive inflation a hike in rates makes mortgages and other loans more expensive for consumers and businesses crimping economic growth but the goal is to prevent runaway inflation down the road that could plunge the economy into recession protect your assets best high yield savings accounts of 2023 it may have to make unpopular choices such as raising interest rates says tim duy economics professor at the university of oregon and author of the fedwatch blog and that may not be in the best interest of the political party in power says peter conti brown a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the wharton school in philadelphia and author of the power and independence of the federal reserve why are critics of moore and cain saying they are ill suited for nonpartisan roles both moore and cain opposed the fed s easy money low rate policies under president barack obama even though most economists said such an approach was necessary to pull the nation out of the worst downturn since the great depression yet both recently supported trump s calls to cut rates or at least not raise them despite a much improved economy and moderately higher inflation their goal is to take the anti democrat position in all states of the economy duy says conti brown was especially troubled that cain suggested during his 2012 presidential bid that strong job growth numbers that year were cooked by the labor department to help obama s reelection chances he has been willing to traffic in conspiracy theories conti brown says adding that casting doubt on the integrity of the government s economic data is a dangerous tactic that can undercut consumer and business confidence has the fed always been isolated from politics presidents have routinely picked members of their own party for fed board seats that has sometimes led to democratic fed officials who are more inclined to spur growth and republicans more concerned about inflation though those distinctions have blurred in recent years conti brown says for the most part both republican and democratic fed policymakers are technocrats working to achieve the best balance for the economy duy says since the clinton administration u s presidents have generally steered clear of trying to influence fed decisions trump has broken with that tradition but prior to the clinton years presidents regularly talked about fed policy says nomura economist lewis alexander a former fed official president lyndon johnson was furious when the fed ignored his wishes and raised the discount rate in 1965 he brought fed chairman william mcchesney martin to his texas ranch took him for a ride in a jeep and then berated him for the rate hike and president richard nixon worried that a recession would hurt his reelection chances in 1972 pressured fed chief arthur burns to lower interest rates the fed s key rate fell sharply from 1970 to 1972 juicing the economy but eventually sparking high inflation it s unclear if burns acted to heed nixon s plea or to bolster the economy more bed bath beyond plans to close at least 40 stores this year but open 15 new locations more forget the dream wedding gen z ers are planning to own homes before they re 30 survey finds aside from their political leanings are moore and cain qualified to serve on the fed s board both duy and conti brown say no while many fed board members have ph d s in economics and deep professional or academic backgrounds others such as current fed chairman powell do not yet those fed officials typically have had other significant related experience such as in banking conti brown says moore who has a master of arts in economics has been a fellow at conservative think tanks such as the heritage foundation and cato institute and co founded the club for growth which advocates tax cuts he advised cain in his 2012 presidential campaign and trump in his 2016 run and regularly appears on tv in support of trump s policies cain rose through the ranks at companies such as burger king and pillsbury before becoming ceo at godfathers pizza he served as a director of the federal reserve bank of kansas city from 1992 to 1996 in the roles of deputy chairman and then chairman of the board but duy doesn t believe that qualifies him to serve on the fed s board the boards of regional fed banks are often made up of business executives not monetary policy experts both moore and cain have called for the united states to return to the gold standard which would restrict the fed s ability to adjust interest rates conti brown added he s very uncomfortable about the sexual harassment allegations against cain that forced to drop out of the 2012 race cain has denied the claims have trump s other fed nominees raised these sorts of concerns no the three current board members trump has appointed all have deep credentials and experience in economics including high level positions in the treasury department or banking trump himself elevated powell a former treasury official lawyer and investment banker from fed board member to chairman but has since soured on him because of the rate hikes why is trump taking a different approach with these two nominees duy says trump was frustrated by the fed s four rate hikes last year and so now picks people he thinks will be more pliable michael bardo director of the center for monetary and financial history at rutgers university says trump is worried a recession in 2019 or 2020 could doom his reelection chances and wants to appoint fed officials who will push growth enhancing policies he s thinking like nixon bordo says nixon was really paranoid about a recession could moore and cain steer fed policy in the direction trump wishes if confirmed by the senate almost certainly not they would be two voices on a policymaking committee of 19 that includes seven fed board members and 12 regional fed bank presidents says barclays economist and former fed staffer michael gapen duy however said moore and cain could affect the fed s internal debate about monetary policy and muddy its efforts to communicate more clearly to the public and conti brown says their elevation to the board could set a precedent that makes future presidents more willing to move away from the tradition of picking technocrats to sit on the fed board
sins the us has been planning to have julian assange handed over for a longtime that much is obvious mike pence the vice president was visiting ecuador last year notionally to discuss the venezuela situation and trade but it was fairly obvious at the time and even more so now that they were discussing the details of assange being handed over to uk authorities and eventually extradited to the us trade indeed in terms of quid pro quo the situation is clear cut in february ecuador got a 4 2 billion loan approved by the international monetary fund amongst other pay outs reuters reported on february 19th of this year ecuador has reached a 4 2 billion staff level financing deal with the international monetary fund imf president lenin moreno said on wednesday as the andean country grapples with a large fiscal deficit and heavy external debt the country will also receive 6 billion in loans from multilateral institutions including the world bank the inter american development bank and the caf andean development bank so less than 2 months ago it was announced ecuador was going to receive over 10 billion dollars of loans where all that money will eventually end up is anyone s guess it certainly isn t being spent on infrastructure or state enterprise moreno has begun to implement an austerity plan that includes layoffs of workers at state owned companies and cuts to gasoline subsidies also plans to find a private operator for state run telecoms company cnt and other state owned firms president moreno has already been the subject of numerous corruption accusations so these loans nominally for work opportunities for those who have not yet found something stable could more realistically be described as a pay off more than just money lenin moreno has been gifted something all insecure third world leaders crave western approval the economist ran a story on april 12th the day after assange was arrested praising lenin moreno s economic policies and blaming the previous administration for the mess that moreno has to clear ups of course the idea that moreno is handling the economy brilliantly but somehow also needs over 10 billion dollars in loans is never addressed a tiny logical contradiction compared with the nonsense the msm dish up on a daily basis the basic structure of the give and take of this situation is fairly obvious less on the nose but still definitely present is the slow burn media based campaign of defamation and smears directed at assange a campaign designed to weaken public support for him and lessen the potential outcry if when the uk handed him to us authorities who famously use enhanced interrogation on suspects last october just three months after pence s ecuador visit an ecuadorian government memo was leaked claiming that assange had bad personal hygiene habits was hacking people s electrical devices and neglecting his cat these charges cynically designed to make assange a figure of ridicule got massive play in the media the guardian ever at the vanguard of sticking the boot in on assange ran a gleeful opinion piece mocking him as did many other publications assange who had his internet access shut off in march of last year was unable to defend himself to this day we have no way of knowing if there is any veracity to this leaked memo but real or not it served both to belittle assange in the public mind and provide ecuador with an excuse to get rid of him they set up rules claim assange wasn t following them and that s why they kicked him out not the 10 billion dollars they got from international financial institutions the media are of course complicit in this lie gus bold various outlets from the guardian to cnn to the australian have written explainer articles with headlines such as rude ungrateful and meddling why ecuador turned on assange because you know rude and ungrateful people don t deserve to have their human rights respected there s probably a clause in the un charter to that effect every step of this ignoble process so far has been based on lies let s list them lie 1 assange has been and is attacked as a russian agent and putin s stooge a breaking news story for the guardian written by an erstwhile plagiarist and a convicted forger claimed assange had worked with paul manafort to swing the us election for trump no evidence for these claims has been supplied it remains to date nothing more than a baseless allegation and wikileaks is in the process of suing the guardian over it this lie paints assange as an enemy combatant and will be used to justify whatever happens to him lie 2 let s all recall that for months we were told the us didn t want assange that the only barrier to him leaving the embassy was pride wikileaks claims that us had sealed indictments waiting for assange were dismissed as conspiracy theories not true not any of it the secret indictments were leaked proving wikileaks correct ecuador is shocking claiming that they weren t aware there any extradition orders for mr assange before they released him to the uk police this risible assertion has gone totally unchallenged in the mainstream media lie 3 just one week ago the ecuadorian government claimed they had no plans to kick assange out and that wikileaks lied when they claimed as much they released assange to uk police just six days later equally obnoxious and dishonest is the corporate concern trolling that allows faux liberals to take up the craven position of qualified support such as you can think assange is a liar fascist and misogynist but still think he shouldn t be extradited this is the stance adopted by folks like owen jones in the guardian a position which claims to support one course of action but is actually covertly arguing for the opposite damning assange with the pretence of faint praise and identity politics is also playing its part here displaying its usefulness in clogging up public debate with shallow finger pointing and crucible esque accusations of moral impurity jones labels anyone who doesn t believe the accusations against assange a misogynist suzanne moore the epitome of the liberal hypocrite wrote a column for the new statesmen talking quite a lot about totally unproven accusations of molestation but breezing over the very much proven crimes against humanity meanwhile seventy uk mps including people s champion jess philips and john woodcock who quit labour over accusations of sexually inappropriate behaviour signed a letter to sajid javid demanding assange be handed over to sweden to face justice a position marred only by the fact that sweden haven t actually asked for him yet this was aimed at corbyn and diane abbott whose support for assange will be turned against them and used to label labour as being soft on sexual predators or not supporting women etc but this is all distraction and obfuscation keeping the totally discredited accusations in the headlines whilst avoiding the actual truth which is julian assange was arrested for publishing evidence of us war crimes after the us government bribed the ecuadorian government to break international law that is what happened and anyone who uses lies and distraction to deny this truth is on the wrong side of history kit knightly read more

fighting inequality would be the best tribute to him dr b r ambedkar s birthday as we celebrate dr babasaheb ambedkar s birth anniversary we need to imbibe his important motto educate organise agitate as karl marx said philosophers have interpreted the world in different ways the point is to change it this is the most important heritage of dr ambedkar changing the world one of the great advantages of dr ambedkar s teachings was the tremendous awakening he created among dalits especially in maharashtra it led to a creation of very vibrant dalit writing i notice that dalits are very well read much better read than people from many communities they have a real hunger for knowledge they read analyse this is all because of the heritage of dr ambedkar he had a vision for a better world we too need to fight to achieve that kind of a society the capitalists have created their own vision for their advancement they are powerful they have planners and money to buy people land we have to create expertise to challenge this anti people vision of capitalists for example we can create an alternative transport system it can be done at very little expense we don t need those fancy expensive schemes at all mahatma gandhi was essentially an activist agitationist like dr ambedkar gandhi has been confined by the establishment to the safe custody of gandhi bhavans dr ambedkar s legacy is more active what the ambedkarite movement needs to do now take up other issues along with issues of caste discrimination like dadasaheb gaikwad took up the issue of land allotment for dalits when i was in times of india it was full of very talented people in the times group including kumar ketkar in economic times he is now a rajya sabha member arun sadhu in toi and ashok jain and dinkar gangal in maharashtra times sadhu later wrote the script for the film on dr ambedkar directed by jabbar patel all of them and other activists started the granthali non profit publishing organisation which produced the first major dalit autobiography of daya pawar called balute which became a big hit those were the days of a strong marxist and dalit ambedkarite movement including dalit panther of namdeo dhasal which was inspired by the black panther movement of blacks of the u s granthali also published an autobiography by laxman mane called upra he was from the nomadic tribes he strongly criticised marathi culture as the culture of 3 5 percent upper class people the granthali activists were mostly non dalits but there was a good bond in those days between dalit activists and progressive marxist activists and still there is fairly good coordination in these sections the agitational path of dr ambedkar is very important today when inequalities are rising common people are under attack and there is strong need for resistance many of dalit leaders are too involved in parliamentary politics which is o k but it is also important to build politics by fighting for people s basic problems through mass struggles look at the current transport crisis in mumbai pedestrian and railway bridges are falling or are likely to fall several are being closed for repairs this causes extreme hardship to people new york declared emergency in public transport two years ago the authorities neglected public transport so badly had our authorities any self respect they would have suspended work on such fancy schemes like the bullet train coastal road and helipad at bandra kurla complex considering the crisis in public transport the pedestrian bus user train commuter needs more respect more priority than a motorist because the ordinary commuter uses no fuel no pollution causes no congestion and saves so much of foreign exchange which we spend in thousands of crores because of our import bill for cars we need serious reforms in the transport sector to give priority to the commuter this will confer so many benefits confer dignity to the common commuter who is constantly humiliated in today s system it will reduce congestion pollution and help fight climate change and save tonnes of money india is committed to reducing pollution under an international obligation providing an affordable quick public transport will be a win win situation the anti people policies are visible everywhere i was walking by the bungalow of the chief justice of mumbai high court at narayan dabholkar road on malabar hill recently on the other side of the road is the bungalow of the state transport minister diwakar raote and further beyond is the bungalow of the legislative council chairperson ramraje nimbalkar so here we have senior figures of the three pillars of the indian state the judiciary the executive and the legislature and yet though the transport minister himself lives here there is no footpath on this road which gives one an idea of the extreme contempt with which the whole system treats ordinary people this is an example of violation of fundamental rights and everything dr ambedkar stood for if a pedestrian is killed on the road it won t be suprising if our heartless system treats the victim as the offender never mind the absence of a footpath rutger bregman dutch historian made a sharp speech at the davos economic conference an elite preserve in switzerland earlier this year he said the rich must pay taxes and more taxes should be collected from them those funds will be vital for spending on real needs of people creating assets for them but the issue is being avoided it is like not talking about water when you are fighting a fire similarly funds from motorists imposing such heavy social environmental costs on society should be used for public transport also there is a serious need to change the mindset of people look at the recent csmt pedestrian bridge collapse in mumbai near the former victoria terminus station we think bridge was needed for smooth traffic we forget that such bridges are meant for the convenience of cars causing inconvenience to pedestrians they are an insult to pedestrians we pay the price for the system s slavishness to the motor car pedestrians are far more in number they should get priority on the street if necessary the car should go up on flyover or down through an underpass like the civil rights movement which grew out of the resistance put up by rosa parks public transport is the source of another major civil rights movement with mahatma gandhi s resistance to being thrown out of a first class compartment by a white man in south africa in 1893 a train station in paris is named after rosa parks rosa parks february 4 1913 october 24 2005 was an american activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the montgomery bus boycott the united states congress has called her the first lady of civil rights and the mother of the freedom movement on december 1 1955 in montgomery alabama parks rejected bus driver james f blake s order to relinquish her seat in the colored section to a white passenger after the whites only section was filled in public transport people come together they socialize they can forge solidarity the potential is there that is one reason the ruling class is afraid of public transport clearly there is a need for strong organisations of commuters which are totally lacking in los angeles the bus riders unions mainly of coloured discriminated communities scored an important victory in 1994 it asserted that a dense network of bus routes is a higher priority for most working people than high profile rail lines in the city and some of the funds for metro lines be diverted for bus travel the same argument can be made in mumbai with relation to the metro system some of its funds should be diverted to the best service dalits in india could be considered to have similar problems as blacks and they could be in the forefront of agitations for basic amenities as they suffer most when bus services are reduced and inadequate they need the heightened political consciousness about public transport as the blacks in the u s showed last year during the bhima koregaon agitation best and st buses were burnt we need these public transport services most so they should not be the target of attack if dalits and other sections become more aware more active it would be possible to make the authorities to change their priorities in favour of people away from motor cars there is an inter connection between the lives of african americans in the us and the dalits in india prominent us thinker and political activist angela davis said in mumbai some time ago she gave the 8th anuradha ghandy memorial lecture on black lives dalit lives histories and solidarities i would like to link the collective predicament of black people in the us and the dalits in india she said we in the us can learn from the long struggles of dalit people in india davis said she recalled that mahatma jyotirao phule the pioneering social reformer from 19th century maharashtra dedicated his book gulamgiri to the anti slavery activists in the us she also referred to dr b r ambedkar s statement that he had been a student of the negro problem many black people in the us encountered the black struggle through dr martin luther king king wrote about his trip to the land of gandhi she added the dalit panthers was formed in india in 1972 six years after black panthers the quality of public bus transport has not improved in the past five years gone down sharply in september union transport secretary y s malik acknowledged that india needs at least 30 lakh public transport buses but has barely 2 8 lakh buses run by state agencies not much has been done to discourage the use of private transport in mumbai for example metro lines are being laid for public transport but the maharashtra government s push for the rs 12 700 crore coastal road will further encourage the car lobby janette sadik khan served as new york city s transportation commissioner from 2007 to 2013 under mayor michael bloomberg in these six years she was responsible for removing cars from times square building 400 miles of bike lanes and introducing the bus rapid transit brt system in her city cities around the world are changing their mobility playbooks says sadik khan who is now principal at bloomberg associates adding there is no reason why delhi can t do the same the world health organisation points out that transport provides access to jobs education services and recreational activities critical social determinants of health many vulnerable groups such as women children and youth disabled persons low income groups and the elderly have less access to a personal vehicle to a car they rely on walking cycling and public transport therefore improving public and non motorized transport can improve health equity in two ways directly reducing air pollution noise and injury risks in poor neighbourhoods and secondly by increasing mobility and accessibility for the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of society k r narayanan in his republic day address on golden jubilee of independence said that our three way fast lane of liberalization privatization and globalization must provide safe pedestrian crossings for the unempowered india also so that it too can move towards equality of status and opportunity beware of the fury of the patient man says the old adage one could say beware of the fury of the patient and long suffering people aspiration for car what about aspiration for ordinary people to get bus train walking space no footpath on malabar hill near chief justice house trans mini and legislative council chairman the jalianwala bagh massacre centenary took place on april 13 but massacre on roads on a much bigger magnitude goes on and there is no revolt the car culture is most responsible for this massacre of the innocents india tops the list of numbers of people killed in road crashes in the world this is shameful our vehicle culture is that bad los angeles is to create permanent memorials for bicyclists killed in crashes we need to show similar sensitivity we need to be as sensitive to deaths of innocents as about soldiers killed in insurgency or war instead of taxing the rich the maharashtra government is in a way plundering public resources to finance schemes that will help boost the car lobby making mhada housing authority to pay some rs 800 crore for the dharavi redevelopment scheme is a case in point plus mhada itself is giving away grounds reserved as recreational spaces to big builders mode shift to public transport walking and cycling can yield cost effective co2 emission reduction the most cost effective urban mobility improvements are typically improvements in bus operations replacing inefficiently run small buses in mixed traffic with high capacity buses operated on rights of way that give priority to these vehicles bus stations and improving conditions for walking and cycling in public transport corridors these lead to more efficient utilization of scarce street space in terms of person movements per meter of roadway such approaches especially benefit low and moderate income households and reduce co2 while delivering more person movement capacity for a given amount of investment capital when compared with higher carbon transport investments oecd study revealed as mahatma gandhi said be the change you want to see in the world the transport sector now contributes 13 of global green house gas emissions and 23 of energy related carbon dioxide co2 emissions three fourths of transportation related emissions are from road traffic emissions from transportation are rising faster than from other energy using sectors the absurdity of the expensive metro rail system is being noticed in pakistan as well imran khan the prime minister referred to the huge debt incurred by the nation because of such fancy schemes earlier the daily dawn had observed that the government has been misleading everyone consistently on all components of the orange line train project cost number of affectees their economic and social plight and compensation an official said once the orange train gets operational it would cost a subsidy of around rs 1 000 for each passenger which no government could afford for a long time calling nawaz sharif king he said the king has left us in heavy debts as for the car culture the most significant change to our environment has not been the physical territory that has been won by the automobile although these territories are vast instead the most significant change is the dominant position that the automobile has won over our psychological territory this process has occurred so gradually that few have noticed but the depth of change over the past 100 years is profound without the dominance of the automobile in our psychological territory it would be impossible to overlook the negative externalities imposed by automobiles on society and their dominance in our physical territory as the site streetblog has observed far from charging a levy on cars the authorities in maharashtra are encouraging cars with

trump attacks the fed as his nominees herman cain and stephen moore are in trouble amid president s struggle to reshape the central bank ahead of 2020 election president donald trump attacked the federal reserve again on sunday his latest parlay comes as his two nominees herman cain and stephen moore are in trouble with reports cain will withdraw his nomination trump has struggled to appoint members who back his policies in his battle to reshape the central bank ahead of the 2020 election trump has railed against the fed s interest rate hikes believing they will hurt economic growth which he intends to run on in his re election bid fed chair jerome powell last week reiterated the bank s independence president donald trump attacked the federal reserve on sunday as his two nominees to the central bank are in trouble amid his effort to reshape monetary policy ahead of the 2020 election if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up 5000 to 10 000 additional points and gdp would have been well over 4 instead of 3 with almost no inflation quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite he wrote on twitter on his way to his virginia golf course on sunday his attack comes as his two new nominees to the central bank are in trouble president donald trump attacked the federal reserve again on sunday herman cain the former godfather s pizza executive and ex presidential candidate is expected to withdraw from consideration after four republican senators said they could not support him moore is still in the running but is dealing with questions about why he was held in contempt of court in 2012 for not paying his ex wife more than 330 000 he owed her in alimony child support and a divorce settlement he also has a tax lien as he owes 75 000 in federal taxes interest and penalties both men have supported trump s calls to cut interest rates or at least not raise them the president has railed repeatedly against the fed and chairman jerome powell for raising interest rate a move trump has publicly worried will slow economic growth the strong economy is expected to be one of his talking points in his upcoming reelection bid powell reasserted his independence from the president when he spoke to house democrats at their retreat last week herman cain the former godfather s pizza executive and ex presidential candidate is expected to withdraw from consideration for a federal reserve board position stephen moore is still in the running but is dealing with questions about his divorce and child support payments we re strictly nonpartisan powell said according to the washington post we check our political identification at the door but trump has questioned the bank s moves such as he did again on sunday the st louis federal reserve bank last week defended the fed policy of quantitative tightening which is reducing the level of bonds on its balance sheet in the wake of trump s previous attacks it is true that removing unusual monetary accommodation will likely result in less real activity and lower prices than otherwise but the ongoing shrinkage of the fed s balance sheet was not responsible for bearish asset markets in 2018 nor is it likely to significantly retard activity going forward fed economist christopher j neely wrote amid this fight over monetary policy the president has struggled to bring aboard members of the board of governors who would back his stances abc news said early friday that cain would withdraw his name after four republican senators and a moderate democrat said they would not confirm the businessman who quit the 2012 presidential race over sexual harassment allegations cain does not currently have the support of enough lawmakers to be confirmed republican sens kevin cramer of north dakota lisa murkowski of alaska cory gardner of colorado and mitt romney of utah have said they will oppose the former godfather s pizza chairman democrat joe manchin of west virginia who sometimes crosses party lines to support trump s nominees said thursday that he would not vote confirm cain either unless cramer or one of his colleagues change their minds the nomination is doomed the gop holds 53 seats in the senate and can only afford to lose the support of three of the party s legislators on any given vote assuming the vice president plays tie breaker and still win passage of the measure fed chair jerome powell last week reiterated the bank s independence the white house referred dailymail com to the president s earlier statements on cain on friday as defeat appeared all but certain trump said wednesday morning herman s a great guy and i hope he does well i like herman cain and herman will make that determination he said he s just somebody i like a lot as to how he s doing in the process that i don t know white house national economic council director larry kudlow told the hill newspaper on thursday that the president still backs cain as the president said yesterday he continues to support him and we ll see how that turns out kudlow said he s in the process we ll let him go through it the president insists on that trump last week called cain a wonderful man and a terrific person after a reporter asked about the appointment in the oval office he s a friend of mine i have recommended him highly for the fed i ve told my folks that that s the man and he s doing some pre checking now and i would imagine he would be in great shape i find herman to be an outstanding person a truly outstanding individual i would think he would do very well there the president said cain has denied that he sexually harassed women and committed adultery nevertheless he dropped out of the 2012 presidential race as the damaging accusations threatened to tank his candidacy years later they were on the brink of costing him a position on fed board too trump insisted to reporters last week that cain is a highly respected man and someone who gets it after a reported asked about the businessman in the oval i hope everything goes well but herman cain is a very good guy the president said sen kevin cramer sen lisa murkowski sen cory gardner sen mitt romney cain said a week ago on friday in a video posted to his facebook page he s up against a cumbersome confirmation process but he wouldn t be scared off by attempts to derail it let them go back and dig up eight year old stuff cain said i will be able to explain this time where they wouldn t let me explain it last time they were too busy believing the accusers cain served as chairman of the federal reserve bank of kansas city from 1989 to 1991 he competed for the gop nomination for president against romney in the 2012 contest but dropped out after sexual misconduct allegations from his time at the national restaurant association were revealed by news outlets democrats have continued to mock the 9 9 9 tax plan he pushed as a candidate and say he is too partisan to sit on the board of the feb which operates independently from the rest of the executive branch

editor s note fox news channel will televise a town hall with vermont senator and presidential candidate bernie sanders from 6 30 to 7 30 p m edt on monday april 15 special report anchor bret baier and the story anchor martha maccallum will question sen sanders and take audience questions in the live broadcast from bethlehem pennsylvania in america today we have more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on earth and it is worse now than at any other time since the 1920s unbelievably while millions of american workers are forced to work two or three jobs to pay the bills and over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck the three wealthiest families in our country now own more wealth than the bottom half of americans 160 million people bernie sanders hits the campaign trail reaching out to working class voters today while hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college and millions are struggling with high levels of student debt the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent today while ceos of major corporations make over 300 times what their average workers earn thousands of veterans sleep out on the street and 20 percent of senior citizens are trying to survive on a paltry 13 500 income or less for 40 years under democratic and republican administrations we have seen a massive redistribution of wealth and income from the working class of this country to the top one percent in fact if the distribution of income remained what it was 40 years ago the average household in america would have about 11 000 more in income today do you want to know why the american people are angry today despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average worker has seen his her income go up by just 5 cents an hour over the last 43 years after adjusting for inflation and if we don t turn the economy around economists predict that the younger generation will have an even a lower standard of living than their parents this is not acceptable to me we need an economy that expands the middle class and reduces poverty and not one that makes the very rich much richer when donald trump ran for president he made a lot of promises to working families he told them that he would protect their interests while standing up to the establishment unfortunately he did not tell the truth during his campaign trump said he would provide health insurance for everybody but as president he has pushed to repeal the affordable care act and throw 32 million americans off of the health insurance they have his efforts would also end the protections that are currently in existence for pre existing conditions and end the ability of people under 26 to stay on their parents insurance plans meanwhile while 34 million americans currently have no health insurance and even more are under insured with high deductibles and co payments a handful of health care ceos paid themselves more than 1 billion last year in my view at a time when we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other nation we should not be throwing millions of americans off of health care they have quite the contrary we should join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right through a medicare for all single payer program medicare today is a popular and effective health insurance program for seniors over a 4 year period it should be expanded and improved to cover every man woman and child in the country and when we do that we significantly reduce the cost of health care for the average american family we are living in a pivotal moment in american history our goal must be to create good paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure not give huge tax breaks to people who don t need them during his campaign trump said that he would stop the pharmaceutical companies from getting away with murder well that didn t happen they re making more money than ever during the first half of last year there were 96 drug price increases for every price cut today in the united states we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs while the top ten pharmaceutical companies made 69 billion in profits last year alone shockingly one out of five americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe that is insane as president i will implement legislation i have introduced which would lower prescription drug prices by 50 percent so americans no longer pay any more for their medicine than the people of other countries during his campaign trump promised he would not cut medicare medicaid and social security but the budget he proposed in march would cut 1 5 trillion from medicaid 845 billion from medicare and 25 billion from social security as president at a time when so many seniors and people with disabilities are struggling i will not cut social security in fact legislation that i have introduced would expand social security benefits while extending its solvency for over 50 years during his campaign trump promised that the rich will not be gaining at all under his tax plan but the reality is that the plan that he helped pass provides 83 percent of the benefits to the top one percent by the end of the decade further as a result of his tax plan major profitable corporations like amazon general motors chevron ibm and eli lilly and dozens of other major corporations paid zero in federal income taxes after making billions in profits that is a regressive and unfair tax system that must not be allowed to continue at a time when the very rich are getting much richer and when corporations are enjoying record breaking profits i believe that the wealthiest people in this country have got to start paying their fair share of taxes and that we must end the tax havens that exist in places like the cayman islands where corporations and the rich stash trillions of dollars to avoid paying their taxes during his campaign trump promised that he would substantially reduce the trade deficit prevent the outsourcing of american jobs and protect good paying jobs here at home however since trump has been president the trade deficit in goods has hit a record high of 891 billion and his own labor department says that 185 000 american jobs have been shipped overseas under his watch he has also expanded the tax cut that rewards companies for replacing american workers with robots created new tax incentives for his corporate allies to shift jobs overseas and given out 50 billion in government contracts to companies that are offshoring jobs we are living in a pivotal moment in american history our goal must be to create good paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure not give huge tax breaks to people who don t need them our job must be to invest in public education and combat climate change not spend trillions on never ending wars click here to get the fox news app our job must be to bring all americans together black white latino native american asian american gay and straight native born and immigrant and not allow ourselves to be divided up together we can and must create an economy and government that works for all americans and not just the 1 percent

by julian ryall for the accj journal japanese companies continued their recent spree of mergers and acquisitions m as in 2018 with an impressive number of deals coming to fruition some of these involved eye catching agreements with us companies and analysts suggest that the prospects for this year appear similarly positive despite the clouds of geopolitical tension hinting that a global economic downturn may be on the horizon prime for expansion many japanese companies have enjoyed record profits in their operating businesses and have access to low cost capital from banks said frank packard chair of the american chamber of commerce in japan accj alternative investment committee and president of cross border financial services provider triple a partners japan co ltd abenomics and prime minister shinzo abe s desire to reinvi gorate the economy is encouraging companies to focus on returns and growth he added with the maturity of japan s economy and its aging population more companies are looking overseas also japanese companies have limited domestic m a opportunities that would gain antitrust approval from the japanese government companies in japan are also trying to find a way around the relatively lower rate of domestic economic growth smaller domestic markets and the need to increase revenue oppor tunities these are all things the united states can provide packard told the accj journal thanks to a higher rate of economic growth a dynamic venture capital industry a spirit of technology development and innovative businesses eric sedlak accj vice president and a partner at us based global law firm k l gates llp agreed that cash rich japanese companies are looking to either retain or expand their positions globally by moving into growing markets with better return on investment prospects and the united states is the ideal destination for invest ment he said as it gives them an opportunity to expand vertically horizontally and geographically china connection japanese companies are also taking advantage of the relative decline of chinese buyers said scott sugino vice chair of the accj foreign direct investment committee and partner at o melveny myers law firm in tokyo that decline is due to both chinese restrictions on getting currency out of china and increased regulatory scrutiny of chinese buyers in the united states which has opened the door for japan to win deals they were previously losing to chinese buyers he said there is also an element of anti chinese sentiment in the united states and other countries that are members of the organisation for economic co operation and development he said as evidenced by the ongoing problems involving telecommunications and consumer electronics giant huawei technologies co ltd in contrast japan is now viewed as a friendly country and a welcome alternative to chinese buyers he said safer bet for target companies japanese buyers may even be preferable to some us private equity buyers said packard us financial investors often have short term goals and seek to sell the company again in three to five years because they have pressure to return money to their investors by contrast a japanese company may have more to offer potentially a better strategic fit the opportunity to quickly achieve global scale deeper alignment of business interests and more corporate stability and job security he suggested sedlak agreed that japanese investors are more welcome nowadays and may even be somewhat underappreciated local communities are much less apprehensive about japanese buyers than they were in the 1980s he said they realize that if a japanese investor buys the company the jobs are secure at least in the near term japanese companies have also become much more adept at building ties to local communities and governments deal makers analysts point to a couple of particularly significant deals that went through in 2018 including fujifilm corporation s acquisition of california based irvine scientific sales co inc which specializes in cell culture media fujifilm said the addition would help advance its growth strategy in biopharmaceuticals and regenerative medicine softbank group corp has also been busy over the past 12 months or so investing in uber technologies inc in january 2018 and moving ahead with the merger of t mobile and sprint corporation with softbank chairman and chief executive officer masayoshi son expected to sit on the board of the new company for sugino however the purchase by recruit holdings co ltd of glassdoor inc lays down a marker the glassdoor acquisition was notable because it is unusual for japanese companies to acquire us market leaders in the consumer internet space he said glassdoor is the leading employer review site in the united states and a pioneer in its space recruit previously acquired indeed the employment related search engine for job listings and seems to have done a good job of integrating the company into its japanese business recruit he added is making some bold acquisitions and seems to be able to do a good job of integrating the companies and retaining top talent connecting cultures integrating operations and holding on to a company s best people are just some of the challenges that await the unwary looking to expand abroad cautions gerhard fasol ceo of eurotechnology japan kk japanese companies acquire us companies for their tech nology and market access in large part because the united states is still the largest international market and it s much easier to do business there than in china but it is important to remember that an acquisition is not finished when the deal is closed quite a few japanese companies then run into problems managing their overseas acquisition he said a textbook case is a japanese company that acquires a us company and places a member of the japanese board as the new us ceo but this person cannot speak english sufficiently or lacks knowledge of how to manage a global company based in the united states this happens more often than one would expect jiri mestecky an attorney with the osaka office of kitahama partners agrees that japanese companies are looking to us companies to provide not only technology but also talent and this requires the appropriate human resource management and communication skills historically it has been our experience that the most difficult aspect of japanese acquisitions of us and other foreign companies is the post merger integration pmi phase which if not handled properly can turn an otherwise very promising venture into a nightmare said mestecky who also serves on the executive committee of accj s kansai chapter the key to success is forward planning in which both sides clearly understand the structure capabilities and limitations of the other party and have a plan in place as to how to address known and potential obstacles well before the merger officially takes place japanese companies through their own experience as well as studying other mergers and acquisitions are now rapidly realizing the importance of this phase of the deal and are becoming much more proactive in addressing the relevant issues he added as the number of japanese acquisitions increases we are also finding that us and other foreign companies are learning how japanese companies operate and are adjusting their pmi plans accordingly mestecky pointed out fasol summed up this situation the main point has to be the long term success of each acquisition or investment unfortunately some m a transactions destroy value and not all planned mergers even make it that far shigetaka komori chairman of fujifilm holdings corporation admitted in late december that the 6 1 billion acquisition of xerox corporation originally announced in january and then cancelled by the us side in may had become difficult after an activist investor was granted an injunction by a new york court to block the merger stay the course nevertheless there is particular appetite among japanese companies for m as in the artificial intelligence space he said as well as other areas of cutting edge technologies the biological pharmaceutical life sciences and logistics sectors are particularly enticing among large japanese banking groups fintech and venture capital startups attractive targets are medical devices automotive tech specialized heavy equipment and factory automation property in contrast appears to have waned in its appeal already a quarter of the way into 2019 analysts say there is little sign that japanese demand for m as involving us companies is drying up to be fair uncertainty around the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement did give some japanese companies pause but as that negotiation concluded without creating major disruptions the worry abated said sedlak sudden policy shifts around tariffs steel and aluminum caused disruption and significant supply chain uncertainty and uncertainty causes potential buyers to hit the pause button but the size and volume of deals should nevertheless continue to increase japanese companies need to expand abroad to continue to grow he said acquisitions are a faster route to increasing revenue and profits than organic growth and greenfield projects sugino concurs while there is a lot of uncertainty in global trade the us japan relationship is stable he said the global trade turbulence does not change corporate japan s need to find growth and that is mostly going to be abroad custom media publishes the accj journal for the
