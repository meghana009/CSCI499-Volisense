system reactiv8 for people with disabling chronic low back pain clbp the company is headquartered in dublin ireland it has subsidiaries operating in ireland the united states australia germany and the netherlands and is listed on regulated market of the euronext paris msty pa and the euronext growth market of euronext dublin msty ie about chronic low back pain one of the root causes of clbp is impaired control by the nervous system of the muscles that dynamically stabilize the spine reactiv8 is designed to electrically stimulate the nerves responsible for contracting these muscles to improve dynamic spine stability allowing the body to recover from clbp people with clbp usually have a greatly reduced quality of life and score significantly higher on scales for pain disability depression anxiety and sleep disorders their pain and disability can persist despite the best available medical treatments and only a small percentage of cases result from an identified pathological condition or anatomical defect that may be correctable with spine surgery their ability to work or be productive is seriously affected by the condition and the resulting days lost from work disability

corporate trust 1 3 place valhubert 75013 paris france mainstay medical international plc chairman s statement dear shareholder i am pleased to present the 2019 annual report for mainstay medical and its subsidiaries based on the progress made by the company during 2019 we believe the company is well positioned for success in 2020 and beyond business review we announced headline results from the reactiv8 b clinical trial in november 2018 whilst the difference between the treatment and control groups on the primary endpoint of responder rate at 120 days was not statistically significant due to a higher than expected response rate in the control group we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 these overall results include additional pre specified analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint as well as high responder rates in the patients that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications by patients at one year we believe these results will continue to support commercial validation efforts in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark these results also formed the basis for our submission of a pre market approval pma application for reactiv8 with the u s food and drug administration fda in august 2019 a detailed review of the company s corporate activity in 2019 can be found in the directors report on page 7 of this annual report finance review cash on hand as at 31 december 2019 was 17 4 million 2018 15 5 million operating expenses were 19 2 million during the year ended 31 december 2019 2018 29 6 million outlook our corporate objectives for 2020 are to advance the pma review process with the fda with a decision regarding approval expected around the end of 2020 and to continue our commercial validation efforts in germany and other select markets by focussing on building a limited number of high volume reactiv8 practices that will allow us to gather associated clinical data refine the patient selection process and gain the learnings needed to accelerate commercial launch in future markets directors and staff i would like to thank our staff consultants clinical trial investigators and all my fellow directors for their support and dedication which has enabled the continued success of the company of course we also owe a debt of gratitude to all those people who agreed to be subjects in our clinical trials and helped to advance reactiv8 as an option for the millions of people suffering from chronic low back pain i

we describe our performance during the year ended 31 december 2019 on the relevant areas above including updates on progress towards milestones and analysis of expenditure and use of funds during the year business review clinical and regulatory activities us pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial the reactiv8 b trial is an international multi centre prospective randomized sham controlled triple blinded clinical trial with one way crossover conducted under an ide from the fda the reactiv8 b trial is intended to gather data in support of the company s pma application information about the clinical trial can be found at a total of 204 subjects were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control 14 days after implant in the treatment group the reactiv8 pulse generator was programmed to deliver electrical stimulation expected to elicit contractions of the multifidus muscle in the control group the reactiv8 device was programmed to provide a low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days subjects in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group the subjects in the study had an average age of 47 and an average duration of chronic low back pain of 14 years this patient population had tried many other treatment alternatives including physical therapy and drugs with limited success and 79 of the subjects were on pain medication at baseline the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain consisting a 0 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worse imaginable pain responders were defined as having a 30 or greater improvement on this measure between baseline and 120 days after baseline without any increase in pain medication and or muscle relaxants taken in the two weeks prior to the primary endpoint assessment visit the following table shows the result on the primary efficacy endpoint primary efficacy endpoint treatment n 102 control n 102 difference p value responder 30 reduction in low back pain vas and no increase in pain medications 57 1 46 7 10 4 p 0 1377 the investigational plan for the study included a pre specified sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of medication changes to treat acute unrelated pain conditions on the primary endpoint the company in consultation with statistical advisors determined that a valid way to handle the subjects with pain medication increases for reasons unrelated to low back pain would be to analyze the endpoint with these subjects removed as pain medication use for reasons unrelated to low back pain was an exclusion criterion in the study by doing so inference is limited to the population of subjects taking pain medication only for reasons related to low back pain as intended by the patient selection criteria in the trial protocol six subjects had increases in pain medications for reasons other than low back pain the following table presents the results of the primary efficacy endpoint in the subjects not requiring an increase in pain medications for reasons other than for low back pain showing a clinically meaningful and statistically significant difference primary efficacy endpoint treatment n 96 control n 102 difference p value responder 30 reduction in low back pain vas and no increase in pain medications 60 6 46 7 14 0 p 0 048 the investigational plan for the study also included a pre specified analysis of the primary endpoint data examining the cumulative proportion of responders which is a comparison of ranks and inherently preserves information over a dichotomized endpoint thereby improving statistical power in that analysis a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups was demonstrated with the treatment group showing a higher proportion of responders across all threshold levels numerous secondary endpoints and supporting analyses were collected to assess improvements in the treatment group as compared to the control group at 120 days including reduction from baseline in pain as measured by both mean reduction in vas and percent pain relief ppr change from baseline in disability measured by the

our ce mark for reactiv8 following ce marking approval a range of activities is required for post market clinical follow up to gather additional data on the long term performance and safety of reactiv8 the reactiv8 a pmcf study is a continuation of the reactiv8 a clinical trial but using ce marked reactiv8 subjects enrolled in the reactiv8 a clinical trial in the uk were converted to the reactiv8 a pmcf study physicians commenced with these implants in late 2017 and 43 implants were completed by the end of 2018 and we continue to gather clinical data from these patients reactiv8 c registry in addition to the reactiv8 a pmcf study the company is maintaining the reactiv8 c registry an international multi centre data collection registry all centres that use the product commercially are invited to participate in the registry program all patients who are implanted with reactiv8 at the centres participating in the registry will be invited to enroll in the registry until the target enrolment numbers have been reached the purpose of the registry is to gather additional summary data on long term performance of reactiv8 in at least 50 patients pma submission in august 2019 the company submitted a pre market approval pma application to the fda for reactiv8 the fda notified the company in october 2019 that it had made a threshold determination that the application was sufficiently complete to begin an in depth review in december 2019 the company completed a day 100 meeting with the fda regarding the pma application prior to the meeting the fda provided us with its initial feedback on the pma consisting of questions regarding the data included in the pma and the interpretation of such data the company currently has no plans to conduct

undertaking our clinical trials commercialization expenditure the ongoing costs of being a public company and running the group principal risks and uncertainties a summary of the principal risks relating to the group and company and or its industry include the following we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could be dilutive to current investors or require us to agree to terms which are specifically favourable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect we operate in a highly regulated environment and regulatory approval is required before we can market or sell reactiv8 in any market seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices can be a long and uncertain process strict or changing regulatory regimes government policies and legislation in any of our target markets may delay prohibit or reduce potential sales we are required to conduct clinical trials for regulatory approvals and other purposes clinical trials carry substantial risks and are costly and time consuming with uncertain results any inability to fully protect and exploit our intellectual property may adversely impact our financial condition business prospects and results of operations a more extensive description of the existing and future potential risks to mainstay s business and to the company s ordinary shares are outlined in the risk factors section of this report on pages 25 to 52 and should be considered carefully by shareholders and prospective investors financial risk management the group is

company s use of cash during the year there has been no significant change during the year or since the year end to the types or quantum of financial risks faced by the group or the group s approach to the management of those risks liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through i the issuance of equity securities and ii debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all the group s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the group s financial position and its ability to pursue its business strategy credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet contractual obligations and arises principally from the group s cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables credit risk is managed on a group basis the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset foreign currency risk the group s presentational currency is the us dollar the group s exposure to foreign currency risk arises through expenditure incurred in euro and australian dollars the group s australian subsidiary has an australian dollar functional currency and three of the group s subsidiaries located in ireland germany and the

experience in considering nominations to the board the nomination committee takes into account the benefit of board diversity including diversity of business background geographical diversity and gender diversity the board does not currently have a formal diversity policy in place due to the early stage of development of the group during 2020 the board will continue to focus attention on considering nominations to the board that re affirms the board s commitment to diversity across the group mainstay medical international plc risk factors this section addresses the existing and future material risks to mainstay s business however the following does not set out an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks that shareholders or prospective investors may face when making an investment in the ordinary shares and should be used as guidance only as further risks and uncertainties not currently known to the board or that the board currently deems immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the company s or the group s financial condition business prospects and or results of operations in such a case the market price of ordinary shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment risks relating to our business and our financial position we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we have incurred significant net losses since we were founded for the years ended 31 december 2019 and 31 december 2018 we had a comprehensive loss of 22 3 million and 31 million respectively we have funded our operations through equity capital and debt and have raised more than 139 million of equity capital and we have drawn 18 3 million under our debt facility the outstanding principal on this debt is 12 8 million as at 31 december 2019 we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of reactiv8 including completion of our feasibility study in october 2012 progress on our reactiv8 a clinical trial which commenced in 2014 and led to ce marking in may 2016 progress of our u s pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial the purpose of which is to gather data in support of our application for pre market approval pma from the u s food and drug administration fda initial commercialisation and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio to implement our business strategy and generate revenue and profit in the future we need to among other things obtain regulatory approvals for reactiv8 which on the date of this report is our only product in our target markets we have obtained ce marking of reactiv8 which allows for commercialisation of reactiv8 in the european economic area the eea which includes the eu iceland liechtenstein and norway and switzerland in january 2017 we applied to the australian therapeutic goods administration tga for reactiv8 to be admitted to the australian register of therapeutic goods artg which would allow for commercialisation in australia in april 2018 the tga requested additional clinical data with respect to reactiv8 which we submitted in june 2019 in december 2019 we received regulatory approval from the tga for reactiv8 confirming inclusion of reactiv8 in the artg and enabling commercialization throughout australia we have submitted an application for reactiv8 to be included in the prostheses list of reimbursed products in australia with a reimbursement decision expected in the third quarter of 2020 the prostheses list identifies implantable devices eligible for reimbursement from all private health insurance funds in australia we cannot be certain whether we will be successful in securing inclusion of reactiv8 on the prostheses list we do not plan to commercialize reactiv8 in australia until inclusion on the prostheses list is secured there is no assurance that commercialisation in the eea switzerland or australia if inclusion of reactiv8 on the prostheses list is secured will be successful or will generate sufficient revenue and profits to cover expenses or fund future growth we have filed a pma for reactiv8 in the u s but we have not yet obtained regulatory approval for reactiv8 in the u s the u s pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on two pre specified alternative analyses of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the u s pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda to allow for the approval of our pma application if u s regulatory approval is not obtained then it will not be possible to commercialise reactiv8 in the u s if we are unable to obtain additional regulatory approvals for reactiv8 in the u s and elsewhere or if product development manufacture marketing sales or commercialisation of reactiv8 is delayed or abandoned we may never generate significant revenue or become profitable even if we do become profitable in the short term we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis over the medium to long term in any case we will need to obtain additional capital to fund commercialisation including expanding reimbursement to fund continuing research and development and to run additional clinical trials we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue these objectives we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could require us to agree to terms which are specifically favourable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs including funds to pay our financial obligations as they fall due continue research and development conduct clinical trials continue our work to obtain regulatory approval and other activities necessary to bring reactiv8 to target markets and to establish marketing and sales capabilities however we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favourable to us if at all when needed if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it we may cease to have operations and may need to liquidate some or all of our assets being at this point the group s intellectual property in addition if we raise additional funds through further issues of equity or debt or other forms of financing existing shareholders could suffer significant adverse financial consequences including dilution any new equity securities could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of current shareholders any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required additional capital our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration our only product as of the date of this report reactiv8 is designed to treat people suffering from chronic low back pain clbp a serious and often debilitating medical condition the success of reactiv8 may be negatively impacted by many factors including regulatory delays adverse regulatory or legal actions problems arising from manufacturing research and development rates of product adoption lack of reimbursement and market penetration and low sales in target markets because our business currently relies on the success of a single product any factors that negatively impact the regulatory approval and commercialisation of reactiv8 would adversely affect our financial condition business prospects and or results of operations failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect in august 2015 mainstay medical limited entered into an agreement for a debt facility of up to 15 million in april 2019 we agreed to an amended debt facility and in july 2019 we announced the drawdown of 3 million in additional debt from a new tranche of the debt facility the repayment schedule for the three existing tranches drawn under the debt facility was amended in april 2019 such that no principal or interest will be repaid until 2021 with the principal and accrued interest to be amortized over the period from 1 january 2021 through 30 september 2023 the repayment schedule for the new tranche is the same as the amended repayment schedule for the three existing tranches the interest rate for all tranches will be 8 per annum with interest accruing but capitalized prior to january 1 2021 all principal and accrued interest from all tranches will automatically convert into ordinary shares of the company at a price per share of 8 00 upon the earlier of a fda approval of the company s pma application for reactiv8 b the date by which at least 900 000 ordinary shares are publicly sold on market by non affiliates of the company since 18 april 2019 at a price per share of at least 8 00 or c ipf s election to undertake such conversion in each case unless the company elects to satisfy such obligation in whole or in part in cash the terms of the agreement include covenants including a requirement that mainstay medical limited hold cash at least equal to its projected cash expenditures for operations and debt repayment for each three month period after 18 april 2019 in addition on 18 april 2019 the company issued to ipf warrants to purchase 1 5 million of its ordinary shares at a price per ordinary share of 6 00 at any time prior to the 6th anniversary of the amendment date being 18 april 2019 the company has issued further conditional warrants to ipf that will become exercisable only to the extent the company elects to repay the debt in cash rather than issue ordinary shares when a conversion of the debt is triggered the facility is secured by way of fixed and floating charges over the assets and undertakings of mainstay medical limited and the debenture includes customary terms and conditions in addition the company created a first fixed charge in favour of ipf over its present and future shares held in mainstay medical limited if we fail to comply with the provisions included in the debt facility and or the debt covenants and or fail to make repayments of principal or interest ipf might enforce their security which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition business prospects and or results of operations there is no guarantee that the performance of reactiv8 in commercialisation will match the performance of reactiv8 in clinical trials while the company will take steps including physician training and certification and having company sales representatives or field clinical specialists attend some or all implant procedures reactiv8 clinical performance in commercialisation may be different from the clinical performance observed during the clinical trials for a number of reasons including less control on the selection of people suitable for use of the product use by physicians with different experience and or training and failure to adhere to a follow up regimen in the absence of clinical trial oversight furthermore issues with product performance may subsequently be identified once a product is in the market regulatory authorities require medical device manufacturers to monitor and report certain types of adverse events as part of the medical device reporting mdr regulations so that safety issues can be identified and addressed quickly when such issues are identified corrective actions may be required such as modifying labelling or instructions for use improving training or removing the device from the market to ensure proper use or patient safety any of these could result in significant time delays and or expense and or may harm our reputation such issues may result in the need for our product to be suspended from sale or withdrawn from the market in these circumstances our product may require substantial redesign and or re engineering to address any identified issues this may result in the need to undertake further clinical trials to re establish the safety and efficacy of the revised product which would be costly and time consuming and may exceed our resources any of these circumstances may have a material adverse effect on the timing and extent of our future revenues and profitability we only recently began commercializing reactiv8 in the eea and have no history of commercializing reactiv8 in the united states or elsewhere reactiv8 has been ce marked since 2016 enabling us to commercialize it throughout the eea we have received tga approval for reactiv8 in australia but we do not intend to begin commercialisation activities there unless and until reactiv8 is included in the prostheses list we have not yet obtained approval from the fda to commercially market in the united states as a result we have a limited history of commercializing reactiv8 generally and no history of selling reactiv8 in the united states or elsewhere as an organization we have never commercially launched a product in the united states nor commenced a sales representative training program or conducted a launch of a similar expected size a commercial launch and training program of this size is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources we may be unable to gain broader market acceptance in the countries in which we have already begun to commercialize reactiv8 or successfully commercialize it in the united states or elsewhere for a number of reasons including established alternatives to reactiv8 with strong relationships with customers including physicians hospitals and third party suppliers limitations in our ability to demonstrate differentiation and advantages of reactiv8 compared to alternative methods for treating clbp and the relative safety efficacy and ease of use of reactiv8 the limited size of our sales force and the learning curve required to gain experience selling

international plc chairman s statement dear shareholder i am pleased to present the 2019 annual report for mainstay medical and its subsidiaries based on the progress made by the company during 2019 we believe the company is well positioned for success in 2020 and beyond business review we announced headline results from the reactiv8 b clinical trial in november 2018 whilst the difference between the treatment and control groups on the primary endpoint of responder rate at 120 days was not statistically significant due to a higher than expected response rate in the control group we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 these overall results include additional pre specified analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint as well as high responder rates in the patients that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications by patients at one year we believe these results will continue to support commercial validation efforts in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark these results also formed the basis for our submission of a pre market approval pma application for reactiv8 with the u s food and drug administration fda in august 2019 a detailed review of the company s corporate activity in 2019 can be found in the directors report on page 7 of this annual report finance review cash on hand as at 31 december 2019 was 17 4 million 2018 15 5 million operating expenses were 19 2 million during the year ended 31 december 2019 2018 29 6 million outlook our corporate objectives for 2020 are to advance the pma review process with the fda with a decision regarding approval expected around the end of 2020 and to continue our commercial validation efforts in germany and other select markets by focussing on building a limited number of high volume reactiv8 practices that will allow us to gather associated clinical data refine the patient selection process and gain the learnings needed to accelerate commercial launch in future markets directors and staff i would like to thank our staff consultants clinical trial investigators and all my fellow directors for their support and dedication which has enabled the continued success of the company of course we also owe a debt of gratitude to all those people who agreed to be subjects in our clinical trials and helped to advance reactiv8 as an option for the millions of people suffering from chronic low back pain i look forward to the future with optimism yours faithfully

activities us pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial the reactiv8 b trial is an international multi centre prospective randomized sham controlled triple blinded clinical trial with one way crossover conducted under an ide from the fda the reactiv8 b trial is intended to gather data in support of the company s pma application information about the clinical trial can be found at a total of 204 subjects were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control 14 days after implant in the treatment group the reactiv8 pulse generator was programmed to deliver electrical stimulation expected to elicit contractions of the multifidus muscle in the control group the reactiv8 device was programmed to provide a low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days subjects in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group the subjects in the study had an average age of 47 and an average duration of chronic low back pain of 14 years this patient population had tried many other treatment alternatives including physical therapy and drugs with limited success and 79 of the subjects were on pain medication at baseline the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain consisting a 0 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worse imaginable pain responders were defined as having a 30 or greater improvement on this measure between baseline and 120 days after baseline without any increase in pain medication and or muscle relaxants taken in the two weeks prior to the primary endpoint assessment visit the following table shows the result on the primary efficacy endpoint primary efficacy endpoint treatment n 102 control n 102 difference p value responder 30 reduction in low back pain vas and no increase in pain medications 57 1 46 7 10 4 p 0 1377 the investigational plan for the study included a pre specified sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of medication changes to treat acute unrelated pain conditions on the primary endpoint the company in consultation with statistical advisors determined that a valid way to handle the subjects with pain medication increases for reasons unrelated to low back pain would be to analyze the endpoint with these subjects removed as pain medication use for reasons unrelated to low back pain was an exclusion criterion in the study by doing so inference is limited to the population of subjects taking pain medication only for reasons related to low back pain as intended by the patient selection criteria in the trial protocol six subjects had increases in pain medications for reasons other than low back pain the following table presents the results of the primary efficacy endpoint in the subjects not requiring an increase in pain medications for reasons other than for low back pain showing a clinically meaningful and statistically significant difference primary efficacy endpoint treatment n 96 control n 102

of the primary endpoint data examining the cumulative proportion of responders which is a comparison of ranks and inherently preserves information over a dichotomized endpoint thereby improving statistical power in that analysis a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups was demonstrated with the treatment group showing a higher proportion of responders across all threshold levels numerous secondary endpoints and supporting analyses were collected to assess improvements in the treatment group as compared to the control group at 120 days including

study the reactiv8 a clinical trial was an international multi center prospective single arm clinical trial of reactiv8 that formed the basis of our ce mark for reactiv8 following ce marking approval a range of activities is required for post market clinical follow up to gather additional data on the long term performance and safety of reactiv8 the reactiv8 a pmcf study is a continuation of the reactiv8 a clinical trial but using ce marked reactiv8 subjects enrolled in the reactiv8 a clinical trial in the uk were converted to the reactiv8 a pmcf study physicians commenced with these implants in late 2017 and 43 implants were completed by the end of 2018 and we continue to gather clinical data from these patients reactiv8 c registry in addition to the reactiv8 a pmcf study the company is maintaining the reactiv8 c registry an international multi centre data collection registry all centres that use the product commercially are invited to participate in the registry program all patients who are implanted with reactiv8 at the centres participating in the registry will be invited to enroll in the registry until the target enrolment numbers have been reached the purpose of the registry is to gather additional summary data on long term performance of reactiv8 in at least 50 patients pma submission in august 2019 the company submitted a pre market approval pma application to the fda

cash outflow reflects the cost of the research and development of reactiv8 undertaking our clinical trials commercialization expenditure the ongoing costs of being a public company and running the group principal risks and uncertainties a summary of the principal risks relating to the group and company and or its industry include the following we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could be dilutive to current investors or require us to agree to terms which are specifically favourable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect we operate in a highly regulated environment and regulatory approval is required before we can market or sell reactiv8 in any market seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices can be a long and uncertain process strict or changing regulatory regimes government policies and legislation in any of our target markets may delay prohibit or reduce potential sales we are required to conduct clinical trials for regulatory approvals and other purposes clinical trials carry substantial risks and are costly and time consuming with uncertain results any inability to fully protect and exploit our intellectual property may adversely impact our financial condition business prospects and results of operations a more extensive description of the existing and future potential risks to mainstay s business and to the company s ordinary shares are outlined in the risk factors section of this report on pages 25 to 52 and should be considered carefully by shareholders and prospective investors financial risk management the group is exposed to a variety of financial risks including credit risks liquidity risks interest rate risks and foreign currency risks further information can be reviewed in note 21 risk management framework mainstay s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group s risk management framework the group s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to the limits risk management systems and policies will be reviewed regularly as conditions affecting the group change the group has no significant concentrations of financial risk other than concentration of cash with individual banks other than liquidity risk based on the company s use of cash during the year there has been no significant change during the year or since the year end to the types or quantum of financial risks faced by the group or the group s approach to the management of those risks liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through i the issuance of equity securities and ii debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all the group s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the group s financial position and its ability to pursue its business strategy credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet contractual obligations and arises principally from the group s cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables credit risk is managed on a group basis the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset foreign currency risk the group s presentational currency is the us dollar the group s exposure to foreign currency risk arises through expenditure incurred in euro and australian dollars the group s australian subsidiary has an australian dollar functional currency and three of the group s subsidiaries located in ireland germany and the netherlands have a euro functional currency interest rate risk the group s cash balances are maintained in short term access accounts and carry a floating rate of interest the company s loan originally carried a variable rate of 3 month euribor plus a margin ranging from 10 5 to 12 5 the repayment schedule for the three existing tranches drawn

mainstay medical international plc risk factors this section addresses the existing and future material risks to mainstay s business however the following does not set out an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks that shareholders or prospective investors may face when making an investment in the ordinary shares and should be used as guidance only as further risks and uncertainties not currently known to the board or that the board currently deems immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the company s or the group s financial condition business prospects and or results of operations in such a case the market price of ordinary shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment risks relating to our business and our financial position we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we have incurred significant net losses since we were founded for the years ended 31 december 2019 and 31 december 2018 we had a comprehensive loss of 22 3 million and 31 million respectively we have funded our operations through equity capital and debt and have raised more than 139 million of equity capital and we have drawn 18 3 million under our debt facility the outstanding principal on this debt is 12 8 million as at 31 december 2019 we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of reactiv8 including completion of our feasibility study in october 2012 progress on our reactiv8 a clinical trial which commenced in 2014 and led to ce marking in may 2016 progress of our u s pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial the purpose of which is to gather data in support of our application for pre market approval pma from the u s food and drug administration fda initial commercialisation and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio to implement our business strategy and generate revenue and profit in the future we need to among other things obtain regulatory approvals for reactiv8 which on the date of this report is our only product in our target markets we have obtained ce marking of reactiv8 which allows for commercialisation of reactiv8 in the european economic area the eea which includes the eu iceland liechtenstein and norway and switzerland in january 2017 we applied to the australian therapeutic goods administration tga for reactiv8 to be admitted to the australian register of therapeutic goods artg which would allow for commercialisation in australia in april 2018 the tga requested additional clinical data with respect to reactiv8 which we submitted in june 2019 in december 2019 we received regulatory approval from the tga for reactiv8 confirming inclusion of reactiv8 in the artg and enabling commercialization throughout australia we have submitted an application for reactiv8 to be included in the prostheses list of reimbursed products in australia with a reimbursement decision expected in the third quarter of 2020 the prostheses list identifies implantable devices eligible for reimbursement from all private health insurance funds in australia we cannot be certain whether we will be successful in securing inclusion of reactiv8 on the prostheses list we do not plan to commercialize reactiv8 in australia until inclusion on the prostheses list is secured there is no assurance that commercialisation in the eea switzerland or australia if inclusion of reactiv8 on the prostheses list is secured will be successful or will generate sufficient revenue and profits to cover expenses or fund future growth we have filed a pma for reactiv8 in the u s but we have not yet obtained regulatory approval for reactiv8 in the u s the u s pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on two pre specified alternative analyses of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the u s pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda to allow for the approval of our pma application if u s regulatory approval is not obtained then it will not be possible to commercialise reactiv8 in the u s if we are unable to obtain additional regulatory approvals for reactiv8 in the u s and elsewhere or if product development manufacture marketing sales or commercialisation of reactiv8 is delayed or abandoned we may never generate significant revenue or become profitable even if we do become profitable in the short term we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis over the medium to long term in any case we will need to obtain additional capital to fund commercialisation including expanding reimbursement to fund continuing research and development and to run additional clinical trials we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue these objectives we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could require us to agree to terms which are specifically favourable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs including funds to pay our financial obligations as they fall due continue research and development conduct clinical trials continue our work to obtain regulatory approval and other activities necessary to bring reactiv8 to target markets and to establish marketing and sales capabilities however we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favourable to us if at all when needed if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it we may cease to have operations and may need to liquidate some or all of our assets being at this point the group s intellectual property in addition if we raise additional funds through further issues of equity or debt or other forms of financing existing shareholders could suffer significant adverse financial consequences including dilution any new equity securities could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of current shareholders any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required additional capital our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration our only product as of the date of this report reactiv8 is designed to treat people suffering from chronic low back pain clbp a serious and often debilitating medical condition the success of reactiv8 may be negatively impacted by many factors including regulatory delays adverse regulatory or legal actions problems arising from manufacturing research and development rates of product adoption lack of reimbursement and market penetration and low sales in target markets because our business currently relies on the success of a single product any factors that negatively impact the regulatory approval and commercialisation of reactiv8 would adversely affect our financial condition business prospects and or results of operations failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect in august 2015 mainstay medical limited entered into an agreement for a debt facility of up to 15 million in april 2019 we agreed to an amended debt facility and in july 2019 we announced the drawdown of 3 million in additional debt from a new tranche of the debt facility the repayment schedule for the three existing tranches drawn under the debt facility was amended in april 2019 such that no principal or interest will be repaid until 2021 with the principal and accrued interest to be amortized over the period from 1 january 2021 through 30 september 2023 the repayment schedule for the new tranche is the same as the amended repayment schedule for the three existing tranches the interest rate for all tranches will be 8 per annum with interest accruing but capitalized prior to january 1 2021 all principal and accrued interest from all tranches will automatically convert into ordinary shares of the company at a price per share of 8 00 upon the earlier of a fda approval of the company s pma application for reactiv8 b the date by which at least 900 000 ordinary shares are publicly sold on market by non affiliates of the company since 18 april 2019 at a price per share of at least 8 00 or c ipf s election to undertake such conversion in each case unless the company elects to satisfy such obligation in whole or in part in cash the terms of the agreement include covenants including a requirement that mainstay medical limited hold cash at least equal to its projected cash expenditures for operations and debt repayment for each three month period after 18 april 2019 in addition on 18 april 2019 the company issued to ipf warrants to purchase 1 5 million of its ordinary shares at a price per ordinary share of 6 00 at any time prior to the 6th anniversary of the amendment date being 18 april 2019 the company has issued further conditional warrants to ipf that will become exercisable only to the extent the company elects to repay the debt in cash rather than issue ordinary shares when a conversion of the debt is triggered the facility is secured by way of fixed and floating charges over the assets and undertakings of mainstay medical limited and the debenture includes customary terms and conditions in addition the company created a first fixed charge in favour of ipf over its present and future shares held in mainstay medical limited if we fail to comply with the provisions included in the debt facility and or the debt covenants and or fail to make repayments of principal or interest ipf might enforce their security which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition business prospects and or results of operations there is no guarantee that the performance of reactiv8 in commercialisation will match the performance of reactiv8 in clinical trials while the company will take steps including physician training and certification and having company sales representatives or field clinical specialists attend some or all implant procedures reactiv8 clinical performance in commercialisation may be different from the clinical performance observed during the clinical trials for a number of reasons including less control on the selection of people suitable for use of the product use by physicians with different experience and or training and failure to adhere to a follow up regimen in the absence of clinical trial oversight furthermore issues with product performance may subsequently be identified once a product is in the market regulatory authorities require medical device manufacturers to monitor and report certain types of adverse events as part of the medical device reporting mdr regulations so that safety issues can be identified and addressed quickly when such issues are identified corrective actions may be required such as modifying labelling or instructions for use improving training or removing the device from the market to ensure proper use or patient safety any of these could result in significant time delays and or expense and or may harm our reputation such issues may result in the need for our product to be suspended from sale or withdrawn from the market in these circumstances our product may require substantial redesign and or re engineering to address any identified issues this may result in the need to undertake further clinical trials to re establish the safety and efficacy of the revised product which would be costly and time consuming and may exceed our resources any of these circumstances may have a material adverse effect on the timing and extent of our future revenues and profitability we only recently began commercializing reactiv8 in the eea and have no history of commercializing reactiv8 in the united states or elsewhere reactiv8 has been ce marked since 2016 enabling us to commercialize it throughout the eea we have received tga approval for reactiv8 in australia but we do

published tuesday 25 february 2020 print disqus richard rick mills ahead of the herd in our last article a minsky moment is coming for gold we presented the minsky moment referring to a point in time when a period of bullish speculation leads to a spectacular market crash named after economist hyman minsky the theory centers around the inherent instability of stock markets especially bull markets such as the current one that has been in place for over a decade minsky held that over a prolonged period of prosperity investors take on more and more risk until lending exceeds what borrowers can pay off from their incoming revenues when over indebted investors are forced to sell even their less speculative positions to make good on their loans markets spiral lower and create a severe demand for cash an event that has come to be known as a minsky moment the levy economics institute of bard college in our article we asked is the current us stock market and global economy approaching a minsky moment if so precious metals gold and silver will surely go ballistic in the aftermath of the collapse the intellectual challenge is identifying the metaphorical pin that pops the bubble which investors banks and governments have been happily inflating our minsky moment piece pinpointed some catalysts that could lead the global economy down a road of economic ruin they include the coronavirus a related collapse in ocean freight shipping rates fake good news that is masking serious problems in the us economy like a lack of business investment record share buybacks that enrich management not companies nor their shareholders plus any number of white swan geopolitical risks hotspots that could at any time boil over into a conflagration that destabilizes the fragile global economy the truth of the matter though is these are all symptoms of a bigger much more insidious disease and that is paper money more specifically piles and piles of consumer business and government debt that has been allowed to accumulate without consequences under our fiat paper monetary system gold s minsky moment will come when everyone realizes that the paper monetary system and its reserve currency the us dollar has no intrinsic value and therefore can no longer be trusted when money is worth nothing but the paper it s printed on and previously rejected gold and silver re emerge as currency backstops the making of the fed the us federal reserve operates as a central bank controlling fiscal and monetary policy its three goals are to promote maximum employment keep prices stable ie control inflation and to moderate long term interest rates the fed is independent in that it is not a part of the us government while the us president appoints its seven member board of governors including its chair appointments must be approved by the senate he has no direct control over its policies though he d certainly like to witness president trump s attempts to bully current fed chair jerome powell into dropping interest rates in order to keep the us dollar low needed for trump s maga credo of reviving the us manufacturing sector how did the us come to have a central bank that is independent from the government it all goes back to november 22 1910 when a delegation of the nation s leading financiers led by senator nelson aldrich left new jersey for a secret 10 day meeting on jekyll island georgia among the attendees are some now familiar american family banking names frank vanderlip president of the national city bank of new york associated with the rockefellers henry p davison senior partner of j p morgan company regarded as morgan s personal emissary charles d norton president of the morgan dominated first national bank of new york col edward house who would later become president woodrow wilson s closest adviser and founder of the council on foreign relations benjamin strong a lieutenant of j p morgan paul warburg a recent immigrant from germany who had joined the banking house of kuhn loeb and company new york directed the proceedings and wrote the primary features of what would be called the aldrich plan read the surprising history of the fed in voluntary servitude begins with a debt the whole point of creating the federal reserve system was to give the new central bank the fed control over the money supply having been spooked by the crisis of 1907 here a bit of history is useful courtesy of former us senator ron paul and lewis lehrman s the case for gold written back in 1983 in their seminal work of economic history paul and lehrman go right back to the beginning of what they call the present monetary crisis when in 1784 thomas jefferson said if we determine that a dollar shall be our unit we must then say with precision what a dollar is the founding fathers followed his advice and in 1792 defined one dollar as 371 grains of silver from then until 1971 the dollar was defined by a weight of either silver or gold but since 1971 when president nixon abandoned the gold standard the dollar remains undefined by a physical value the greenback is really nothing more than a piece of paper printed with government ink and imbued with the subjective value that a 1 bill is in fact worth the 100 cents the government says it is worth in 1900 the governing republicans officially announced the gold standard all paper money was to be redeemable in gold and silver continued as a subsidiary metal the problem was that between 1897 and 1914 an increase in gold production pushed the gold supply up by 7 5 however the amount of cash deposits during the same period overwhelmed the amount of gold in bank vaults total bank deposits increased 317 5 to gold s 7 5 rise in 1907 the treasury was called upon to bail out the banks that ran short on cash resulting in an agreed need for some form of central banking hence the 1910 meeting at jekyll lsland georgia and the creation of the us federal reserve an instrument of inflation paul and lehrman explain how by creating the us federal reserve system the government invited persistent inflation by establishing the federal reserve system the federal government changed the base of the banking pyramid to the federal reserve banks only the federal reserve could now print cash and all member banks could now multiply their deposits on top of federal reserve deposits all national banks were required to join the federal reserve and their gold and other lawful money reserves had to be transferred to the federal reserve the federal reserve in turn could pyramid its deposits by three to one on top of gold this centralization created an enormous potential for inflationary expansion of bank deposits not only that reserve requirements for the nation s banks were deliberately cut in half in the course of establishing the federal reserve system thereby inviting the rapid doubling of the money supply average reserve requirements for all banks prior to the federal reserve act is estimated to be 21 percent in the original act of 1913 these were cut to 11 6 percent and three years later to 9 8 percent it is clear then that the federal reserve was designed from the very beginning to be an instrument for a uniform and coordinated inflation of bank money indeed total bank deposits were 14 0 billion at the beginning of the federal reserve system in january 1914 after six years in january 1920 total bank deposits had reached 29 4 billion an enormous increase of 110 percent or 18 3 percent per year the creation of the federal reserve had made that expansion possible yet it was nothing compared to what would come after 1971 when president nixon announced that no more gold would be given in exchange for dollars there were now absolutely no checks on the availability of the united states to inflate states the paul and lehrman report in a clear reference to the inflationary 1980s the authors conclude that there has never in peacetime american history been any sustained rate of inflation to match the inflation since 1941 the same in fact is true of wartime which at least has never lasted more than a few years and it is not an accident that the highest most accelerated rate of inflation has taken place since 1971 when the united states went off the international aspects of the gold standard and went over completely to fiat paper and in the forward to the report the effort and planning imaginable cannot make paper money work there is no way paper can be improved as money whenever governments are granted power to purchase their own debt they never fail to do so eventually destroying the value of the currency political money always fails because free people eventually reject it for short periods individual countries can tell their citizens to use paper but only at the sacrifice of personal and economic liberty the fed s ability to print money on a whim to purchase their own debt in the words of ron paul and lewis lehrman is best exemplified by the quantitative easing programs that followed the 2008 financial crisis which in retrospect was another debt fueled minsky moment in that case the popping of the us housing market bubble elevated out of control via easy credit and toxic bank loans qe was used to maximum effect to counter act the effects of the crisis that brought down lehman brothers and bear stearns among other large banks between 2008 and 2015 the fed bought trillions of dollars worth of t bills and mortgage backed securities keeping interest rates near zero percent but making the us debt balloon from 900 billion to 4 5 trillion debt crisis five years later the us debt stands at 23 trillion and counting in january the world bank warned of the risks of a new global debt crisis pointing to the latest of four waves of debt accumulation over the past 150 years the current wave which the washington dc based group says started in 2010 is thought to be the largest fastest and most broad based increase in global borrowing since the 1970s cnn reports in the first quarter of 2019 world debt hit 246 5 trillion reversing a trend that started in the beginning of 2018 of reducing debt burdens when global debt reached its highest on record 248 trillion we ve written extensively about the dangers of the mounting us debt load the country is accumulating about the same amount of debt as its annual economic output each year another trillion dollars gets added to the national debt according to its latest projections the congressional budget office says debt to gdp will reach 150 by 2047 well past the point where financial crises typically occur the budget deficit is also likely to rise nearly tripling from 2 9 of gdp to 9 8 in 2047 de dollarization it s not a stretch to envision a scenario whereby the world s reserve currency the us dollar collapses under the weight of unmanageable debt triggered say by a mass offloading of us treasuries by foreign countries that own about 6 trillion of us debt this would cause the dollar to crash and interest rates would go through the roof choking consumer and business borrowing import prices would skyrocket too the result of a low dollar hitting consumers in the pocket book for everything not made in the usa business confidence would plummet mass layoffs would occur growth would stop and the us would enter a recession all the countries that sold their treasuries would then face a major slump in demand for their products from american consumers their largest market eventually companies in these countries would begin to suffer plus all other nations that trade with the us like canada and mexico before long the recession in the us would spread like a cancer to the rest of the world this isn t some tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist s idea de dollarization has already begun as america s adversaries punt the dollar in favor of other currencies and gold bullion in 2019 russia grew its gold reserves by 158 1 tonnes and chinese gold reserves increased by 95 8 tonnes over the first nine months according to the world gold council in 2018 russia sold off 84 of its us debt holdings between march and may leaving just 14 9 billion in its us reserve account that compares to 102 billion in december 2017 the sell off corresponded with tough us sanctions imposed on russian president putin s closest associates and rusal which produces 7 of the world s aluminum the dumping of us treasuries by russia caused barely a ripple since the country only holds about 1 10 of the t bills owned by china which has the most of any country 1 2 trillion but it begs the question what would happen if china started selling us treasuries think it would never happen consider the trade war with china isn t over the coronavirus has thrown a spanner into the phase 1 trade agreement signed on jan 15 china s promise to purchase an additional 200 billion worth of us goods including agricultural products is now in considerable doubt beijing is reportedly being urged to invoke force majeure a clause allowing the two parties to consult one another if a natural disaster or force beyond its control delays either party from meeting its obligations under the agreement the possibility of moving forward on a phase 2 agreement seems unlikely in light of all the supply chain interruptions caused by the pandemic china is warming to russia through energy deals and is buying iranian oil despite us sanctions its one belt one road initiative is key to its plan to exert chinese hegemony and create a trading bloc without the need to trade with its former enemies the us and europe eventually china could stop buying us treasuries altogether how would that affect the us dollar and more significantly how would the us finance its 23 trillion debt if the anti t bill movement spread to other countries and the market for them dried up the current arms buildup between the us china and russia precipitated by the us pulling out of the 1987 inf treaty due to russia breaking its terms could easily trigger a war especially if china is pushed into a corner due to economic weakness and is looking for a scapegoat taiwan hong kong vietnam and us naval positions in the east and south china seas are all potential hot spots that could lead to a military confrontation that combined with persistent trade barriers that are keeping the chinese economy weak could result in china dumping us treasuries we ve lived under us dollar rule since 1944 but history shows us that all currencies have a shelf life as we wrote in the later united states empire history is marked by empire after empire that has over extended itself militarily the us is no different the roman and british empires were underpinned by strong militaries that both expanded territories and defended them the same can be said for other empires throughout history the akkadians vikings greeks gauls spanish portuguese and soviets to name a few all seized power by conquering or seizing other lands the united states since world war two has been the street cop on the global block occasionally challenged but never yet surpassed in economic nor military power world domination however comes at a heavy price to the national budget military spending is the main reason for the spiraling debt over the past few years as a line item it is second only to social security if special forces nuclear weapons and the va budgets were added to the military budget military spending would dwarf all other spending programs the us under the trump administration has been punching above its weight the country no longer walks softly and carries a big stick if anything it s the other way round hence the testing of decades old alliances picking fights with adversaries inciting racism at home stacking the supreme court sowing division amongst republicans all amid allegations that trump interfered with an investigation into whether russia helped get him elected and pressured the ukrainian leader to investigate joe biden the subject of an impeachment trial at which he was later acquitted but as america fights against those who threaten her hegemony and wealth north korea china mexico the eu iran etc and tries to borrow and spend its way out of the financial quagmire it finds itself in through low interest rates and monetary stimulus others see a country that is no longer operating an economy responsibly enough for its currency to rule the world what could bring the us down we believe the answer lies in a relatively arcane and under reported change to us trade policy currency rule the trump administration is going down a very dangerous road with its new currency rule that imbues the us commerce department with incredibly strong powers to invoke across the board trade protectionism from countries all the way down to individual companies the way we see it this could be the beginning of an all encompassing trade war and a truly global round of highly competitive currency devaluations wherein the winner is the biggest loser some industries and us at aoth believe this aggressively protectionist stance will lead to currency wars and turn the 6 trillion per day global currency market into a new battleground for trump s trade wars goods benefiting from weaker currencies then the us dollar representing each and every one of america s trading partners could be recipients of duties or countervailing duties equal to the difference between the weaker currency and the us dollar in other words eliminating that country s currency advantage while china is the obvious target of us tariffs and rule changes strengthening the commerce department s hand in dealing with currency complaints there are many other countries and individual businesses commerce has in its sights last year the treasury department came out with a report that recommended 21 trading partners should face scrutiny over their currencies they include china germany japan south korea ireland italy malaysia vietnam and singapore these trading nations and even their individual businesses that import goods into the us are now vulnerable to being tariffed on targeted imports an amount that will make imports sell for more than their us counterpart minsky moment taken to its logical solution if the us starts slapping tariffs on all the products its domestic industries can t compete against we are looking at the complete collapse of global trade as we know it imagine you want to hell you need to sell your products to the us because of the enormity of the us market consumer spending makes up 70 of us gdp to be a successful international company you need to be selling into the us but your american competitors don t like how cheaply you re able to sell your goods in their own backyard they complain to the commerce department and bang your us imports are immediately hit with a 25 tariff guess what just happened to your us market any country in the world that manufactures goods that are priced higher than ones made in the us or any country company that manufactures goods the commerce department thinks can be made cheaper domestically can be subjected to punishing duties those duties aren t picked up by the so called currency manipulators they are added to the prices paid by us consumers and go directly into us government coffers and because a lot of goods previously made in america no longer are because of globalization american consumers end up paying billions of dollars worth of duties which are effectively an import tax on consumers having treated its former trading partners with such disdain they begin looking elsewhere to replace the increasingly closed off us market in country supply chains spring up regional trading blocks with countries friendly enough to not engage in a race to the bottom devaluation battle start to emerge including the countries that are part of china s belt and road initiative the problem though is everything is priced in us dollars companies don t have to sell into the us but they do have to buy raw materials which invariably are priced in usd soon discussions at higher levels like the imf and the wto point to alternatives beyond the usd the us has been in danger of losing its exorbitant privilege as the reserve currency but now its adversarial trade stance pushes the major powers into adopting a new global currency possibly backed by gold once this happens the us dollar plunges in value hardly anyone can afford to trade with the us because of its radical protectionism in this environment of fear and isolationism the metals that prosper are gold and silver traditional safe havens that hold their value and can be relied upon as tangible currencies in the event of a fiat money breakdown conclusion this is gold s true minsky moment many things can happen to cause instability in the global economy including a worsening coronavirus a slowdown in shipping a denting of the largest economies the us china germany japan and in the worst of cases a war though that would be good for the military industrial complex or another global recession but these are just reactions symptoms of the disease paper money a global fiat currency system the uncontrolled printing of paper money has caused consumer debt business debt and government debt to reach out of control proportions and the country in the worst debt shape is the united states which also happens to have the world s reserve currency all the effort and planning imaginable cannot make paper money work there is no way paper can be improved as money whenever governments are granted power to purchase their own debt they never fail to do so eventually destroying the value of the currency political money always fails because free people eventually reject it for short periods individual countries can tell their citizens to use paper but only at the sacrifice of personal and economic liberty we know that the us stock market is a bubble and all bubbles pop it s only a matter of when we also know that much has been done by the trump administration to fray existing alliances and to inflame tensions with trading partners turned adversaries namely china the european union and even its two nafta amigos canada and mexico china russia turkey and others are already moving away from pricing trade in us dollars and buying us debt through treasury purchases central banks have been stocking up on gold will the rest of the world follow and punt the us as the world s reserve currency we at

was once a 0 3 contraction becomes 0 4 the peso relative strength has not been a function of a booming economy but of the high real and nominal interest rates that are choking the economy that means that if the downward revision does materialize the impact on peso could be marginal the broader risk appetite is more significant the us dollar closed above mxn19 00 yesterday for the first time since

the earnings materials and company industry resources sections of our investor relations website at www americantower com non gaap and defined financial measures in addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap provided throughout this press release the company has presented the following non gaap and defined financial measures gross margin operating profit operating profit margin adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nareit funds from operations ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated adjusted funds from operations affo affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated affo per share affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders per share free cash flow net debt net leverage ratio and indian carrier consolidation driven churn iccc in addition the company presents tenant billings tenant billings growth organic tenant billings growth and new site tenant billings growth these measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the company s core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group as outlined in detail below the company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods particularly where acquisitions or non operating factors including historical cost basis are involved the company s non gaap and defined financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies revenue components in addition to reporting total revenue the company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for and operating performance of its real estate portfolio accordingly the company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components i tenant billings ii new site tenant billings iii organic tenant billings iv international pass through revenue v straight line revenue vi pre paid amortization revenue vii foreign currency exchange impact and viii other revenue tenant billings the majority of the company s revenue is generated from non cancellable long term tenant leases revenue from tenant billings reflects several key aspects of the company s real estate business i colocations amendments reflects new tenant leases for space on existing sites and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment ii escalations reflects contractual increases in billing rates which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index iii cancellations reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non renewals or in limited circumstances when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced and iv new sites reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions new site tenant billings day one tenant billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior year period incremental colocations amendments escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in new site tenant billings the company believes providing new site tenant billings enhances an investor s ability to analyze the company s existing real estate portfolio growth as well as its development program growth as the company s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period organic tenant billings tenant billings on sites that the company has owned since the beginning of the prior year period as well as tenant billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the company s portfolio international pass through revenue a portion of the company s pass through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices as a result revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period which is not representative of the company s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs furthermore this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the company s markets as a result the company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass through revenue on certain revenue growth rates straight line revenue under gaap the company recognizes revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases due to the company s significant base of non cancellable long term tenant leases this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals typically increases when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred these signings and renewals are only a portion of the company s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our tenant billings growth as a result the company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures pre paid amortization revenue the company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants these upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on its real estate portfolio i e does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do the company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business foreign currency exchange impact the majority of the company s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country s local currency as a result foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from period to period depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the u s dollar the company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business other revenue other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue non gaap and defined financial measure definitions tenant billings growth the increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of tenant billings for a current period with tenant billings for the corresponding prior year period in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring tenant billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio organic tenant billings growth the portion of tenant billings growth attributable to organic tenant billings the company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness and therefore the value of the company s property assets new site tenant billings growth the portion of tenant billings growth attributable to new site tenant billings the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to tenant billings from recently acquired or constructed properties indian carrier consolidation driven churn iccc tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short term carrier consolidation in india includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation but excludes normal course churn the company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event gross margin revenues less operating expenses excluding stock based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations depreciation amortization and accretion selling general administrative and development expense and other operating expenses the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site level profitability of its assets operating profit gross margin less selling general administrative and development expense excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments for segment reporting purposes in periods through the third quarter of 2018 the latin america property segment operating profit and gross margin also include interest income expense tv azteca net operating profit and gross margin are before interest income interest expense gain loss on retirement of long term obligations other income expense net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and income tax benefit provision operating profit margin the percentage that results from dividing operating profit by revenue adjusted ebitda net income before income loss from equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of long term obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stock based compensation expense the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations in addition it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector adjusted ebitda margin the percentage that results from dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenue nareit funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interests the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above particularly depreciation expenses given the high initial up front capital intensity of the company s operating model in addition it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector consolidated adjusted funds from operations affo nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders before i straight line revenue and

capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and long term deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii gain loss on retirement of long term obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interests less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures the company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above which if unadjusted may cause material fluctuations in nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of the company s property assets in those periods in addition it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector adjusted funds from operations affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated affo excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of consolidated affo the company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency given the minority interests in its indian and european businesses consolidated affo per share consolidated affo divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders per share affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures including payments on finance leases and perpetual land

free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies net debt total long term debt including current portion and finance lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents net leverage ratio net debt divided by the quarter s annualized adjusted ebitda the quarter s adjusted ebitda multiplied by four the company believes that including this calculation is

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

netty ismail lilian karunungan robert brand and sydney maki thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe bloomberg emerging market bonds are on fire but there s a worrying subtext to the rally as investors grow increasingly concerned about the long term economic impact of the coronavirus while the dollar denominated debt of developing nations advanced for an 11th week in the five days through friday the longest winning streak in eight years indexes of stocks and currencies retreated as the spread of the virus showed few signs of slowing that s left bonds more disconnected from stocks and currencies than at any time this year the divergence underlines the concern that the rally may have less to do with the strength of emerging economies than the scramble for returns in a

sara grut and caesar maasry analysts at goldman sachs group inc say the relative safety of emerging market debt is being driven by expectations that the virus s impact will be temporary and that easing by central banks will reduce the risk that the turmoil leads to defaults or restructurings the downside risks which tend to matter most for the pricing of credit risks appear relatively contained they said in a note the drawback though is that bonds may be less likely to rally along with equities and currencies if the virus is contained and sentiment improves they wrote read em bonds

february 25 2020 links international journal of socialist renewal reposted from international viewpoint on 21 november 2019 colombia experienced a social explosion unprecedented in the history of the country since the middle of the last century on that day the national strike directorate cnp comando nacional de paro called for a protest march against the announcement of regressive economic counter reforms the cnp is made up of the central trade unions central unitaria de trabajadores cut confederación general de trabajadores cgt confederación de trabajadores de colombia ctc and by organizations of students peasants indians pensioners and environmental activists who in recent years have led the resistance by these social sectors to the policies of the colombian state the call for mobilizations was launched by the trade union federations repeating the configuration of previous years routine marches at the end of the year aimed at hampering the negotiations for the minimum wage with the government which by legal obligation must be convened in this period limits on union capacity stem from the low rate of unionization they represent only 4 of the total number of employees this has its origin in part in reactionary employment legislation and also in the criminalization of union resistance in terms of internal structure this fragility in the capacity for social negotiation refers to the isolation resulting from a form of vertical and authoritarian organization this in terms of operation implies agreements at the top between bureaucratized union leaderships left parties and the non partisan social left in addition their platforms of action are limited to the most immediate demands everything suggested a routine demonstration however in the weeks leading up to 21 november the social tensions that have arisen in recent months in neighbourhoods universities the informal sector and the unemployed started to converge towards this deadline international news has contributed to this at the same time the ecuadorian indigenous movement was in the midst of attempting to impose an adjustment plan and in chile a country emblematic of latin american neoliberalism pointed to as an example by technocrats a gigantic social explosion erupted which is still keeping the piñera government at bay thus the contagion effect encouraged the desperate of one of the most unequal countries in the region the announcement of greater sacrifices imposed on an increasingly impoverished population reinforced the movement of indignation provoked by the routine of the daily assassinations of social leaders without anyone being found responsible for them and the corruption practiced by politicians and big crony tycoons in order to share the public wealth all this in the context of a justice system muzzled by the powerful and which obeys the principle of impunity for them for this reason 21 november became a massive mobilization incorporating large sections of the population who took to the streets to protest against the multiple forms of oppression produced by the established order and the cynicism of its political representatives for the first time in decades the streets of the country s major cities saw millions of people parade despite government blackmail despite curfew proclamations despite selective searches before the demonstrations in short despite the classic threats of state terrorism the mobilizations of november 21 had the nocturnal sound support of cacelorazos casserole concerts in the neighbourhoods a complicit noise of declarations and proclamations read in the street thus confirming the enormous social legitimacy of the strike the following days the marches and cacelorazos continued in the streets the districts and in the squares accompanied by the presence of musical and theatrical groups a show of collective joy combat and street art on sunday 8 december some 300 000 people attended the strike concerts in various places in central bogota in which youth orchestras took part in order to show solidarity with the demonstrators when the organizers asked for authorizations to hold the artistic day the town hall offered them the simón bolívar park a place in the city that allows the concentration of thousands of people designed for this type of spectacle but the organizers rejected the offer by taking over the city streets with fixed scenes or others installed on trucks it was a question of prolonging the joy throughout the public space they said they thus confirmed that there is a popular feeling of re appropriation of public space a feeling accompanied by the conviction that the time has come to abandon the fear that has condemned us for decades to be excluded from it a feeling of reappropriation which is expressed in daily conversations by this symbolic formula this country is not the same after 21 november the failure of the government s internal security policy traditionally the main justification of the elites for making social resistance illegal was to present the opponents as collaborators of the guerrillas thus utilising the internal civil war which started around the middle of the 20th century any protests by the people were considered to be linked to the guerrillas which served as a pretext to apply emergency legislation to arrest and prosecute leaders in court negotiations with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc concluded in august 2016 prevented this argument from being used any longer opening up new perspectives for the popular movement these negotiations did not focus on the transition to democratic reforms which represented the aspirations of democratic parties organizations or figures who have supported the proposal for a political solution to the conflict for several decades the peace agreement was rejected in a referendum on 2 october 2016 by a right wing political alliance led by uribismo named after álvaro uribe president from 2002 to 2010 currently a senator which brought together the conservative party the majority of the catholic church and the preachers of the evangelical churches this refusal forced new negotiations between the parties with the presence of uribismo reducing the content of the agreements which passing through the congressional filter were subjected to additional restrictions the final version of these agreements envisaged a system of justice truth and reparation represented by the jurisdicción especial para la paz special justice for peace jep responsible for all judicial and non judicial measures to remedy the heavy legacy of human rights abuses in a society emerging from armed conflict or a dictatorial regime and the truth commission in the case of the jep the treatment of those who financed the war businessmen and large landowners was so benevolent that appearing before this judicial body was voluntary likewise the chain of command test that is the responsibility of the principals of both parties was ignored and in the case of responsibilities for human rights violations committed by members of the armed forces the possibility appeared of an amnesty by means of a legal device called renunciation to state action the economic agenda also did not indicate structural reforms given that the farc was a guerrilla group with a peasant tradition and that they were present in the so called colonato zones the peasants work land which does not belong to them but to which they are bound and for which they have to pay a rent under various forms to the owner and are taxed by the state the land issue was at the heart of this negotiation however the agreement did not include measures effectively calling into question the concentration of land in the hands of large landowners which had been reinforced during the war both by dispossession of peasants and by recycling and money laundering this meant the de facto ownership of seven million hectares was recognized to the big landowners in the colonato areas where the farc was historically present as for the creation of a land fund composed of three million hectares supposed to be distributed to the poor peasants of the country it has so far been unfulfilled another point in the deal was the state s commitment to invest in marginalized and conflict affected regions but the government also ignored this under the pretext of the current budget crisis as if that were not enough 170 demobilized farc members were killed inside the camps in which they are concentrated as provided for in the agreements after having surrendered their weapons despite these limitations in the design and implementation of the agreements themselves uribismo has tried to dilute their content even more the democratic centre party to which the current president iván duque belongs presented to the jep a series of objections to the peace agreement providing for the characterisation as special peace districts of 16 regions particularly affected by the armed conflict with a large number of individual or collective victims the goal to put a stop to the recognition procedure with regard to public order the current government implemented a policy designed according to obsolete internal enemy hypotheses it appointed general nicacio martínez as head of the army the latter had been recognized by the attorney general s office as responsible for extrajudicial executions in the caribbean region departments of guajira and cesar in 2006 when he was the second commander and chief of staff of the brigade located in this region once appointed martínez reintroduced into army protocols the guidelines that led to the widespread use of extrajudicial killings which was denounced by the new york times which obtained information from official sources of murders and arrests of so called suspects in this context the former farc guerrilla dimas torres was murdered in the municipality of convención region of catatumbo located in the northeast of the country he was arrested by soldiers while defenceless this assassination had the particularity of being known and having been denounced by the inhabitants of the locality which forced general diego luis villegas commander of the special forces of this region to publicly ask for forgiveness and to repeat this before the peace commission of the congress subsequently in early november 2019 during a parliamentary debate the public learned of the tragic result of the bombing of a so called dissident farc camp perpetrated at the end of august in san vicente del caguán in the department of caquetá which killed 18 people it became clear that the army had been informed before the bombing of the presence of children in the targeted area the brigade command had been officially informed by the representative of the public prosecutor in this municipality for months the military hid what really happened during the bombing the debate led to the resignation of the then minister of defence guillermo botero these tensions within the army and between the parliamentary factions of the government confirm the existence of a fissure within the elites between uribismo which defends the policy of internal security and those who supported former president santos in political negotiations with the farc in havana the latter believe that the army must adapt to the post conflict and gain legitimacy this is why they also demand the implementation of the agreements in their final version and have formed a political bloc called defenders of peace this bloc leads campaigns across the country that has been joined by all non uribist parties including the left and human rights movements they played an active role in the formation of alliances during the last regional elections which took place on 27 october and in which the candidates of the democratic centre were beaten in the chief towns of the provinces beyond these inter elite contradictions the erosion of the government which pursues the warmongering option is obvious popular rejection of the incessant assassination of social and environmental leaders and members of ethnic communities in peripheral regions is finding growing resonance in the cities the case of the children killed in the bombing of caquetá aroused collective indignation and found massive resonance during the mobilization on 21 november on this day of national mobilization the people had to face another form of state terror the esmad escuadron movil antidisturbios anti riot brigades a police force specializing in the suppression of demonstrations created in 2007 under the second uribe government these brigades are responsible for the deaths of several people and numerous arrests and beatings in the midst of a social explosion like the one we are currently experiencing this arbitrary behaviour has sparked an even greater rejection on 23 november in downtown bogota a member of this riot brigade seriously injured an 18 year old high school student dilan cruz shooting him at point blank range dilan died a few days later in a city hospital becoming a symbol of the current resistance on 11 december members of the same squadron using an unmarked car attempted to kidnap two students who were taking part in a rally outside the buildings of the national university a bystander alerted by the cries of the young people started to record the scene got into his vehicle and followed the ghost car until he was forced to stop he forced the occupants to identify themselves many demonstrators were beaten and brought to justice others like in chile lost an eye faced with these despicable acts one of the central and unifying demands of the strike as well as of the democratic movement as a whole is the dissolution of esmad which this time failed to put an end to mobilizations in the streets the economic package the current international economic crisis has highlighted the fragility of the extractive financial model in latin america the sharp fall in international commodity prices during the period 2013 2017 led to trade and budget deficits in the countries of the region leading to an increase in public and private debt under these conditions and as happens in peripheral economies in times of decline foreign direct investment fdi has decreased this downturn is directly linked to the fall in investments in the extractive sectors which are becoming less profitable and in that of portfolio investments because the risk premium increases causing capital flight like a self closing vicious circle the reduction in foreign investment produces a monetary devaluation and an increase in debt which by the standards of the macroeconomy of neoliberal domination leads to adjustment plans whose purpose is to contract demand but the people tired of enduring the constant deterioration of their living conditions rose up to reject them the october mobilizations in ecuador and chile are a demonstration of this those in colombia are part of the same discontent with neoliberal adjustments a few weeks before the strike the duque government presented to congress a proposal for tax reform in line with a policy which since the beginning of the implementation of neoliberalism in the early 1990s has increased tax exemptions on big capital while transferring most of the tax burden to the middle and poor layers this in a country which since 2000 has had to undergo 13 tax reforms of this type one every eighteen months and in a country where the concentration of wealth is one of the highest in the region the government added to this proposal a reform of the employment code which aims to introduce more flexibility to the point of establishing hourly contracts and wages a pension reform favourable to private pension funds on the recommendation of the oecd the creation of a state financial holding company which would centralize all the resources of the public financial sector in order to position itself as a competitor on the financial market the demands of transnational capital to stabilize an economy in crisis after the fall in the price of oil the main export explain the package proposed by the government colombia has a deficit exceeding 4 of gdp which increased considerably from 2013 with the fall in the international price of oil as well as the fall in fdi during the 2013 2017 period there was a sharp drop in international oil prices and as a result oil exports fell by 60 4 and fdi in this sector decreased by 41 3 despite the partial recovery in world oil prices in recent years the deficit continues to grow as does the reduction in fdi which has precipitated short term capital flight statistically represented in the decline in portfolio investments in this recessive scenario the devaluation of the currency has reached one of the highest levels of the international average with the exchange rate against the us dollar now at 3 500 pesos as against 1 800 in 2014 bringing with it the growth of foreign debt particularly serious in the case of public debt which is already reaching 51 of gdp with the aggravating circumstance that the country is subject to legislation imposed by the imf according to which the payment of interest is a priority in the establishment and execution of annual budgets according to neoliberal ideology economic adjustment would be inevitable therefore while protesters on the streets are calling for a fairer society the president and the parliamentary majority continue to introduce draft bills into congress that are demanded by transnational capital which highlights the divide between people and institutions as well as the narrowness of a representative democracy based on political clienteles business lobbies and secret negotiations like neoliberalism in colombia and south america in general we are witnessing not only the crisis of neoliberalism as an economic model based on dispossession but also the crisis of its forms of political representation the challenges posed by the new political situation since 21 november the country has seen the emergence of a pluralist movement involving workers residents of neighbourhoods the middle classes crushed by taxes and banking usury in the cities in this social convergence it is necessary to underline the role of the youth movements which asserted themselves in the confrontation to demand rights and to make explicit their distancing from a war which does not concern them anymore these expressions of youth have a history in the university resistance movements of a few years ago in 2011 the national students council mesa nacional estudiantil succeeded thanks to a very broad mobilization in defeating a university reform project promoted by the government of juan manuel santos and last year another movement of the same kind managed to obtain additional budgetary resources compared to those planned by the current government but today the range of youth engagement is much broader it includes the presence of young people who do not have access to university or those who having obtained a degree cannot find a job it also includes students from private universities forced to go into debt the same applies to those who in technical and vocational high schools have received offers of precarious employment contracts before the end of their studies as well as for young people who because of their poverty cannot complete secondary studies and do not have access to privatized health services and cannot aspire to a minimum of comfort in their life as has happened in other parts of the world with similar social movements this youth movement spontaneously takes to the streets to protest using social networks with the aim of denouncing the consequences of neoliberalism but without knowing its causes these young people reject the institutions and parties of the establishment but neither do they feel represented by the left parties or by traditional popular organizations this youth movement does not accept vertical decisions or authoritarian directions it seeks to democratize decisions which gives a lot of strength to its actions at the same time the movement expresses a broad ideological pluralism amidst the depoliticization to which neoliberalism has condemned them hence also their weakness within this ideological plurality it is necessary to underline two questions which highlight the crisis of civilization to which contemporary capitalism has condemned us that of the destruction of nature and that of the preservation of patriarchal society strongly contested by young female university students and employees the plural social movement which supported the demonstrations of 21 november could not establish a balance of forces allowing it to envisage institutional ruptures such as the resignation of the president or the convening of a constituent assembly as in chile however during its short existence it has already achieved the following objectives overcoming state terror which for decades has considered the actions of popular organizations to be illegal by enforcing the state of emergency and equating protesters with appendages of guerrilla warfare refocusing social resistance in the cities both by the way it started and by the themes it offers in its platform of demands strengthening a human rights movement that denounces the recurrent assassinations of social leaders and demands a democratic policy guaranteeing the definitive end of the armed conflict putting social inequality at the centre of the national political debate as an expression of the crisis that neoliberalism is going through on the international scale the national strike directorate which called the demonstration on 21 november maintains dialogue with the government but the sectors of the population which act spontaneously or which belong to an enormous diversity of social organizations do not submit to this organization however they are dispersed and do not have the capacity to become a different political option for the moment coordination is taking place in neighbourhood assemblies a territorial form of direct democracy that responds to the dispossession caused by neoliberal town planning described as urban extractivism these neighbourhood assemblies can become superior expressions of democracy if they manage to centralize and articulate with nationwide movements that resist government policies this will obviously depend on the continuation of the strike in the first weeks of 2020 which seems possible under the current circumstances and on the challenges that confrontation with the government poses to the movement the battle for a political alternative will continue but in a new context there is an urgent need for unitary coordination between those of us who are convinced of the need to preserve an anti capitalist strategy footnotes the human rights department of the central unitaria de trabajadores cut union federation estimates that 3 000 of its activists have been killed since the mid 1980s the levels of land concentration in the country are very high 1 of large rural owners monopolize 60 of cultivable land while two and a half million peasant families live on the rest of the land during alvaro uribe s second term in 2008 it emerged that members of the armed forces had killed defenceless civilians by posing as victims in combat see el jefe del ejército de colombia dirigió una brigada acusada de matar a civiles el país 5 june 2019 this was one of the most notorious military scandals under the first government of alvaro uribe in order to obtain salary bonuses or compensatory rest days according to the manuals recognized by the ministry of defence taken in their turn from the manuals of the us army members of the army arbitrarily arrested poor young people at the outskirts of cities including some with disabilities then they would take them to conflict zones don guerrilla uniforms and shoot them down in order to obtain the promised compensation the number of executions according to social and human rights organizations could reach 10 000 this is called the compulsory primary surplus before payment of debt service not only in the conception of public budgets but also in the formulation of development plans and public policies about 60 000 graduates apply every six months to the national university the country s largest public university only 7 000 of them are admitted youth unemployment has reached levels of around 22 according to official statistics and methods these movements which are trying to emerge from the social marginality to which they have been subjected by neoliberalism have been characterized as movements of emerging citizenships the term is employed because the spatial reorganization of cities by big real estate and financial capital in search of rents leads to the expulsion of populations just as in the territories where the exploitation of hydrocarbons and minerals takes place this is why it has been called urban extractivism

following is the address by former prime minister ranil wickremesinghe at the fourth edition of the huddle organised by the hindu on 23 february at itc gardenia hotel bangalore india starting with the mohenjo dara harappa civilisation over four millennia ago trade and commerce have played a decisive role in the integration of the indian sub continent and south east asia the mauryan empire became a catalyst for promoting regional trade buddhism removed the restriction on sea travel though kingdoms rose and fell trade remained consistent political alliances were made and broken on the basis of trade in the ninth century the pallavas came to an agreement with the anuradhapura kingdom in sri lankan and the sumatran sri vijaya empire to control trading in the bay of bengal this was challenged by their commercial rivals the chola who defeated the pallavas the sri lankans and finally sri vijaya with the traders travelled the missionaries taking with them the cultures languages and religions of the indian sub continent including hinduism buddhism and jainism during the time of the buddha tapassu and bhallika the first trader converts to buddhism carried the message of the new faith to sri lanka kaundinya a brahman commenced the indianisation of the funan kingdom formed around the mekong river in southeast asia former prime minister ranil wickremesinghe addressing the the huddle the proliferation of culture alongside trade led to the creation of robust networks a good example of that was the multinational network of the nattukottai chettiars which spanned sri lanka myanmar thailand malaysia singapore and south vietnam until the mid 20th century they had over 1 500 businesses in myanmar before world war ii the integrated financial network of the nattukottai chettiars has yet to be matched in the asean and the bimstec countries the total geographical extent of this region was never clearly defined the south and the south east asia are social constructs of recent origin invented mainly by uk and usa for instance the world war ii allies created the south east asia command comprising myanmar malaysia singapore indonesia and thailand to better conduct the war in asia south asia and regional groupings the term south asia was first used by the us state department in 1950 to refer to former british colonies in the indian sub continent thus arose the political construction of two regional groups which now dominates and perhaps divides the bay of bengal region the request for regional groupings in the region have emerged from time to time sixty years ago the leaders of india pakistan sri lanka myanmar and indonesia met in april 1954 for the colombo powers meeting to discuss cooperation within their common region within the indian sub continent an initiative for a regional grouping was first taken up by president ziaur rahman of bangladesh in december 1977 i remember questioning president jayewardene as to whether the proposed association will be a success if we can get india and pakistan to the table keep them talking and avoid a war that will be sufficient he replied finally the heads of the seven governments of the sub continent countries met in dhaka in 1985 and formed saarc south asian association for regional cooperation from this arose the south asia preferential trade agreement in 1995 followed by the south asia free trade agreement in 2006 however you will agree with me that neither of these agreements has resulted in a meaningful degree of economic integration with an intra regional trade amounting to only 5 of the total trade today both agreements have been unsuccessful in promoting trade in 1997 india and thailand took the initiative to form bimstec the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation the first summit was held only in 2004 and subsequent summits held intermittently bimstec has neither a clear vision nor actionable goals it took 10 years after the first summit to establish the bimstec secretariat which is still underfunded the bimstec trade record on economic integration is also insignificant an agreement in 2004 to conclude an fta by 2006 is still pending on the other hand south east asia started a slow but successful march towards regional integration starting with asean the association of south east asian nations the asean free trade area was established in 1992 the ultimate goal is an asean economic community thereafter the broader constellation of the asia pacific economic community apec was formed in 1989 consisting of 21 member economies including asean china japan republic of korea australia usa canada mexico and chile to promote multilateralism and trade integration in the asia pacific the first asia pacific trade agreement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership one of the most transformational trade agreements with inter locking commitments was signed by 11 of the asia pacific countries ratification by singapore japan vietnam australia new zealand and mexico has now activated the cpapp the most recent agreement is the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep an asian dominated trade agreement that brings together asean the three east asian nations as well as australia and new zealand though shallower than cpatpp it enables china to join the non american members of the cpatpp in a trade integration scheme as a result of these successive agreements tariffs have fallen substantially and remain low services in many sectors have been liberalised and market access conditions substantially improved however overarching all these groupings is the belt and road initiative bri which the hsbc has referred to as globalisation s next chapter as you know this china centric multilateral globalisation framework promotes both physical and economic connectivity and thereby significantly increases the economic presence of the chinese current large scale infrastructure projects funded under bri in the south asian region include there ports and the three economic corridors which connect china with pakistan with nepal and with myanmar the bri projects in our region will thus recast regional connectivity while giving china access to the indian ocean via gwadar and kyaukphyu ports parallel to the bri are the chinese free trade agreements expanding chinese economic partnerships beyond the rcep today the asia pacific is the largest economically integrated region in the world a series of trade agreements covering four continents forms its integration architecture these cover australia new zealand the whole of east asia other than north korea and the entirety of the america pacific coast excluding the usa the bri can be seen as dovetailing into the rcep what remains is for the usa to join the cpatpp which is likely to happen within a decade these agreements also affect us in the subcontinent for example the cpatt reduced tariff on apparel export between members in particular tariff reductions on items such as male trousers hs 620342 and brassieres hs621210 may lead to exporters like sri lanka and bangladesh losing their staple markets in canada australia and japan to vietnam a fellow member of cpatt south asia remains the least economically assimilated region in asia unfortunately for us south asia remains the least economically assimilated region in asia and it faces a dilemma to be connected or to be left out of these new and expanding asia pacific configurations of productivity and trade effective integration in trade and security within our region gives us the members the ability to determine our architecture for the next few decades as an integrated regional grouping we will have the strength to negotiate agreements favourable to us with the rcep and other trade groupings we were the first to gain independence during the first phase of british de colonisation this combined with our strategic location in the subcontinent enabled our nations to punch above our weight in the global fora yet today we are at the risk of being left out of this productivity network no doubt individual nations can bargain for admission to rcep but becoming an appendage in that forum will mean the loss of voice and weight in this region moreover our region will also lose its identity and the leading position amongst the indian ocean nations the consequences for india will be even greater a loss of prestige and predominance especially if bimstec and saarc loses its economic importance and therefore its political relevance if india loses its clout in this region then it will be a critical setback to its aspirations for a global role therefore all of us require an outcome which enables us to control our destiny consequently regional economic and security integration continues to be the best option inertia towards regional integration as noted earlier our two regional groupings have hitherto made no headway the postponement of the kathmandu saarc summit in 2017 due to heightened indo pakistan tension has brought saarc to a standstill but saarc s stagnation is not entirely due to the uri terrorist attack there have been similar periods of acrimonious relations between members previously and these were not confined to india and pakistan i believe that the core issue holding us back from a regional grouping is the inertia towards regional integration we wish for trade agreements based solely on reducing tariff rates without the required economic restructuring this is an outlook starting from the bombay plan prepared by eight leading industrialists in pre independent india in 1944 the plan was based on the premise that indigenous industries could not compete in a free market and required government intervention hence the development of a supportive government economic bureaucracy but nearly 80 years later indian companies themselves have proved this to be a false premise by their ability to compete both in the domestic and export markets these inward looking theories and political stances have led to south asia has less than 1 of the net worth of the world s total production of exports while south east asia has 8 you will agree that 1 is a figure that is not sufficient to sustain south asian economic growth the growth in our countries are driven by domestic demand therefore our imports far outstrip our exports leading to increasing trade deficits it is doubtful as to whether this scenario is sustainable in a highly competitive world more to the point an energetic growth scenario is required if the 150 million young people entering the job market in the region by 2030 are to be found employment therefore in the medium term we need to transit into export led growth to galvanise regional economic development and dynamism it is worthwhile noting that imf reports estimate a productivity boost of 20 over 20 years for india if it accelerates structural reforms including the elimination of trade and investments barrier in such a scenario the spill over effect in bangladesh and sri lanka will possibly see gdp increases by 3 furthermore the total region would contribute 35 to global growth by 2040 at least three recent reports by multilateral agencies have dealt exhaustively with the subject of integrating regional economies and making them competitive these are i south asia ready for take off imf ii a glass half full the promise of regional trade in south asia world bank and iii exports wanted world bank as noted earlier saarc is deadlocked while bimstec is not a substitute for saarc it is nevertheless a starting point for integration furthermore it has immense untapped potential by 2030 the entire bimstec population will exceed 1 7 billion at present bimstec has 3 7 of global trade the current intra regional trade is 40 billion according to the report reinvigorating bimstec by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry it is estimated that the actual trade potential of regional integration by bimstec countries could be 250 billion bimstec also has the added advantage of being a bridge to asean unlike asean the bimstec countries of bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailand are asymmetrical to one another no doubt this could be construed as a hurdle to integration the population the land area and the gdp of india exceeds the combined equivalent of the other countries many times over furthermore economic unevenness between members prevent the uniform restructuring that is required for genuine economic reintegration therefore if regional integration is to succeed in bimstec the initial effort should be confined to a core group of nations which have complementary economies india sri lanka bangladesh and thailand which have a combined gdp of us 3 5 trillion having a deeper assimilation will not be disadvantageous to india in 2018 india had a surplus of us 9 billion in the trading transactions with the other three partners therefore a four pronged economic integration road map eirm is proposed below to accelerate this integration four pronged economic integration road map first it is imperative that the four countries come to grips with economic structural reforms traditionally our countries have been averse to competition in south asia the indexes for tariff and non tariff barriers on imports are two to nine times higher than for imports from the rest of the world even the average of cost of trade within south asia is much higher than the corresponding figure for asean and naft amcta therefore any successful regional trade integration has to address the issues of para tariffs and non tariff barriers when our government came into power in 2015 sri lanka had over 6 000 tariffs line effected by para tariff by 2018 we had eliminated over 2 000 such tariff lines similarly one third of the south asian inter regional trade is governed by a sensitive list which has to be reduced drastically other pertinent issues to be addressed include those relating to rules of origin and the norms of value addition anti dumping rules and countervailing measures for subsidies and common national regulations the removal of tariffs is a more complex process needing the examination of adjustment costs vs efficiency costs in some sectors domestic stakeholders will require time for adjustment a series of trade adjustment programmes must provide technical and financial assistance for any affected enterprises these sectors can be held up until the end while trade creating sectors and complementary sectors can be given priority to begin with second e commerce exceeds 10 of retail sales in many countries yet it was below 2 in our region commercial internet transactions have been identified as a fast growing sector in the world bank s unleashing e commerce for south asian integration a three stage regional strategy it is a vital part of this initial road map so as to utilise its potential for regional integration third it may also be important to conceptualise an economic sub region consisting of the five southern indian states and sri lanka which has a population of 300 million people and a combined gdp of over 500 billion more than sweden an economic sub region including a broad band corridor will optimise the complementarities accelerating regional economic integration kerala is building a new port near trivandrum an adb funded feasibility study is proposing a further expansion of the colombo port with an extension to the north that can make it the largest trans shipment port in the region an offshore financial centre is also planned for colombo therefore the proposed sub region will be attractive for shipping logistics offshore finance it and for maximising on the opportunities of the global value chain a similar sub region is currently being planned between india and bangladesh coronavirus has highlighted the need for a second workshops of the world these two economic sub regions together with thailand are ideally suited for this purpose bangalore as an it centre will also enable the transition to the 4th industrial revolution the fourth leg of the four pronged eirm is tourism a sector which can animate the integration process the bay of bengal is the largest bay in the world dotted with famous cities and scenic beaches including the andaman islands and phuket cruise tourism catering to millions of the emerging asian middle classes is a new commercial opening for the region the bay of bengal has the potential to rival both the caribbean and the mediterranean of course the implementation of the bay of bengal cruise tourism will require detailed planning financing and efficient coordination in addition to bimstec members maldives malaysia and singapore are other cruise destinations that must be invited to join such an initiative this eirm must be i market driven and ii able to provide a deeper integration than the rcep i would suggest that the negotiations for such an agreement be concluded in two years if not the talks should be abandoned a signal in that we have failed if we are to succeed a mechanism with the apex body meeting bi annually should be instituted with the mandate of preparing the eirm the apex body should consist of the heads of governments of the four participating countries the secretary general of bimstec and the high level head of eirm task force consisting of special representatives appointed by member governments this apex mechanism will need to have a sunset clause leading to the dismantling of the mechanism on a specified date by then provisions will be made for a new permanent mechanism in charge of the eirm once the eirm agreements are signed it should then allow for other members of bimstec and saarc to become signatories to the agreements expanding regional connectivity is a pre requisite for the success of the eirm conversely it is anticipated that the enactment of eirm would accelerate and cement the networks of regional connectivity clearly the pressing need for regional cooperation and connectivity cannot be met by one single country or one single institution we must also take note of the other connectivity enterprises in the region in addition to the chinese belt and road initiative india herself has undertaken two ambitious connectivity projects as you know the kaladan multimodal transport project and the india myanmar thailand trilateral highway japan s quality infrastructure investment qii partnership has also funded a number of projects including i the east west economic corridor ii the thilawa and dawei special economic zone iii the bay of bengal industrial growth belt iv the delhi mumbai and chennai bangalore industrial corridors v the mumbai ahmadabad high speed rail vi the colombo port development the asian development bank has also taken the initiative with the 10 year south asia sub regional economic cooperation programme for infrastructure which is anticipated to a strengthen multimodal cross border transport networks b improve trade facilitation and c enhance electricity trading however it must be recognised that the present bimstec secretariat is too bureaucratic understaffed and not equipped for monitoring this type of undertakings therefore the secretariat will have to be restructured and upgraded with the head of the secretariat being equivalent to ministerial level the secretariat could then be in a position to coordinate and fast track the connectivity plans and projects within bimstec asian security there is no doubt that asia s huge appetite for connectivity and related infrastructure merges with the critical issue of asian security this has resulted in the polarisation of two conceptualisations of security strategies for the asian region one is centred on bri china s asia for asians strategy and the pla far sea forces concept is based on a network of partnerships which is poised to tilt the balance of power in asia the usa and its allies have responded to this with the indo pacific and the quad in an attempt to safeguard the existing balance of power consequently today the asia pacific has to contend somewhat paradoxically with a security architecture linked to usa and an economic architecture involving china unlike the asia pacific whose security structure has been based on military alliances our region has avoided such alliances consequently the security structure of the asia pacific cannot be duplicated in the indian ocean moreover there are difference of opinion as to the exact definition and demarcation of the indo pacific the us concept of the indo pacific extend only up to the west coast of the indian sub continent in contrast our countries stand by the iora definition of the indian ocean and envisage an indo pacific starting from east africa to the pacific coast of the americas when it comes to security a major source of concern to the littoral states of the indian ocean is the increasing presence of naval ships belonging to outside stakeholders the sea lines of communication in the indian ocean the lifelines of global commerce must be open for peaceful use the indian prime minister narendra modi is advocating an open and inclusive indo pacific sri lanka has taken the initiative in promoting a code of conduct on the freedom of navigation in the indian ocean based on unclos the united nations convention on the law of the sea we have also proposed the need to formulate an enforcement machinery these proposals include the safeguarding of undersea cables a lifeline as vital as the sea lanes the first 1 5 diplomatic track meeting was held in colombo on 11 october 2018 on the whole there is a need to avoid security polarisation within our region security cooperation need to be based on agreed threats within the region rather than political posturing the mounting multi dimensional regional trade arising from economic integration should not be thwarted by war or other security disruptions consequently terrorism piracy human smuggling narcotics and the presence of non state actors are recognised as regional threats and have become the basis for security cooperation in the region progress has already been made on security coordination in the bay of bengal bimstec members have agreed to cooperate on the bimstec convention on cooperation in combating international terrorism transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking and have established a joint working group however to become effective bimstec members must overcome their indifferences and ratify the convention in addition to the convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters maritime security has also been added to the agenda of the bimstec national security chiefs annual meetings india has also hosted the first bimstec military exercise on boosting inter operationality amongst intranational forces to contain terrorism another security initiative the trilateral maritime security cooperation between india sri lanka and maldives provide joint cooperation in patrolling the exclusive economic zone and combating piracy the bay of bengal littoral states have also participated in the milan naval exercises hosted by the indian navy the biennial indian ocean naval symposium and the annual galle dialogue also provide opportunities for navy chiefs of bimstec and saarc littoral states to discuss maritime security threats at least the building blocks for regional security in bimstec are falling in to place saarc and successful regional integration of course successful regional integration both economic and security is dependent on saarc becoming fully functional at the highest levels yet irrespective of the saarc summits official and ministerial discussions take place the people to people contacts are strong funding is received meetings of the saarc non governmental organisations are held regularly the secretariat carries on its work and a new secretary general from sri lanka will assume office soon nevertheless saarc is not fully functional and will not be so until the summit meetings are held moreover the indo pakistan tensions have led to our region being identified as a possible site for nuclear conflict this itself indicates the urgent necessity to restore normalcy hence the indo pakistan disputes affecting the saarc though a bilateral issue need to be resolved by the two countries at a level which permits the summits to take place this also requires solutions to the underlying issues of terrorism including cross border terrorism here we must reflect on how economic integration in the asia and pacific has acted as a disincentive for conflict the outstanding issues are still retained within the present architectures available for example our region should follow a similar approach only regional integration both economic and security leading to a linkage with the existing asia pacific network will enable us to create rapid economic growth to escape the middle income trap and lead us to prosperity this will also make us the first economically integrated region in the indian ocean hence we will be able to take leadership in promoting trade integration in the indian ocean and ensure security of the sea lines of communications in conclusion then let us be bold in conceptualising one vast global productivity and connectivity network from east africa to the shores of the pacific region of the americas we have the possibility of becoming the fourth global trading bloc and increasing our voice and weight in the global fora we must not miss it
lucky trump looking smug sydney and kuala lumpur feb 25 2020 ips meeting the president of the republic of korea in september 2019 president donald j trump bragged that the us economy is the envy of the world trump reiterated such claims in his state of the union address in early february hailing his own policies with typical humility trump touted us economic success at the davos world economic forum in january as nothing short of spectacular asserting i m proud to declare the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before facts hardly matter to the contrary us economic growth slowed after trump started the trade war with china dropping from 3 5 in the second quarter of 2018 to 2 1 in the last quarter of 2019 much less than the 5 5 per annum peak in the second quarter of 2014 during the obama presidency meanwhile annual growth declined from 2 9 in 2018 to 2 3 in 2019 growth in trump s first three years was well below the clinton era 1993 2000 average around 4 the highest for any presidency in the last half century although growth was even higher at times in earlier years obama inherited a recession following the global financial crisis from september 2008 with the deepest post war contraction when real gdp fell by about 4 p a in the second quarter of 2009 the us economy then turned around by the end of that year while us growth peaked under obama at almost 4 p a in the first quarter of 2015 trump s peak in the last three years was around 3 p a in mid 2018 making america great again the united nations the international monetary fund imf and the world bank all expect the us economy to continue slowing to 1 7 1 8 annually in 2020 2021 us manufacturing growth slowed to its lowest level in almost a decade in august 2019 as the purchasing managers index pmi signalled contraction for the first time since september 2009 meanwhile with its agricultural sector experiencing higher levels of farm debt the number of us farm bankruptcies grew by a fifth in 2019 from 498 in 2018 to 595 despite the government s us 28 billion bailout for farmers double the 2009 bailout of its big three automobile producers the us congressional research service doubts that the supply side incentive effects of trump s tax cuts and jobs act mainly benefiting the wealthiest 10 of americans will be as significant as he claims much of the funds released by the tax cut have been used for a record breaking spree of stock buybacks worth more than us 1 trillion in the first quarter of 2019 augmented by easy money policies in december 2019 the imf noted that global growth recorded its weakest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago despite monetary policy easing all round meanwhile slower global growth has been increasingly blamed everywhere on the us china trade war hence while trump s attempts to make america great again have largely failed to lift us growth they have been harming the rest of the world election economics president trump kicked off his 2020 re election campaign at an orlando florida rally in june 2019 with his characteristic modesty claiming that the us economy under his watch was perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country to enhance his appeal trump has successfully pressured the us federal reserve to keep monetary policy and credit conditions easy however the funds have not gone into productive investments but instead to portfolio investments mergers acquisitions and share buybacks transferring more wealth and income to the rich trump has also been repeatedly promising more tax cuts ostensibly for the middle class his economic advisor larry kudlow told fox news that trump wants to give the middle class a 10 tax cut in september weeks before the polls meanwhile trump has claimed victory and struck a less aggressive tone on international trade conflicts declaring the end of hostilities with china in january after concluding the us mexico canada agreement usmca with some minor largely cosmetic changes to the preceding north american free trade agreement nafta but he has also turned on europe threatening at davos to levy huge tariffs on european car imports this was followed by another threat from treasury secretary steven mnuchin to punish european countries that have the audacity to tax american digital firms the art of the ordeal trump commerce secretary wilbur ross s blatant schadenfreude over the coronavirus outbreak that it could boost us jobs is telling the coronavirus pandemic has shut down chinese businesses and ports as efforts to contain the pandemic wreck china s manufacturing supply chains under the us china phase one trade deal china will increase imports of us farm goods by us 32 billion over two years enhancing his appeal to the us rural farm vote so if anything goes wrong trump can always blame china or the pandemic for any shortfalls while heroically claiming to be protecting the us from a new chinese threat meanwhile trump seems likely to ratchet up his rhetoric against europe s farmers to mitigate the economic impacts of the trade conflicts and the coronavirus outbreak other countries including china are further easing monetary policy the us fed can thus more easily remain dovish at least until november ensuring more buoyant equity markets and helping trump s re election prospects the donald has much reason to grin again

pandemic investors sold riskier assets and rushed to traditionally safer bets such as gold and u s treasuries after countries including iran italy and south korea reported a rise in virus cases over the weekend even as china eased curbs with no new cases reported in beijing and other cities the benchmark s p 500 index and the blue chip dow turned negative for the year to date and the dow dropped

yields fell to their lowest levels since 2016 as investors sought safety in government bonds while the yield curve inversion between the 3 month and 10 year u s treasuries deepened in what is often viewed as a recession predictor adding to worries goldman sachs slashed its u s growth forecast on sunday and predicted a more severe impact from the epidemic the cboe volatility index a gauge of investor anxiety registered its biggest one day jump since february 2018 and ended the day at 25 03 its highest closing level since january 2019 there was this underlying concern that was out there and obviously over the weekend it just escalated said stacey gilbert portfolio manager for derivatives at glenmede investment management in philadelphia wall street s three main indexes had notched record highs last week partly on optimism that the global economy supported by central banks would be able to snap back after short term weakness related to the virus the s p 500 fell below its 50 day moving average and the dow slipped below its 100 day moving average all closely watched technical indicators health insurers such as unitedhealth group inc and cigna corp dropped almost 8 after senator bernie sanders who backs the elimination of private health insurance strengthened his position for the democratic presidential nomination with a victory in the nevada caucuses janney montgomery scott s luschini said that while the coronavirus was by far and away the primary influence for the market s decline on monday investors he said were also beginning to handicap the odds of

coronavirus cases reported in italy south korea and iran the head of the world health organization said that using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear we must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told reporters in geneva adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large scale deaths concerns over the hit to economic growth and uncertainty over the stress to supply chains triggered selling in stocks and other high risk assets it is not as though the numbers have changed dramatically but what has changed is the geography which adds a new level of concern said art hogan chief market strategist at national securities in new york what the market is trying to predict here is how large will this get globally and when will it start to peak the pan european ftseurofirst 300 index lost 3 76 with milan s stock market down over 5 after a spike in cases of the virus left six dead in italy and parts of the country s industrial north in virtual lockdown msci s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2 92 its biggest single day decline since june 24 2016 emerging market stocks

infections last week said it had confirmed 61 cases and 12 deaths with most cases in the holy city of qom kuwait bahrain oman afghanistan and iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases all in people who had been to iran the idea that the coronavirus has been fully contained has been firmly banished said chris beauchamp chief market analyst at ig this means the economic forecasts of the impact such as they are will need to be revised with a greater impact now to be expected surge to safety u s fed fund futures signaled more rate cuts later this year and a near 20 chance of a cut next month benchmark 10 year notes last rose 30 32 in price to yield 1 3705 from 1 47 late on friday the 30 year bond touched a record low yield of 1 811 in currency markets the japanese yen strengthened 0

markets when you look at the yen when you look at the swissie when you look at rates it is risk off it s probably reflective to a certain degree of the market being a little too sanguine up until now

global markets tanked as with the covid 19 arriving on europe s doorstep it has magnified investors attention to the single most significant global risk of the virus crisis the fear of clustering cases outside of china risk off sentiment intensified monday as the s p500 is down around 2½ heading into the close with european equities falling almost 4 and smaller losses through asia as covid 19 mushrooms from an asia centric concern to a global nightmare us 10y yields fell a further 9bps to 1 38 the lowest since july 2016 while 30 year yields set another record low of 1 84 having fallen 20bps in the past week oil is down more than 4 and copper fell 1 5 even as the number of new cases in china is declining and the who indicates that the virus there has peaked the market has reacted to growing evidence of spreading infections outside china notably italy iran and korea the risk off tone overnight has seen the us2s10s curve at its flattest since october and as the interest rate and growth differentials continue to support capital flows into the us and absent a more dovish fed these tenacious structural trends are showing little signs of abating as global investors seek safe harbor under the umbrella of us bond yields creating a supercharged usd dollar however its the dollar strength that the fed might not be able even if willing to tolerate as the strong usd both tightens financial conditions and depresses oil and commodity prices sufficiently enough for the fed to miss their inflation targets the irony here for gold investors is that a weaker dollar could lessen the chances of a fed rate cut there has been very little data flow do divert attention away from the coronavirus still fed speak both hawk and dove didn t sound off any rate cut alarm bells as cleveland fed s loretta mester voter hawk and minneapolis fed s neel kashkari voter dove both advocated policy prudence the who director general called the outbreaks deeply concerning though he also noted that the who was encouraged by the continued decline in cases in china even as the market focusses on recent outbreaks outside china chinese activities are starting to recover if the chinese labor force activities recover quickly then pboc stimulus effort will start paying dividends via ramped up domestic production admittedly with many unknows surrounding the impact but there are a few knows china is coming back on the grid while governments and global central banks aren t about to let this insidious virus snatch defeat from the jaws of victory oil markets with the virus arriving in europe it has magnified the oil market s attention to the single most colossal risk of the virus crisis the fear of a super spreader outside of china this appears to have materialized over the weekend with a considerable number of cases reported in south korea and italy and using china as a template the most immediate economic impact is likely to be aggressive containment measures and travel bans so similarly to the primary containment measures in china traders went into sell first ask questions later mode for fear of more evidence that the outbreak is spreading in europe or even to the united states from a technical perspective the so called opec straddle implied price bottom between 50 50 25 is holding as the thought of a move below 50 makes a more massive opec production cut response more likely wti continues to respect his level but with thoughts of disease x keeping investors awake at night china teapot refinery activities need to come roaring back with a vengeance and with china workers appearing abler and willing to come back online it could go a long way to stabilizing regional risk sentiment gold markets on the back of a colossal position build over the past week gold investors found themselves a bit too far over their skies and absent a decisive shift in fed speak the markets insatiable demand for gold has temporarily abated as profit taking has set in from a technical perspective after yesterday s launchpad on the back of a massive parabolic rally the failure to break 1700 was a touch disappointing and likely caused some technical unwinds however the afternoon gold liquidation could be related to equity margin calls rather than any underlying market weakness given the overtly risk off tone dominating the markets the steep declines in stocks may have triggered the need to meet margin requirements by some investors and necessitate the sale of liquid assets such as gold so if this is indeed the case once these margin obligations are covered gold could rebound a touch but with a possible recentring of risk on a more favorable asia centric theme the rate of infection in china has eased demand for hedges may not be as robust today currency markets asia fx the turning point for the asia fx remains less clear as global risk aversion comes to the fore as covid19 cases are getting reported abroad redoubling the global fear factor in this environment foreign investors have gone cold on riskier assets in favor of the umbrella of us treasuries which is creating usd demand as investors favor the usd over more china sensitivity asia currency growth proxies until we see a significant increase in people going back to work in china and the pboc stimulus paying dividends via ramped up domestic production asia fx could languish the malaysian ringgit political uncertainty on the back of pm mahathir resignation and as the power struggle intensifies leaves the government in a state of gridlock at a time when policy inputs are most needed to ward off the economic tumult from a protracted usd china trade war and the double whammy effect from the coronavirus the australian dollar fx markets look to be moving from asia is the epicenter of covid and with the lights starting to flicker across china s industrial heartland decent support is beginning to build around audus 6600 as asia key currency barometer the yuan remains on an even keel on anticipation of the ramp up in production the euro better pmis out of europe at the end of last week helped to put a stop to the eur s slide though in an environment where the usd still looks to be the safe haven of choice it may be hard for the eur to recoup too much ground germany s ifo index saw both current conditions and business expectations improve slightly in february despite market expectations of a modest decline with the coronavirus spreading in europe immediate eurusd weakness may not be a foregone conclusion on the back of the virus crisis the primary driver of recent euro weakness has been carry trade related funding if the virus were to spread across europe the negative growth impact could be offset by an unwind of carry trades amidst risk aversion what s more a severe economic impact is likely to see a more significant monetary policy response from the fed rather than the ecb given available monetary policy space the swiss franc the european outbreak of the virus should make the swiss franc an even more popular safe haven it is the only european currency with a negative beta to growth as the snb appears resigned to staying on the sidelines funding carry trades in francs has been far less prevalent than in euros or yen the japanese yen an epic debate is raging behind the scenes over whether or not we are witnessing a regime shift usdjpy is it or isn t it losing its safe haven status but overnight the jpy was clearly a safe haven bet as the focus has shifted from china to europe jpy loses its haven appeal when the exogenic shock comes from china but not from global risk aversion with virus fear spreading in europe the jpy should in theory also benefit from the squeeze on its funding shorts
as of 2016 the average black american family had total wealth of 17 600â about one tenth the wealth of the average white american family which stands at 171 000 exhibit 1 this gap leaves many black families at a significant economic disadvantage with less financial security and less ability to fully participate in the economy less wealth also means black americans are underrepresented in the market for financial products and services 1 a lack of access to financial services is not just a symptom of the racial wealth gap it is also a cause without the ability to affordably save invest and insure themselves against risks many black families struggle to translate the income they earn into wealth as international monetary fund deputy managing director mitsuhiro furusawa stated â financial inclusion is the bridge between economic opportunity and outcomesâ exhibit 2 2 but building that bridge has not been easy black families have faced the compounding effects of decades of exclusionary policies and programs that have contributed to the racial wealth gapâ exhibit 3 this article explores the ways in which the lack of financial inclusion contributes to and perpetuates the racial wealth gap it also identifies how greater access to financial services could be central in closing the gap 3 fundamentally improving financial inclusion would help address historical challenges and better equip black families for today exclusionary policies and strategies from limited access to federal mortgage lending to geographic barriers to physical bank branches have hindered black economic well being for example nearly half of black households are unbanked or underbanked exhibit 4 â a disparity that over the course of a financial lifetime can cost nearly 40 000 in fees 4 disparities such as these have tangible and far reaching implications for black families improving financial inclusion is not only our collective societal obligation to support american families that have too often been historically marginalized but also a critical step in supporting the future economic livelihoods of black families moreover increased inclusion of black americans in the financial system would benefit the entire economy black families would have greater opportunities to reinvest and grow their wealth and subsequently support increased economic activity the inclusion of black families in the financial system would also create new opportunities for financial services companies our research shows that financial institutions could realize approximately 2 billion in incremental additional annual revenue if black americans had the same access to financial products as white americans if black americans reached full parity in terms of wealth with white americans financial services companies could realize up to 60 billion in additional revenue from black customers each year as the world evolves financial services companies should view financial inclusion of black americans as a critical business imperative in a time of severe economic inequality companies that lead the way in creating solutions for black communities have an opportunity to build an enduring legacy that is aligned with consumer demand indeed 64 percent of americans say that a companyâ s primary purpose should be making the world better and by 2043 the majority of americans will be people of color poc in addition our present moment represents a meaningful opportunity to counter decades of exclusionary practices and rebuild trust with black communities doing so could improve the competitiveness of financial services firms and accelerate financial inclusion for black families the five pieces of the financial inclusion puzzle the world bank defines financial inclusion as the condition when â individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needsâ transactions payments savings credit and insuranceâ delivered in a responsible and sustainable way â many public and private institutions across the globe are actively championing greater financial inclusion in marginalized communities these institutions include nonprofits such as prosperity now and accion private institutions such as jpmorgan chaseâ s financial solutions lab and advancing black pathways program and nongovernmental efforts such as the world bankâ s financial inclusion global initiative building on their efforts and drawing on the experiences of black families in the united states we have identified five key aspects of financial inclusion exhibit 5 a household with full access to the financial system should be able to make everyday transactions through a safe and affordable transaction account have access to credit hold insurance against key risks be able to save for big goals or rainy days and ultimately accumulate long term wealth while many families take these elements of financial inclusion for granted black families face more difficulties gaining access to the whole â puzzle â 5 the potential impact of greater inclusion two scenarios scenario 1 equal access unequal wealth this scenario assumes the same penetration of financial products across black and white households but with no change in the average revenue per product realized from black households today in other words there would be no disparity in access between black and white families even if there was a disparity in revenue per product given that the income and wealth of the average black family today is less than that of white families estimating the additional value black households would bring the financial sector in such a scenario requires knowing two key data points for each product in the financial inclusion puzzle the first data point is average revenue per black household for each product in dollars in 2016 per mckinseyâ s global banking pools research the second data point is the number of potential new black customer households for each product were we to close the racial gaps in access this calculation is based on the total number of black households in the united states about 18 million multiplied by the difference between the percentage of white and black households that currently have access to a given product for example if the percentage of black households with a bank account matched the rate among white households the analysis estimates that approximately 2 4 million more black households would be banked based on the average revenue per product and the additional black households that would use a product in the access parity scenario the analysis identifies a total of approximately 2 billion in annual revenue to financial institutions if black customers had access to financial products at the same rates as white customers banks could realize this additional revenue in the short term were they to bring more black customers into the foldâ but it is also important to take a longer term view that is because financial inclusion would not just mean more black families with bank accounts home loans mutual funds or discretionary pensions in the short term but it also would enable these black families to build wealth year over year and generation over generation as the capital that black customers contribute to the financial system increases these black households the financial institutions that support them and the economy as a whole would continue to benefit hence we considered an alternative longer view method of the potential value of achieving financial inclusion for black families scenario 2 total parity in this longer term scenario we calculate the additional value black households would generate in the financial sector were there no disparity between the average revenue generated per white household about 6 200 and the average per black household currently less than half as much approximately 3 000 in this scenario the same percentage of black households would access each financial product as white households currently doâ but we further assume that black households would contribute the same revenue per product as white households as a proxy for imagining a world where black individuals and white individuals have the same amount of wealth in such a world the full financial inclusion of black americans would generate about 60 billion in additional annual revenue in the financial sectorâ almost 30 times more than in scenario 1 these numbers suggest that the first steps might be small ones to ensure more black households are able to fully access the financial system across the full range of products and services available moreover relieving the racial wealth gap could also bring meaningful financial benefits to black families and the financial institutions that serve them to size the potential impact of greater inclusion we calculated the additional annual revenue under two different scenarios that financial institutions would realize if racial disparities in access to financial products and services were mitigated by providing black customers access to financial products at the same rates as white customers an equal access unequal wealth scenario financial institutions could realize approximately 2 billion in annual incremental revenue further if there was no disparity in the average revenue per household between black and white customers a total parity scenario which has been largely driven by differences in wealth and income the full financial inclusion of black americans would generate about 60 billion in additional annual revenue in the financial sector see sidebar â the potential impact of greater inclusion two scenariosâ what exclusion looks like today financial exclusion has intergenerational consequences decades of financial exclusion created real challenges in black familiesâ ability to sustainably build and grow wealth moreover modern day financial disparities such as the approximately 45 percent of black individuals who report experiencing racial discrimination when trying to rent an apartment or buy a home compared with 5 percent of white americans continue to make economic mobility and wealth building more difficult for black americans to bring this reality to life we want to imagine the experiences of two hypothetical familiesâ richard and jennifer smith a white couple with a six year old daughter who live in portland oregon and scott and carla morgan a black couple with a six year old daughter who live in jackson mississippi the smith family earns 61 200 per year the median annual income for a white family in the united states and has accumulated 171 000 in wealth the median wealth for a white family the morgan family earns 35 400 per year the median income for a black family in the united states and has accumulated 17 600 in wealth the median wealth for a black family as these families journey across each stage of the financial inclusion puzzleâ making everyday transactions through a safe and affordable transaction account having access to credit holding insurance against key risks being able to save for big goals or rainy days and accumulating long term wealthâ a clear view of how financial exclusion amplifies and reinforces inequality emerges making everyday transactions even mundane experiences such as depositing and accessing monthly paychecks diverge sharply for the two families richard and jennifer smith both have traditional checking and savings accounts at banks located in their neighborhood and their paychecks are deposited directly meanwhile carla morgan receives her check by direct deposit and scott morgan receives his check via mail given the limited availability of banks in his neighborhood he cashes his check at a storefront service which charges him a 3 percent feeâ high but at least he knows what the fee is every month the morgans pay approximately 40 in bank fees and penalties for using atms or for falling under the minimum required balance on their joint monthly income of 2 600 by contrast the smiths who earn an average monthly income of nearly 4 500 pay nothing to access their paychecks would you like to learn more about our public sector practice the morgans like 30 percent of black households are underbanked one reason is that basic checking and savings accounts are harder for black consumers to open and more expensive for them to maintain in majority white counties there are 41 banks per 100 000 people compared with just 27 in majority poc neighborhoods and when black families do gain access they often pay more than their white counterparts banks in black neighborhoods require customers to deposit an average of 60 percent of their paychecks to avoid fees or account closures compared with just 28 percent in white neighborhoodsâ a consequence of both higher bank fees and lower incomes as a result many black households rely on alternative financial services such as check cashing services payday loans money orders and prepaid credit cards all of which typically charge high fees over the course of a financial life those fees can add up to an estimated 40 000 these obstacles and the distrust they engender make even the simplest transactions a challenge for black families accessing credit lack of access to credit has far reaching consequences for the financial lives of black americans car ownership for example is essential in many communities for getting to work and holding a job but it is more expensive for the financially excluded in their visit to the showroom the smiths were offered a straightforward loan at prevailing rates yet when the morgans went car shopping with a comparable credit rating they were offered a higher cost loan that added several thousand dollars in additional costs over the life of the loan in fact poc car shoppers who are more qualified than their white counterparts are 62 5 percent more likely to be offered costlier pricing optionsâ adding up to 2 662 in extra fees and interest over the life of the loan loans are generally harder to obtain and more expensive for black americans who are twice as likely to be denied credit compared with white americans making it harder for them to weather financial challenges holding insurance there is also a large disparity in the types of insurance products that are more readily accessible to black and white americans for example 73 percent of white families have private health insurance compared with just 57 percent of black americans black families are also overrepresented in states that have less expansive medicaid policies forcing them to purchase expensiveâ and often inadequateâ individual healthcare policies this reality has material ramifications for the smith family and the morgan family when both daughters go to the emergency room for a broken arm the smiths have health insurance through jenniferâ s employer that covers their daughterâ s medical costs minus a co pay of 200â their only out of pocket expense the morgans donâ t have employer provided insurance since they just miss the federal poverty level cutoff for medicaid they purchased insurance through the private market there they found a plan with a 4 000 deductible which they have not yet met the out of pocket bill for their daughterâ s broken arm comes to 2 500 which is almost equal to their joint monthly income planning for big goals or rainy days a cushion of readily available liquid assets is an essential part of a healthy financial plan itâ s what allows families to pay for college save for retirement or weather unexpected financial events black families are less likely to have such a cushionâ leaving them in a more precarious situation exhibit 6 approximately 70 percent of black familiesâ financial portfolios are in illiquid assets such as property compared with 54 percent for white families while the average white family has 31 days of liquid savings on hand black families have only five days 6 one key financial goal for the smith and morgan families is saving for a comfortable retirement the smiths can put aside money for retirement each month their retirement account holds 77 000 the median for white families who own accounts the morgans meanwhile have only accumulated 24 600 in their retirement accountâ the median for black families who own retirement accounts despite these disadvantages the morgan family is lucky to be among the 34 percent of black families who have a retirement account at all compared with 60 percent of white families accumulating long term wealth historically buying a home has been a key step in building family wealth while homeownership is not the silver bullet solution for all families in all contexts homes can appreciate over time significantly add to net worth and become an important means of wealth transfer for the next generation black americans however face significant barriers to home ownership they have been denied loans at much higher rates than white americansâ 28 percent and 11 percent respectivelyâ and are offered higher cost loans compared with white borrowers with similar credit scores for borrowers with fico scores above 660 21 percent of black individuals typically end up with a higher risk higher priced mortgage compared with 6 percent of white borrowers itâ s important to note that while homeownership could significantly narrow the racial wealth gap it alone would not close it among nonhomeowners white households have an average of 31 times more wealth than black households with 3 775 compared with 120 respectively homeownership takes that multiple down to 2 4 at 239 300 versus 99 840â but this is still an average wealth disparity of 140 000 these realities play out in the lived experiences of the smith and morgan families the smiths bought a 200 000 home the median value for a white familyâ s primary residence given their financial position and credit score of 680 they received a 3 5 percent interest rate on their loan the morgans had a different experience they found a house they loved for 124 000 the median value for a black owned primary residence but despite a credit score of 680 the same as the smithsâ they were given a subprime loan that carried an interest rate of 7 percentâ double what the smiths were paying in interest the compounding effects of these different financial experiences will likely have generational implications just 8 percent of black families leave inheritances to their children compared with 26 percent of white families richard and jennifer smith will likely be able to pass along wealth to their daughter at their death scott and carla morgan are less likely to do so what can be done to unlock the full financial inclusion puzzle for a plethora of engrained institutional and societal reasons black families like the morgans face challenges to financial inclusion at nearly every turn greater geographic isolation fewer products tailored to their economic realities explicit racial discrimination and bias and more that said meaningful changes and actions could be taken across the private public and social sectors to tangibly improve financial inclusion for black families the role of the private public and social sector financial inclusion will not be achieved unless the private public and social sectors commit to coordinated efforts leaders at banks and other private sector institutions can make an enormous difference simply by rooting out the geographic process and economic barriers at their institutions that make it more difficult for black families to gain full access to financial products and services the public sector in its role as policy maker regulator watchdog and developer of financial infrastructure could identify and support initiatives such as student loan reform black americans with bachelorâ s degrees who took out student loans hold nearly 4 400 more debt than the average american college graduate and innovative systems that support multidimensional credit scoring in addition the public sector could monitor and enforce equity in policies related to financial inclusionâ for example ensuring real estate agents do not discriminate against black families who wish to move into neighborhoods that are not comprised of majority black residents the social sector meanwhile can help identify and pilot innovative solutions that once proven could be brought to scale how cross sector solutions could address financial inclusion for black families given the breadth of challenges that work in tandem to create financial exclusion there is no magic bullet that will single handedly lead to financial inclusion rather specific and individual barriers that exclude black americans from the financial system must be broken down thoughtfully and sustainably we offer four potential coordinated efforts that the private public and social sectors could pursue to further financial inclusion 1 breaking down geographic and affordability challenges in financial inclusion geography matters bank branches tend to be scarcer and banking services more expensive in communities of color banks would be wise to re examine their geographic footprintsâ in terms of the location of branches as well as how they engage in the communities where they are present local partnerships such as prudential financialâ s investment in newark and jpmorgan chaseâ s investment in detroit for example could serve as models banking institutions can also adopt existing guidelines and standards for affordable banking such as allowing opening deposits of less than 25 giving free access to online and mobile services or limiting overdraft fees the federal deposit insurance corporationâ s model safe accounts or the cities for financial empowerment fundâ s bank on national account standards have set such examples social sector organizations can help by rigorously testing these interventions advocating for programs that work and piloting solutions that limit the influence of geography for example campaigns to connect black families to community development financial institutions the public sector can support policies that reward institutions that expand their presence in black communities the economic impact of closing the racial wealth gap new technologies could also further address geographic and affordability barriers for example digital banks such as n26 aspiration bank and chime increasingly offer customers flexible access to banking and investment services delivered digitally and with no or low fees such services could help meet the needs of black americans who have mobile or internet access and are currently underserved by traditional institutions the public sector can support these emerging solutions by creating a regulatory environment that enables responsible deployment of digitally enabled products and services 2 increasing diversity in the financial system increasing representation in financial services institutions is a critical step in creating the conditions that can lead to products that serve black families as well as reversing feelings of mistrust among black customers currently black americans are underrepresented 82 percent of loan officers are white and only 9 percent are black moreover black employees make up only 7 percent of director level roles in financial services institutions and only 2 percent at the executive level this lack of representation combined with historical precedent may send an implicit message that black americans are less valuable customers indeed almost one in three unbanked households cite distrust of banks as a reason for not having a bank account black perspectives must be at the table when new financial products and services are being created and when decisions about investments in specific communities are being made increasing racial diversityâ in the financial services sector and creating more equitable working environments for black employees could go a long way toward ensuring financial products are accessible for black families 3 exploring innovative inclusionary credit decisioning financial institutions could also embrace alternatives to conventional backward looking credit scoring that could expand access to credit for black customers for example start ups such as revolutioncredit combine big data with behavioral economics to predict a loan applicantâ s creditworthiness going forward this approach often benefits borrowers of color who are disproportionately likely to have had predatory first lending experiences that leave them with more challenging credit histories the lending circles program developed by the mission asset fund offers another example of a successful credit building innovation with members lending money to other members of the circle on a rotating basis loans are offered with no interest or fees and repayments are reported to credit bureaus to help participants strengthen their credit histories public private and social sector institutions could also take on bolder initiatives to serve black customers by creating consumer labs to study the preferences and needs of black communities using this fact base to inform product development marketing research and policy 4 alleviating financial pressure through supportive employee policies finally organizations across sectors can provide the benefits and services that employees need to make smarter financial decisions and to overcome short term financial stress short term fluctuations in income and expenses often have severe consequences for american families particularly for the 50 5 percent of black households that are liquid asset poor compared with 28 2 percent of white households although myriad programs and products in the market today support saving habits and income smoothing employers are particularly well positioned to support their employees in this one key example is early wage access or a policy allowing employees to receive their paychecks ahead of the typical two or four week cycle for a small fee walmartâ s partnership with even offers an example of this approach employers can further support inclusion by making sure that any financial advice or education offered through the workplace is explicitly paired with thoughtful services products and opportunities such as on site tax prep clinics and auto enrollment into programs to ensure employees fully benefit financial stress is a major cause of lost productivity at workâ thus greater employee financial security ultimately benefits employers too financial inclusion for black communities can lead to meaningful benefits for black americans the institutions that serve them and the economy as a whole the public private and social sectors all have roles to play and can work collectively to bring about concrete changes for black families the status quo perpetuates historical and current day inequalities that disproportionately affect black families it is our collective duty to work to make financial inclusion a reality and in so doing narrow the persistent wealth gap between black and white america
evening skyline in shanghai photo by adi constantin china s economy is often presented as a powerful engine this is however only one face of it it has also been marked by vulnerabilities and these have become more obvious over time as the costs of high speed growth have rebounded on the country giving rise to social tensions that are straining the capacity of the reigning communist party to contain them uneven development among regions has been one of legacies of the chinese road to capitalism with most of the benefits of growth being cornered by the eastern and southeastern coastal region that led the integration of china into the global economy while the growth of income disparities has slowed overtime it continues with the inland provinces particularly in northwestern and southwestern china lagging behind guangdong jiangsu and zhejiang the powerhouses of china s export led industrialization the inland provinces continue to supply cheap labor to china s gold coast where migrants endure legalized discrimination owing to the hukou residential system that prevents them from enjoying housing and social security benefits in the areas where they work overcapacity stalks industry china is meanwhile burdened with an overcapacity problem especially in heavy industry and many medium industries there has been significant overcapacity in the steel iron aluminum and automobile industries leading to practically flat prices and causing some analysts to say that china is now suffering from industrial deflation since china accounts for a great part of global production and trade in heavy goods its surpluses in these goods have brought down global prices contributing to global deflationary pressures overcapacity is a symptom of overproduction and overaccumulation and it is a product of the chinese way of capitalism specifically it is due to repression of domestic consumption and excessive investment repression of consumption was a policy dictated by the need to channel people s savings to the industrial export sector excessive investment stemmed from the decentralized economic strategy where local areas were given a great deal of autonomy in investment decisions many local authorities says ho fung hung perhaps the leading expert in china s overproduction act developmentally that is they pick industrial winners and act proactively to set these up at the local level the sum of these efforts however produces anarchic competition among localities resulting in uncoordinated construction of redundant production capacity and infrastructure as early as the 2000s in fact more than 75 percent of the country s industries were already suffering from overcapacity and fixed asset investment in industries already experiencing overinvestment accounted for 40 to 50 percent of china s gdp growth the situation however has worsened since then with state media admitting that 21 industries suffer from serious overcapacity including steel aluminum cement shipbuilding power generation heavy engineering solar panels wind turbines construction machinery chemicals textiles paper glass shipping and oil refining for instance since 2014 china has produced more than half of all the steel in the world but of the 1 1 billion tons of steel chinese factories were capable of making in 2015 only 70 percent was actually produced that year more than half of china s steel companies posted a loss and prices were driven so low that as one account observed steel was cheaper than cabbage as was the popular observation at the time to solve the overcapacity problem china has tried to shut down the less efficient enterprises and rationalize the remainder this is however easier said than done because officials are scared to death of provoking worker unrest since the ability to maintain social stability is one of the key justifications used by the communist party for its continued political dominance moreover shutting down enterprises may be demanded from the center but it is the local authorities that have to deal with the consequences and so the natural response of the latter is to resist the end result is that keeping zombies which are mainly state owned enterprises soes alive has been extremely costly overcapacity brings down prices bringing down profits throughout an industry indebtedness becomes a permanent condition so that one can speak of a permanent line of credit to banks which is never repaid calculations of the levels of debt of the public and private corporate sector in china are not easy to come by but china s companies went from owing 3 4 trillion to 12 5 trillion between 2007 and mid 2014 a faster buildup of debt than in any other country in modern times as a mckinsey report points out finance the economy s achilles heel massive indebtedness mainly to chinese state banks clearly poses a threat to the economy but china is no ordinary capitalist economy under normal capitalism when loans are nonperforming the banks come calling on the debtor and either collect or force them into bankruptcy but in china the fact that the state enterprises and the banks are all owned by the government places the day of reckoning far into the future as dinny mcmahon writes the real advantage of china s system of state ownership isn t that the cleanup is easier than in market economies it s that the clean up is easier to put off sure bank profits erode after all a big chunk of their loans aren t paying interest but otherwise no one has to take responsibility for mounting bad loans and most importantly deadbeat companies are kept alive but though put off indefinitely the day of reckoning will arrive and it has perhaps been advanced by the negative synergy between the mountain of debt owed by the soes and the other vulnerabilities of china s financial system a real estate bubble a roller coaster stock market and an uncontrolled shadow banking system there is no doubt that china is already in the midst of a real estate bubble as in the united states during the subprime mortgage bubble that culminated in the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 the real estate market has attracted too many wealthy and middle class speculators leading to a frenzy that has seen real estate prices climb sharply chinese real estate prices soared in so called tier 1 cities like beijing and shanghai from 2015 to 2017 pushing worried authorities there to take measures to pop the bubble major cities including beijing imposed various measures they increased down payment requirements tightened mortgage restrictions banned the resale of property for several years and limited the number of homes that people could buy however chinese authorities face a dilemma on the one hand workers complain that the bubble has placed owning and renting apartments beyond their reach thus fueling social instability on the other hand a sharp drop in real estate prices could bring down the rest of the chinese economy and given china s increasingly central role as a source of international demand the rest of the global economy along with it china s real estate sector accounts for an estimated 15 percent of gdp and 20 percent of the national demand for loans thus as pointed out by banking experts andrew sheng and ng chow soon any slowdown would adversely affect construction related industries along the entire supply chain including steel cement and other building materials the problem is not just a real estate market slowdown having a domino effect on the rest of the economy owing to reduced demand it is also that so many other industrial sectors are heavily invested in real estate because of reduced profitability in the real economy owing to overcapacity more and more manufacturing companies have started to subsidize their losses by investing in real estate or financial speculation financial repression keeping the interest rates on deposits low to subsidize china s powerful alliance of export industries and governments in the coastal provinces has been central in pushing investors into real estate speculation however growing uncertainties in that sector have caused many middle class and rich investors to seek higher returns in the country s poorly regulated stock market the unfortunate result a good many chinese have lost their fortunes as stock prices fluctuate wildly as early as 2001 wu jinglian widely regarded as one of the country s leading reform economists characterized the corruption ridden shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges as worse than a casino in which investors would inevitably lose money over the long run at the peak of the shanghai market in june 2015 a bloomberg analyst wrote that no other stock market has grown as much in dollar terms over a 12 month period noting that the previous year s gain was greater than the 5 trillion size of japan s entire stock market when the shanghai index plunged 40 percent later that summer chinese investors were hit with huge losses debt they still grapple with today many lost all their savings a significant personal tragedy and a looming national crisis in a country with such a poorly developed social security system another source of financial instability is the virtual monopoly on credit access held by export oriented industries state owned enterprises and the local governments of favored coastal regions with a significant part of the demand for credit from a multitude of private companies unmet by the official banking sector the void has been rapidly filled by so called shadow banks informal institutions of credit that are unregulated the shadow banking system in china is not yet as sophisticated as its counterparts on wall street and in london but it is getting there ballpark estimates of the trades carried out in china s shadow banking sector range from 10 trillion to more than 18 trillion in 2013 according to one of the more authoritative studies the scale of shadow banking risk assets i e assets marked by great volatility like stocks and real estate came to 53 percent of china s gdp that might appear small when compared with the global average of about 120 percent of gdp but the reality is that many of these shadow banking creditors have raised their capital by borrowing from the formal banking sector these loans are either registered on the books or hidden in special off balance sheet vehicles should a shadow banking crisis ensue it is estimated that up to half of the nonperforming loans of the shadow banking sector could be transferred to the formal banking sector thus undermining it as well in addition the shadow banking sector is heavily invested in real estate trusts thus a sharp drop in property valuations would immediately have a negative impact on the shadow banking sector creditors would be left running after bankrupt developers or holding massively depreciated real estate as collateral finance is the achilles heel of the chinese economy the negative synergy between an overheating real estate sector a volatile stock market and an uncontrolled shadow banking system could well be the cause of the next big crisis to hit the global economy rivaling the severity of the asian financial crisis of 1997 1998 and the global financial implosion of 2008 2009 environmental wasteland not surprisingly china s infrastructure intensive smoke stack industries dependent high speed growth has been accompanied by widespread and chronic environmental crises with perhaps the dangerous air pollution levels in beijing being the most widely discussed internationally water scarcity desertification deforestation soil erosion and degradation and soil and water contamination have all contributed to a greater concern about the environment especially among the middle class yet that same middle class is the source of much of the problem reliance on fossil fuels contributes significantly to air pollution and climate change prosperity has made china the world s biggest car market with the consequent rise in unhealthy levels of airborne pollution in the cities owing to its price competitiveness coal the dirtiest fossil fuel continues to be the fuel of choice for generating power accounting for 65 percent of electricity use apart from their massive negative impact on the environment and public health fossil fuel driven industrial processes have increasingly boomeranged on the economy economists have estimated that environmental degradation and pollution cost the chinese economy the equivalent of three to 10 percent of gdp owing to work days missed crops lost to pollution and contamination decline in tourism and other problems a recently published retrospective analysis by the chinese academy of sciences placed the figure higher at 13 5 percent of gdp in 2005 from relative equality to gross inequality china s breakneck capitalist growth relying on cheap labor has had two contradictory effects on the socioeconomic conditions of its people on the one hand people living in poverty declined from 88 percent in 1988 to two or three percent at present on the other hand it has converted china from one of the world s most egalitarian societies during the mao period to one of the world s most unequal societies research by branco milanovic one of the world s leading experts on inequality shows that in the period 1988 to 2008 income inequality in china rose far more rapidly than in any other region in the world estimates of china s gini index or gini coefficient the most commonly used measure of inequality range from 0 47 the government s estimate to 0 55 the government figure it has been pointed out would make china s income inequality substantially greater than is the case in all developed countries class related inequality has recently been joined by gender related inequality as a great source of concern ironically as china has become more prosperous the gap has increased between women s incomes and economic status and those of men with the headlong rush towards capitalism the earnings of women went down from 80 percent those of men at the start of the reform era to 67 percent in the cities and 56 percent in the countryside the drivers of this regression from the status of women during the mao period are a greying population and the demographic imbalance produced by the controversial one child policy when male children were favored over females resulting in widespread abortion and infanticide gender is now one of the most important factors determining income inequality in china perhaps more so than even the longstanding divide between the cities and the countryside what is alarming is that discrimination against women is now accepted if not promoted by the country s leadership mao famously told women that they held up half the sky and despite turmoil and the persistence of patriarchal traditions they entered the wor force in record numbers and began to enjoy greater rights now in a break with the marxist ambition of liberating women president xi has openly called on women to embrace their unique role in the family and shoulder the responsibilities of taking care of the old and young as well as educating children no party leader would have been caught saying something like this in the past but the breaking of the taboo apparently stems from the male party leadership s push to raise the birth rate owing to its obsession with china s looming demographic crisis china s rapid growth has produced prosperity and reduced poverty it has also generated less wholesome economic social and ecological consequences which are now catching up with it making the much vaunted chinese model increasingly less attractive for

president trump holds up a trump digs coal sign as he arrives to speak to a west virginia rally in august 2017 but he hasn t brought the coal industry back president trump and his economic advisors have been taking a rather premature victory lap about the nation s economic performance during his three years in office it s premature in part because trump s term isn t over yet and also because the economy hasn t performed nearly as well as he says even if one discounts a good portion of his rhetoric as bombast advertisement in his state of the union address earlier this month trump proclaimed the economy to be the best it has ever been no one s going to argue with the point that coal as a percentage of u s electricity generation is declining and will probably continue to decline for some time energy secretary dan brouillette in the foreword to the latest report from his council of economic advisors released thursday trump boasts of having championed policies to restore the united states economic strength including tax cuts deregulation energy independence and trade renegotiation advertisement the report itself however acknowledges that as of december the u s economic expansion had reached its 127th month meaning that it began 7 1 2 years before trump took office as for his assertion that his economy is the best in u s history the rationale for that claim is a mystery it s not true by any measure much of trump s economic rhetoric is aimed at the obama administration by asserting as he does in the latest white house economic report that he has reversed trends seen under the previous administration advertisement he may have been goaded by a tweet issued by obama on feb 17 marking the 11th anniversary of the american reinvestment and recovery act obama tweeted that the act had paved the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in american history with trump s tenure entering its fourth year evidence is mounting that the economic expansion under his leadership has left millions of americans behind the government s own statistics demonstrate that large sectors of the economy including those for which trump is making especially bold claims aren t performing well at all eleven years ago today near the bottom of the worst recession in generations i signed the recovery act paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in american history pic twitter com bmdxrxuauf barack obama barackobama february 17 2020 advertisement they include coal mining which appears to have become bound in an implacable doldrums since 2016 and manufacturing which entered a recession late last year and in which employment has at best stagnated as we ve reported before trump s campaign promise of driving the economy to a growth rate of more than 3 has receded into the mists of time the president s economic report projects real annual growth net of inflation of about 3 1 this year falling to about 2 8 toward the end of the decade but that s only with full implementation of trump s economic agenda of further business deregulation and an extension of the tax cuts enacted in december 2017 which were heavily tilted toward the wealthy barring that the economic team says annual growth could fall to just over 2 a year advertisement the stock market has been soaring but even the biggest gain in the standard poor s 500 of the trump years the 31 1 gain last year didn t match the best year under obama a 32 43 gain in 2013 the index never had a negative year during obama s eight years in office incorporating dividends but already has had one 2018 under trump after selloffs monday and tuesday both the s p 500 and the dow jones industrial average turned negative for 2020 it may be unfair to blame trump for the coronavirus driven selling but since he s been claiming largely undeserved credit for the market gains up to now he can take the blame too in any event the stock market is not the economy though it may from time to time put money in the pockets mostly of the affluent who earn as much as half their annual income from capital gains advertisement what s more telling is to examine how average workers have done under trump there the facts warrant even less braggadocio it s true that the economic expansion that started under obama following the 2008 09 recession has continued under trump but at the same pace or less than under his predecessor in terms of job growth under the circumstances it s proper to ask what trump s role in the expansion has been advertisement to begin with there are no signs that it has picked up steam quite the contrary according to the bureau of labor statistics trump has added an average of 181 000 jobs per month over his three years in office obama added an average of 224 000 per month in his last three years and 216 000 during his entire second term trump asserted in his state of the union address that his policies have been especially good for low wage workers who have seen a 16 pay increase since my election that s before inflation counting price increases it s 9 economist jared bernstein of the center on budget and policy priorities a former economic advisor to vice president joe biden agrees with trump that low income workers have seen larger gains than middle or high income workers advertisement but their incomes are still too low to make ends meet the same living wage calculator cited by bernstein which is produced by mit shows that in a household in los angeles with two working adults and two children each worker would have to earn 20 28 an hour full time to cover the family s typical living expenses of 84 352 that s a stretch for almost anyone outside the fields of law medicine or other top professions the mit survey indicates low wage and middle class americans remain caught in the same vise that has been squeezing them for decades your paycheck hasn t grown as much as it needs to says thea lee president of the labor oriented economic policy institute and everyone has seen a rise in costs part of the reason is an eroding public sector she says including a consistent defunding of public universities that transfers costs to families according to an analysis of census data done by the epi in conjunction with the journalism website capital and main the growth of real median household income has slowed nationwide under trump to the extent that low wage workers have experienced income growth lee notes much of that results from increases in the minimum wage enacted in several states and cities advertisement increasing the minimum wage is not a policy of which trump approves she says so that s not something president trump can take credit for meanwhile the trump administration has been moving to shoot holes in the economic safety net by pushing initiatives that would throw millions of households off the food stamp program and thousands off medicaid trump supports a lawsuit brought by texas to invalidate the affordable care act which would end premium subsidies for as many as 10 million americans and could leave those with pre existing medical conditions without access to health coverage as recently as tuesday the trump controlled national labor relations board significantly weakened the so called joint employer rule which had made franchise companies such as mcdonald s responsible for the workplace treatment of employees by franchisees advertisement by depriving those workers of bargaining rights with the parent companies according to the economic policy institute the change from an obama era rule could cost workers 1 3 billion annually the biggest doubts about the trump economy apply to his industrial policy trump promised during his election campaign to restore the coal industry s health throughout his term he has displayed hostility toward renewable energy sources such as wind last year he unveiled an amendment to the clean air act aiming to extend the life of coal fired power plants despite evidence that they re a danger to public health and contribute to climate change advertisement but the industry hasn t come back and there s reason to doubt it ever will u s coal mining employment fell to its lowest level ever in the fourth quarter of 2019 coal generation has been undercut by historically low prices for natural gas which burns cleaner anyway no one s going to argue with the point that coal as a percentage of u s electricity generation is declining and will probably continue to decline for some time energy secretary dan brouillette said this month it s worth noting that trump s focus on coal is a distraction in terms of the big economic picture the entire u s coal mining industry employed about 50 000 workers at the end of last year amazon com alone employs 10 times as many workers in the u s and walmart 30 times as many advertisement more worrisome is the slump in manufacturing another sector trump promised to support as my colleague don lee reported manufacturing entered a recession late last year layoff announcements surged during 2019 especially in states such as pennsylvania and michigan that would be crucial for trump s reelection manufacturing employment reached 12 851 000 in september but has largely stalled since then following a gain in november the sector lost 5 000 jobs in december and an additional 12 000 in january landing again at 12 851 000 according to preliminary government figures advertisement part of the problem is trump s trade war which has disrupted the supply chain for many american manufacturers despite trump s insistence that it s designed to protect american jobs farming has been another black hole in the trump economy farmers have been whipsawed by the trade war they ve been targeted for retaliatory tariffs by china which reduced its buying of american soybeans virtually to nothing as i reported in may farm prices are down bankruptcies are up farm equipment is getting more expensive and export markets are fading away trump announced last month that china would commit to stepping up its purchases of u s produce as part of his phase 1 trade deal but skepticism still abounds over whether or how soon china will make good on the pledge advertisement business column if trump thinks he can get more than 3 economic growth he s dreaming with the political world deeply focused on the question of whether the trump administration comprises a gang of russian pawns less attention has been devoted to more mundane questions such as what ever happened to trump s economic policy trump has tweeted about increasing subsidies to american farmers hurt by the trade war but the tweet caught his own agricultural officials by surprise that would be on top of 28 billion the government has already committed in aid to the farm sector most of which has gone to large agribusinesses not small farmers some of the most significant headwinds hampering economic growth may come from trump s own immigration policies which have choked off the flow of lower income workers who help keep the overall economy humming white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney acknowledged as much in a private meeting in england reported by the washington post we are desperate desperate for more people mulvaney said according to a recording of the meeting we are running out of people to fuel the economic growth that we ve had in our nation over the last four years we need more immigrants advertisement mulvaney specified that he meant immigrants who came to the u s legally but the administration has tightened standards for legal immigration as well as trying to stem the inflow of those coming illegally mulvaney s remarks underscored the essential disconnect between the administration s desire for economic growth and the constraints its ideologies have placed on growth taken together the numbers indicate that trump s policies have benefited the wealthy and large corporations but left the fortunes of the middle class and low income households behind his economy may be booming but it s not everyone s economic boom

this article is a preview from the spring 2020 edition of new humanist ann pettifor is a political economist whose work focuses on the global financial system international finance and sustainable development she is director of prime policy research in macroeconomics a network of economists that promotes keynes s monetary theory and policies and co founded jubilee 2000 the worldwide campaign for debt cancellation she is also a fellow of the new economics foundation her latest book is the case for the green new deal what is the green new deal we have raised the temperature of the planet by over producing and over consuming that involves burning fossil fuels to create all the goods and services we need the green new deal argues that we need public authority over the monetary system if we are to manage the economic system so that we can lower our emissions and protect the ecosystem to manage the outputs of oil coal and gas we must manage the input of credit this is done by pouring credit into the globalised markets and making it possible for people to borrow and then spend in production and consumption to manage emissions we must manage the flow of credit right now that is left to the invisible hand of unregulated market forces environmentalists typically say our concern is with trees water the landscape and with our natural system but it s wrong to think about emissions in isolation the ideas of the economist john maynard keynes pop up quite a bit in your book what can we learn from him keynes s view was that if you manage the financial system then the economic system will manage itself he was a capitalist who thought it was really important for the public authorities to manage the financial system in the same way that they look after say the public sanitation system these public systems are used collectively and so they must be regulated another figure you quote at length is the 32nd us president franklin d roosevelt who enacted the new deal in the 1930s the green new deal is modelled on roosevelt s work he was a remarkable figure when he came to power in the 1930s the economic conditions that prevailed were quite similar to what they are today there was a global financial system where the free market was deciding on matters like exchange rates the value of the currency the cost of borrowing and whether or not money should flow in and out of borders roosevelt argued that the united states had been in a deep depression and a deflationary period because the monetary system was effectively managed by wall street he began the process of dismantling the monetary system by demanding that interest rates and other important levers in the economy would no longer be decided by wall street this put the government in the driving seat of the economy roosevelt was also faced with a catastrophic ecological crisis during the dust bowl trees had to be planted and soil restored back to health there was a lot of investment in people and in the land during the new deal your book talks about the hegemony and imperialism of the us dollar globally what impact does the us dollar have on economics and geopolitics the power of the dollar is backed up by the military and economic power of the united states but the way that power is managed is devastating and harmful for the ecosystem and the planet by dollarising the entire global economy we are being subjected to what is good for the united states this means massive imbalances in the global economy particularly for countries in the global south this has led to political tensions that could eventually result in world war three so we can choose to go to war or we can choose to alter the system that causes these imbalances do global institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf do more harm than good the imf and the world bank have lost their way and no longer exist to bring prosperity to countries these global institutions act as agents for global capital markets and have become enforcers and policemen who act on behalf of the world s creditors those creditors can be countries corporate firms such as say the global investment management company blackrock or private individuals can individual countries effectively challenge global market forces if a country like britain wants to take back control then it needs to manage the flow of capital across its borders this would ensure that global capitalist markets don t get to decide what is the rate of interest for britain or what britain should be investing in or not if the flow of capital isn t controlled these choices tend to be made beyond the control of individual countries their governments and their representatives your book is tough on multinational corporations why are you so critical of them big corporations come and operate in the uk and then refuse to pay taxes they then take their profits and invest them in ireland or somewhere else where their tax rates are low they can do this because of capital mobility if we want the tax system to be fairer we have to manage the flow of capital across borders to apple amazon and other such corporations we need to be saying if you are making profits here in this country you must pay your taxes but governments cannot do that if these corporations have the power to move their money without any hindrance whatsoever so in a sense we are powerless against these too big to fail companies no we have the power to leverage our negotiation with them because these companies need assets that public institutions create global capitalist markets and institutions depend on governments to create credit because they need collateral a guarantee which they then use to create new cash we need to understand that we own assets or collateral that are absolutely essential to the global capitalist markets right wing populism is currently ascendent in many countries including the uk and the us what are the realistic chances of the green new deal being implemented it s a really tough time for greens progressives and people on the left we have been beaten by the right who are demanding protectionism authoritarianism is winning the argument because the left haven t made an alternative one it will take a crisis for the to shift but we are due an environmental financial and geopolitical crisis and when that happens the question will be what do we do to save the world the green new deal may seem utopian right now but it s a plan for how to deal with the crisis when it arrives so the authoritarian right are winning the anti globalisation argument we are seeing authoritarianism all around the world in the philippines russia turkey india and the united states where promise to protect their people from globalisation but they do it in a reactionary way they are not interested in protecting the people they want to protect their own interests the authoritarian response is undemocratic irrational counterproductive and ends up in conflict does the recent election result in the uk make it more or less likely that the green new deal will be implemented this tory government is highly opportunist and populist it will grab and run with any policy it thinks could reinforce its power so i wouldn t put it past them to pick up some elements of the green new deal but they will stop at doing anything that questions how the city of london operates how important are self sufficiency and localisation for the green new deal self sufficiency and localisation are incredibly important has gotten rich from imperialism by extracting the ecological assets of the poorest countries from the global south and we cannot do that any longer we are going to have to be more self sufficient currently here in britain we don t grow our own green beans we import them from kenya we drain kenya s water table in order to import our green beans they are flown from kenya to london so that we can have fresh green beans all year round for the future of our planet we need to live more sustainably so this is an anti globalisation argument yes it s definitely anti globalisation because globalisation means being beyond the reach of democratic governments which the global financial system is silicon valley can manage uber across the world almost beyond the reach of democratic governments bankers can move their money around pretty much without interference from governments too that is globalisation my argument is if you want to save the ecosystem you cannot continue with our present system

margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are measures not recognized under u s gaap and which exclude certain non cash and special items that may obscure trends and operating performance not indicative of the company s core financial activities management considers ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow to be key indicators of the company s operating performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the company s performance in addition similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in the company s financing arrangements and management uses these measures for developing internal budgets and forecasting purposes ebitda is defined as net income adjusted to reflect income tax expense interest expense net of interest income depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the company s core operating performance adjusted ebitda margin is adjusted ebitda presented as percentage of sales adjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the company s core operating performance adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and is useful to both management and investors in evaluating the company s ability to service and repay its debt when analyzing the company s operating performance investors should use ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow as supplements to and not as alternatives for net income operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with u s gaap and not as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company s results of operations as reported under u s gaap other companies may report ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow differently and therefore the company s results may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in addition in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income it should be noted that in the future the company may incur expenses similar to or in excess of the adjustments in the below presentation this presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income should not be construed as an inference that the company s future results will be unaffected by special items reconciliations of ebitda

in fed chair jerome powell s appearance before congress on february 11 formerly known as the humphrey hawkins testimony he asserted that the u s economy was in a very good place and there s nothing about this expansion that is unstable or unsustainable but compare powell s sophomoric declaration to what charlie munger vice chairman of berkshire hathaway nyse and warren buffett s longtime right hand man had to say about the market and the economy i think there are lots of troubles coming there s too much wretched excess mr powell s comments rival in ignorance with that of former fed chair bernanke s claim that the sub prime mortgage crisis was contained that is until the great recession wiped out 50 of stock valuations and over 30 of the real estate market and of course don t forget about fed chairs yellen and powell s contention that their quantitative tightening program would be like watching paint dry and run harmlessly in the background on autopilot at least that was their belief until the junk bond market disintegrated and stocks went into freefall in the fall of 2018 therefore it should not be a surprise at all that the fed doesn t recognize the greatest financial bubble in history the worldwide bond market mania perhaps this is because central banks created it in the first place and therefore didn t want to take ownership of it mr powell also averred this gem in his latest testimony low rates are not really a choice anymore they are a fact of reality credit must be given here for finally admitting the truth albeit what was probably a slip of the tongue the fed is tacitly stating that keeping money at a virtually free rate is now a mandatory condition for perpetuating asset bubbles and preventing mass defaults on the record breaking level of corporate debt running in debt case in point so how can hoping interest rates never rise back to normal be a condition that is either stable or sustainable jay powell must understand this is an untenable position to take and how stable can interest really be when the budget deficit for the first four months of fiscal 2020 has jumped to 389 2 billion that is an increase of 25 over last year the national debt is now an incredible 23 3 trillion it was just 9 1 trillion at the end of 2007 total household debt increased by 193 billion in q4 2019 and is now 14 15 trillion this marks 22 consecutive quarterly increases with total household debt now 1 5 trillion higher than 2007 that s the good news corporate debt has exploded by over 52 since the great recession and is at a record percentage of gdp total u s debt now stands at about 330 of gdp this ratio was 150 of the economy prior to severing the s tether to in 1971 and the total market capitalization of stocks as a percentage of gdp has soared by 50 percentage points since june 2007 another all time record high but what else would you expect when returns on cash are losing value when subtracting inflation the only way these debt and asset bubbles are manageable is if interest rates are artificially held down close to zero percent by central banks otherwise the economy will collapse and cause the gdp denominator in these ratios to plunge just as all of the debt in the numerator remains in other words these debt ratios which are already daunting will become absolutely nightmarish an economy that must lug along this tremendous debt burden encumbers its ability to grow the fed believes the only way to keep the credit markets open and the economy growing is by constantly lowering borrowing costs however it is now running out of room to lower interest rates it only has 1 5 before it returns to zero and most of the major central banks around the world are already at zero therefore without another round of massive fiscal stimulus like we saw with trump s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the prospects of continuing to hold a recession in abeyance much longer are dwindling by the day this is especially true given the appetite and ability to significantly cut taxes or increase spending while annual deficits are already north of 1 trillion 5 of gdp is greatly attenuated somehow mr powell finds solace in these scary facts he doesn t understand that this bond bubble is international and its bursting will wreak havoc across the globe for example the insolvent nation of greece which back in 2012 had its 10 year bond yielding a whopping 45 has now seen its benchmark yield retreat to an all time low of just 1 today in fact greece is now issuing 13 week debt with a negative yield this is especially concerning given that its debt gdp ratio has increased from 159 back in 2012 to 181 today mr powell should tremble while wondering what greek bond yields would yield if the ecb ended q e and stopped buying its debt he s unconcerned because the ecb boj and pboc are all caught in the same trammel of ensuring money is free forever i ll close with this piece of wisdom from robert kaplan president of the dallas fed in a paper he wrote about one year ago warning about the excesses in the corporate and government bond market an elevated level of corporate debt along with the high level of u s government debt is likely to mean that the u s economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically i would have graded mr kaplan s paper with a c for using the word likely instead of definitely when referring to the economy s addiction to low rates however ultimately he gets an f for not recognizing that it is in fact the fault of central bankers for getting caught in a trap of their own creation this is yet another admission by the fed that interest rates can never be allowed to increase our central bank has now announced it is on hold forever therefore it is not much longer before investors lose faith in fiat currencies maintaining their value and that is when the real crash will begin because a central can t fix an inflation problem by promising to create more inflation in the meantime each day that goes by the madness grows larger and the inevitable reconciliation process will become all the more severe michael pento is the president and founder of pento portfolio strategies produces the weekly podcast called the mid week reality check and author of the book the coming bond market collapse

senior analyst at swissquote bank said that brokerage continues to have a bearish bias on oil prices believe that traders should continue chasing top selling opportunity below the us 55 resistance targeting a retrace below the us 50 level due to the expectation that the divergence in supply and demand could widen and even additional production cuts from opec may not absorb the extra glut she

public health care education and gun laws are the hottest issues in the us election campaign but neither democratic nor republican hopefuls are eager to discuss the burning question of the country s financial future us president donald trump is not exactly known for being humble when it comes to describing his leadership credentials already in the run up to the 2016 elections that swept him to power the then republican candidate pledged to eliminate the 19 trillion 17 4 trillion of us debts within a period of eight years now almost four years later a look at trump s debt reduction record is sobering by all counts instead of lowering america s debt load figures recently released by the congressional budget office cbo show the upward trajectory of the country s financial problems since assuming office the trump administration has added a net total of 2 5 trillion in fresh debt with the us budget deficit in the first four months of 2020 alone rising by 25 this means that trump has already spent close to 40 of the entire deficit last year the primary reason for the budget gap is trump s 2017 package of tax cuts which he once described as a great christmas gift to the middle class with overall us debts spiraling to 22 5 trillion the cbo now has warned that such a high and rising debt load could pose a severe financial risk to the united states the nonpartisan agency has estimated that state spending could surpass revenue by 1 trillion in 2020 the us dollar is it as strong as it looks image picture alliance chromorange conspicuous silence surprisingly though neither the democrats nor the republicans have made this an issue in their campaigns for the us presidency trump didn t waste a word on the debt problem in his latest state of the union address and failed to chart out a clear reduction strategy all he came up with was the lofty promise of trimming state expenditure by 4 4 trillion over the next decade at the same time however trump plans to increase spending for the military the space industry and for the wall he wants to building along the border with mexico among the democratic hopefuls too the us s dire financial straits seem to be on the backburner of their campaigns in their first televised debate all of the candidates conspicuously ignored the debt issue with the ugly deficit word not being mentioned once in the 4 hour road show public debts were only once briefly touched upon costly promises political observers believe the democrats have many reasons to keep america s miserable finances flying under the radar during the presidential primaries the average american has no interest in us debt at all says g william hoagland senior vice president at the washington based think tank bipartisan policy center he told dw that the booming us economy of the past years including low interest rates and unemployment had americans feeling less worried about the mounting deficit so why should democrats address such a sensitive topic and stick their neck out for it he says and notes that most of the voters are satisfied overall with their current financial situation bloomberg steps into tough debate to view this video please enable javascript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports html5 video and indeed about 70 of americans consider maintaining the us s economic strength as their main priority in the us presidential election national pollster pew research center found in a survey carried out at the end of last year that is followed by issues such as education health costs and the fight against terrorism at the bottom of the list of priorities come climate change the military situation and not even half of the constituency is concerned about the deficit as a matter of fact democratic frontrunners can score political points more easily with social programs and their health care reform under the slogan medicare for all yet when it comes to discussing the 35 trillion price tag attached to the democrats 10 year reform proposal the party s left leaning hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders quickly fall silent according to the urban institute think tank financing the democratic programs would require more than is currently being spent on social welfare medicare and medicaid together a newly introduced wealth tax as proposed by warren would soften the financial impact stresses hoagland and adds but that makes it still the status quo no visions on the horizon nevertheless six of the 11 democratic hopefuls running for president appear at least to some extent willing to touch the hot potato issue of debt reduction as they ve announced to stabilize or even reduce america s debt to gdp quota none of them however has unveiled a plan about how to do that former obama administration vice president joe biden has vowed to tackle the deficit problem but at the same time wants to invest boldly in jobs and low income communities another contender for the democratic nomination michael bloomberg is running on the promise of greater financial responsibility and wants to boost investment while taxing the wealthiest americans more just as little has been heard from moderate democratic senator amy klobuchar who only plans to stabilize the debt quota and from moderate candidate pete buttigieg who wants to reduce the deficit without saying exactly how and yet buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana could be successful says hoagland who has advised a number of us senators on budget issues for the past 30 years buttigieg wouldn t scare away voters with demands for higher taxes he argues and at just 38 stands for a generation that could one day find itself having to repay america s huge debt burden trump biden und sanders their generation won t be around to worry anymore he told dw

and constant currency current remaining performance obligation growth rates collectively the non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap management uses both gaap and non gaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating the company s performance the primary purpose of using non gaap measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company s results in the same way management does management believes that supplementing gaap disclosure with non gaap disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company s operational performance and allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company s business further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non gaap measures the provision of supplemental non gaap information can allow for a comparison of the company s relative performance against other companies that also report non gaap operating results non gaap diluted earnings per share excludes to the extent applicable the impact of the following items stock based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company s convertible senior notes as well as income tax adjustments these items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but instead for the company s long term benefit over multiple periods specifically management is excluding the following items from its non gaap earnings per share as applicable for the periods presented in the q4 fy20 financial statements and for its non gaap estimates for q1 and fy21 stock based expenses the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period thus stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period amortization of purchased intangibles the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships and in some cases acquired lease intangibles as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non gaap measures management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation gains on strategic investments net upon the adoption of accounting standards update 2016 01 on february 1 2018 the company is required to record all fair value

held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses the company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its gaap and non gaap estimates for future periods income tax effects and adjustments the company utilizes a fixed long term projected non gaap tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition related costs since each of these can vary in size and frequency when projecting this long term rate the company evaluated a three year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non cash items stock based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles the projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three year period and considers other factors including the company s expected tax structure its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates for fiscal 2020 the company used a projected non gaap tax rate of 22 5 for fiscal 2021 the company uses a projected non gaap tax rate of 22 0 which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions the non gaap tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons including the rapidly evolving global tax environment significant changes in the company s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity or other changes to the company s strategy or business operations the company will re evaluate its long term rate as the rate as appropriate the company defines the non gaap measure free cash flow as gaap net cash provided

business tech michigan manufacturing sees ups and downs on trump s watch in 2016 donald trump ran on bringing back manufacturing jobs to rust belt states like michigan file in this sept 27 2018 file photo a united auto workers assemblyman works on a 2018 ford f 150 truck being assembled at the ford rouge assembly plant in dearborn mich carlos osorio file associated press in 2016 donald trump ran on bringing back manufacturing jobs to rust belt states like michigan which was one factor in his surprise wins in michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania and less surprising victory in neighboring ohio the results of that promise however have been quite muddled michigan is down 5 300 manufacturing jobs since trump took office in january 2017 although overall employment is up eighteen counties that swung from now former president obama in 2012 to trump in 2016 lost manufacturing jobs the heart of the slowdown has really been in manufacturing the global manufacturing sector is in a recession right now but the u s is doing a little better than everyone else aditya bhave vice president and global economist for bank of america merrill lynch global research said during a business leaders for michigan event in detroit in november recent months in michigan however have seen ups and downs for the manufacturing industry as steel companies have idled due to current market conditions all while the big 3 automakers in detroit general motors ford and fiat chrysler have launched multibillion dollar investment efforts here those conditions are combined with vast uncertainty from trade and tariff policies from the trump administration one big wildcard in the election is a brand new trade deal that netted overwhelming bipartisan support in congress trump last month signed the united states mexico canada agreement usmca although he only invited republicans to the signing ceremony irking democrats he came to macomb county auto supplier on jan 31 to celebrate the victory in his february state of the union address trump also touted the usmca saying that it would help with bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words made in the usa but despite widespread legislative support manufacturing experts note that the usmca is largely a replacement of the dated free trade deal the north american free trade agreement nafta the usmca s largest impact is ending a period of great uncertainty for manufacturers said kristin dziczek vice president of industry labor and economics at the center for automotive research car in ann arbor on the margin it will move some production to higher wage regions of north america to canada and the united states dziczek said there s some job impacts to that but because we re not going from no agreement to free trade the effects are pretty marginal trade tensions between the united states and china also appear to be cooling as both trump and china president xi jinping recently reaffirmed their support for the first phase of a new trade agreement according to a reuters report michigan impact it s hard to overstate the role of manufacturing in michigan and the economic impact it brings manufacturing makes up 19 of the state s gross domestic product gdp accounting for more than 96 billion in revenue and more than 14 of the state s workforce are employed in the manufacturing sector according to figures from the national association of manufacturers a washington d c based trade group while economists say that 2019 presented challenges and uncertainty for manufacturers and a whole host of other industries there s some evidence that things could be on the upswing a november forecast report from the university of michigan s research seminar in quantitative economics said that 2019 provided a tough test for michigan s economy we believe that after slogging through much of 2019 the report reads michigan will return to moderate but sustained expansion in 2020 and 2021 the report said the forecast predicts the state added 23 300 payroll jobs in 2019 and will add another 54 900 new jobs in 2020 and 2021 meanwhile the big 3 automakers have all been on a tear in the last year with multi billion dollar investments around metro detroit as they attempt to keep up with the demand for profitable trucks and suvs and prepare for a driverless future but while large tier 1 automakers continue to weather the storm albeit with generally lower earnings many of their suppliers and related industries are feeling an even stronger pinch and it s having a direct impact on the lives of working michigan residents shawn crowley 38 works at gerdau special steel in jackson the company announced last month it s laying off more than 100 employees although he s not one of them crowley said it s been a tough few years for he and a lot of workers in the steel industry you have to understand that foreign companies have been dumping steel here on the cheap for years the jackson resident said that put a lot of us at risk and then the whole tariff war comes in crowley said he s not optimistic that the administration will end the trade war anytime soon wages also have been kind of flat crowley told the advance which has made it hard to keep up with other living expenses like health insurance premium hikes nationally real wages in manufacturing slipped 2 4 last year people pay a lot of attention to the stock market but that s not the same thing as the economy he said people make millions and billions in quick money but they don t think about the people who have lost their jobs a lot of people in the country don t see that perspective crowley s company isn t the only one in the steel industry to be hit hard just before christmas u s steel a pittsburgh based giant announced that the company plans to indefinitely idle its facility in river rouge southwest of detroit u s steel ceo david burritt cited market conditions in a statement announcing the idling of the great lakes works operation in order to further accelerate our strategy of creating a world competitive best of both u s steel we must make deliberate but difficult operational decisions in this case current market conditions and the long term outlook for great lakes works made it imperative that we act now allowing us to better align our resources to deliver cost or capability differentiation across our footprint burritt said transitioning production currently at great lakes works to gary works will enable increased efficiency in the use of our assets improve our ability to meet our customers needs for sustainable steel solutions and will help our company get to our future state faster the move by u s steel drew the condemnation of michigan lawmakers like state sen stephanie chang d detroit who represents the river rouge area and in a statement appeared to place the blame squarely at the feet of the trump administration s policies i am disappointed to hear the united states steel corporation s announcement to indefinitely idle their river rouge facility chang said it is unfortunate that our hardworking men and women are again paying the price for washington s detrimental policies that have led to the market conditions us steel and so many others have been facing pennsylvania numbers pennsylvania s manufacturing industry has seen ups and downs but its role in the state s economy is still large according to the the national association of manufacturers an industry trade group manufacturing output was worth 93 75 billion that s almost 12 of the commonwealth s gdp the bureau of labor statistics lists 575 000 manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania those workers bring home a weekly paycheck of 1 199 or roughly 62 348 over the course of a year overall this makes pennsylvania the sixth biggest state for manufacturing jobs with only fellow rust belt states ohio and michigan ahead but david taylor president of the pennsylvania manufacturer s association an industry lobbying group and trade association said those employment numbers could be even higher there are 6 000 open manufacturing positions where our employers are having great difficulty in finding qualifying employees taylor said at times over trump s first term pennsylvania s most symbolic industry steel looked to be on the upswing last year u s steel promised to invest 1 billion into three steelmaking facilities south of pittsburgh including the 145 year old edgar thomson steel works in braddock pa outside pittsburgh the investment would make the plant more efficient as well as reduce pollution the company said this is a truly transformational investment for u s steel we are combining our integrated steelmaking process with industry leading endless casting and rolling to reinvest in steelmaking and secure the future for a new generation of steelworkers in western pennsylvania and the mon valley david burritt the company s president and ceo said in a may 2019 press release the decision came as the industry was riding high on tariff juiced steel prices since prices have fallen shrinking revenues u s steel finished 2019 in the red and also announced that it was slowing down its previously announced investment in pennsylvania instead it was purchasing an under construction mill in arkansas that turns scrap metal into usable steel we re actually pivoting to the future and focusing on the company we want to become burritt said at the time according to the pittsburgh post gazette wisconsin winners and losers manufacturing in the dairy state appears to be holding up better than in many of its surrounding states and even until recently the nation as a whole at the same time challenges ranging from trade to worker shortages have dampened at least slightly an otherwise enthusiastic community of factory operators the state of manufacturing in wisconsin is actually pretty good right now said buckley brinkman executive director of the wisconsin center for manufacturing and productivity wcmp brinkman considers workforce development and longer range strategic challenges among the sector s top priorities the center is a consultancy that collaborates with wmep manufacturing solutions another networking and consulting organization and the university of wisconsin stout manufacturing outreach center to aid small and medium sized manufacturers in wisconsin manufacturing accounted for 63 3 billion in output in 2018 the most recent year for which figures are available just under 19 of the state s gdp according to the national association of manufacturers the sector employs about 16 of wisconsin s non farm workforce conflicting measurements complicate assessing how well manufacturing jobs are actually doing though federal government reports don t even agree on whether the state is starting to lose ground or continuing to expand based on monthly projections from the bureau of labor statistics wisconsin had about 473 400 manufacturing jobs in december 2019 a 1 drop from a year earlier but dennis winters chief economist at the wisconsin department of workforce development says those numbers appear to be off target the monthly reports he says come from surveys that throughout 2019 have underestimated the wisconsin manufacturing sector more accurate quarterly reports based directly on payroll records have so far outpaced the monthly projections showing an increase for the first six months of 2019 he expects the state s third quarter 2019 report due by the end of february to continue that upward trend national data also suggests a better picture for five straight months from august through december 2019 the national factory index from the institute of supply management ism consistently fell below 50 a sign of contraction in manufacturing then in january 2020 it jumped to 50 9 indicating an expansion bolstered by that news i don t see a turndown here anytime soon winters says i think we weathered the storm and the angst that was there certainly due to the last half of last year the scene in ohio at the start of 2019 ohio manufacturers held 706 800 jobs according to preliminary numbers from the bureau of labor statistics by the end of the year preliminary numbers say the state had 701 500 jobs in the industry jamie karl of the ohio manufacturing association said there has been growth overall and the industry within the state has increased since trump took office over the last year we have fluctuated and i would attribute that in part to the tariffs karl said in the context of a decade the state s industry changes are only slight in december 2009 ohio reported 613 600 manufacturing jobs in the month before trump was inaugurated the state held 687 600 jobs karl said ohio seems to be unique in the country as far as manufacturing growth i don t think there s this story of maintaining manufacturing jobs in other states karl said still projections by the ohio department of job and family services say the industry will lose 40 000 jobs by 2026 an almost 6 loss the biggest projected losses are in rubber product manufacturing 23 printing and related support activities 18 2 and glass manufacturing 16 7 iron and steel mills and industrial machinery manufacturing are close behind with projected losses of between 15 and 16 presidential politics naturally the role of manufacturing in the u s economy and particularly in swing states like michigan is an issue the myriad democratic presidential candidates have sought to use as key components of their platforms former vice president joe biden has a lengthy bullet point plan to revitalize manufacturing across the country posted on his website so does u s sen elizabeth warren d mass other major democratic presidential hopefuls including u s sen bernie sanders i vt former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and u s sen amy klobuchar d minn also have elements of policy proposals aimed at the revitalization of u s manufacturing but automotive industry analyst dziczek notes that the economic policy plans to help the manufacturing sector need not be particularly complex what they really need to do is create good solid economic growth dziczek said that helps manufacturing dziczek also had one more bit of advice for presidential candidates who want to help manufacturers settle down with the tariffs a bit dziczek said this story was originally published by the michigan advance for more stories from the michigan advance visit michiganadvance com

there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms

do productivity shocks in the united states matter to components of nigeria s external sector the paper examines the effects of united states productivity shock on components of nigeria s external sector using a structural macroeconomic model smm the paper modelled nigeria s external sector by using ten behavioural equations and four identities the smm was simulated using a 3 increase and 3 decrease in us productivity to elicit responses of nigeria s external sector components to this shock using quarterly data from 1981 to 2015 the paper found that both positive and negative us productivity shocks elicited symmetrical responses from nigeria s external sector components also both positive and negative shocks had little effects on nigeria s current account balance imports exports foreign direct investments and reserves however positive shocks increased remittances inflow a depreciation in nominal exchange rates a reduction in foreign portfolio investment position and a reduction in foreign debt flows the responses for a negative us productivity shock were just the direct opposite of a positive shock our finding shows that the components of nigeria s external sector will respond in like manner to both positive and negative shocks to united states productivity 1 introduction countries engage in a dynamic and complex world of international trade and capital flows this infers that public policymakers business planners and other stakeholders in these countries have to embrace a larger knowledge set that enables them to become effective economic agents in the global market with the general expansion of international trade and cooperation countries and businesses alike now have an advantageous option of expanding their activities to other countries of the world to achieve their objective increasing profits competing for a larger market share or enhancing their material well being through trade relations one of the government s objectives is to use policy measures to ensure a favourable external balance whereby the inflow of income especially from exports is at least equal to the outflow of income especially from imports economic literature has documented both favourable economic outcomes for a current account deficit and an unfavourable economic outcome also a current account surplus when exports are more than imports may improve domestic employment through improvements in the production of competitive goods and services in the case of china see and may also discourage domestic employment if a recession triggers the surplus which then discourages domestic spending and a reduction in import spending in the case of japan see the disturbances stochastic economic actions by both domestic and foreign economic agents that originate from abroad as well as those originating domestically have significant influences and repercussions these repercussions are transmitted through the components of the external sector to domestic macroeconomic variables the disturbances that originate from abroad are not controlled by domestic economic policies unlike disturbances that originate from within the economy these foreign disturbances are the exogenous shocks shocks may be a significant change in the value of a variable from its underlying trend or a sudden event beyond the control of authorities that has a significant impact on the economy these definitions infer that shocks are simply a deviation from the norm or trend which is unanticipated and has significant effects on the economy which requires some form of adjustment this study focuses on the effects of exogenous shocks from abroad on the components of the external sector against this backdrop investigating the effects of productivity shocks of the united states on nigeria s external sector components will serve as a useful guide for policy responses to the occurrence of an unfavorable shock despite the importance of eliciting external sector responses to exogenous shocks there is very limited number of studies that has looked into this from the literature there exist a handful of studies that has elicited the external sector response to exogenous shocks given the structure and direction of trade between nigeria and the united states to presume only crude oil prices and crude production shocks may not be able to show the necessary reaction dynamics necessary for policy making and forecast though crude oil prices and production shocks have considerable feedback effects on both the components of the external sector and the real sector in nigeria and there has been no documentation of exogenous shocks to productivity of nigeria s major trade partners despite documentation of its influence on the external sector components in nigeria and on this basis the study sets out to 1 expand on the literature on the effects of productivity shocks of trading partners 2 show the effects of productivity shocks on the nigerian external sector and 3 provide possible policy implications of these shocks in section 2 a literature review is provided while in sections 3 and 4 the study provides the methodology used and the findings respectively conclusions are provided in section 5 2 literature review with the increasing rates of globalization and international trade among countries it will be intuitive to conclude that international policies of various governments will have some degree of influence on the macro economy and growth of other countries they engage in trade with however there exists substantial controversy on how countries growth rates and international policies interact the major contentions on the expected relationship between growth rates of countries boarders on the level of openness international trade globalization and governments policies towards protecting domestic infant industries while studies by support the possibility of positive country growth effects through degree of openness and trade other studies by concluded with negative country growth effects studied the impact of the us economic growth on the rest of the world they used a panel data set with fixed effects and found that there exists a significant positive effect of the us economic growth shock on world economic growth especially for developing economies they attributed their findings to the fact that the us is an important global trade partner they explained their findings through the effects of strong conditional convergence if a country s trading partner is rich the implication of this is that developing economies benefit from trading with industrial countries due to their relatively higher incomes also industrial countries benefit from trading with developing economies because of the possibility of their rapid growth studied the impact of international trade on economic growth in nigeria they concentrated on using external sector components as the transmission mechanism for the effects of international trade thus using balance of payments and net exports in a cointegrating relationship they found that international trade through exports has a significant positive effect on the nigerian economy these findings are supported by where they studied the nexus between foreign trade and economic growth using quarterly data in a var system they found foreign trade innovations from other countries serve as a predominant source of growth variations in nigeria expanded on the growth openness debate on if it is beneficial for industrial countries to enter into trade with developing countries some researchers argue that trade with developing countries can be beneficial as it will bring about specialization in advanced sectors however postulated that this conclusion will only be valid within some specific conditions these conditions include the existence of learning by doing and homothetic preferences the study concluded that a rich country could actually become worse off if it trades with a poorer country when the demand pattern of the poor country tends towards sectors that have a weak learning by doing process 3 methodology in this study the relationships between the components of the external sector and the effects of a us productivity shock on the external sector are examined using a structural macroeconomic model smm structural macroeconomic models are built using economic relationships established from theory the smm relies on a system of simultaneous equations in trying to measure the whole economy or a sub sector of the economy with each equation specifying a single relationship the smm methodology follows in principle the cowles commission approach as used in macroeconomic model in this approach economic theory determines the nature of relationship between the right hand side and left hand side variables for all stochastic equations used in building the macro model the resulting equations are estimated using a consistent estimation technique abstracting form smm model the smm model is specified in its non linear form as f i y t y t 1 y t p x t α i μ i t i 1 n t 1 t 1 where y is an n dimensional vector for all endogenous variables x is also a vector of all predetermined exogenous variables including lags of endogenous variables α is a vector of all unknown coefficients and μ represents the stochastic error term for equations i for period 1 the firm m equations are assumed to be stochastic and the remaining equations identities thus specifying the model will entail choosing the variables that enter into each equation with non zero elements the functional form for each equation and the probability structure of the error term the behavioral equations in the smm model are estimated using ordinary least square ols with the inclusions of lags for both dependent and independent variables in each behavioral equation according to macroeconomic models are normally nonlinear simultaneous and very large thus they tend to have serially correlated error terms however the features of the smm allows for the correction of these problems in modeling the smm the smm provides a convenient way of correcting for the problem of serial correlation by treating the serial correlation coefficients as structural coefficients and transforms the equations into equations with serially uncorrelated error terms 1 thus the smm used in estimating the effects of exogenous shocks on nigeria s external sector components comprises the following behavioral equations modelled as x 0 v 0 1 v 1 1 p 0 t 2 v 2 1 o p e c t

results for within sample smm using the estimated behavioural equations we introduce all the variables endogenous and exogenous and identities into the smm and solve the smm block using the gauss seidel method the first step in using the gauss seidel method to study the effects of us productivity shocks on the external sector components is to compare actual and simulated values for all the endogenous variables this comparison will provide an assessment of the smm against the historical data on all endogenous variables the simulated results perform quite well in predicting the general trend for the endogenous variables making them appropriate for simulating the smm see figure 1 with satisfactory within sample simulations for the smm we provide out of sample simulations for the external sector components assuming specific shocks to us productivity with this assumption the smm will be able to track responses to this shock in all the external sector components first we have to provide a baseline forecast of the external sector components which will then form the yardstick for comparing simulated responses to shocks of the external sector components also we introduce different scenarios to capture our assumptions of changes to the exogenous shock variables while also assuming that the conditions within the baseline will hold true in the future 3 2 simulation results for out of sample smm the study presents the smm simulations for foreign country productivity positive shocks and then the results for foreign country productivity negative shocks in simulating the effects of foreign country productivity shock the study first assumed that foreign country productivity increases by 3 for positive shocks and simulate the responses of the external sector components the study also assumed that foreign productivity reduces by 3 for negative shocks and simulated the responses of external sector components for both simulations all the other exogenous variables will continue on their trend path and not deviate from it within the period of simulation a closer look at the simulation results and the percentage deviations show with an increase in foreign country productivity by 3 the following responses of external sector components were elicited see table 1 with the percent deviation from the benchmark represented in figure 2

productivity shock increases the current account balance capital financial flows foreign debt flows foreign portfolio investments nominal exchange rate real exchange rate reserves and remittances on the other hand a positive shock to foreign country productivity will also bring about decreases in foreign direct investments imports total exports non oil exports and service exports a negative foreign country productivity shock increases the current account balance capital financial flows foreign debt flows foreign portfolio investments nominal exchange rate real exchange rate reserves and remittances on the other hand a positive shock to foreign country productivity will also bring about decreases in foreign direct investments imports total exports non oil exports and service exports the responses elicited for foreign productivity shocks confirm the findings of that there exist significant interactions between a countries economic growth and international policies the simulation results show that an increase in demand captured by positive shocks to foreign country output actually reduces nigeria s non oil exports however it will be difficult to attribute such findings to domestic protectionist policies of nigeria s trade partners as claimed by and for trade between developing and developed economies the expectation was that with this shock there would be an increase in the demand for nigeria s non oil exports this may indicate either the low quality of nigeria s non oil export or the low demand for such non oil exports another reason for nigeria s non oil exports not benefiting from an increase in demand from foreign trade partners is based on the claim by and that trade with developing countries can be beneficial as it will bring about specialization in advanced sectors with the caveat that specific conditions the existence of learning by doing and homothetic preferences which are lacking in developing economies must exist the study found a striking similarity among the responses of the external sector component responses to positive and negative foreign country productivity shocks despite the similarity in responses the study found that the elicited responses to a foreign country productivity shock outweighs those of a negative foreign country productivity shock this finding shows that it does not matter if shocks to nigeria s trading partners are positive or negative as the components of nigeria s external sector will respond in like manner to these shocks this can be explained by existing unfavourable terms of trade as well as the relatively smaller proportion of nigeria s trade compared to that of the united states of america 5 conclusions in eliciting responses of nigeria s external sector components to both positive and negative us productivity shocks the paper employed a structural macroeconomic model smm which consisted of ten behavioural equations which described the relationship between endogenous variables and exogenous variables in the smm and four identities which we expect will hold true in reality using the gauss seidel technique we simulated an eight period ahead forecast response of all the endogenous variables in the smm and compared the responses to a baseline response the baseline response was simulated under the assumption that all the variables will continue on their trend path without any significant change the simulated responses for this study find an overwhelming evidence that us productivity shocks have significant effects on nigeria s nominal and real exchange rates remittances and capital financial flows however we found that both positive and negative shocks to us productivity had very limited effects on the components of nigeria s exports total export oil export non oil exports and service exports also we found weak responses to us productivity shocks on reserves and foreign direct investments the simulation results show symmetry between positive and negative productivity shocks notes
when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth by tatira zwinoira when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth these are the words of literary fiction s arguably greatest detective sherlock holmes a character created by the british 19th century author sir arthur doyle the statement refers to the idea that after considering all the facts of a problem presented whatever you are left with is the truth no matter how unlikely in recent weeks both finance minister mthuli ncube and reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor john mangudya have been selling the idea that the economy is de dollarising yet while making these assertions business leaders government departments and consumers are reverting to the greenback or are moving towards doing so as the local currency zimdollar continues to weaken as a store of value for a while now many businesses have been offering us dollar pricing but recently mangudya said more fuel operators selling in foreign currency would not jeopardize the de dollarisation process yet fuel remains one of the biggest cost drivers for businesses and consumers often affecting prices thus adding to inflation in any economy despite this both ncube and mangudya still seem to think the economy is de dollarising so the question then becomes why are they acting differently from reality applying the holmes theory one can conclude that both officials may just be holding posts but there is an invisible hand on the tiller what they said in a statement in may 2016 mangudya was quoted dismissing the return of the zwl also known as zimdollar the rbz would like to assure the public that such rumours are unfounded the multi currency is here to stay the rumours should be dismissed with the contempt that they deserve why did he dismiss the return of the zwl there is nothing like the return of the zimbabwe dollar as the country shall continue to use the multi currency system we have assured the public before and we would like to continue to do so that the country s economic fundamentals do not support the return to the zwl he said on october 9 2016 mangudya is quoted in a report which appeared in a state controlled weekly saying we can t just say the zimbabwe dollar has returned when we haven t achieved the macro economic fundamentals or conditions that allow us to use our currency key economic fundamentals or conditions for the return of the local currency involve balancing the export bill against the import bill for over a year he added this means the economy has the capacity and ability to generate foreign exchange to meet its domestic and foreign requirements development and promotion of foreign exchange revenue streams without this there is no way we are going to return to the zimbabwe dollar if government has a balanced and sustainable budget that way we will be able to return to our local currency in august 2018 a month before becoming the treasury boss ncube was quoted as saying i was one of the people who were of the idea that zimbabwe should adopt the rand and join the rand monetary union for a seven to 10 year period this is because south africa accounts for 80 of zimbabwe s trade so clearly you want a currency that is linked to your largest trading partner but i don t think i want to argue that now because things have moved on and we are at a new juncture he said speaking to local media house zhou media what i would argue now is that we remove the bond note currency because it is becoming a surrogate currency to the us dollar without the macro economic credibility to support it the bond note currency is bad money and we know that in economics bad money drives out good money it s not surprising that the us dollars are now in short supply because people are not banking them so the immediate course of action is to remove the bond notes and then let the us dollar become the core currency but over time we have to bring back zimbabwe s domestic currency that s what will deal with liquidity issues in a big way ncube announced the reintroduction of the zimdollar 10 months later in june 2019 what macroeconomic stability it was clear that mangudya and ncube understood one thing there needed to be favourable macroeconomic indicators in place but the zimdollar was reintroduced without the critical macroeconomic support inflation started to gallop reaching 176 in june 2019 as panic set in ncube banned the zimbabwe national statistics agency from releasing annualised inflation figures prices were also rising and in some cases daily as businesses started to hedge against higher inflation currency depreciation higher wages and transport cost among others the vicious cycle was gathering speed by mid year the world bank had already flagged a slowdown in economic growth and a gross domestic product contraction of 3 for the year national income was also declining due to a slowdown in the purchasing power parity as consumers were prioritising their budgets amid shrinking disposable income and eroding wages finally unemployment was increasing as businesses adopted cost cutting measures to militate against the harsh economic environment a look into several financial reports from companies alluded to that fact so why would the zwl be introduced despite the macroeconomic climate remaining unstable so why the zimdollar if we apply the holmes theory the only thing which makes sense is that treasury and the rbz are not being run independently because if both mangudya and ncube understood that the macroeconomic climate was not conducive for a local currency they would not have brought back the zimdollar so quickly these two gentlemen are educated and experienced enough to understand the import of such a move and in their sober minds would clearly not sanction such a risky move that they did means that someone is overriding their common sense and that someone is driven by greed corruption and opportunities for arbitrages the chaos would foment early this month american global policy think tank the rand corporation noted of zimbabwe s economy due to a highly cartelised and patronage based economy politics and economics are inseparable in zimbabwe so fiscal and monetary authorities find their hands tied leaving the country at the mercy of special interest groups that pull the political strings various office bearers of zimbabwe s key institutions including prosecutor general kumbirai hodzi have variously referred to such interests as sophisticated cartels that have permeated public institutions and can bend key policy decisions to their whim impeccable sources told newsday business last week that monetary and fiscal authorities were at the mercy of the political economy which was controlling key decision making there is what is called the political economy i think you must understand that that is what controls our decision making they fiscal and monetary authorities know what needs to be done but the powers that be are the ones controlling things one source said the result is that consideration is given to the special political interests at the expense of the economy the country and its people in zimbabwe s political speak the cartels are in charge

there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are several reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 per cent debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have a debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 per cent a debt to gdp ratio of 60 per cent is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only one per cent of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is four per cent in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios give a snapshot of the country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of one per cent in the debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 per cent and 0 03 per cent in interest rates african governments are paying interest of five per cent to 16 per cent on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt those african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raised for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures credit ratings third is poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in the determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and creditworthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 per cent among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks is almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 per cent and has been hovering between eight to 11 per cent for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three global rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging six per cent over the past 10 years but it remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was kenya s standard gauge railway which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms governments should use the money raised to fund profitable projects and use the profits from these projects to repay interest owed governments must take control of the bond issuance process during the bond structuring stage they must exercise their choice of accepting or rejecting investors bids it is imperative for african countries to structure bonds with favourable yields and tenure this process should not be entirely renounced to syndicates of lead managers originators and investment banks eurobond issuances have been oversubscribed by three times on average

their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period thus stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period amortization of purchased intangibles the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships and in some cases acquired lease intangibles as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non gaap measures management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and

better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition related costs since each of these can vary in size and frequency when projecting this long term rate the company evaluated a three year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non cash items stock

u s dollar bank notes are arranged for a photograph on september 7 2017 in hong kong the dollar rebounded on wednesday from a two week low hit in the previous session as investors scaled back expectations that the u s federal reserve would signal more policy easing in response to a deadly virus spreading outside china however broader market sentiment remained cautious with implied volatility gauges on euro dollar rising to 4 1 2 month highs while commodity currencies like the australian and the kiwi dollar came under fresh selling pressure the broader theme of risk aversion is still impacting fx markets though markets are starting to reprice some of their excessive policy easing expectations said manuel oliveri a currency strategist at credit agricole in london that was evident in expected price swings for the euro currency with one month maturities rising to an early october high of 5 7 after hitting a six year low of 2 3 last week but gyrations in derivatives had little impact on broader cash markets with the single currency struggling to push above the 1 09 level on wednesday it was trading at 1 08760 commodity currencies came under some selling pressure with the aussie and the kiwi dollar shedding half a percent each against a broadly sturdy greenback
there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker coughlin expanding eligibility for the pharmaceutical assistance for the aged and disabled or paad and senior gold programs to thousands more new jerseyans investing an additional 200 million to further lower the costs of health insurance for individuals purchasing plans through the aca fully funding women s health care and family planning maintaining our data driven and whole of government fight against our opioid scourge continuing the partnerships the first lady has built to meaningfully combat the infant and maternal mortality disparities among our communities of color investing in programs and services for youth so they don t get entangled in the juvenile justice system fully funding the amistad commission expanding the size of the earned income tax credit and making thousands more young adults eligible helping ensure safe learning environments for our kids and communities of faith for the first time exempting combat pay earned by our active duty military men and women from

the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax incentives but this is too important this is about who we stand with and what we stand for this is about how we create jobs and for whom we create jobs these are our choices are we on the side of protecting taxpayers hard earned money or with the millions of dollars spent with no oversight and too often with no results are we on the side of small businesses and the entrepreneurs women veterans and people of color who want to start a business or do we only welcome the big fish and the well connected are we on the side of communities and residents or do we reward those who ignore them are we on the side of transparency and accountability or do we close our eyes to those gaming the system we should all agree that a targeted program with strong compliance standards is a good thing we should all agree that we need a program whose focus is on expanding our economy not rewarding special interests and we should all agree that just as much as we need strong compliance standards we must have clear annual overall caps in place blank checks are bad policy no family budgets that way neither should we as i ve said countless times most companies are good corporate citizens who play by the rules but some are not we are seeing progress in the name of our taxpayers in getting back some of the millions of dollars we now know were inappropriately awarded the first 11 million of some 500 million being investigated i am committed to not reliving the mistakes of the past the mistakes that put huge tax breaks for the well connected before tax breaks for the middle class and let s be perfectly clear billions given away in open ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for both residents and businesses tax incentives cannot be about rewarding special interests they must be about making our state more competitive creating jobs and growing the next great wave of new jersey based companies period i am pro jobs pro growth and pro accountability that is why i am for reforming a failed incentives system just as i am for reforming our ethics laws to let more light shine in when we reject transparency in any forum bad deals are made and taxpayers are hurt the public needs to see unmistakably that we work for them and not the other way around and i ask you to join me in this cause the goal isn t to win for the sake of politics but to win for the sake of our future that s also an apt way of thinking about our first two years two years speaking to our core value that new jersey is at its strongest when it is at its fairest two years speaking to the need for us to focus not on gimmicks but on long term and sustainable solutions for real property tax relief two years speaking to the need to change the culture of trenton from one that shields the wealthy and special interests to one that secures progress for our entire new jersey family we re doing what no one thought possible we re making real progress against high property taxes restoring new jersey s fiscal standing growing our economy repositioning our state for success and at the same time investing in our future here we are with a record of unmistakable progress on all fronts and with a budget that promises to keep us moving forward thank you all very much may god continue to bless the great state of new jersey and the united states of america

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker coughlin expanding eligibility for the pharmaceutical assistance for the aged and disabled or paad and senior gold programs to thousands more new jerseyans investing an additional 200 million to further lower the costs of health insurance for individuals purchasing plans through the aca fully funding women s health care and family planning maintaining our data driven and whole of government fight against our opioid scourge continuing the partnerships the first lady has built to meaningfully combat the infant and maternal mortality disparities among our communities of color investing in programs and services for youth so they don t get entangled in the juvenile justice system fully funding the amistad commission expanding the size of the earned income tax credit and making thousands more young adults eligible helping ensure safe learning environments for our kids and communities of faith for the first time exempting combat pay earned by our active duty military men and women from taxes making a down payment for our communities to replace lead water service lines and modernize our infrastructure and building the futures of our college students through the garden state guarantee the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax incentives but this is too important this is about who we stand with and what we stand for this is about how we create jobs and for whom we create jobs these are our choices are we on the side of protecting taxpayers hard earned money or with the millions of dollars spent with no oversight and too often with no results are we on the side of small businesses and the entrepreneurs women veterans and people of color who want to start a business or do we only welcome the big fish and the well connected are we on the side of communities and residents or do we reward those who ignore them are we on the side of transparency and accountability or do we close our eyes to those gaming the system we should all agree that a targeted program with strong compliance standards is a good thing we should all agree that we need a program whose focus is on expanding our economy not rewarding special interests and we should all agree that just as much as we need strong compliance standards we must have clear annual overall caps in place blank checks are bad policy no family budgets that way neither should we as i ve said countless times most companies are good corporate citizens who play by the rules but some are not we are seeing progress in the name of our taxpayers in getting back some of the millions of dollars we now know were inappropriately awarded the first 11 million of some 500 million being investigated i am committed to not reliving the mistakes of the past the mistakes that put huge tax breaks for the well connected before tax breaks for the middle class and let s be perfectly clear billions given away in open ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for both residents and businesses tax incentives cannot be about rewarding special interests they must be about making our state more competitive creating jobs and growing the next great wave of new jersey based companies period i am pro jobs pro growth and pro accountability that is why i am for reforming a failed incentives system just as i am for reforming our ethics laws to let more light shine in when we reject transparency in any forum bad deals are made and taxpayers are hurt the public needs to see unmistakably that we work for them and not the other way around and i ask you to join me in this cause the goal isn t to win for the sake of politics but to win for the sake of our future that s also an apt way of thinking about our first two years two years speaking to our core value that new jersey is at its strongest when it is at its fairest two years speaking to the need for us to focus not on gimmicks but on long term and sustainable solutions for real property tax relief two years speaking to the need to change the culture of trenton from one that shields the wealthy and special interests to one that secures progress for our entire new jersey family we re doing what no one thought possible we re making real progress against high property taxes restoring new jersey s fiscal standing growing our economy repositioning our state for success and at the same time investing in our future here we are with a record of unmistakable progress on all fronts and with a budget that promises to keep us moving forward thank you all very much may god continue to bless the great state of new jersey and the united states of america
here is the full text as prepared for delivery of gov phil murphy s third state budget address which he is delivering at the statehouse in trenton on tuesday lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness gov phil murphy enters the state assembly chambers in trenton to deliver his third state budget address michael mancuso nj advance media for nj com as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them gov phil murphy delivers his state budget address tuesday at the statehouse in trenton michael mancuso nj advance media for nj com we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee a fish eye view of the state assembly chambers before gov phil murphy delivers his state budget address tuesday at the statehouse in trenton michael mancuso nj advance media for nj com every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker coughlin expanding eligibility for the pharmaceutical assistance for the aged and disabled or paad and senior gold programs to thousands more new jerseyans investing an additional 200 million to further lower the costs of health insurance for individuals purchasing plans through the aca fully funding women s health care and family planning maintaining our data driven and whole of government fight against our opioid scourge continuing the partnerships the first lady has built to meaningfully combat the infant and maternal mortality disparities among our communities of color investing in programs and services for youth so they don t get entangled in the juvenile justice system fully funding the amistad commission expanding the size of the earned income tax credit and making thousands more young adults eligible helping ensure safe learning environments for our kids and communities of faith for the first time exempting combat pay earned by our active duty military men and women from taxes making a down payment for our communities to replace lead water service lines and modernize our infrastructure and building the futures of our college students through the garden state guarantee the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax

stock based compensation heska is unable to provide a reconciliation of the non gaap guidance measure to the corresponding gaap measure on a forward looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the high variability and low visibility of most of the excluded items material changes to any one of these items could have a significant impact on future gaap results heska believes the non gaap

core companion animal segment 2020 outlook comments heska is pleased with underlying growth trends in poc lab diagnostics consumables and instruments in 2019 and over the past few years the company sees positive trends relating to core lab offerings in the domestic market due to the timing size and nature of incremental test launches and the nature of heska s reset subscriptions model on newly released analyzers and new analyzers placed the impact to revenue from these new launches is anticipated to modestly begin in the latter half of 2020 and to accelerate in 2021 heska remains committed to this strategy of building long term economics and value through these sustainable subscription plans and intends to continue to follow this successful model in the future for current and new products significant international revenue growth is expected via acquisitions of cvm companies spain and the upcoming acquisition of scil germany and greater core europe for 2020 heska anticipates continued and increasing competition for new customers and market share to counter this competition and scale for new products releases heska will further grow investments in sales and marketing team expansion to deliver net customer gains higher utilization in heska subscriber hospitals new activations in heska s corporately owned hospital group accounts and stable heska retention rates at or

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker coughlin expanding eligibility for the pharmaceutical assistance for the aged and disabled or paad and senior gold programs to thousands more new jerseyans investing an additional 200 million to further lower the costs of health insurance for individuals purchasing plans through the aca fully funding women s health care and family planning maintaining our data driven and whole of government fight against our opioid scourge continuing the partnerships the first lady has built to meaningfully combat the infant and maternal mortality disparities among our communities of color investing in programs and services for youth so they don t get entangled in the juvenile justice system fully funding the amistad commission expanding the size of the earned income tax credit and making thousands more young adults eligible helping ensure safe learning environments for our kids and communities of faith for the first time exempting combat pay earned by our active duty military men and women from taxes making a down payment for our communities to replace lead water service lines and modernize our infrastructure and building the futures of our college students through the garden state guarantee the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax incentives but this is too important this is about who we stand with and what we stand for this is about how we create jobs and for whom we create jobs these are our choices are we on the side of protecting taxpayers hard earned money or with the millions of dollars spent with no oversight and too often with no results are we on the side of small businesses and the entrepreneurs women veterans and people of color who want to start a business or do we only welcome the big fish and the well connected are we on the side of communities and residents or do we reward those who ignore them are we on the side of transparency and accountability or do we close our eyes to those gaming the system we should all agree that a targeted program with strong compliance standards is a good thing we should all agree that we need a program whose focus is on expanding our economy not rewarding special interests and we should all agree that just as much as we need strong compliance standards we must have clear annual overall caps in place blank checks are bad policy no family budgets that way neither should we as i ve said countless times most companies are good corporate citizens who play by the rules but some are not we are seeing progress in the name of our taxpayers in getting back some of the millions of dollars we now know were inappropriately awarded the first 11 million of some 500 million being investigated i am committed to not reliving the mistakes of the past the mistakes that put huge tax breaks for the well connected before tax breaks for the middle class and let s be perfectly clear billions given away in open ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for both residents and businesses tax incentives cannot be about rewarding special interests they must be about making our state more competitive creating jobs and growing the next great wave of new jersey based companies period i am pro jobs pro growth and pro accountability that is why i am for reforming a failed incentives system just as i am for reforming our ethics laws to let more light shine in when we reject transparency in any forum bad deals are made and taxpayers are hurt the public needs to see unmistakably that we work for them and not the other way around and i ask you to join me in this cause the goal isn t to win for the sake of politics but to win for the sake of our future that s also an apt way of thinking about our first two years two years speaking to our core value that new jersey is at its strongest when it is at its fairest two years speaking to the need for us to focus not on gimmicks but on long term and sustainable solutions for real property tax relief two years speaking to the need to change the culture of trenton from one that shields the wealthy and special interests to one that secures progress for our entire new jersey family we re doing what no one thought possible we re making real progress against high property taxes restoring new jersey s fiscal standing growing our economy repositioning our state for success and at the same time investing in our future here we are with a record of unmistakable progress on all fronts and with a budget that promises to keep us moving forward thank you all very much may god continue to bless the great state of new jersey and the united states of america
there are some misconceptions about how frequently bitcoin is being used in venezuela and the problems it can solve there in issue number 18 of bitcoin magazine published in january 2014 cathy reisenwitz wrote one of if not the first accounts arguing why venezuelans could benefit from bitcoin an article titled grounded venezuelans may want to escape to bitcoin the original cryptocurrency reisenwitz stated could provide an escape hatch from what was then escalating economic oppression under the regime of president nicolás maduro to that end she also wrote that several things could hamper a venezuelan escape to bitcoin including limited internet access price volatility and a lack of liquidity read cathy reisenwitz s grounded venezuelans may want to escape to bitcoin marked by hyperinflation escalating starvation disease crime and massive emigration venezuela s economic crisis has bulged magnitudes higher since 2014 during the same time countless reports have indicated that bitcoin adoption has grown remarkably within the country according to data on weekly bitcoin volume from localbitcoins 2019 saw the highestbitcoin exchangevolume for the bolívar on record however it s inaccurate to conclude that bitcoin can save venezuela that would exaggerate what sound money can do for a country in socioeconomic and political freefall to revisit an issue that has been on the minds of bitcoiners since at least 2014 and to gain a more accurate picture of what bitcoin means for venezuela we spoke with peter mccormack host of the what bitcoin did podcast who conducted some firsthand reporting there recently the reality of bitcoin adoption in venezuela image credit peter mccormack we cover venezuela as a place where bitcoin adoption can improve the economic troubles of its people where do you think bitcoin adoption stands today in the country don t get me wrong there are use cases for bitcoin in venezuela another cryptocurrency being touted as a use case for venezuelans is dash i was very critical of dash the ceo wrote me an open letter and he came up with a number of arguments for why dash is useful to venezuelans his general analysis was correct it has low friction and divisibility the venezuelan bolívar does not also that crypto is really for the middle and upper class what he failed to understand is that the vast majority of the country is poor and the people who have access to the tools to use bitcoin are the ones that need the least help the perception is that bitcoin can help all of venezuela it really can t how does that change the use case for cryptocurrency i think any cryptocurrency comes with added friction and risk for these people which the dollar does not the bolívar doesn t really have friction as a medium of exchange because everyone in the country accepts it when i went to the slums it became painfully clear that these people aren t going to download a bitcoin wallet and back up their private keys right they only want to find out how they re going to eat that day and it might be because they ve earned a couple of dollars or getting food donated through a humanitarian project this is the reality of the actual lives that people are living i admit i have been a hypocrite i used to believe bitcoin was great for venezuela it can help some people but right now venezuelans need infrastructure and the biggest problem they have is the maduro regime bitcoin is not going to get rid of the government they ve got guns it s naive to think a currency can remove a dictator backed by an army a firsthand look image credit peter mccormack you recently traveled to venezuela was it difficult getting in so i am learning how to make a documentary film i chose a few places in south and central america because there s so much happening there venezuela was the weirdest spot we left most of our equipment in bogotá colombia because if you turn up with a portable recording studio then it s pretty obvious you are a journalist the venezuelan government isn t a fan of media coverage so we just took an iphone and a dslr camera each my producer said he was a photographer i just said i was a tourist and worked in marketing we went through separately like we didn t know each other we got grilled pretty brutally on the way through immigration in caracas it was you know what are you doing here why are you here what do you want blah blah blah were people accepting bitcoin in caracas yeah so they are when you get into venezuela there are a few places that accept bitcoin those who can accept bitcoin know it s better than accepting the bolívar i posted a punchy title on twitter saying bitcoin can t save venezuela because it can t it is being used but a lot less than people think on the border in cúcuta the ngos accept bitcoin as donation but that s just because it s a form of money and they desperately need money for example if someone offered them a bunch of dentacoins they would take dentacoins or potato coins or whatever because they can just convert it to dollars and then use that money i was told inside that there are some people who use bitcoin for remittance that is limited but there are some people doing it like the places that accept bitcoin there are also educated users who use bitcoin as a way to avoid the bolívar s hyperinflation but again they re educated bitcoiners all on the wealthier side that is to say the upper and middle class in caracas all the poor people are lucky to live on a few dollars a month also in the other venezuelan provinces there are regular blackouts where there is no power can you share more about how the country s economic disparity affects bitcoin use cases first off common sense indicates it s useless for them because it s a volatile asset if you re earning 5 a month you don t want to buy bitcoin and then the price drops and you ve lost 10 percent of your living income when you re already in a pretty poor spot controversially the dollar or even perhaps a stablecoin is a much better medium of exchange for these people right now second bitcoin is also technically complicated and there s a lot of crime in the slums if anyone has bitcoin on their phone anyone can just put a gun to their head and demand they hand over their bitcoin people say the same thing can happen with dollars but that s their day to day living money the level of opsec they need for money has to be both more simple and way above what people in the west need third bitcoin is not universally accepted in venezuela while the bolívar and the dollar are everybody accepts bolívars and most people will take the dollar it doesn t matter whether you re in the east part of the city which is quite wealthy at a restaurant or in the west part of the city where everyone is very poor everyone will take bolívars the problem with the dollar is that if you buy something under a dollar which happens a lot there s no way to get change unless you get it in bolívars how venezuelans are thinking about money image credit peter mccormack did you meet any venezuelans using bitcoin as a store of value the problem with the store of value use case is that these people have no culture of financial savings everything they earn they have to spend just to survive we haven t even gotten mass adoption in the west i think people need to be more realistic but for those who can buy bitcoin with the bolívar and then convert it back to the bolívar when they need to buy something it can save them from the bolívar s 10 percent weekly inflation my impression of how many people are actually doing that was very low how does money break out in terms of physical notes versus digital payments people want u s dollars it s the best currency in venezuela right now because everyone will accept it and it holds its value over the bolívar and it s physical if you re in a store or a restaurant visa and mastercard are accepted in the slums it s going to be all cash however they do have payment apps like venmo which the majority of the population uses now because it s just realized it s too costly to keep printing notes that s how most people are paying each other person to person when thinking about bitcoin and a place like venezuela a common misconception seems to be that general economic need and disparity warrant a need for bitcoin adoption in that place it turns out to be more complicated what qualifies a place to be good for bitcoin adoption it depends on what kind of adoption you are talking about if it s for speculation then i think it s typically western countries if it s an actual medium of exchange use case a place where bitcoin adoption can take off necessitates a government currency that is inflating or hyperinflating so south america and probably africa venezuela s economic disparity is too great but in general south america is a great region for bitcoin adoption and i ve seen it many of these countries show that classic swing from left to right governments a lot of those countries have been living under an unstable monetary policy yet many are fairly developed uruguay chile colombia and brazil it s a similar situation in central america though i ve only traveled through mexico and el salvador the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc

now that the presidential primaries are finally underway which means that rather than taking up 90 percent of your daily news coverage the election will now take up 100 percent there s a question i think is worth asking but let me say this you probably won t think this question is worth asking you ll probably think this question is dumber than dumb a waste of neurons it s a question we first asked in freakonomics land back when george w bush was president then again during the obama era and here we are now in the age of trump with a president who s just been impeached no less and yet the question we want to ask today is this how much does the president of the united states really matter i fully recognize this may not sound like a sensible question that the answer is too obvious so why do i think it s worth asking because we humans aren t always so good at understanding cause and effect intellectually you know this we talk all the time on this show about how the relationship between x and y isn t always what it seems that other less obvious factors may be important but emotionally that s a different story emotionally we tend to be drawn to clean simple explanations of cause and effect even if the reality is more nuanced this may be a form of mythical reductionism we love our heroes and our villains so if you happen to hate a particular president and i ask you how much does the president matter you ll probably say the president matters very much because it s tempting to blame every bad thing you see on this person who seemingly has infinite power and what if you happen to love a particular president you may well give the same answer they matter very much you say because you ll attribute all good things all signs of progress to your president even if he or she had demonstrably zero to do with a given piece of progress that said has there ever been a less opportune time to ask the question we re asking today maybe not donald trump is the most anomalous and divisive u s president in recent history maybe our entire history but then again maybe it s the perfect time to revisit this question americans are obsessed with the presidency we may ridicule the british obsession with their monarchy but is the attention we pay to the president positive and negative attention is it really so different consider this odd fact the gallup poll every year asks americans to name the man they most admire living anywhere in the world last year the result was a tie between donald trump and barack obama whether you love or hate a given president the white house captures so much of our attention that it seems worth asking how much is signal and how much is just noise how much smoke how much fire is the so called leader of the free world as almighty as we tend to think today on freakonomics radio we put this question to three people in a good position to answer it a law professor who studies presidential power a law professor who studies constitutionalism and a former white house chief economist we talk about the relative power of the government s three branches we talk about the evolution of the presidency and yes we talk about donald trump glenn hubbard well i think president trump can rightly claim some credit eric posner no i do think he s unfit bernadette meyler i think it s a lot easier for a president to destroy than to create let s start with the president s role in the economy and for that we turn to glenn hubbard hubbard i m a professor of finance and economics at columbia university hubbard has twice served in government in the early 1990s as deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis in the treasury and then hubbard and then in the early 2000s i was chairman of the white house council of economic advisors and the principal economic advisor to the president that was republican president george w bush later on hubbard was chief economic adviser to mitt romney on his unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign hubbard yes i was and also for jeb bush in 2016 dubner so the question we re asking in this episode is somewhat vague intentionally or at least open to interpretation the question is how much does the president of the united states matter hubbard well i think the president of the united states matters less and more than people think less meaning a low number on a scale of one to 10 because the overall economy is moved by very big factors in technology in globalization in developments in consumer tastes and so on but a president has more influence than people think in the sense of the very large regulatory and administrative state which report to the president dubner so most economic measures in the u s at the moment are strong very strong especially the stock markets labor markets are relatively strong with slightly higher wage growth and we re about to enter the meat of a new presidential campaign with obviously trump as the incumbent how much credit not will but should trump claim for this state of the economy hubbard well i think president trump can rightly claim some credit when the beginning of his presidency happened there was a shift in business people s expectations about what was possible there was a sense in which regulation and tax policy were going to become more favorable having said that a lot of factors underlying economic growth happen whoever the president is dubner in terms of trump administration economic policy everything ranging from the 2017 tax cuts to tariff and trade activity with china and elsewhere i d like you to name three things from the trump administration that you approve of and three you disapprove of hubbard in terms of approving right at the very beginning resetting expectations with businesspeople that things were going to be different the pop in the stock market and growth happened at that time it was a different economic climate have to give the president credit for that the tax cut and jobs act had many positive features now it s true that those weren t necessarily the president s own ideas but without presidential leadership you don t get a tax bill and then finally confronting china at the 30 000 foot level i agree with the president where i disagree and this would get to the second set you mentioned on exactly how he confronted china i think there the trade policy has generated significant policy uncertainty i also disagree with the administration s views on immigration i think immigration is a big positive for the american economy and the third criticism is more the dog that didn t bark president trump was elected by a group of people at the margin who felt left behind in the american economy there s so much we need to be doing for these people and i don t see any action from the administration dubner you mentioned the uncertainty over the tariffs and trade war i guess really the big question is will the short term pain and cost of the tariffs be worth it in the long run hubbard well i think that is the real question and that s why i actually start by giving the president some credit previous administrations democrat or republican had not really confronted china as the elephant in the room china really is the bad actor on the international economic stage that the president says it is it is stealing intellectual property it is not abiding by the rules of the world trade organization that said the question is how do you deal with that kind of elephant in the room i would have thought that one way to deal with it would be to get all of our allies together the european union japan canada others with us to confront china fundamentally does it belong in the w t o the world trade organization so i think tariffs were not the right tool dubner what you re describing is not the trump way plainly correct hubbard well perhaps but it would be a typical way to win a negotiation you try to unite your friends and divide your enemies not the other way around dubner why had so many past presidents been reluctant or even impotent to deal with china in this way hubbard i think dealing with china is hard first of all there s a lot of good there the opening up of china to the modern world has been the world s greatest anti poverty program tens of millions of chinese citizens have become less poor as a result of that openness that is a good thing and we shouldn t forget it we also shouldn t forget that many american consumers have benefited a lot from trade with china the question is strategically for the country going forward with a lack of adherence to the w t o rules and the theft of intellectual property serious enough issues i think they became more serious and that s why i give president trump some credit in confronting them dubner so in a columbia business school podcast where you were discussing business leadership you were asked where stability ranks as a leadership trait and you said a leader s first and foremost characteristic is defining and illustrating the organization s purpose but he or she has to be a steady hand in doing that remember people look up to the leader as a symbol of the organization the job of a leader is not to run around with his or her head cut off based on that assessment of yours how would you rate president trump as a leader of his branch of government hubbard well i think president trump s leadership style is different from many leaders i think in some respects he s done a good job he has articulated some very clear themes and tried to approach them on the other hand the vacillation in policy and the policy uncertainty is unsettling just like it would be for employees in a company so i think as with many people there s some strong leadership traits to be sure but others that at least i wouldn t share dubner in that same interview you said this about politics my fear is at what point do people lose faith in the government that they have and that is something one shouldn t trifle with because once lost it s very hard to get back glenn where do you think the u s stands now in terms of its citizenry s faith in its federal government hubbard i think the u s public or at least swaths of it are losing faith in the federal government s ability to solve economic and overall domestic and foreign policy problems and i think that s a problem another manifestation of that problem is that the economic system we have that has delivered amazing innovation changes in living standards not only here but around the world that economic system is not manna from heaven it s in part a political and social construct if people start to lose faith in the system and in the government that provides guardrails around it that becomes a first order problem that is my number one concern at the moment it was nearly 10 years ago that we last asked this question about how much the president matters barack obama was nearly two years into his first term he d had some victories a stimulus package and health care reform but in the 2010 midterm elections the democrats got slaughtered and lost the house one of the people we spoke with for that episode was a cornell law professor named bernadette meyler she specializes in the constitution and executive power that conversation started like this dubner it s a cliché but the president of the united states is regularly called the most powerful person on earth what say you yes no maybe so meyler no basically the president of the united states is not the most powerful person the president s power is really constrained in a lot of different ways and the president isn t as significant as we imagine him or her to be meyler has since moved on to stanford we got hold of her there and asked whether she still agreed with her 10 years ago self meyler i think that my view has shifted somewhat since we spoke i think two things have changed significantly one is that the increases in legislative gridlock have made it even harder to enact a legislative agenda so presidents have moved towards doing more things through executive orders and sole executive action secondly the fact that the filibuster for judicial nominees and for executive branch nominees was abandoned which now means that only a bare majority is required for confirmation in those positions has changed the nature of presidential power regarding appointments and significantly increased that power dubner on that note presidential appointments have the presidents and their administrations been actively trying to glean more power or has that power been transferred or surrendered through some other consequences meyler i think it s a combination of the two in terms of the confirmation process that was up to the senate to determine and ultimately they decided to get rid of the filibuster in that context i think that was a mistake on the part of the senate but that was a legislative action a quick primer here while the president has the power to nominate federal judges they must be confirmed by the senate that used to require a supermajority at least 60 of the 100 votes in the senate but in 2013 that changed barack obama s judicial nominees were facing republican pushback the democrats had control of the senate but not enough to muster a supermajority so democratic senate majority leader harry reid used what had come to be known as the nuclear option harry reid it s time to change the senate before this institution becomes obsolete the nuclear option got rid of the rule requiring a supermajority now only a simple majority would be required to confirm all federal judicial nominees except for the supreme court mitch mcconnell who was then the senate minority leader here s what he said at the time mitch mcconnell i say to my friends on the other side of the aisle you will regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think indeed in the next election cycle the republicans took control of the senate and then in 2016 when the republican donald trump was elected president he had the power to confirm judges with a simple majority and he has been using that power just three years into his first term trump has gotten confirmed 50 appeals court judges obama only got 55 during his entire two terms one of every four sitting circuit court judges is a trump appointee and then there s the supreme court in 2017 mitch mcconnell got rid of the supermajority requirement for that and that s helped make possible the confirmation of two trump nominees to the supreme court neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh and so as bernadette meyler argues presidential power has certainly increased when it comes to judiciary appointments but she says that s not the only avenue through which presidential power has been consolidated lately meyler obama i think did aggrandize executive power to some extent he wound up making a lot of determinations through his executive cabinet and other executive branch processes during his two terms barack obama issued 276 executive orders there is nothing extraordinary about that number george bush issued 291 bill clinton 254 president trump has so far issued 138 keeping him roughly on or perhaps a bit ahead of that pace but there is a great variance in the reach of a given executive order it can be something as simple as a statement of intention or some sort of ceremonial proclamation or it can essentially create policy without having to bother going through the legislative branch obama frustrated with a republican majority in congress that he saw as needlessly obstinate he often chose the latter barack obama we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we re providing americans the kind of help they need i ve got a pen and i ve got a phone obama s appetite for executive action was fairly omnivorous meyler with respect to climate change he made a lot of executive orders and he also entered the paris agreement as president rather than trying to negotiate a treaty which would probably have been impossible he also extended the deferred action for childhood arrivals program which was a decision by the executive branch not to enforce some of the immigration laws against people who had come to the country as children so i think that obama did aggregate more power into the executive branch which then also meant that a lot of his actions could be undone subsequently by president trump dubner so barack obama is nothing if not a thoughtful and intelligent human so it s impossible for me to reckon that he wouldn t have thought through the consequences of aggregating that power through the use of executive orders and sole executive action and so on so what do you think was the plan there or the idea meyler yeah i think that s a fascinating question and it s something that i have thought a bit about one thing that he said with respect to the affordable care act is that it established a baseline and i think his view was that you couldn t go back from that baseline i think that was the motivation behind presenting something like daca or entering into the paris agreement i think his view was that these baselines would be very hard to dial back it hasn t really proved as hard as i think he imagined i definitely think it has increased the extent to which trump could claim some form of bipartisan legitimacy for his action that he can claim that he s just acting as a democratic president would and i think that s particularly the case with something like daca where he can say well i don t think it was constitutional in the first place so i m going to get rid of it and i m not exercising extra discretion it s just what obama had done previously another example that occurs to me is the national monuments so he reduced the national monuments in utah more than any president has reduced national monuments previously and his claim was well it was just some democratic presidents clinton and obama who created these large monuments and prevented people in utah from using their land in the way that they would have liked to so i m just undoing the wrong that these earlier presidents did dubner i d like you to compare president trump s declarations of intent whether they were things he said during the campaign or during his time in office with his actual accomplishments meyler i think he s generally tried to do the things that he claimed he would do he s definitely made immigration a big hinge of his presidency as he had said he would i think he s lived up to promises to the coal plants and various other energy industry constituencies to dial back environmental regulation and then also on the tax front he managed to undermine the affordable care act through the law that was passed to get rid of basically the tax that would have supported the affordable care act dubner and how typical would you say that is for recent presidents again the gap between declarations of intent and accomplishments meyler i would say he s been average i don t feel that he s been extraordinarily effective he had touted passing a lot of laws early in his presidency but the pew foundation did a study and showed that while the number of laws were say greater than the prior congress a lot of those laws were symbolic and there weren t that many major legislative accomplishments dubner it strikes me that trump kind of has put the bully back in the bully pulpit that he s behaving demonstratively in ways that past presidents haven t in a long time and i m curious your views on that meyler yes i love this metaphor of the bully pulpit as applied to trump i would not have thought of that but i yes i completely agree he has put the bully back in bully pulpit my feeling is that there could be a positive dimension to reinvigorating the symbolic and the rhetorical power of the presidency now i mean i really dislike everything that trump does and all of his tweets and excess but the way that he s managed to actually use social media to galvanize people and to try to unify his base around an agenda i think is instructive for other potential leaders i think one problem with president obama s strategy was that he didn t really appeal enough to people and to people s ordinary moral intuitions in order to get them to support his agenda i think people felt that his presidency was too bureaucratic or too technocratic so that he wasn t really taking advantage of the possibility of galvanizing a public just for the historical record i want to clarify something here it was president teddy roosevelt who coined the phrase bully pulpit as a description of the presidency and roosevelt took great delight in using the bully pulpit but back then the word bully had an additional usage as an adjective that meant good or even great that s what roosevelt meant by calling the presidency a bully pulpit that it was a great platform to get things done not that you could use the presidency to bully people into submission okay okay dubner if you could just in a nutshell tell us the president has the greatest leverage in which realms and the weakest or least leverage in which realms meyler i would say the president has the greatest leverage when you re dealing with foreign affairs so that s one reason why he could get out of the paris agreement that he s negotiating in various ways with other countries with china about tariffs another area is in the administrative state and there it s not only by direct command but also by retaining the power to fire people and the supreme court has gradually been making the president s power over subordinates in the administrative branch more plenary and saying that it s not constitutional to restrict in various ways and then another prominent area in the trump administration would be the power of pardoning which he s been using to great strategic advantage dubner can the president constitutionally pardon him or herself if required meyler i don t think so i think that goes back to a limitation implicit in the concept of pardoning itself which has to do with the common law precept that you can t be a judge in your own case dubner okay and then some realms in which the president is maybe weaker than the average person might think meyler so one really important realm is with respect to budgeting congress really is acknowledged to have the power of the purse and that does constrain what the executive branch can do one example i think where trump really attempted to make a strong push for greater executive power is with respect to the national emergencies act when congress refused to grant him the money to build his border wall he decided to appropriate the money from the defense budget and transfer that money under a claim of authority through the national emergencies act even though congress had pretty explicitly said that they didn t want to give him money for that project dubner so one hallmark of the trump presidency has been deregulation and he argued that one hallmark of the obama administration was heavy regulation so can you talk for a moment about the degree of power or leverage in the realm of regulation for presidents again whether through executive order or legislation or just not enforcing existing regulations meyler so i think it s a lot easier for a president to destroy than to create and to undo prior actions than to pass a new agenda proactively i think that trump has benefited a lot from not enforcing things the example that comes to mind for me is the affordable care act where it took obama so much political energy and will to pass the affordable care act and that was the main i would say regulatory reform of his administration whereas it doesn t take that much to not enforce a lot of its provisions dubner so of the three branches of government which would you argue has gained the most power and lost the most power over the past let s say two decades meyler i think that the judiciary has gained the most power dubner really meyler because with the impasse in the legislative branch almost all questions of significance are getting decided by the judiciary and it means that congress lacks the ability to really override judicial decisions because they just can t agree on enough so for example with a lot of these administrative questions previously congress might have been able to say clarify the meaning of a statute that an administrative agency is implementing by passing some kind of further legislation but now they re not really able to do that so most of these questions wind up getting resolved ultimately by the supreme court dubner now i know that you personally clerked some time back i believe it was for judge robert katzman the u s court of appeals 2nd circuit is that right meyler yes dubner so assure me that you are not exercising your personal judiciary bias in claiming that the judiciary has gained the most leverage over the past so you re going to claim that this is an unbiased assessment of the three branches and that judiciary has gained even more the executive yes meyler i think so yes and i mean i actually wish it weren t the case because there was a whole movement in constitutional law to de center courts and actually obama was obviously a constitutional law professor before becoming president and he was i think on board with a lot of the idea about bringing the legislative branch and the executive more into the realm of constitutional interpretation and de centering courts and i think that s why he partly didn t prioritize judicial nominations but my sense is that that just pragmatically was a mistake because in fact the courts have wound up being the branch to decide on a lot of things precisely because the other branches just can t get along well enough if you want to hear some earlier episodes of ours about the political system you might try no 356 america s hidden duopoly or no 255 ten ideas to make politics less rotten dubner so when we last spoke the topic was whether the u s presidency had become or was on its way to becoming a dictatorship or something similar to that i d love you to just quickly summarize your view back then posner my view back then was that we had developed a system of what i prefer to call presidential primacy there are certain elements of dictatorship in it in the sense that the president has primary authority to determine policy in a wide variety of areas and i think this is a system that s evolved over two centuries it s not the system that the founders gave us eric posner is a law professor at the university of chicago he s one of the most cited legal scholars of this era we last spoke with posner back in 2016 for an episode called has the u s presidency become a dictatorship his answer wasn t a hard yes but he was wary of how much power the executive branch had been accruing dubner so would you say that the intensity or level of what you re calling the primacy has increased stayed roughly the same or diminished posner roughly the same dubner now we also should say when we spoke a bit over three years ago we had a good bit of conversation about donald trump but it was all theoretical because it was highly highly unlikely at the time or thought to be highly unlikely that he would be elected so i d just love to hear you for a minute on how surprised you were and how that perhaps changed the way that you thought about this question largely posner i was surprised and how has it changed the way i think about the question well let s separate two dimensions of the question one is what is the system that we have and the other is should we change it i think the system that we have is the same as it was before trump became president and i am more worried now than i was before he became president that the public would elect people who are unfit to be president so in that sense my view has changed to some extent dubner the implication there is that you believe he is unfit to be president or am i overreaching posner no i do think he s unfit dubner so here s my theory is that the president matters much less than most people think chiefly because the president s ability to make substantial changes that directly affect our lives daily lives is in most cases limited or indirect plainly you disagree give me an example or two of where i m wrong posner well i think part of the problem is what does it mean to matter that s just tricky and i agree with you for example that the president can t come in and revolutionize our system can t make the economy grow much faster or cause a recession but where the president matters for example law enforcement priorities whether the police go after drug users or drug dealers immigration policy as we ve seen recently so if you re an american citizen and all of your friends and family and others are americans you might not notice the effect that the president can have on aliens whether they re here lawfully or not but that s a pretty big effect the president can have and then in the area of foreign policy as we ve seen recently the president can really change things very rapidly dubner if i were to ask you to break down the job of president into the major domains how would you label them posner foreign policy is one domain maybe we ll call the economy the other management of the executive branch is maybe a third dimension dubner and then do we want to have another basket that s something like domestic affairs everything non economic posner we could have a basket for that i mean a lot of people put a lot of weight on the president s appointment of judges which is outside of the executive branch dubner so let s go through and let s start with the economy if i were to just ask you in the three plus years that president trump has been in office how much his actions have affected what we call the economy and what specifically he s done let me just ask you to speak on that for a bit posner the corporate tax cut probably provided a short term boost of no real lasting value but that had an effect on people the deregulation that he s engaging in probably won t have a measurable effect on the economy but will affect people s lives in particular he s been dismantling regulations that were designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so the long term effect of that is meaningful and then i think this ridiculous trade war he s started has generated uncertainty and of course has increased costs for imported products dubner would you have predicted that the markets and the economy generally as evidenced by unemployment would be as healthy as they are and if not what s that say about either his leverage or maybe just our inability to predict anything posner i think that s well established in the literature that generally the economy does what it does and presidents will affect it only on the margin in the case of the deregulatory actions that i told you about well very few of them have actually been put into effect they re working their way through the bureaucracy they re being challenged by courts i should also say that the positive effect of deregulation will be on pure economic indicators but there will be non economic harms that aren t going to show up in some kind of aggregate measure like g d p or something like that so if we re going to have more greenhouse gas emissions they re going to show up 10 20 50 years from now when the climate is somewhat hotter than it would be otherwise dubner okay let s talk about foreign affairs then name some signature decisions moves or non moves that president trump has made posner withdrawal from the paris treaty disengagement from security arrangements with foreign countries the beginning of the trade war and cutting back on refugees and other types of immigration dubner and you didn t even get into north korea iran venezuela israel right posner yeah in those cases he is sort of floundering around more it s a little unclear what he s trying to accomplish dubner so the impeachment of president trump has revolved around his withholding of foreign aid to ukraine what can you tell us about the president s unilateral ability to manage foreign aid posner foreign aid is determined by congress but the president has power to withhold it typically the way these things work is if congress wants to do something with respect to foreign relations it will pass a law saying we want x y z to happen but then there will almost always be a provision that says that if the president thinks it s in the national interest not to do this he can do that the constitution is extremely vague about where foreign policy powers are located it gives the president the commander in chief power not clear whether that means only the power to lead the army or whether it s something broader than that so this vagueness was taken advantage of by presidents over the many years that followed and they basically claimed more and more power over foreign policy and congress acquiesced dubner let s move on to as you put it management of the executive branch what falls under the label of management of the executive branch posner appointing members of the executive branch and setting the policy of the executive branch i think this has not really received that much media attention but he s really changed the priorities of the various immigration agencies they re much stricter than they used to be and he s done this through dozens of i guess executive orders or regulatory actions one trump executive order that got a lot of attention and pushback was the so called muslim immigration ban it effectively directed the department of homeland security to refuse entry into the u s of nationals from iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen posner initially the lower courts struck it down because it was sloppy and kind of stupid he revised it the revision included some countries that weren t predominantly muslim north korea and venezuela posner they struck it down again and they were reversed by the supreme court i think most legal scholars were surprised that trump had as much trouble as he did because there is a statute that says that the president can pretty much block anyone from entering into the country for any reason if he believes that it advances national security i next asked eric posner the same question i d asked bernadette meyler about trump and the power of the bully pulpit posner the bully pulpit is extremely important it s the way that the president gets the public behind him and he needs the public behind him to get congress to act if the president really wants to have a significant long term impact there s a limit to what he can do unilaterally but if he has the public behind him he can get congress to pass laws but there s a big difference between the way trump has used the bully pulpit and i think really all previous presidents all previous presidents i m going to hazard they used the bully pulpit to try to unify the country they tried to convince the public that some new policy serves everybody s interests and everybody should support it trump is not like that he uses the bully pulpit to divide people immigration is an important example where he disparages not only undocumented immigrants but also more broadly hispanics muslims from other countries and in a winking way sometimes signals support for white nationalists or white supremacists dubner so as you re speaking it strikes me there maybe needs to be one more basket of presidential activities that we re ranking this president has been aggressive not just in language but in action as have other presidents to be fair but this president has gotten inside the head of a lot of people he s done many things to create anxiety and anger so if we were to consider presidential behavior or carriage another category how much do you think that really matters posner there are all these people who go back and rate presidents and people have even rated how virtuous they are how honest they are and so forth and the worst presidents warren harding for example they re not in trump s league harding was kind of a weakling who didn t try to stop other corrupt people in his cabinet even once he knew about it but he wasn t a dishonest person in his private life he was just pretty much an ordinary politician we ve got someone in the presidency who s a liar dishonest who s he s a philanderer some presidents have been like that but not that many what effect does it have it makes a lot of people angry it sort of contributes to the polarization does it damage the presidency in some long term way maybe i m not sure about that dubner so let s maybe we should call this category virtue do you think it s substantial enough to be separate or not quite posner i think it deserves its own category because it s important to distinguish trump from any old regular republican president so republican presidents come into office they cut taxes they deregulate and in many respects he s no different from that but in this special category what he does in all the other categories is he warps public policy to advance his narrow political interest at the expense of his political opponents in a way that s damaging dubner so here are a couple sentences that you wrote not long ago it is critical to distinguish trump s bark from his bite he has disparaged judges called the media the enemy of the people praised torture and compared the intelligence community to nazis but he has not followed up on these statements you write unlike franklin d roosevelt he hasn t tried to pack the supreme court not that trump needs to you added unlike barack obama you wrote he hasn t yet targeted journalists in leak investigations unlike george w bush you wrote he hasn t actually taken a page from the nazis by ordering the intelligence community to use coercive interrogation so again thinking in terms of leverage or how much the president matters it sounds like you re describing someone that s positioning themselves as an attack dog but is actually a watchdog if not a lapdog posner i wouldn t call trump a lapdog trump s most aggressive behavior i think has been in international relations he s really attacked a bipartisan consensus in favor of free trade american military engagement and in fact the republicans seem to be although muted as unhappy about this as democrats are from just a narrowly constitutional perspective he does seem less aggressive than his predecessors which is not to say at all that he s a better president i think he s far worse than any of his predecessors but in a way this is what my point has been all along which is the presidents we like often are the really powerful ones who break the rules because those rules are out of date and old fashioned and reflect values that we no longer agree with dubner let s say a given person feels that trump is as bad a president as could possibly exist given the norms of american politics even if you believe that and then you look around at how the country is now and probably will be in five and ten years can you really make the argument that the president him or herself matters so much because if one believes this is the worst president ever shouldn t the country have suffered much much more already or perhaps you re arguing it may and we can t tell yet posner well he can be the worst president ever without being infinitely worse than the second worst being a bad president is not the same thing as having an impact so you could say someone s the worst president ever and still think that presidents in general don t have much of an impact i mean we could have a president who is like a declared fascist who still didn t accomplish very much it s just it s hard to say in the abstract what it means to have an impact if you think for example that climate change is the absolutely most essential issue of our time and what trump has done is moved us back several years at a really important time then maybe he will be the worst and most consequential president ever but if you don t think climate change rises to that level of importance then he ll seem like he had less of an impact dubner but there are other variables in that formula for instance climate change it seems is starting to be addressed aggressively and often well by technological solutions and breakthroughs that are the result of millions of people working on thousands of different projects obviously the president could do something about that for good he could also do something about it for ill but again it comes back to me to the leverage of this one person or this one office it s very comforting to think that one person can make things great or terrible it goes back to thomas carlyle s great man theory of history and i think there is a kind of religious connotation there when we assign that much power to one person or one office i think it in some way alleviates some of the pressure or responsibility for ourselves as individuals but i m perfectly satisfied with you not buying that one iota posner no i think people are worried about the president being too powerful and don t take comfort in the idea that one person for example destroyed the entire world by launching a nuclear war so i m not sure i agree with you if the question is how much effect can the national government whether controlled by the president or someone else realistically have on people s lives ah i don t even know how to begin to answer that question i mean it could if it wanted to destroy everybody s life but if we look throughout history sometimes it s had enormous effect and sometimes it s had no effect and i guess i find it hard to assign a number in the abstract but we did ask eric posner and bernadette meyler and glenn hubbard to assign a number on a scale of one to 10 for how much the president matters for each of the major domains we ve been talking about today you ll hear posner first then meyler then hubbard we ll start with the economy posner three meyler i would say seven hubbard i would say one to 10 the president matters six or seven for the economy how about foreign policy posner let s call it seven meyler eight hubbard foreign policy the president matters nine to 10 management of the executive branch posner let s call it six meyler eight hubbard for management of the executive branch i would put the president at five to six it is the president s branch but so much of that management is done by cabinet officers control over the judiciary posner seven meyler eight hubbard eight to 10 if the president is fortunate enough to have a senate that agrees with him or her then that s control how about domestic affairs including the bully pulpit posner nine meyler two or three hubbard i would give that a seven i think economists might generally say not so important but i would say yes important people look to a leader as a gauge of mood of what s going on in the country that would be true in any organization and finally as we agreed to call the final category virtue posner eight meyler i would say nine hubbard i would give it a seven i think virtue matters a lot certainly matters a lot to me personally but i can also think of virtuous presidents that weren t terribly effective dubner for instance hubbard jimmy carter dubner and can you think of people who were a little scoundrel y on the virtue scale that were very effective presidents hubbard i would put richard nixon in that category dubner and where would you put clinton in that category hubbard clinton would definitely be an effective person who had some virtue challenges if you were to assume equal weighting of all the categories a terrible idea if you re trying to come up with a remotely scientific answer which this is not you d find eric posner saying the president matters about six and two thirds on a scale of 1 to 10 bernadette myler a hair above seven and glenn hubbard just shy of seven and a half so fairly consistent rankings from our experts although quite a lot of inconsistency within categories but also that number is fairly well short of a 9 or 10 ranking which is to say that yes the presidency of the united states is an obviously powerful position with more power having accrued perhaps in recent decades but is it possible that maybe just maybe some of us sometimes slightly overemphasize just how much leverage the president has i m going to let you answer that question for yourself once you ve calmed down a bit drop us a line at radio freakonomics com and tell us just how infuriating this episode was but do try to calm down a bit first because things are only going to get rockier through election day and there s new evidence suggesting that elections are

thanks pierre and good morning everyone 2019 was a phenomenal year for spirit and our shareholders in terms of operating and financial results we capped off three years of tireless effort by our entire team and board with substantial improvements to our operations portfolio leadership balance sheet and technology these changes resulted in spirit becoming a simplified triple net reit that can generate predictable earnings and dividend growth you will note in our earnings release that we re increasing our previously stated 2020 full year affo per share guidance which mike will lay out in his remarks as we look forward into 2020 we have a solid pipeline of acquisition opportunities and are seeing positive momentum from the changes we made to our acquisition process with the collaboration between our acquisition and asset management teams i m grateful that we were able to provide investors with a comprehensive view of our team and our business approach at our investor day event this past december we are utilizing the systems tools and processes that we presented on a daily basis enabling us to consistently produce solid operating and financial results other notable accomplishments in 2019 were investments of 1 34 billion in real estate assets that we aligned with our views on industry credit and real estate underwriting our successful return to the capital markets issuing over 700 million in common equity and 1 2 billion of unsecured bonds receiving credit upgrades from both s p and fitch to bbb and delivering total shareholder returns of 48 as a result of our success over the last three years spirit has a favorable cost of capital which makes us competitive in a much larger pool of potential acquisitions with our current team and platform we are well positioned to achieve our strategic and operating goals for 2020 and beyond now on to a rundown of our fourth quarter operating results and key metrics we generated affo per diluted share of 0 76 and ended the quarter with annualized contractual rents of 461 million we had strong operational performance on all fronts with portfolio occupancy of 99 7 lost rent of 0 3 and 1 4 property cost leakage which is a reflection of our active asset management and portfolio quality our adjusted debt to annualized adjusted ebitdare was 4 9 times our public tenant exposure was 49 and our weighted average lease term was 9 8 years our systems operations refine processes and people give us keen insights into our tenants the financial health operating performance and the industry dynamics we re seeing the benefit of consistently ranking evaluating and monitoring the real estate markets credit fundamentals and trade areas that underpin the 1 752 properties that we own all of this critical data is accessible through our technology platform and shapes our capital allocation decisions turning to capital allocation we acquired 139 properties totaling 574 8 million and invested an additional 14 8 million in revenue producing capital with an initial cash yield of 7 55 an economic yield of 8 18 and average annual rent escalators of 1 8 the investment activity represented key tenant attributes that we are looking for including publicly listed tenants existing relationships favorable industries solid lease structures and organic rent growth the acquisitions this quarter represented 18 different industries and we re accretive to our property rankings approximately 39 4 of the total investment was derived from public issuers and our properties represent key real estate for their underlying businesses our top 20 tenancy remains very diversified with our largest tenant only accounting for 2 9 of our contractual rents since last quarter our top 20 tenant exposure fell by 160 basis points to 36 9 and our top 10 exposure fell by 170 basis points to 22 2 of contractual rents the percentage of our tenants with flat rents fell by 200 basis points to 11 2 of our contractual rents our top 20 tenancy will continue to evolve as we execute our investment and disposition strategy and in the fourth quarter carmax was a new addition to our top 20 during the quarter we disposed of four occupied and seven vacant properties totaling 23 8 million the occupied properties were sold at an 8 73 cap rate over 60 of the gross disposition proceeds were related to the sale of a shopping center in broadview illinois this shopping center had approximately 12 4 leakage on the in place rents as there was some vacancy and we were able to carve out the and retain the home depot that anchored the center this is a great example of the targeted dispositions we spoke about when we initially set our 2019 disposition guidance the gravy on this disposition is that it both enhances our portfolio while keeping a target tenant like home depot before i pass it off to mike i want to reiterate what we re solving for here at spirit it s predictable earnings and dividend growth with a competitive cost of capital we have a very high quality portfolio defined and disciplined investment strategy a fortress balance sheet strong operating systems and outstanding people that are working together to achieve this goal for our shareholders with that i ll turn it over to mike mike michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jack and good morning i think i speak for everyone at spirit when i say that we are very pleased with the quarter and a strong finish to the year hope that all of you listening today had the opportunity to attend our investor day in new york we did a deep dive into our processes our underwriting technology and people if you missed it fear not the entire five hour webcast is still available under the investor relations tab of our website starting with the balance sheet we ended the year with leverage which we define as adjusted debt to annualized adjusted ebitdare of 4 9 times near the low end of our guidance range during the fourth quarter we did issue 2 7 million shares of common stock under our atm program for gross proceeds of 140 6 million which will allow us to maintain low leverage despite robust acquisition activity in december we repaid one cmbs mortgage with a loan balance of 42 4 million the loan carried an interest rate of 4 67 and was scheduled to mature in september of 2022 as a result of the repayment we unencumbered 12 properties with a gross book value of 80 million and recognized debt extinguishment cost of 2 8 million at year end 90 of our debt and 93 of our rents were unsecured in addition we maintain 698 million of liquidity consisting of cash and availability and our revolving line of credit now turning to the p l we reported fourth quarter affo per share of 0 76 and full year affo per share of 3 34 both at the high end of our guidance range annualized contractual rent which annualizes the contractual rent in place at quarter end were 39 8 million compared to last quarter approximately 43 8 million of the increase was attributable to acquisitions and contractual rent increases offset by a reduction of 3 million attributable to dispositions and 1 million to vacancies as jackson mentioned operations are running very smoothly with high occupancy minimal lost rent and low leakage as our portfolio continues to experience very minimal tenant disruption while our financial statements were fairly straightforward this quarter i do want to provide some color around a couple of items on the income statement first we recognized 11 7 million loss on the sale of a multi tenant power center which warrants a little explanation when that asset was acquired the purchase price was allocated equally across the square footage and land acreage of the entire property however when we sold the property we carved out and retained the anchor tenant which as jackson mentioned was home depot since the actual market value of the anchor tenant was far greater than the residual value of the remaining power center but the book value was spread equally across the asset the sale resulted in a book loss now i point this out because this is a case where the book loss was not representative of an actual loss of economic value and second we recognized an income tax gain during the fourth quarter of 229 000 which was also a bit unusual the gain was a result of a reduction in taxable income for taxable losses incurred during the fourth quarter which related to the income tax expense of 11 2 million recognized during the third quarter following the 48 2 million management termination fee payment from smta to src now generally we are only subject to state and local tax which on a normalized run rate basis should equate to approximately 200 000 per quarter so please keep that in mind for your models going forward now i ll spend just a few minutes highlighting some of the changes to our disclosure materials that we rolled out this morning these changes were implemented to address shareholder feedback improve the presentation of key metrics and remove duplicative information and you ve hopefully had the chance to see this morning the earnings release has been significantly streamlined by removing year to date references financial results portfolio and balance sheet highlights and other information as duplicative with the information now provided in our earnings supplemental this streamlining will save time and cost and based on shareholders feedback that they would rather see all important information consolidated into the earnings supplemental our earnings supplemental received a major overhaul this quarter with a refreshed look and improved layout some important additions to note in our new supplemental are the addition of an earnings highlights page an overview of key portfolio operational and balance sheet metrics the disclosure of lost rent and leakage which we feel are important metrics a reconciliation to net operating income a breakdown of the current quarter s acquisitions by industry as well as our average annual rent escalations our property count by state a breakdown of our portfolio by real estate value square footage and annualized rent expanded credit metrics disclosures a new portfolio breakdown disclosure by asset type and industry and a new organic rent growth disclosure that shows our average rent escalations for our entire portfolio over the next 12 months there are a couple of important subtractions to note as well first we are now disclosing only our top 20 tenants in our earnings supplemental given the competitive environment that we operate in we feel that continuing to disclose our top 100 concepts every quarter puts us at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis our public peers and private competitors all of who are seeking new tenants every day keep in mind that we will still disclose all of our concepts annually in the schedule iii included in our 10 k second we removed our disclosure of same store rent growth after much thought and deliberation we concluded that the same store metric was not meaningful for several reasons it was backward looking captured less than 80 of our contractual rent a year had to pass before newly acquired leases could be added to the metric and does not provide insights into portfolio s health now same store rent growth has been replaced by the aforementioned disclosure of forward 12 month lease escalations which captures 100 of our leases at each reporting period and provides investors with a forward looking growth rate that is actually relevant for their forecasting in regards to portfolio health as we have mentioned many times our management team focuses on lost rent simply put lost rent is the difference between what we are owed by tenants and what is paid which we believe is the ultimate lead indicator of tenant issues as mentioned before we added that disclosure to our supplemental package we hope that you will find all these changes useful now turning to guidance due to the steady operations we are experiencing across our portfolio and the stability in our tenant base we are updating our full year affo per share guidance previously provided in december we are raising our projected affo per share range from 3 12 to 3 17 up to 3 14 to 3 18 all other guidance ranges remain unchanged with capital deployment comprising acquisitions revenue producing capital and redevelopments from 700 million to 900 million dispositions from 100 million to 150 million and leverage from 5 0 times to 5 4 times one other item i want to point out for your models relates to interest income for this year now i mentioned on our last earnings call and at investor day that we anticipate receiving an early mortgage repayments from a borrower during the fourth quarter that borrower ultimately revoked their prepayment notice and the early mortgage repayments did not occur therefore we ended the year with 34 5 million in mortgage receivables however all the remaining mortgage receivables are scheduled to mature this year which will result in less interest income compared to the fourth quarter 2019 run rate the largest mortgage receivable the balance of 23 7 million matures in the third quarter with the remaining mortgages maturing in the fourth quarter just under 1 million of interest income is forecasted in our guidance for 2020 and finally i want to provide some color regarding our thinking around our common dividend for this year while we feel our dividend is well covered and is very sustainable over time we would like to migrate toward a more conservative affo payout ratio of 75 we believe we ll better position the company for long term growth and better total returns for our shareholders we intend to reach this payout ratio through earnings growth therefore i would anticipate keeping our common dividend payment as current annualized rate of 2 50 per common share for the intermediate term as always our ultimate common dividend payment will be determined by our board of directors and with that i will open the call for questions questions and answers operator our first question is coming from greg mcginniss of scotiabank please go ahead greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst hey good morning jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer good morning greg greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst mike i just want to clarify one of your opening comments so it sounds like affo per share guidance was raised due to less than expected tenant fallout am i interpreting that comment correctly michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah if you remember back on investor day kind of walked through reserves that we put in place within our guidance just to account for things that happen and we re just seeing better stability in our tenant base than our reserves within our guidance so it s things just going well and so as a result we took up our guidance based on really good operations greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst okay thanks and then jackson you mentioned the top 20 tenants is going to continue to evolve what should we expect that evolution to look like is that just a shift toward more of the public tenants the b and bb rated companies that you had mentioned at the investor day or is this kind of a different type or size of assets any info there would be appreciated jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer yeah good morning thanks it s more or less the same as we talked about at the investor day our top 20 tenants as you know are pretty tight relative to percentage difference between our number one tenant and number 20 they re very close together what i would tell you is some of the things that we re sort of focused on right now obviously our industrial assets qsr grocery home improvement dollar stores auto service warehouse clubs education and auto parts so we re seeking those currently we re not going to shy away from c stores or healthcare health and fitness or casual dining as well but that s generally kind of what we re going to focus on public tenants in those categories within our heat map that we re focused on and we feel like there is adequate opportunity out in the market right now but i do expect some shifting in our top 20 as we continue through the year greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst and that s going to be just based on additional based on acquisitions not on dispositions jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer yeah probably more definitely more on acquisitions there might be some slight we re always looking to try to improve the portfolio and so when we get an opportunity to you got a very liquid portfolio and it s granular so when we see an opportunity to move an asset out that we think doesn t really rank well within a master lease or opportunity like thator we do a blend and extend we ll try to monetize that because the market is obviously very liquid right now in terms of buying and selling at the moment greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst all right thank you jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator thank you our next question is coming from haendel st juste of mizuho please go ahead haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst hey good morning michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst so i was hoping you guys could talk a bit more about some of the investment opportunities that you are looking at that align with your heat map your improved cost of capital i guess what i m intrigued about is the recent outparcel deal with washington prime i m curious if you could comment around that how intense the bidding process was are you inclined to do more of these types of deals and maybe some commentary on the split between ground and fee simple but interest first in that can you comment overall on the acquisition marketplace and what you re looking at as well thanks jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer sure haendel hey thanks good morning look the washington prime deal to be honest is a relatively small transaction and we re in the kind of legal documentation due diligence portion of it at this point i wouldn t call that like bright yellow new strategy for us it s just in the normal course we re talking with owners of property we re talking with tenants and opportunities like that will continue to evolve as we roll out our acquisition program but we re looking for it s pretty consistent as i mentioned on the previous question i highlighted some of the real priority industries that we re looking at that i just mentioned and other things that i didn t mention we still like car wash we still like auto dealers to be honest we re not afraid of home decor and furnishing it s a very small portion of our portfolio and we like what we own we re not going to increase it dramatically but we re sort of set up right now haendel where if you look at our kind of tenant exposure and just proportion of contribution from our top 20 tenants we just have a lot of ability to sort of move and influence the portfolio if you look at what we ve done in the last year we reshaped about 30 of our portfolio we bought 1 3 billion of assets sold 260 million so for us we can dramatically change the shape of this portfolio that s one of the opportunities i think that s exciting for us good cost of capital not too small not too big and yet by kind of doing business like we did last year we can have a meaningful influence on the shape of this portfolio so i would expect if we can do 20 to 30 reshaping as we re going through over the next few years this is going to be a pretty exciting portfolio and balance sheet going forward haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst i appreciate that and maybe a bit more on what you re looking at today just curious how the the of the sizing of the opportunity compares to maybe a year ago and do you have anything under under contract in discussion loi that you re willing to share jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer on loi no we talked a little bit about washington prime right so we ll just leave it at that but i mean look if you kind of think about this past year i was kind of chuckling with the team last year on this call we mentioned smta 26 times on our prepared remarks and the other s company was shopko which filed bankruptcy right around january of this year early last year so when you think about our cost of capital back in january last year it was around 7 today it s just under sub 5 so our opportunity bandwidth of what we can look at from a cap rate range has widened dramatically and so we re kind of diligently kind of going through those opportunities right now that s the thing that s most interesting i think for our platform we re trying to match up simply said we re trying to buy assets where the tenants can pay rent through the entire term and at the end of the term be able to release it at a comparable rent either the guy we extend with renewal option or we can find a new tenant so it s sort of a simple idea but industries matter credit matters buying good real estate matters all those things so i would just describe it with our cost of capital improving our menu of things that we can look at is much wider and so we re still being diligent and careful and all the normal things that we should running a company like this haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst got it if i could michael can you follow up clarify the comment on the dividend is it your intent to lock in the payout at a fixed 75 of affo or are you just giving a guidance what you want to get that payout ratio to on a longer term basis michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah no i m not trying to be rigid and format a lockstep policy because my philosophy is it s a similar philosophy i ve taken to the balance sheet it s a little bit more conservative than i think spirit has been in the past is just to migrate toward that 70 payout ratio so we have enough free cash flow to create a lot of organic growth which i think would create a lot of long term total return for our shareholders we re a little high now we re just above 80 and i think as we get through this year we ll definitely migrate down to 70 so i don t it will take us too long to get to that point but it s more of a philosophy to get to that 75 range and then from there we can work around that range and the dividend will go up over time more in lockstep with earnings growth in that point it won t be perfect but we ll definitely stay right around that number once we hit it haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst got it thank you for that operator thank you our next question is coming from shivanisood of deutsche bank please go ahead shivanisood deutsche bank analyst hey good morning just taking haendel s question in a slightly different way can you give us some color on the cadence we should expect throughout the year from acquisition or investment timing perspective jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer we don t give quarterly guidance you know for acquisitions shivani but what i will tell you is in the fourth quarter i think we closed eight transactions our medium term goals are to try to get that number somewhere between 15 to 20 transactions closed per quarter i believe this quarter we ll have more than eight transactions i can tell you that that we ll close feel pretty confident about that but no i mean we re it s hard to we re pretty specific about what we want and so it s really hard to try to say hey we want to buy x amount per quarter because we really don t want to get forced into buying things that s one thing i would say to you and the other thing is we obviously want to do more business with our existing tenants if you remember from our investor day one of the things that we really want to do is further integrate that asset management and acquisition platform trying to really utilize our large tenant base where there s really good opportunity and that creates a better predictable pipeline i d say the other thing that we re doing is once again just trying to pick our spots like if we think there is an opportunity that s going to have like 10 bidders i mean that s probably we re not going to spend time there we re trying to be more selective in terms of what we want to buy how we want to spend our time we re not just going to go pay the most of all the market because we ve got attractive cost of capital so that s i don t know if it s a great way to answer the question but that s we don t really sort of try to fill it straight line across the year shivanisood deutsche bank analyst fair enough and then just the recapture rate for the year can you share that kenneth heimlich executive vice president and head of asset management yeah shivani this is ken we ended 2019 a shade under 100 i think it came in at 98 shivanisood deutsche bank analyst thanks so much jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from brian hawthorne of rbc capital markets please go ahead brian hawthorne rbc capital markets analyst hi good morning guys can you talk about your expectations for broker versus relationship deals this year jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer look we d love to categorically do more relationship deals but part of it is sometimes relationship tenants don t need money so you have to so i think that s an aspirational idea that we want to try to develop and it s hard to put a predictor on what it is put it this way i would rather do a broker transaction that s a good piece of real estate in the right industry versus a relationship deal that s over rented and not in the right industry you know what i mean so i would say of our 290 tenants we don t want to do repeat business with all of them just not that we don t like all of them but some we have higher priority on because of where they sit kind of in our industry map and just generally what s going on with those tenants but i would say overall all the work that we re doing with operationally in terms of working collectively with our asset management team and acquisition team together is to attack that ability to do more relationship business it s clearly better more predictable but i couldn t put a hard and fast percentage i think one quarter it could be really high the next quarter it could be lowe really feel like i said we re pretty diligent on just the types of things that we re trying to buy and then i would say relationship is also really important brian hawthorne rbc capital markets analyst sure okay that makes sense and then how comfortable are you with your movie theater assets and do you have the unit level coverage for them jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer we do i d say overall most of our movie theater let me just answer the question so we like the dine in concept and as you know as part of the spin off we were able to move a lot of what i d call big box movie theaters out of the portfolio a lot of the carmikes we did acquire a regional portfolio as part of the svc transaction in the fourth quarter it s a private operator and so generally i would say that our sweet spot is dine in type concepts we re not really looking at megaplexes anymore at this point with the big operators i would say that in that movie theater portfolio that we bought with svc we priced that appropriately for what it is i don t think we would normally go buying things like that but as part of a portfolio we understood it and we re willing to buy it and we felt we got it at attractive price but i would say yeah we ve got a good balance of unit coverage and things like that in our portfolio but we don t have as you know a lot of movie theaters relative to some of our where we were before in term of just overall rent contribution brian hawthorne rbc capital markets analyst got it okay thank you for taking my questions jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer yeah one other thing just one last thing on that just as a follow up too on the regionals there is some of the antitrust laws are changing in the movie industry that were passed historically so one of the things that we you might see going forward in the future is possibly more consolidation of regional operators by the big three because there are still some antitrust changes relative to the movie distribution laws and things like that so that could be also hopefully maybe a potential tenant upgrade in some of our regional operators brian hawthorne rbc capital markets analyst would you look to acquire more movie theaters then in that scenario jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer well i think we are looking at movie theaters but the type we are doing are kind of more of the studio movie grill type where it s really experiential dine in we think that it s really important to have that dine in experience we also like those types of venues because they tend to be smaller where they can rent the space out for corporate use which is kind of they re just different than sort of these large megaplexes in terms of different types of use and different profitability margins in those units brian hawthorne rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you thank you for taking the time jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is coming from adam gabalski of morgan stanley please go ahead adam gabalski morgan stanley analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question just given some of the recent headlines about art van just kind of wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about your thoughts on the furniture space then if you ve seen any changes in unit level coverage with at home jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer yeah okay so first of all on some big kind of a big question but on furnishing and decor we re just under 5 in terms of exposure from a contractual rent standpoint we actually like the business as it relates to kind of the difference the way we see it between home furnishings and decor where decor for us is interesting because it s lower rent per square foot generally in the boxes they ve got generally 10times the skus in home decor versus like furniture like for instance like at home the average basket is about 65 versus in a home furnishing unit it s about 1 300 and they generally in home decor units they operate at 2 times the margins than furnishing so those are all kind of good things in our home decor bucket at home generates about 85 of our total rent we still like at home we think that we like it the real estate they operate in we ve got 12 units there they are in two master leases with three single site properties so we re very comfortable with the rent per square foot of what they re doing i would say on the art van question we only own one of those units and it s a legacy asset that was part of the cole acquisition the art van is attached to our shopping center one of our four power centers that we own so and the rent is less than 600 000 so we re generally pretty comfortable we haven t bought anart van so that s not and one of the reasons like i said we like home furnishings and we like home decor it s just that if you look at sort of what we own in those units in furnishings it s big sandy which we picked up in the svc transaction which is a a regional operator it s privately owned very high coverage raymour la z boy and ashley and they re pretty that s pretty they re generally equal contribution in terms of rent so we don t have a lot of art van but we do like home furnishings and decor and we ll continue to selectively look at it the one other thing i would say is within that portfolio of home furnishing and decor we only have two pe backed owned companies in the portfolio one of them is obviously the art van one unit and then we have another operator that s pe backed in the home decor side so we sort of like our exposure at this point and if we see opportunities we will be very selective about it adam gabalski morgan stanley analyst got it that s really helpful and then just one more were there any sort of one time acquisitions or any things that move the needle as far as the initial yields on the acquisitions this quarter that seem to jump up a bit jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer i mean really it s the it s that portfolio that we bought that made a big difference like i said we i think if you were at the investor day we arevery excited about that transaction we thought we the seller needed kind of had an objective to close before year end we were able to pick up tremendous amount of qsrs and casual dining yields that we knew really well and one of the cost of doing business was we had to pick up a movie theater portfolio which we talked about in the last question but overall yeah that one drove a lot of that obviously the activity in the fourth quarter but i think you ll see more sort of i ll call it normal sized transactions going forward which are i ll call them that somewhere in the circa 10 million to 20 million range adam gabalski morgan stanley analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from john massocca of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst good morning jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer good morning john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst so if you think about i think about the acquisition volume outside of the svc transaction what kind of were the big tenant industry thrust there jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer i mean we focused we did obviously we brought the at home portfolio last year we bought some restaurant portfolios carwash portfolios we bought distribution assets they are pretty diversified if you think about it outside of the svc transaction and as i kind of laid out for you our real focus point this year is i talked about our i ll call it my green category which is i laid out on earlier question things like qsr grocery home improvement dollar stores auto service warehouses warehouse clubs we ve got more bandwidth and interest in those areas so i would think that based on what i said on that earlier question we re going to trying to fill those buckets and once again we want to make sure that the credit is right real estate is good granular and liquid so those would be the principal things that we ll look at john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay and then it looks like the carmax additional carmax assets came from svc but one other place one othertenant that you saw kind of move up a couple of ranks in the total exposure was gpm i mean how did you source that transaction kenneth heimlich executive vice president and head of asset management hey john this is ken that was the movement of gpm up was actually a result of us putting assigning an existing cng lease with a different tenant over to gpm we felt like it made a lot of sense we greatly increased the strength of our tenant for those properties so that technically wasn t i would call it an acquisition it was more an existing tenant that assign their lease to gpm john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that makes sense and then touching on another industry that s been in the news recently from a tenant credit perspective what is your long term view on franchise restaurant and has that changed at all given some of the recent struggles in that space jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer well i mean we like restaurants and what s critical about restaurants is get the right tenant get the right credit get the right real estate get the right rent per square foot in the svc transaction we picked up steadily eight restaurants what i can tell you is that today we don t have any crystal burger in the portfolio we don t have any granite city brewery we don t have any american blue ribbon we don t have any sd holdings you knowsonic we don t have any mpc and we have no pizza huts in the portfolio so i mean like our restaurants are we like them but you ve got to be really selective on who the operator is last year we did a transaction up and up in the salt lake area with a portfolio we will see this as one of the it was the chuck a rama portfolio those guys were there at with trident at our investor day we re looking for quality niches and operators and balance sheets and real estate that kind of fit that parameter so we continue to look for those but we want to be really selective we ve got look very nice portfolio of restaurants and casual dining and that s an area especially in the qsr side we want to continue to increase john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay and then one last detailed question i know you ve removed disclosures so i promise i won t ask it every quarter but what would same store kind of noi growth have been or same store rent growth have been in 4q 19 michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it would have been about 28 the challenge we re running into that would have been 70 some odd percent of our portfolio given all the acquisition volume intense we ve added so 28 would have been q4 jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer and john if you look at it for the over the whole year based on how we announced the quarters the overall would have been like 1 225 for the year and roughly 80 of the portfolio john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that s it for me thank you very much jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer thank you michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next question is coming from chris lucas of capital one securities please go ahead chris lucas capital one securities analyst hey good morning guys just two quick ones for me mike just as it relates to guidance for next year how should we think about g a for the year as it relates to the percentage of revenue or percentage of assets or something michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would think of it more just the dollar amount i think it s going to be flat 2019 if you actually look at it it s beenflat sinceabout 2016 so i wouldn t see any movement in that obviously as we increase revenues it will become less of a percentage of revenue but i think about more justthe dollar amount being flat for 2019 chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay great thanks for that and then jackson just sort of a bigger picture question i appreciate the additional disclosures particularly as it relates to sort of where the rent and investments have gone up as it relates to the size of asset i guess that raises the question for me which is are you if you had a bias is it the industry or is it the granularity jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer to me it starts with industry first i d say granular let me i ll give you kind of my rankings industry first which means industry and credit second would be good real estate which means good location good rent per square foot and then granular will be next and then i guess liquid as always really important i want to make sure whatever we buy we could sell chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay great thank you i appreciate that nothing else from me michael hughes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next question is coming from ki bin kim of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks just a bigger topic question what are the couple of main reasons why you re not selling more i would imagine that is a good environment to sell cap rates are tight interest rates are low and the economy is doing well so why not take this opportunity to prune your profile even further jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer we were always trying to prune i mean we sold 260 million this past year and if you think about what we pruned like one of the shopping centers that we sold we still we carve out the home depot to keep it and we sold the balance of the center for about 8 5 cap that made tons of sense i think we will continue to sell and we re actually without getting specifically what we re trying to do right now is improve quality within each of the industry boxes that we invest in so there might be an opportunity for instance in c stores we like our circle case and we think there might be an opportunity to add more recycle so one of the things that we re doing keeping us as we re talking about these priority sectors that we re investing in we re also looking at and we can do this through our rankings to be able to take off the bottom to the extent we can now taking off the bottom i mean just selling outright or working on blending spend selling those assets or selling weaker units or selling units that are not as favorable for us out of a master lease so i think selling properties will continue to be an important part of what we re doing going forward and so yeah we are definitely focused on it we aren t talking about it too much but we have the tools to be able to kind of target what we want to sell so that won t be sort of continue to be an important part of what we try to do ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and any quick update on your casual dining in terms of like coverage or trends and financials jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer ken do you want to take that one kenneth heimlich executive vice president and head of asset management yeah sure very very stable we don t have a all of our casual dining we do monitor they tend to get unit level in corporate level and what i can tell you is that we re very comfortable with it ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from spenser allaway of green street advisors please go ahead spenser allaway green street advisors analyst thank you just one quick one from me just in regards to your office exposure can you remind us how you guys are thinking about that particular property type right now and if there s any intention to reduce or grow that exposure jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer i think if you especially in the investor day i talked about potentially office getting as high as 5 i was referring to professional office so what you would consider you and i would consider an office building today the way we categorize it is about 3 1 in terms of awaiting for us in terms of industry the way we categorize office in our disclosures medical offices and the data centers and others so i wouldn t say office is a huge thrust for us like i said like that bofatransaction was really interesting for us in maryland it s not a core growth area for us i mean we ve got other areas that we re prioritizing on but if it ever crept up i could see it maybe someday getting up to 5 at some point spenser allaway green street advisors analyst and then maybe just one more you did talk about in your prepared remarks obviously your improved cost of capital and how that s widened the net in terms of what you guys are looking at for acquisitions would it be safe to say that your cost of capital does continue to improve throughout 20 you guys could get more aggressive on the external growth front jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer for us we re constantly trying to improve the portfolio so i d say no to be honest with you like because we don t want to buy things but we don t think it makes sensewhere a tenant can pay rent through the term and there s lots of things to buy i mean it s like i m telling you like we our universe got a lot wider but that doesn t mean we want to buy more necessarily so we re just trying to be selective and i think ki bin raised that question we re also looking at and trying to improve the quality of the portfolio so we have a mindful eye of buying and still selling just to constantly improve spenser allaway green street advisors analyst okay thank you operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to jackson for any additional or closing comments jackson hsieh president and chief executive officer okay thank you very much well look as i reflect back we re as a team super excited here if you think about where we were last year during the call i mean we had way more things that we re juggling and having to deal with at this point we re focused on executing our business plan and we re excited that you also have interest in us and we ll try to do a good job so thank you very much operator duration 51

quarter of 2019 decreased by 28 4 million or 17 from the previous quarter the decrease in revenues was due to lower rates in the gulf of mexico the seasonal slowdown in the north sea and lower 15k irs

trader john bishop works monday on the floor of the new york stock exchange associated press financial markets sounded the alarm monday about the relentless spread and widening economic impact of the coronavirus which after ravaging china now threatens havoc on a global scale the dow jones industrial average sank by more than 1 000 points or 3 5 in the worst day for the stock market in two years as wall street interpreted disease clusters in south korea italy and iran as a sign that the disease has outraced confinement efforts in china traders sought safety in u s government bonds gold and high dividend stocks like utilities and real estate the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to the lowest level in more than three years technology stocks accounted for much of the broad market slide which wiped out all of the dow s and s p 500 s gains for the year factories around the world are grappling with parts shortages as their chinese suppliers struggle to resume normal operations as global economic engines sputter the federal reserve and other central banks are facing calls for emergency help but central bank chiefs may be ill equipped to battle the economic consequences of the flu like illness interest rates are already in negative territory in europe and near historic lows in the united states and making credit less expensive the fed s standard tool for combating a slump may offset some of the financial upheaval but will do little to remedy broken supply chains or ease worker and consumer fears of contagion there s just growing angst in the investor community that this thing is more serious than we realized said chris meekins an analyst with raymond james and former trump administration preparedness official when you re worried about catching a disease you re not going to go out to dinner you re not going to go to the movies or sporting events or concerts the only question is how widespread this becomes after weeks of playing down the likely impact outside china investors on monday rushed into traditional safe havens sending the price of gold soaring as government bond yields which move opposite prices plumbed new depths oil also fell into bear market territory amid expectations of prolonged global weakness it may not be an actual pandemic yet but it s an economic pandemic said diane swonk chief economist for grant thornton it s global in scope and disrupting activity around the world monday s markets action showed the rapid evolution of the coronavirus from a limited threat to supply chains into an across the board tightening of financial conditions said gregory daco chief u s economist for oxford economics a spike in volatility may prompt businesses to hit the pause button on planned investments and as nervous global investors sought safety in u s assets they pushed up the value of the u s dollar that will make imported goods for american consumers less expensive chilling inflation and leaving the fed farther from hitting its goal of 2 annual price increases which the central bank sees as a sign of a healthy economy as a result some investors now expect the fed to cut rates to counteract some of the economic weakness the fed can t eliminate all the risks on its own said daco what the fed can do it prevent a worsening of the situation gold a safe haven in times of turmoil climbed 1 6 to 1 675 an ounce brent crude the global benchmark skidded 5 4 on worries the outbreak will subdue demand for months to come china is the world s largest energy consumer but it has been buying less crude amid virus related travel restrictions meanwhile major oil producers have yet to reach a deal on emergency measures to scale back output the drop in oil prices will ramp up pressure on opec the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and russia to reduce oil supplies at an upcoming meeting in march u s stock markets ended last week in decline with the tech heavy nasdaq shedding 1 79 on friday technology stocks like apple amazon and google parent alphabet were hit particularly hard meanwhile the yield on the 30 year treasury fell to an all time low suggesting investor confidence in the economy was on shaky ground michael farr president of farr miller washington said that the federal reserve s ability to tackle the economic turmoil is very limited a reduction in u s rates won t address the supply problem coming out of asia farr said or reopen shuttered schools and factories the risk isn t so much morbidity and mortality but it is the risk of business slowdown and perhaps even recession farr said still some say it was only a matter of time before global markets reacted sharply and all at once to the outbreak the bond market had been signaling danger while the stock market has been blithely climbing the wall of worry said nancy tengler chief investment officer of laffer tengler investments we expected a much stronger correction on the initial coronavirus news stocks are due for a pullback after all if we get a proper correction as the virus spreads we think this will be constructive for stocks in the long run the white house is preparing to request an emergency spending package from congress to finance its response to the novel coronavirus outbreak and look for ways to mitigate its effect on manufacturing supply chains the request could be sent in the next few days and could seek nearly 1 billion in funds according to two of the people briefed on the planning from the white house and the campaign trail president donald trump often touts the economy s strength and he routinely points to the stock market as one of his administration s top accolades u s stocks have reached record highs even in the face of ongoing trade uncertainty yet there are still worries that in the event of another downturn the government and central bank won t have as much leeway to boost the economy u s stocks have reached record highs despite ongoing trade uncertainty and other destabilizing like the coronavirus in a cnbc international interview that aired monday treasury secretary steven mnuchin said it would be difficult to have strong predictions on the economic issues without being able to predict the health outcome i think we need another three or four weeks to see how the virus reacts until we really have good statistical data mnuchin said on monday chinese leaders postponed the national people s congress the most prominent event on their political calendar set for march 5 beijing also reversed course after saying it would relax travel restrictions on the outbreak s hotbed of wuhan the chinese government reported 409 new coronavirus cases and another 150 deaths by the end of sunday there are now more than 77 000 confirmed cases with a cumulative death toll of more than 2 500 over the weekend south korea italy and iran reported sharp increases in cases italy now has the largest known outbreak outside of asia with more than 200 confirmed cases and five deaths as of monday officials there aren t even sure how the virus arrived in the country south korea s caseload climbed to 833 and a spokesman for iran s health ministry said that the death toll from the new

again capital demand for commodities of all stripes has cratered in china and aviation traffic is plummeting as well early on analysts had hoped that any economic fallout from the coronavirus would be contained to china based on what happened in the wake of the 2002 2003 sars outbreak but today s china is much more interconnected with the rest of the world with supply chains on nearly every continent reliant on chinese manufacturing and labor now economists and supply chain experts worry that the world s economies will feel coronavirus sting for months even if the spread is brought under control auto plants are running low on parts chinese tourists aren t traveling the world and american companies already bruised from trump s nearly two year trade war with beijing face additional

research at ritholtz wealth management said most investors would agree the sell off is normal and not really worth paying too much attention to the reason noise increases during these episodes is

and what if the stock market crashes this is what investors are worried about mr batnick said the more you risk the more you make and the more you make the more you have to be willing to lose there is an amount of pain that you must be willing to bear per unit of risk the data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to

difficult to say mr ellenberger said we ve printed the lowest print ever in 10 year treasury notes and there s no reason to say it can t continue to go lower if you start to have headlines that people

said it s simply too early for a us rate cut the greatest risk to the record us economic expansion is an external shock that the fed can t offset because it responds either too late or without enough

american consumers were still growing in confidence in february according to a closely watched confidence index reporting its first survey results since the conclusion of president donald trump s impeachment trial but as a political risk to the economy faded the coronavirus global health threat intensified the conference board s consumer confidence survey hit 130 7 in february up slightly from 130 4 in january as americans shrugged off the impeachment saga that hung over voters since the president s alleged misconduct first emerged publicly in september but the reading was shy of the 132 that analysts were forecasting the present situation index which is based on consumers assessment of current business and labor market conditions decreased from 173 9 to 165 1 in february the expectations index based on consumers short term outlook for income business and labor market conditions increased from 101 4 to 107 8 consumer confidence improved slightly in february following an increase in january said lynn franco senior director of economic indicators at the conference board despite the decline in the present situation index consumers continue to view current conditions quite favorably consumers short term expectations improved and when coupled with solid employment growth should be enough to continue to support spending and economic growth in the near term the index is compiled each month by insights firm nielsen on behalf of nonpartisan think tank the conference board data for this preliminary release is collected until the middle of the month meaning some respondents reported their sentiments after trump s trial survey respondents who reply later than the cut off are included in the final report published a month later the survey tracks consumer sentiment each month taking in their views on business and employment conditions income household spending and more the u s senate acquitted trump of both impeachment articles on february 6 the house impeached trump with abuse of power and obstruction of congress over the alleged scheme to coerce ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and benefit his re election campaign though the chances of the republican majority senate convicting and removing trump were small the threat was real and such a dramatic step would likely have triggered political and market instability at least in the short term perhaps longer at a headline level the u s economy is strong employment numbers are hitting record highs gdp growth came in at a robust 2 1 percent in the third quarter of 2019 inflation is low

globalization economist says coronavirus is threatening the future of globalization economist says mickey levy chief economist for the u s americas and asia at berenberg capital markets said the impeachment drama had no impact on consumer confidence consumers didn t care and didn t pay attention levy said adding that they are focused on things that affect their finances directly such as labor market prospects wages interest rates oil prices and so on the impeachment trial didn t even measure as a blip on the confidence radar screen what is of greater concern is the coronavirus outbreak tearing through china and spreading across the world in what the world health organization has declared a global health emergency it may yet be declared a pandemic the latest data compiled by johns hopkins university in its coronavirus tracker has 80 248 confirmed cases all over the world the vast majority 77 660 are in mainland china other affected countries include south korea italy japan singapore iran and the u s among many others there have been 2 703 deaths so far and 27 747 recoveries in the u s there are 53 confirmed cases and no deaths the conclusion of the impeachment trial should have little effect on consumer confidence opinions were solidified well before the trial began and the acquittal was essentially a foregone conclusion said yung yu ma chief investment strategist at bmo wealth management given the mid month data cutoff it will be important to consider whether potential coronavirus effects had an early impact on consumer confidence since the u s is well removed from the front lines of the outbreak hopefully the answer is no but we cannot completely dismiss this possibility either read more income growth slowed across the us under donald trump income growth slowed across the us under donald trump padhraic garvey head of global debt and rates strategy at ing financial markets llc said consumer perception of coronavirus s impact on job security because of its disruption to global supply chains many chinese factories have closed for example may feed into future confidence trackers this week s consumer confidence reading is unlikely to capture a significant downdraft just yet but next months could begin to see some creaking in confidence and especially should the panic seen on equity markets today persist in the coming weeks garvey said a gallup poll released last week found that 65 percent of u s adults thought the coronavirus would have a very or somewhat negative effect on the global economy with the remainder believing there would be no negative effect but only 36 percent were very or somewhat worried about the coronavirus the rest were either not too worried or not worried at all the 1 028 adults across

expectations you will hear from joan in a moment but to summarize our fourth quarter performance revenue was 628 million adjusted ebitda was 57 million non gaap earnings per share was 0 72 and free cash flow was 29 million these results were primarily driven by continued strong demand in our networked solutions segment in the fourth quarter we saw strong bookings which brought our total backlog at the end of the quarter to a record 3 2 billion and our 12 month backlog increased to 1 5 billion our bookings in the quarter were 767 million to achieve a full year book to bill ratio of over 1 1 we were pleased with our fourth quarter bookings performance with approximately 75 of our new bookings coming from our networked solutions and outcomes segments we continue to anticipate a book to bill ratio of approximately 1 1 in 2020 with continued rotations in our bookings toward our networked solutions and outcomes segments while our record high backlog gives us visibility into the year we do expect an easing in our turns business which predominantly impacts our device solutions segment we also see our customers increasingly investing in longer term project based solutions to enhance resiliency reliability and safety as evidenced in our recent announcement with los angeles department of water and power ladwp will deploy itron s distribution automation solution to improve grid robustness and reduce operating costs both of these trends are contemplated in our guidance for 2020 as i reflect on the past year we ve made meaningful progress in many of our areas of business by executing our strategy we have expanded our footprint of networked endpoints increased our customer success through innovative new offerings continued to cultivate new partnerships and made solid strides in our operational performance during 2019 we shipped more than 16 million connected endpoints which is an increase of 10 year over year while our networked solutions revenue increased 16 year over year which outgrew the market projections by two times our continued growth relies on investment in product innovation and partnerships that focus on delivering new solutions and outcomes for our customers success from distributed intelligence throughout our networks to enhanced data analytics itron is a leader in enabling utilities and cities to monitor and manage the communities they serve more environmentally soundly and efficiently our ecosystem of well over 250 partners continues to expand with numerous announcements made over the past months alone for example we recently announced

i would now like to give you a brief update we have made significant progress on our committed projects this past year we completed the integration of the former silver spring networks and the restructuring project that was announced in 2016 which was primarily focused on our north american operations on the global manufacturing front we have centralized our procurement efforts and are beginning to drive leverage across our global factories we are active in both value engineering of existing products and the thoughtful outsourcing of products and sub assemblies to contract manufacturing firms aligned to our prior announcements we are still executing on our 2018 restructuring plan which primarily focuses on our operations in europe and asia this plan will continue into 2021 and finally we successfully reorganized our business operations and increased the visibility in our device solutions networked solutions and outcomes segments to focus on the unique opportunities that each segment has for growing revenue expanding margins and improving customer success in device solutions we are disappointed with recent results and are continuing to transform this segment we are working toward launching new global platform based devices continuing to drive down cost on existing products and strategically exiting unprofitable regions and products we continuously look for ways to accelerate these programs while not sacrificing quality nor our customer support in the process turning to our networked solutions and outcomes segments we continue to prioritize investments in customer focused solutions that will drive growth and higher margins gross margins in these segments can be lumpy quarter to quarter due to product mix and customer deployment schedules however they are accretive to total company margins in 2019 networked solutions and outcomes segments combined for more than 65 of our revenue up almost 500 basis points from the previous year and we anticipate the contribution of both networked solutions and outcomes to continue to grow in 2020 and beyond while there is still work needed to hit our near term operational targets and to accelerate value creation for all our stakeholders as we look forward to 2020 i am confident we will continue to make progress toward our longer term business potential and look forward to providing updates as we progress now i will hand it off to joan to discuss q4 results and 2020 outlook joan hooper senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom a summary of consolidated gaap results is shown on slide 6 and non gaap results are shown on slide 7 fourth quarter revenue of 628 million increased 7 versus last year driven by continued growth in the networked solutions segment gross margin for the quarter was 28 2 190 basis points lower than last year and lower than our expectations this was primarily due to product mix and higher software content from the prior year as well as a onetime customer adjustment booked this year while our revenue performance in the fourth quarter was better than expected it was primarily driven by customer demand that shifted in from q1 of 2020 moving to earnings per share gaap net income was 15 million or 0 36 per diluted share compared with net income of 24 million or 0 60 per share in the prior year regarding non gaap metrics non gaap operating income was 46 million adjusted ebitda was 57 million or 9 of revenue non gaap net income for the quarter was 29 million or 0 72 per diluted share compared with 35 million or 0 88 per share in 2018 turning to the fourth quarter year over year revenue bridge on slide 8 total company revenue grew 7 or 8 on a constant currency basis device solutions revenue decreased 9 as reported and 7 in constant currency while we saw growth in the water and gas markets this was more than offset by lower smart spec electric shipments in emea networked solutions revenue increased 21 as reported and in constant currency the increase was primarily driven by continued growth in our footprint of north america connected endpoints in addition some customer demand shifted from the first quarter of 2020 into q4 which resulted in very strong year over year growth outcomes revenue decreased 1 as reported and in constant currency the decrease was due to a one time customer adjustment without that adjustment outcomes revenue would have increased approximately 8 year over year moving to the non gaap eps bridge on slide 9 our q4 non gaap eps was 0 72 per diluted share compared with 0 88 in the prior year net operating performance had a negative 0 05 per share impact versus the prior year this was driven by higher non gaap operating expenses due to increased product development costs and higher variable compensation partially offset by restructuring savings lower interest expense added 0 05 per share year over year the higher q4 2019 tax rate decreased eps by 0 14 per share versus last year you may recall that the tax rate in q4 of 2018 was negative due to a onetime benefit related to an audit settlement and lastly fx changes and the increased share count resulted in a 0 02 decrease from the prior year turning to slides 10 through 12 i ll now discuss the q4 results by business segment compared with the prior year device solutions revenue was 206 million with gross margin of 15 and operating margin of 8 gross margin decreased 230 basis points due to unfavorable product mix and operating margin decreased 330 basis points due to the fall through of lower gross margin as well as higher operating expenses as tom just mentioned the performance of the device business was below our expectations due to both product mix and inefficiencies in our international operations improving the device segment s profitability is a key strategic priority networked solutions revenue was 369 million with gross margin of 35 we were very pleased with the 21 year over year revenue growth in this segment gross margin was down 500 basis points from the prior year due to product and customer mix operating margin was 27 440 basis points below last year due to the fall through of lower gross margin which was partially offset by improved operating leverage growing our footprint of networked endpoints remains a key strategic priority by continuing to outpace the market and gain share in our networked solutions segment we are establishing a strong foundation for our outcomes segment for decades to come outcomes revenue was 54 million with gross margin of 32 gross margin increased 370 basis points year over year without the onetime customer adjustment booked in q4 gross margin in the outcomes segment would have been approximately 38 operating margin was 15 300 basis points higher than last year driven by the fall through of gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses we continue to improve the operating scale of this segment and are working on ways to accelerate our revenue growth we do not see this quarter s performance as indicative of the outcomes business model and we do anticipate lumpy performance until we reach scale turning to slide 13 free cash flow was 29 million in the fourth quarter cash and equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter were 150 million total debt decreased to 932 million after 37 million of debt payments were made of which 30 million was ahead of schedule this reduced our net leverage to 3 0 times now to quickly recap the entire year on slide 14 total revenue of 2 5 billion increased 5 year over year driven by 16 growth in networked solutions and 4 growth in outcomes this growth was partially offset by an 8 decline in device solutions due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower smart spec demand at a total company level revenue increased 8 year over year on a constant currency basis gross margin for the full year was 30 1 adjusted ebitda of 270 million increased 15 year over year non gaap earnings per share of 3 32 was 25 higher than 2018 and free cash flow was 112 million for the full year more than double 2018 s performance now moving on to the full year 2020 guidance on slide 15 we anticipate full year 2020 revenue to be in a range of 2 475 billion to 2 575 billion and non gaap earnings per share to be between 3 35 to 3 85 per share to provide some color on our 2020 guidance the midpoint of the 2020 revenue guidance range represents slight growth from 2019 the growth rate is dampened by the higher than expected 2019 revenue performance we anticipate our networked solutions segment to grow at or above the market in 2020 and outcomes revenue to grow in the low single digits we expect this growth to be partially offset by a mid single digit decline in our device solutions business driven by continued lower smart spec shipments and the easing of our turns business turning to our non gaap earnings per share guidance the midpoint is 8 year over year growth we continue to see benefits from our operating initiatives and expect full year gross margin will improve between 75 basis points to 175 basis points from 2019 performance we anticipate this improvement to be weighted more toward the second half of the year other guidance assumptions are a euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange rate of 1 12 a non gaap effective tax between 25 to 27 and average shares outstanding for the full year of approximately 40 7 million in summary we were pleased with our overall financial performance in 2019 we grew our networked solutions business 16 improved non gaap earnings per share over 25 and we more than doubled free cash flow from the previous year despite a strong 2019 we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our full potential as we enter 2020 we continue to assess each segment s performance to accelerate growth improve margins and generate higher free cash flow now i will turn the call back to tom tom deitrich president and chief executive officer thank you joan as joan mentioned while we have made progress we still have more to do we have the road map to achieve our long term business potential and will continue to actively drive the performance in each of our segments before i hand it over to q a i would like to take a moment to highlight some of the environmental social and governance initiatives that we have completed in 2019 or are currently under way with in 2020 in our prior corporate sustainability reports we discussed several initiatives to improve the reporting of our esg efforts and are making strides on multiple fronts over the past year we have refined our approach to better align our strategic operational and esg efforts in 2020 we look forward to continuing to work with our key stakeholders to identify and improve where itron can have the greatest impact on our planet by expanding our reach of solutions and working with our customers to ensure their success itron is dedicated to creating a more resourceful world and with partnering with our key stakeholders to improve the quality of life enhance safety and promote the well being of people around the globe there will be more to come in our 2019 corporate sustainability report due out in june thank you for joining our call operator please open the line for some questions questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from noah kaye at oppenheimer please go ahead noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst thanks good afternoon appreciate taking the questions so looking at the 2020 guide anything to think about from a revenue cadence perspective anything to call out you would say joan and then related how to think about free cash flow you did a nice job more than doubling free cash flow in 2019 maybe moving past some restructuring cash payments in 2020 how should we be thinking about that joan hooper senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah from a revenue perspective the linearity right now looks pretty even so first half second half is roughly the same and even q1 q2 roughly the same so pretty linear based on the timing of customer deployments in terms of free cash flow the estimate i have is somewhere in a range of 125 million to 140 million so still nice growth from 2019 actuals noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst okay that s very helpful and then if you could just comment on supply chain you ve seen a lot in the trade press recently on tightening supply chain for passes in part because of what s happening over in china with coronavirus is that have any impact anticipated or baked into your guidance and if not could you talk about why you re somewhat insulated from that tom deitrich president and chief executive officer sure noah tom here i can take that one from an overall perspective i would say that we have seen a couple of minor moves on lead times but nothing terribly significant thus far in terms of the supply chain on the coronavirus outlook we ve tried to be as mindful as we can about the overall macroeconomic situation but that virus situation is developing day by day and it s very very difficult to predict what will happen so we don t necessarily have a perfect purview as to where the macro environment will go as a result there certainly is a fair amount of the supply base that is in china and it s something that we ll have to watch out for noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst okay appreciate that if i could sneak one more in you mentioned in the prepared remarks more of the bookings are rotating toward networked and outcomes just more complete solutions being procured by your customers you ve announced some significant program wins for new deployments in the past quarter or so but just wondering how much of that is potential second gen or refresh business and are you starting to see the benefits there tom deitrich president and chief executive officer yeah we definitely see continued robust pipeline of opportunities coming through certainly the north american market continues to be quite strong in terms of new tenders that are out all the time there are some i ll say first generation ami types of deals that are likely to close during 2020 but by and large people are onto the second generation or maybe a little further in terms of where the meat of the market is we definitely see a lot of investment in resiliency reliability safety types of solutions so think beyond just a billing or an ami kind of situation what else can you do with the data to enhance the value for operating leverage on the part of the customer or even engaging with the consumer itself noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst very helpful thank you operator we will now take our next question from robert mccarthy at stephens please go ahead robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good afternoon everyone how are you today joan hooper senior vice president and chief financial officer good thank you robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good i guess the first question since i d rather light a candle than curse the darkness maybe you could talk a little bit about just kind of strength you saw in networked solutions the timing amplify your comments around that and why that gives you a lot of confidence and conviction around that kind of above average above market growth rate that you re expecting in 2020 joan hooper senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i mentioned a couple of the stats in the script itself so for the full year the growth rate was about 16 so clearly much stronger than the overall market i also mentioned some shifting of revenue from q1 into q4 the range of that is somewhere between 10 million to 20 million so again just deployments we expected would be in q1 that were in q4 as we look at 2020 we continue to expect the networked solutions business to grow at or above the market so again if you look at the 2019 numbers clearly we re taking share in that market and feel very good about our offerings and our ability to continue to grow tom deitrich president and chief executive officer yeah if i may rob maybe add a thought or two from my side the backlog that we have coming into this year meaning the 12 month backlog is 1 5 billion and that s up pretty significantly from what you saw in q3 so good sequential progress quarter to quarter there and remember that let s say about three quarters of that backlog plus or minus is related to the networks business so it is a big portion and we ve got pretty good visibility and we see customers doing a lot of deployment on the ami side and beyond for distribution automation types of applications to strengthen the reliability of the grid is also an area that we see pretty good growth robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst great and then i guess as a follow up maybe you could and you may not want to go down this path so it s fine if you do or you don t but maybe just talk about your kind of 2021 targets and what s looking like a tougher putt or some nuance around it help us kind of ring fence how you re thinking about kind of these audacious goals that are out there and how we square the circle with the guide and the recent results and how you re going to get there joan hooper senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah the first thing i d say is obviously we have not provided any updated numbers on 2021 and so the current numbers we have are still from the investor day we were very careful in that investor day to describe the fact that it wasn t going to be a linear line between 2018 and 2021 and in fact we talked about that we expected the 2020 versus 19 growth to be somewhat muted and then accelerate in 21 versus 20 and that s again just based on the deployment schedules that are in our backlog and knowing where our customers are going so from the perspective of networked systems which is by far the biggest piece of our business nothing fundamentally has changed versus investor day outcomes again we still expect them to grow as we mentioned in the script devices is a little bit behind on the profitability improvement plan but we still see a plan for improving the margins in that business robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst i ll leave it there for now thank you for your time operator we ll now take the next question from joseph osha at jmp securities please go ahead joseph osha jmp securities analyst hello thanks for taking the question just to look at the device business for a minute and the trajectory there i m wondering are you all more aggressively walking away from business or perhaps lower margin business than you were as part of what we re seeing maybe just reflective of the tighter filter that you re putting on that and i do have a follow up thanks tom deitrich president and chief executive officer thanks joe on the device side of things i think what you see in those results is a combination of factors certainly the european market which is the lion s share of that business for us is definitely easing back as some of the really big deployments in certain countries are kind of coming to an end the new markets that are expected to fuel a little bit of growth in the years to come are still a bit sluggish to get started so i think the bigger factor is more around the market timing that said certainly we have been disappointed in our progress on that front and we ll continue to look for ways to improve the results value engineering to reduce the cost of products outsourcing of products pruning the portfolio and stepping back from certain geographies are certainly on the menu and things that we ll continue to look at as you referenced joseph osha jmp securities analyst okay so that i was going to ask another question but i guess i want to follow up and it sounds to me like you are saying given some of the opportunities you see elsewhere that selected portfolio pruning is part of what we re seeing here tom deitrich president and chief executive officer without a doubt yeah the same as we talked about back in the investor day time frame we do expect that business to shrink a bit over the years ahead based on exactly the types of activities that i talked about we re really after profitability more so than top line growth out of that business joseph osha jmp securities analyst okay and then just one more if i may and i ve asked this question before i want to see if the answer has changed there are some really interesting companies out there doing devices hardware devices that aid in this task of addressing grid resiliency line sensors whatnot previously you had said you didn t want to get into that but as we see more and more emphasis on that i m wondering could we see you out there looking at other sort of non meter hardware devices that you see to come after this grid resilience and that s it from me thank you tom deitrich president and chief executive officer sure from our standpoint we definitely see a tremendous value in the data and being able to pull insights out of it so as we re looking at our portfolio we re definitely interested in things that goes toward our outcomes business as that is our target for growth that said we are very mindful that we need to have a complete solution today we tend to partner quite a bit more and that is likely to continue to be the case but we ll look for the opportunities to make sure we can provide that full solution top to bottom really leveraging the data that comes through the network joseph osha jmp securities analyst thank you operator we will now take our next question from pavel molchanov at raymond james please go ahead pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for taking my question clearly the software ramp has not been especially bullish i suppose why do you think that is why is the utility adoption of saas solutions kind of running below expectations tom deitrich president and chief executive officer yeah i would say that certainly our results in the fourth quarter were impacted by the onetime customer adjustment that i did talk about so that s one factor to look at that said certainly we want to continue to invest to drive for more growth on the outcomes portion of our business we do see the precursor for that as growth in the networked space but after that is really when we would expect to see some growth on the outcome side of the business it certainly takes a bit of time for customers to digest a new piece of their solution and advanced services tend to grow on top of that so it does lag a bit and it tends to be slightly lumpy based on exact customer timing there is a regulatory component to this we definitely continue to see favorable tailwinds in the regulatory environment relative to performance based rates or being able to capitalize saas in a couple of the states in north america right now and i think that one will be a key leading indicator to watch which will continue to fuel the growth for the outcomes business in the future pavel molchanov raymond james analyst and in the context of software you ve signed three software partnerships year to date grid4c innowatts and bidgely i couldn t help noticing three deals in barely 30 days can you explain kind of what capabilities those alliances will bring to the table tom deitrich president and chief executive officer sure we talked about this a bit before but i ll back up and then be directly responsive to your question the current generation of products and solutions that we are deploying in the marketplace today is based on a distributed intelligence and edge computing kind of approach where you can download an application into the meter and be able to pull out the insights that you re looking for from an operational or from a consumer engagement point of view making sure that we have a full catalog of capabilities as that system solution starts to roll out i think is incredibly important there is significant interest in low disaggregation kind of solutions there is interest in theft detection and revenue assurance types of things and overall the types of partnerships that we re signing up today tend to lead down that path ability to better match supply and demand through a demand response or an energy efficiency program is another place that we see some pretty significant interest on the part of the electricity utilities all of those types of things are really what is the base of that downloadable app kind of environment that we re moving into as we step into the future pavel molchanov raymond james analyst appreciate it operator we ll take the next question from jeff osborne at cowen co please go ahead jeffrey osborne cowen co analyst good afternoon guys most of my questions have been asked but i might have missed it tom but can you or joan give us an update on the 2018 restructuring i think you said silver spring and the 2016 round are done but i wasn t sure how much is still left from the 18 tranche and what the mix is between gross margins and opex joan hooper senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so through so you re correct we basically are done with the 2016 and the silver spring acquisition regarding the 2018 plan we had talked about 50 million of annualized savings we re about two thirds of the way through that in terms of savings and so we would expect a little shy of 10 million incrementally in 2020 over 2019 and that s split roughly 50 50 cogs and growth gross margin and opex jeffrey osborne cowen co analyst got it and then is there any way you could flesh out you talked about water and gas on a relative basis being a bit better can you just talk about what you re seeing regionally or any quantification within devices of the different technologies that you serve tom deitrich president and chief executive officer are you asking specifically on devices or more macro make sure i understand your question jeffrey osborne cowen co analyst yeah i was thinking more devices but macro would be helpful as well if you can layer then into the answer tom deitrich president and chief executive officer sure okay thank you just to be clear joan s comment in the script was really around devices specifically so make sure that that was clear but let me take a step back and parse out the macro environment we definitely see strong business in north america the pipeline of new tenders tends to be strong we see a lot of investment in things that are beyond an ami kind of environment so resiliency reliability safety kinds of applications and increasing interest in consumer engagement types of programs on the part of the north american utilities europe tends to be slowing a bit some of that is program related some of it seems to be macro related we definitely saw a bit more activity in 2019 in the water segment in europe toward the end of the year that tended to slow down a bit and that was contained in our comments earlier about the slowing of the turns business in our outlook for 2020 in asia pacific it s a pretty small piece of our business where we tend to be fairly selective about which markets we play in and the markets that we are participating in again we see tremendous interest in ami kinds of applications and also safety related applications as there is some big markets there australia being an obvious one where wildfires and finding ways to better detect and manage those from a utility standpoint is high on people s minds and that s an area that we think we have some technology that certainly can help so mixed bag as you go across the globe but i tried to give you some flavor of the puts and takes jeffrey osborne cowen co analyst that s helpful and then the last question i had tom is just on riva itself and as you gear up for the xcel launch is that full is it done or is that i think the last update i had it was still an fpga format but i wasn t sure where we are in the technology development of riva itself tom deitrich president and chief executive officer no it s asic based today in terms of some of the underlying protocol that s in the endpoint itself that is indeed the case over the past year some of the announcements that maybe were a little bit below the covers we have taken that same hardware platform and brought it across from the legacy itron side to the silver spring side so that we have the same capabilities on a gen x as well as on a riva capability as we re starting to broaden that out as we do the technology conversions so asic based today not fpga based jeffrey osborne cowen co analyst okay thank you operator it appears there are no further questions at this time mr tom deitrich i d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks tom deitrich president and chief executive officer very good thank you eduardo so thank you everyone for joining our call to summarize we took away expectations in 2019 that we re our results that were largely in line with what we had said some pluses and minuses inside of there we re excited about the leverage that we have and the visibility we have into 2020 and look forward to updating you as we make progress along the way thank you all operator there will be an audio replay of today s conference

a trader works on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse in new york u s on monday feb 8 2016 u s stocks tumbled with the standard poor s 500 index falling to a 22 month low as a second straight selloff pushed bank shares to the lowest since 2013 and left the nasdaq composite index approaching a bear market photographer michael nagle bloomberg 2016 bloomberg finance lp uncertainty over the coronavirus is weighing heavily on investor sentiment but that may not be the only reason for investor concern below three leading market forecasters and contributors to moneyshow com discuss long term technical and fundamental reasons for market caution that are unrelated to recent global health worries our theory is that the stock market is now hugely driven by algorithmic trading to such an extent that traditional analysis especially value oriented must fail in fact we have shown twice before with charts and data that dollar trading volume generated by individual investors human beings has not increased in over 19 years in april 2019 we first pointed out that algorithmic trading amounted to 71 5 trillion accounting for the entire increase in total dollar trading volume dtv from the peak in march 2000 through the end of 2018 at the time we said think about that over nearly two decades the last ten years of which have been a bull market trading has been totally dominated by methodologies that for the most part have nothing to do with the prospects of individual stocks nothing like this has ever before occurred the chart below clearly shows a dramatic declining trend in the number of issues traded daily on the nyse the peaks and valleys would logically be associated with bull market peaks and bear market lows since public interest has always been the principle effect upon prices and when more stocks trade prices are typically going to rise with the increased interest however interest is declining and unlike before as interest decline prices were still rising this is an astonishing development again human participation has not increased in over 19 years our interpretation is that the most recent rally in stocks is a veritable blowoff for market bulls the breadth dynamics chart is awful breadth dynamics for market bulls the breadth dynamics chart is awful the higher prices go less issues are involved in the chase the current picture is the worst we have seen in well over a decade simply put whatever we see of rising prices is continually confined to a smaller and smaller group of stocks this is typical of imminent trend change if a correction is imminent right now fits on so many levels our demand supply chart below is also astonishing we believe the formula for this chart works well to illustrate demand and supply certainly on a relative basis note prior bottoms equating to net supply occurred at bear market bottoms and would typically connote a weak environment precisely the opposite occurs with peak in net demand at bull market peaks however the current period is so strange demand has been negative since february 2015 nevertheless the dow is 10 000 points higher and the s p 500 is up more than 56 demand at bull market peaks alan newman crosscurrents divergences typically offer no particular timing guarantees however they are definitive portrayals of market health stocks are well above nosebleed territory valuations are astronomical we continue to forecast a significant bear market ahead the big picture is that the skyrocketing debt is creating a very serious problem it just keeps surging to record levels at an unprecedented rate cautions most worrisome this is happening during good economic times normally this type of debt growth has only happened during times of crises like in 2008 during the subprime bubble the federal debt has soared and it s higher than it was in 2008 based on the congressional budget office it s projected to keep skyrocketing in the years ahead this is the big picture and it s downright scary the world s leading investment experts agree paul tudor jones for instance says the current situation reminds him of the late 1990s prior to the financial crisis he notes that we re in the craziest monetary fiscal mix in history it s so explosive it defies imagination and it ll end badly george soros warns of potential economic doom and ray dalio says to buy gold which he feels will be a top asset to own in the years ahead even james grant is saying the fed has become the lender of first resort why all the doom and gloom basically with the deficits so large the fed is creating more fiat money to monetize the debt as a result the fed s balance sheet has increased over 500 in the past decade and it s going higher currently the fed keeps pouring huge amounts of money into the banking system via the repo market every day this has been to keep the banks liquid and the economy going but the amounts involved are mind boggling according to the new york fed and reported by wall street on parade since september 17 the fed has funneled a cumulative shocking total of 6 6 trillion to some of wall streets primary dealers via repo loans to put this into perspective the bail out total between 2007 10 came to 19 55 trillion so during the past five months the fed has already pumped about one third of the amount spent during the financial crisis and remember this is during good economic times this is truly unbelievable and it strongly reinforces our view that something is very wrong just under the surface plus the fed recently announced that it ll keep these repo operations going until at least april some are now saying the fed won t avert the next crisis they will cause it the main reason why is because the fed is essentially the cause of the bubble in everything all that money that s been pouring into the financial system has essentially driven stocks higher to unprecedented levels the bottom line is it has formed the third stock market bubble in 150 years how will all of this end we don t know yet but if we look at the two previous cases in 1929 and 2000 this situation will likely be similar and it won t end well the s p 500 has extended its record long expansion but the growth in earnings today may not be as good as it seems s p 500 operating earnings have increased significantly and have helped fuel the 50 gain in the s p 500 since mid 2016 on the other hand corporate profits which measures what all u s corporations earn peaked in 2014 and is lower today than it was in 2012 the reason for this discrepancy has largely to do with different accounting methods corporate profits are primarily calculated using tax accounting while s p 500 earnings use financial accounting corporate profits vs s p 500 earnings jim stack investech research the methodology used to calculate corporate profits is more reliable for many reasons including the fact that the bureau of economic analysis adjusts for non reported and misreported income moreover financial accounting can be more easily manipulated and the management teams of large public companies take full advantage of this fact the current divergence bears a worrisome similarity to the tech bubble of the 1990s the s p 500 has a current p e ratio of 24 6 which is in the 91st percentile of the last 92 years but taking into consideration the fact that today s earnings have almost certainly been manipulated higher which skews the p e ratio lower it becomes clear this is one of the most overvalued markets in history the most recent rally has been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals the dangers in this market are unmistakable making it more important than ever to adopt a diligent risk management approach the smart money market participants also seem to be aware of the questionable fundamentals of the most recent rally margin debt which represents money borrowed to purchase stocks ticked up in the latest reading but remains near the lowest levels of the past few years meanwhile moral hazard is situation in which one party becomes involved in a risky event or investment knowing that it is protected against the risk as the other party will bear the cost or ensure against it there are numerous times in the past when the federal reserve has really messed up and it is surprising how many of them ended with extraordinarily painful consequences the ever increasing inflationary cycles of the 1960s and 1970s were a direct result of over accommodative money supply expansion whenever the economy started tumbling into recession the excessively deep and prolonged recession of 1981 1982 became necessary to break the ingrained inflation psychology of that period the tech bubble of the late 1990s came immediately after federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned of irrational exuberance on wall street in december 1996 but then failed to do anything to prevent it in fact the fed actually helped fuel the bubble by refusing to tighten margin requirements and even cut interest rates when the leveraged hedge fund long term capital management failed less than two years later likewise the housing bubble of 2005 and subsequent 2008 financial crisis would have been much milder or even nonexistent if the federal reserve hadn t dropped interest rates to artificially low levels under 1 5 and kept them there in 2002 2004 it was the ultra cheap money that compelled banks and lending institutions to create the nonsensical mortgages that turned into the collateralized securities and credit default swaps which collapsed like a house of cards taking the entire economy down with it at the height of the 1990s tech bubble the majority of investors honestly believed we were in a new paradigm era in which nothing could go wrong and if it did the fed could step in to prevent it likewise during the housing bubble speculation was running rampant in the belief that housing prices could never go down or if they did the federal reserve could step in to save the day these are both prime examples of a historic moral hazard in which investors homebuyers and speculators took excessive risk in the deeply held belief that profits were guaranteed and the fed had their back in other words the risks would never have been taken if not for the implied assurance from the federal reserve now flash forward to today and it has clearly turned into the silly season in higher risk assets from overvalued stocks to overpriced real estate again and particularly in low quality corporate debt instead of having a single big bubble there are multiple bubbles of dangerous proportion lurking in the shadows and the federal reserve has injected a moral hazard into all of them in 2019 with its implied guarantee of support and assurance against

by dean baker insidesources com back in the 1960s when it had become clear that the vietnam war was an endless morass vermont senator george aiken suggested that we declare victory and leave donald trump would be well advised to take sen aiken s sage advice in his trade war with china trump initiated this trade war with confused and shifting goals throughout his presidential campaign he had been on a tirade against china over its currency manipulation he promised that he would declare china a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency trump actually had a pretty good case on this issue china bought up trillions of dollars of u s assets in the first decade of the century in a deliberate effort to keep down the value of its currency against the dollar the lower value of the chinese yuan meant that china s goods and services were relatively cheaper giving them an advantage in international trade this was a big part of the soaring u s trade deficit in that decade costing the u s millions of good paying manufacturing jobs in the last decade china has stopped buying up u s assets but it still holds more than 4 trillion worth of foreign assets these huge holdings continue to keep down the value of the yuan against the dollar in the same way that the federal reserve board s holding of trillions of dollars of assets helps to keep down interest rates for some reason virtually all economists accept that the fed s holding of assets affects interest rates yet they ignore how the same logic would apply to the value of the yuan against the dollar but this point is now moot in the trade war because trump has essentially left currency values aside as an issue his phase one deal requires substantial chinese purchases of u s exports but does nothing to raise the value of the yuan against the dollar that is unfortunate because a higher valued yuan would alter market prices in a way that would reduce the u s trade deficit instead trump is demanding that china s government make purchases that are not justified on a market basis to get to this point trump imposed tens of billions of dollars in taxes on the american people in the form of tariffs on chinese imports trump claims that china paid for these tariffs but the data are very clear virtually all of the cost of these tariffs was borne by consumers or intermediaries in the united states if trump declared victory now he could eliminate the tariffs he imposed in effect giving a tax break to consumers in an election year and this one doesn t even have to go through congress unfortunately trump seems determined to continue with his trade war making a series of wrongheaded demands backed by a threat of more tariffs everything about trump s trade war effort is confused his central goal now appears to be getting china to show more respect for the patent and copyrights of u s corporations at the most basic level this is hardly in the interest of the u s workers for whom trump claims to be fighting this war if boeing or other multinationals don t have to worry about being forced to transfer technology when they outsource jobs to china then they will be more likely to outsource jobs to china more generally u s workers have no stake in protecting microsoft s copyrights or pfizer s patents rather than trying to have technology bottled up with these archaic protections it would make much more sense to try to open up technology for all to benefit going forward the u s will want more technology from china than china will want from the united states china s economy is already 30 larger than the u s economy and it will be more than twice as large by the end of the decade furthermore it spends the same share of gdp on research and development ideally we would be working out trade deals where we shared innovations in clean energy conservation and biomedical research so that we can make progress in these areas as quickly as possible but that sort of cooperation is way over the head of donald trump and his trade team given his confusion on trade issues and the likelihood that any further trump offensives in the trade war will backfire we would be best off if trump just followed the advice of sen aiken declare victory and leave the trade war behind dean baker is a macroeconomist and senior economist at the center for economic and policy research in washington d c he wrote this for insidesources com

period results against prior periods including core results percentage changes measured in constant currencies ebitda free cash flow and net liquidity debt because of their non standardized definitions the non ifrs measures unlike ifrs measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies these supplemental non ifrs measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how alcon management assesses underlying performance these supplemental non ifrs measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for ifrs measures core results alcon core results including core operating income and core net income exclude all amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets excluding software net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss fvpl fair value adjustments of financial assets in the form of options to acquire a company carried at fvpl obligations related to product recalls and certain acquisition related items the following items that exceed a threshold of 10 million and are deemed exceptional are also excluded from core results integration and divestment related income and expenses divestment gains and losses restructuring charges releases and related items legal related items gains losses on early extinguishment of debt or debt modifications impairments of property plant and equipment and software as well as income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a 10 million threshold taxes on the adjustments between ifrs and core results take into account for each individual item included in the adjustment the tax rate that will finally be applicable to the item based on the jurisdiction where the adjustment will finally have a tax impact generally this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact there is usually a tax impact on other items although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions alcon believes that investor understanding of its performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance because since they exclude items that can vary significantly from period to period the core measures enable a helpful comparison of business performance across periods for this same reason alcon uses these core measures in addition to ifrs and other measures as important factors in assessing its performance a limitation of the core measures is that they provide a view of alcon operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition divestment or amortization impairments of purchased intangible assets and restructurings constant currencies changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the us dollar can affect alcon financial results and financial position to provide additional information that may be useful to investors including changes in sales volume we present information about changes in our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency effects constant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate effects so that an estimate can be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non us dollar functional currencies to the us dollar and the impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency alcon calculates constant currency measures by translating the current year s foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into us dollars using the average exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in us dollars ebitda alcon defines earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda as net loss income excluding income taxes depreciation of property plant and equipment including any related impairment charges depreciation of right of use assets amortization of intangible assets including any related impairment charges interest expense and other financial income and expense alcon management primarily uses ebitda together with net debt liquidity to monitor leverage associated with financial debts free cash flow alcon defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less cash flow associated with the purchase or sale of property plant and equipment free cash flow is presented as additional information because alcon management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of alcon s ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash free cash flow is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under ifrs net liquidity debt alcon defines net liquidity debt as current and non current financial debt less cash and cash equivalents current investments and derivative financial instruments net liquidity debt is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of alcon s ability to pay dividends to meet financial commitments and to invest in new strategic opportunities including strengthening its balance sheet growth rate and margin calculations for ease of understanding alcon uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared to the prior year is shown as a positive growth gross margins operating income loss margins and core operating income margins are calculated based upon net sales to third parties unless otherwise noted reconciliation of guidance for forward looking non ifrs measures the forward looking guidance included in this press release cannot be reconciled to the comparable ifrs measures without unreasonable efforts because we are not able to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate amount or nature of exceptional items in the fiscal year these items are uncertain depend on many factors and could have a material impact on our ifrs results for the

greg costa manager of investor relations please go ahead greg costa manager of investor relations and finance thank you jason and good morning to everyone joining us today welcome to the hersha hospitality trust full year and fourth quarter 2019 conference call today s call will be based on the full year and fourth quarter 2019 earnings release which was distributed yesterday afternoon prior to proceeding i d like to remind everyone that today s conference call may contain forward looking statements these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company s actual results performance or financial positions to be considerably different from any future results performance or financial position these factors are detailed within the company s press release as well as within the company s filings with the sec with that it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to mr neil h shah hersha hospitality trust president and chief operating officer neil you may begin neil h shah president and chief operating officer good morning and thank you for joining us on today s call joining me this morning are jay h shah our chief executive officer and ashish parikh our chief financial officer 2019 was the most operator pardon me we seem to have lost audio from the speaker line please stand by neil h shah president and chief operating officer sorry about that trade disputes inhibited demand throughout 2019 as corporate confidence waned leading to less corporate travel and growth from international travelers which subsided in conjunction with the strength of the us dollar and impacted gateway coastal markets in addition weaker convention calendars in most major cities coupled with increased supply deliveries led to 33 less compression nights the largest decline since the great financial crisis these factors combined with difficult comps in most of our markets like new york city lead to softer results than we and all industry prognosticators forecasted at the beginning of the year beginning of the year on our third quarter call we expected the fourth quarter to be challenging in many of our markets particularly in october with the jewish holiday shift and the quarter was indeed challenging but results in december most especially in south florida came in more positive than we had anticipated and provided a good runway to kick start 2020 however the industry still faces numerous challenges this year not only from elevated supply deliveries and operating costs increases but from exogenous and unpredictable macro events which may impede operational growth with these anticipated headwinds for 2020 we initiated two strategy shifts during the fourth quarter cost containment initiatives to aid margins and accretive dispositions at attractive multiples to reduce debt ash will spend some time on the cost containment initiatives we have put forth but let me highlight our progress on the dispositions front as disclosed in our press release yesterday evening we ve entered into binding commitments on four hotels for a total asset value of 144 million at extremely attractive multiples the sales prices of blue moon and the duane street hotels resulted in over 400 000 per key and a blended trailing 12 month economic cap rate of 2 6 and a 30 9 times ebitda multiple these results in miami and new york city highlight the intrinsic value of this enduring real estate in two of the most valuable markets in the united states with demand from a buyer pool of international and domestic corporations family offices and private equity in boston we were able to take advantage of an accretive off market deal with our current joint venture partner to buy out our remaining interest in the courtyard and holiday inn express south boston for a blended trailing 12 month economic cap rate of 4 9 and a 17 7 times ebitda multiple not only does this exit provide for more simplified operations and a significant gain on our investment but it allows our asset management team to dedicate their focus on our wholly owned assets resulting in more value creation for the portfolio we are very encouraged by the results from these asset sales and the overall interest level in first class real estate in urban gateway markets of which our portfolio is comprised we will use proceeds from this transaction to pay down 97 million in debt and by selling these three hotels we will avoid disruptive capital projects in 2021 and 2022 we do have a second tranche of hotels identified that we could market for sale should private market transactions continue to yield multiples substantially higher than our current public market valuation for now we remain focused on closing the currently announced transactions and on property level operations this year driving ebitda to generate free cash flow before transitioning to ash i want to discuss our fourth quarter performance beginning in miami a market poised for a multi year recovery our south florida portfolio was our strongest during the fourth quarter generating 17 7 revpar growth and outperforming the market by close to 1 700 basis points bolstered by performance at our cadillac hotel beach club the hotel generated 43 7 revpar growth capturing rate and occupancy during the first peak quarter of the season with notable success around high profile events such as our basel and new year s week the market and hotel are off to a strong start thus far in 2020 as the miami beach tract registered 22 4 year over year revpar growth in january and our properties delivered outstanding occupancy and revenue results over super bowl weekend we re anticipating significant ramp up in 2020 from the cadillac and parrot key hotels as both will benefit from a full year of operation under their belt allowing us to optimize revenue and asset management strategies for growth miami is forecasted to be one of the better performing markets in the top 25 msas in 2020 supported by a significant increase in convention room nights additional noteworthy events returning to the city such as the boat show and ultra music festival supply beginning to decelerate and the growing in more diverse corporate base in coconut grove driving hotel demand early results this quarter in key west are also very encouraging our washington dc portfolio was strong again this quarter generating 4 9 revpar growth bolstered by performance at the annapolis waterfront hotel the hotel continued to benefit from our sales and revenue management strategies resulting in 876 basis points of occupancy growth leading to 20 5 revpar growth for the quarter the st gregory continued to gain share as well following the hotel s upgrade to an upper upscale lifestyle offering in 2018 generating 10 4 revpar growth driven by 7 adr growth the st gregory is well positioned to continue its post renovation ramp and establish itself as one of the premier boutique lifestyle offerings in dupont circle the washington dc market is slated to continue this momentum in 2020 supported by less new supply deliveries and our newly renovated suite of hotels that will continue their ramp advantageously capturing market share the coronovirus does create some risk in washington and the market has experienced a decline in convention room blocks but like most of our markets china contribution represents less than 0 6 of our room revenues philadelphia was a very strong market for our portfolio in the first half of 2019 as our recently renovated hotels took advantage of the city s robust convention calendar however the second half of the year bumped up against difficult comps with our cluster generating 10 2 and 6 2 revpar growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 despite our 4 revpar loss this quarter the hampton inn continued to take advantage of increased activity at the convention center growing adr and revpar by 6 6 and 1 9 respectively convention center activity will lead to further demand to the city but results will be impacted by the wave of new supply that is hitting the market in 2020 with expected supply growth of nearly 4 6 this follows the opening of the new four seasons just last fall we are confident in the long term demand in our home market but are cognizant that results will remain temperate while new supply gets absorbed over the next 12 months out on the west coast we had mixed results in the face of new supply and decelerating corporate travel which led to a 4 revpar loss for our portfolio in the fourth quarter the sanctuary beach resort was our best performing west coast asset last year growing adr by 5 1 resulting in a 6 4 revpar growth the hotel milo in santa barbara also had a strong performance during the period registering 5 7 revpar growth aided by a 3 6 adr increase during the fourth quarter san diego faced a difficult comp as our courtyard reported 21 2 revpar growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a robust convention calendar that did not repeat this year and weighed on west coast results additionally our corporate centric hotels in sunnyvale had softer results as the market faced increased supply and a slowdown in demand from traditional corporate accounts in the fourth quarter new supply was also impactful in los angeles and seattle but we remain constructive for our west coast hotels in 2020 with significantly stronger group calendars in la and san diego revenue and asset management strategy that we ve implemented at our resort assets to drive growth and continued absorption of new supply in seattle our hotels in sunnyvale and seattle attract the most chinese travelers in our portfolio and although still not a leading source market we are sensitive to further weakness in international and corporate demand boston was significantly hampered by a difficult year over year comparison in the fourth quarter with our portfolio generating 8 2 adr growth last year due to compression surrounding the columbia massachusetts gas explosion as well as the world series success from the red sox despite our portfolio generating a 6 6 revpar loss this quarter results were approximately 500 basis points better than the market as our hotels continue to draw loyal travelers in this softer demand environment boston s convention calendar was fairly weak in 2019 but it remained a standout market for us for the majority of the year and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020 with a more robust convention calendar and continued growth from our market leading assets such as the envoy in boston seaport district one of the fastest growing innovation markets in the country new york city remained our toughest market from a growth perspective and was especially challenged this quarter as a result of the jewish holiday shift into october however occupancy continued to be strong as our portfolio registered 95 occupancy but stronger occupancy did not equate to rate acceleration again this quarter as our portfolio generated a 6 5 revpar loss which is impacted by elevated supply deliveries decelerating demand from the international traveler and rate sensitive leisure travelers generating more stays than the historically price agnostic business traveler for the second consecutive quarter margins were impacted by our inability to push rate in the market we anticipate 2020 to be a peak year for supply deliveries in manhattan with 3 7 supply growth but this will decelerate beginning in 2021 and stabilize thereafter at more normalized levels below 2 the city s progressive tactics on shadow supply enforcement have been impactful and their approach has spread as we are seeing increased legislation to combat illegal alternative accommodations in other major cities resulting in a more level playing field for our industry there are many reasons to be bullish about new york s prospects in 2022 and beyond but new supply will continue to pressure adr for the coming year our new york metro hotels two of our renovation driven growth catalyst for 2020 finished 2019 very strong with a weighted average revpar growth of 17 3 for the year we anticipate continued ramp up from these assets this year with the hyatt house white plains increasing occupancy with its 28 additional keys while the mystic marriott should see ebitda growth following its holistic renovation the industry has been challenging over the last few years with decelerating revpar growth exogenous events such as hurricane irma and dorian zika and now coronovirus elevated supply in all of our markets and expense growth impacting margins and whether this is the end of the cycle or growth is at a momentary impasse our management team has successfully navigated three cycles together and we are confident that the strategies we are deploying will lead to near and long term value creation for our shareholders with an expected difficult operating environment again this year we turn to our company specific growth catalyst for revpar acceleration our cost containment initiatives to sustain above market margins and our asset allocation strategy to reduce leverage as key drivers for 2020 over the last few years our portfolio has been recycled and renovated to now include young higher growth higher revpar producing assets with very low capex requirements and significant ebitda ramp on the horizon and with our stock trading more than 30 below our internal nav and at an 8 dividend yield with one of the lowest payout ratios in the sector we believe this is a particularly attractive entry point for investors with that let me turn it over to ash to discuss in more detail our cost containment initiatives dispositions balance sheet and our guidance for the year ashish r parikh chief financial officer great thanks neil and good morning everyone flat to low single digit revpar growth has been the norm for our industry over the last few years and coupled with expense growth has resulted in significant pressure on margins over that time several months ago we anticipated these soft revpar trends would continue into 2020 and we aggressively put measures in place to mitigate the negative impact of these cost pressures at the property and corporate level we worked in conjunction with our management partners to adjust our staffing models which led to immediate payroll savings that will be realized in 2020 our unique alignment with our management company allows us to adjust our staffing and operating model in real time which results in immediate savings for the portfolio and leads to projected 2020 ebitda margins and margin growth at the higher end of our peer set after a full evaluation of all departments for operational inefficiencies we executed on a number of cost containment strategies that will result in expense savings to help drive ebitda expansion without compromising the guest experience on property we implemented measures that are focused that are forecasted to generate 3 million in savings through consolidating line level and management positions reducing expenses related to property launches restructuring outsourced labor contracts and by reorganizing on property sales marketing and e commerce position where applicable without impeding the day to day operations of the hotel at the corporate level we carried out 1 3 million in sg a cost cuts after consolidating various levels of the organization to ensure that our corporate structure is right sized for the slow growth environment separately in coordination with our earthview sustainability team we have been executing on new strategies to reduce cost through operational and energy saving initiatives that generate immediate rois in the 20 to 30 range some of our noteworthy initiatives include installing renewable energy alternatives updating older lighting and building equipment with contemporary energy efficient models and additionally green building certifications and sustainable amenities offered at our hotels have resulted in increased group business as more than 80 of our rfps require sustainable practices delivered on property lastly after success in moving our f b operations to a lease model at our salt wood kitchen oysterette we are planning to roll out the structure to a few of our other properties our f b lease structure allows us to capture similar levels of ebitda contribution as our prior operating model but helps limit the potential drag on margins from volatile restaurant and catering operations as disclosed in yesterday s press release we have entered into a binding sales agreement on one new york city hotel one hotel in miami and two unconsolidated joint venture assets in boston which we expect to close by the end of the second quarter the closing of these transactions will result in taxable gains approximating 31 million and following debt repayments our 2020 debt to ebitda ratio will be reduced by close to half a turn at this time we are forecasting that these asset sales will be completed by the end of the second quarter and will result in a loss of approximately 2 4 million of ebitda for the back half of the year but would also result in consolidated interest expense savings of approximately 1 5 million and a reduction of 0 5 million in unconsolidated jv interest expense leading to minimal changes in our adjusted ffo and cash available for distribution for 2020 our capital expenditures for 2019 totaled 35 million a stark contrast to the 90 million we spent on capex in 2018 we currently have six renovations ongoing across our boston philadelphia and washington dc portfolios that are projected to impact our first quarter comparable portfolio revpar by 250 basis points to 300 basis points despite these disruptive capital projects we are still forecasting revpar growth for the first quarter showcasing the strength of our portfolio and its ability to generate growth in a soft demand environment and with properties under renovation for 2020 inclusive of these renovations we are forecasting total capex in the range of 35 million to 40 million allowing for further free cash flow generation to reduce our payout ratio we believe our ffo payout ratio can remain close to if not below 50 inclusive of our dispositions reduced capex spending and stabilization of our assets during the second half of 2019 we were active in the debt market in this more accommodative near term interest rate environment in the third quarter we refinanced our 300 million senior unsecured term loan and entered into a series of new swap contracts to fix the interest rate on the remaining 400 million of senior unsecured term loans eliminating all of our debt maturities until 2021 last quarter we completed a refinancing of the hilton garden inn midtown east in new york and fixed the interest rate at 3 84 until 2022 the term loan refinancing mortgage refinancings and new interest rate swap agreement completed in 2019 resulted in interest expense savings of 2 million in 2019 and an additional 3 5 million of savings are anticipated for 2020 with the refinancing of these near term maturities we continue to improve our financial flexibility as we have ample cash ample capacity with cash on hand and our 250 million revolver to execute our business plan so i ll finish with our full year guidance for 2020 and our first quarter guidance which we presented in the earnings release published yesterday as we ve discussed fourth quarter trends for the lodging industry came in below expectations and we do not foresee a near term rebound in demand fundamentals that would lead to outsized growth for the top 25 msas in 2020 we are constructive on our company specific catalyst for growth our post renovation assets that will continue to ramp and our south florida cluster the adr growth is forecasted to remain elusive and result in low single digit growth across most of our markets adding to this is the uncertainty around the full year impact of coronavirus of the coronavirus outbreak on our portfolio we have taken into account projected cancellations through february a visibility of the full impact of the outbreak for the remainder of the quarter let alone the full year remains impossible to predict at this time until we get more clarity once the virus is contained for the first quarter we are forecasting comparable portfolio revpar growth between 0 and 2 and 50 basis points to 125 basis points of margin growth with an ebitda range of 25 5 million to 27 5 million as i discussed we are undertaking six renovations in the first quarter and if were to exclude these renovations our revpar guidance range would improve by approximately 250 basis points to 300 basis points with margin growth increasing by an additional 75 basis points to 100 basis points for the first quarter for the full year 2020 we re also forecasting comparable portfolio revpar growth between 0 and 2 a negative 50 basis points to positive 50 basis points of ebitda margin growth our full year ebitda guidance is between 165 million to 170 million so this concludes my portion of the call we can now proceed to the question and answer session where jay neal and i are happy to address any questions that you may have operator questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question comes from anthony powell from barclays please go ahead anthony powell barclays capital analyst hi hello good morning everyone question on the second tranche of asset sales you talked about earlier would they be similar to the deals you did this year with very low ebitda contribution or will there be maybe some slightly larger assets neil h shah president and chief operating officer hi anthony this is neil we we have identified an additional four to five assets that we could bring to market across the back half of this year but they are much higher ebitda producing hotels and they would alter the ebitda profile of the company going forward so we are careful or cautious about bringing those to market just yet i think if the environment remains as choppy as it s been and if multiples remain as high as they are we will likely move forward on more asset sales but they would have more of an ebitda hit to the company and so we re a little cautious about them anthony powell barclays capital analyst all right and what kind of geographic profiling those assets have neil h shah president and chief operating officer our portfolio is pretty concentrated in these six markets and so they out of these three to five assets there is additional new york assets but there are some others in other markets throughout our portfolio as well anthony powell barclays capital analyst got it thanks and there was a bit of there has been more talk about increased loyalty costs in the industry that s not really generating incremental revenues i don t know if you ve seen that in any of your markets and if so how do you combat that issue neil h shah president and chief operating officer you know anthony the loyalty costs and just the costs of the brands are a constant challenge for us and for the industry there is nothing in particular or across last 30 days to 60 days that we think is noteworthy or notable but it remains a challenge and something that all owners are spending a lot of time trying to kind of combat some of the brand mandated initiatives that are coming out that do increase our cost as owners but nothing notable to share just yet anthony powell barclays capital analyst okay all right great thank you operator the next question comes from david katz from jefferies please go ahead david katz jefferies llc analyst hi good morning gentlemen how are you neil h shah president and chief operating officer doing well ashish r parikh chief financial officer good neil h shah president and chief operating officer good morning david katz jefferies llc analyst so what i had hoped is that you could help us i know that the environment is uncertain but you have a series of renos that you re starting how much ebitda could those add assuming a flattish environment on their completion and i suppose what i m trying to get to is how does the sort of ebitda line trajectory grow and start to reduce the leverage either inherently or actually literally by by paying some of it down and you know how could we sort of get to a three year or so horizon neil h shah president and chief operating officer you know it is david katz jefferies llc analyst not looking for guidance obviously neil h shah president and chief operating officer yeah we do have we have a handful of renovations occurring right now and a handful kind of our full we re expecting about 35 million in capex spending in 2020 which is very similar to last year 2019 and that s kind of going to be our run rate moving forward in that range 25 million to 35 million we re spending all of that this year in the first quarter our weakest quarter for those markets that we are renovating assets in so in boston we have a couple of hotels in philadelphia the westin is getting a meeting space and lobby renovation currently which we think will be impactful to their rates moving forward and we have a handful of others that will be complete by let s say april at the latest they will provide a tailwind for performance on those assets and they are and they are part of our guidance for that matter but we are we do we do believe that there could be some notable upside from some of those renovations but i think big picture it s after two three four years of repositionings and redevelopments the portfolio truly is non disrupted and is now at the point where we can have very significant ramp up in miami and parrot key not be offset by other renovation activity in the portfolio or other disruptions throughout the portfolio so we feel like this will be a solid year where we can demonstrate an increase in free cash flow and that will by 2021 allow us to start paying down cash paying down debt from cash flow these asset sales of these first quarter bring us down about a half a turn if we were to execute on our next three to five it could be a half a turn to a little bit more than that also so we do think of it as a two year to three year process to get to below five times debt to ebitda we can accelerate that process by accelerating asset sales it s just we re in an environment where it is just we re in an environment where it is just so uncertain and so choppy that we re hesitant to provide a more bullish same store commentary just yet david katz jefferies llc analyst very helpful ashish r parikh chief financial officer let me let me go ahead and add one thing to that so when we when we really look out say past this year into 2021 and beyond we would also anticipate that growth and if we re getting back to more normalized growth but say in the 2 to 3 growth ranges it s really going to be adr driven because if you look at our portfolio in the industry over the last few years last year we actually gained occupancy throughout the portfolio over 100 basis points but everything we lost was in adr so as you look into 2021 and beyond you would anticipate adr growth being a driver of most of the revpar growth which would lead to flow through kind of in the 1 6 times 1 7 times range so anticipating better days 2021 and beyond we do think that even minimal 2 to 3 type of growth can lead to pretty significant ebitda growth david katz jefferies llc analyst right okay perfect thank you so much operator the next question comes from michael bellisario from baird please go ahead michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst good morning everyone neil h shah president and chief operating officer good morning michael ashish r parikh chief financial officer good morning michael michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst you just mentioned some strength in south florida in december and then in 1q so far but is that pickup that you mentioned really just isolated to south florida or are you guys seeing any other pockets of strength compared to the slower trends that you saw during 3q neil h shah president and chief operating officer i think there was there was i don t think our experience was as clear as some of the other research notes i read on some of the other companies in terms of fourth quarter stabilization we did see some stabilization by november december in a lot of our corporate markets and we think that as a function of the china trade disputes coming to an end and reaching some agreement so we were feeling like november and december there was some stability emerging in a lot of markets around the country but i would say that kind of and then december miami clearly was very strong but some of our other markets were less bad or the trend of deceleration slowed down and it kind of had stabilized a bit as we look this year in january even beyond the super bowl january was very strong in south florida and so far in february both in miami and key west it has been very strong and kind of reaching prior peak performance kind of like 2015 level performance so we do believe that miami is back miami and south florida the convention center is working the events are coming back being post dorian irma zika is all starting to deliver results and so our focus really i guess our comments are primarily about miami and south florida being where we re seeing a clear recovery right now michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst got it that s helpful and then just on the blue moon sale can you maybe just talk more about why performance was down so much at that hotel at least on a ttm basis and then what do you think would have been the capex needs at that property 12 months or 24 months out i think you mentioned there was an upcoming renovation there neil h shah president and chief operating officer yeah michael that bring up a good point that you know on both of these asset sales both duane street and blue moon they were great multiples on trailing ebitda but we were expecting to do major renovations at both hotels later this year and early next year at blue moon we think that it would have been 15 000 to 20 000 a room kind of renovation so add 3 million to 4 million 2 million to 4 million depending on how far we went with the program with dwayne street also in that same neighborhood around the 2 million to 3 million not huge dollar amounts but as a percentage of those asset values they were meaningful blue moon for us was a we own three hotels on miami beach the cadillac the winter haven and the blue moon all three are autograph collection hotels with marriott the blue moon was the only asset that we owned in miami beach that wasn t ocean front so that kind of was something that led our performance across the last few years in an environment of slow demand and kind of choppy demand in miami it was those hotels south of 15th street and off of the ocean that bore the brunt of weakness in the market there is blue moon it s a very fine hotel of high quality building and high quality box but it is surrounded by a lot of other art deco hotels that were that had been pushing rates down in the marketplace we also see the level of new supply in miami is definitely decelerating very noticeably peak supply there really was 17 and 18 16 through 18 but there is some new hotels there are some new hotels opening in that south beach area closer to blue moon that was also something that was concerning for us as we look forward we believe in miami not only for this next year or two but for the long term we do think of it as one of the highest growth markets in the country in the world for the long term but being off the beach and requiring renovations made it one that we felt like we could sacrifice michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst that s helpful color thank you operator the next question comes from bryan maher from b riley fbr inc please go ahead bryan maher b riley fbr inc analyst good morning guys not to beat a dead horse on south florida but can you tell us how cadillac and parrot key given the strength in the market are doing relative to your expectations of maybe 6 months or 12 months ago ashish r parikh chief financial officer hey bryan this is ashish yeah we are at this point based on our forecast for 2020 we are at or slightly above where we thought we would be for the first quarter and for 2020 in and of itself right now we are looking at an ebitda range somewhere in the 15 million to 16 million range and probably getting a little bit better even for those assets for the full year compared to roughly 12 million last year peak ebitda for these assets were 17 million back in 2015 so we still think that there is ample ramp up opportunity before we truly get to stabilization at these assets bryan maher b riley fbr inc analyst great and then you mentioned in your prepared comments something about your cost savings initiatives and updating older lighting i m guessing that s to led lighting can you talk about how much more opportunity there is there throughout the system and what other more impactful cost saving initiatives you might be implementing this year ashish r parikh chief financial officer sure most of the lighting is has been converted to led lighting at this point we are looking at doing some more solar installation projects this year we continue to look at our overall water usage across the portfolio but still it is energy management systems temperature controlled hvac systems that where we see the greatest opportunity bryan maher b riley fbr inc analyst great and then last from me on labor costs can you talk about what the trend has been over the last quarter or two and what your thoughts are for 2020 ashish r parikh chief financial officer trends really haven t changed that much bryan i mean we re still looking at a total labor increase including benefit of 4 to 5 for this year that s been pretty consistent over the last few years we aren t seeing it going up one of the things that we re now looking at is really most of our major markets are coming up to sort of this 13 to 15 minimum wage and that s been going up by 1 or 2 in most of these markets every year so we re sort of peaking out at this point in most of our markets and we think that the rate of that minimum wage increase in overall rate growth should start to stabilize it s probably more in the 3 range going forward bryan maher b riley fbr inc analyst okay thank you operator the next question comes from ari klein from bmo capital markets please go ahead ari klein bmo capital markets analyst thanks maybe just following up on the last question on the cost side of things how much left do you think is there to cut when you maybe when you look out ahead into 2021 or so if the environment continues to remain weak and how much more can you savings can you find neil h shah president and chief operating officer you know ari it s really dependent on certainly on market conditions we haven t touched anything that s truly guest facing at this point because we re not seeing any material drop off in occupancies when we look at the last downturn in 08 or in 09 we were able to cut a significant amount of costs from our portfolio and we had to hit things that were guest facing so if the markets remained very challenging or were more challenging we would have to implement those type of cuts we ve looked at everything in our portfolio from consolidating positions to looking at different ways to do housekeeping having managers run shifts at front desk mobile check in and so we will continue to look at ways to cut costs and we still believe that there are opportunities but it is dependent on what we see from the standpoint of the operating environment ari klein bmo capital markets analyst got it all right thank you operator the next question comes from bill crow from raymond james please go ahead bill crow raymond james financial analyst thanks good morning on miami in your discussion about supply having peaked just curious how the marriott marquis of 1 700 rooms is going to impact the market i know it s not on the beach it s on a different sub market but it s an awfully big hotel to open all at once neil h shah president and chief operating officer yeah no it is and that hotel like recently i ve been noticing it like popping up on some of the supply reports again remember this deal was discussed a lot in 2010 and 2011 as part of the downtown redevelopment and originally it was talked about when there was hope for gambling to come to miami or more broad gambling than just native american like gambling that never happened but the rest of this kind of downtown world center has continued to develop so there has been some new office and residential that s gone up and again there is talk about this 1 700 room marriott marquis i would tell you that it s nowhere close to getting started just yet but when that comes that would have some impact 1 700 rooms in a market like miami would be very significant but i believe that that is at least three to four years away and so i think of it almost as a the next cycle supply and i m not considering that in the next several years hitting the numbers where we did see a lot of new supply on miami beach in brickell or in areas west and north of miami that was significant in the last several years but at least on the beach there is there is a clear deceleration of new supply bill crow raymond james financial analyst yeah that s helpful on capex i know we talked about it quite a bit on this call but where do you think your baseline ff e spend is it s not on the renovations but just the maintenance are you 4 000 a key 5 000 a key what where do you think you are neil h shah president and chief operating officer just on maintenance bill bill crow raymond james financial analyst yeah neil h shah president and chief operating officer you know i don t think it s even that high across the portfolio i mean most of our assets are very young we don t have sprawling f b space that most of these i would say on a maintenance basis it s probably maybe 2 500 to 3 500 of that ashish r parikh chief financial officer yeah so it feels like that would be at the high end even because again you know not only are our assets a little bit more focused in rooms oriented but they re all relatively newly built assets and so we just don t have the same level of roof repairs to be focused on or other systems kind of renovations that might hit the numbers bill crow raymond james financial analyst yeah okay that s helpful too one final one from me we talked about the you talked about this three year goal to get the leverage down the last couple of years you ve been talking about 200 million in the ebitda from this portfolio and clearly not going to hit that number or and i also think the street ever believed that you re going to quite get there but what were the two or three things that just threw you off the rails in your progress toward that numbers so when you think about the adjustments we have to make neil h shah president and chief operating officer i mean one of the biggest drivers of it was hurricane irma and so it just kind of delayed our projects and the whole ramp up of the system that was probably the biggest single driver i think number two was the ongoing weakness in new york and kind of a turn for the for the worse last year those were the two probably biggest specific drivers but overall it s been a much weaker corporate demand environment than we had expected three years ago we did not expect to have we knew it would be challenging and choppy with new supply but we were expecting we were not expecting government shutdown we were not expecting the level of trade disputes that we had and the impact that that had on gdp bill crow raymond james financial analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate it guys thanks operator the next question comes from barry oxford from d a davidson please go ahead barry oxford d a davidson analyst great thanks guys switching gears just a little bit to the coronavirus i know it s hard to kind of handicap what that s going to be but if you guys look back at sars and i know this is different than sars but what type of cancellations did you see coming out of sars just to kind of help us kind of frame what might be coming ashish r parikh chief financial officer you know barry this is ashish in 2003 when the sars virus hit our portfolio was just very different from where we are today so it s difficult to draw a correlation barry oxford d a davidson analyst right right i m talking about more from an industry level what was going on and what and what were you guys seeing at that particular time ashish r parikh chief financial officer i mean with sars there were a few months in time that there was a meaningful revpar impact in major gateway cities so i think it was new york at high single digits decline in revpar for a couple of months and so that i think is the worst case fear in our mind that it could could it be that rough we don t expect it to be at that level i think the world has matured a lot since 2003 and it s gotten used to some things but i think it s important to know that even when that happened in 2003 the bounce back was very quick and actually out like within six months i believe it was well above pre sars performance so it s a pretty quick bounce back when it s done but for a month or two in sars in the case of sars there was some impact in cities like new york barry oxford d a davidson analyst right would you maybe expect domestic travel that might have gone to international to stay here to offset some of the international that may not come here or not necessarily ashish r parikh chief financial officer absolutely absolutely there is barry oxford d a davidson analyst i m talking about like miami like instead of going abroad maybe people deciding to go to miami ashish r parikh chief financial officer yeah no i think that s absolutely something we ll see barry oxford d a davidson analyst perfect thanks for the color guys operator the next question comes from chris woronka from deutsche bank please go ahead chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys on the blue moon do you know if that s going to remain autograph collection kind of post the sale and then the second question with that is as we look at south beach still a lot of independently branded properties out there are you guys aware are the brand still trying to kind of encroach and poach some of those over to soft brands and how might that impact your portfolio in south beach neil h shah president and chief operating officer just in the case of the blue moon we are going to deliver the asset the hotel unencumbered of brand and management to the buyer and so we re expecting it will be an independent hotel like many others in miami i think in terms of other soft brands i mean all the brands are looking for looking to grow their brands for sure what makes it a little bit challenging in miami and particularly in south beach with these art deco hotels is that very few of them have more than 50 to 75 rooms and so on those smaller boxes to run brand fees through them can be pretty challenging and most of these are deco hotels aren t they were built for a different age and a different time so their bathrooms are small the guest room footprint is not current or traditional and so they re not perfect fits for a lot of the brands because of some of those requirements the blue moon was one that had gone through a major renovation right before we had purchased it so it had the current life safety specs and all of that that made it possible to be a branded execution but i see just as many acquisitions happening in miami right now that are taking something and going independent with it or creating a new brand out of it like the raleigh in miami beach they re going to try to create something out of that of what was an independent hotel and aren t willing to take on any kind of soft brands or anything for it so is that is that where you were does that answer your question chris woronka deutsche bank analyst yeah no i think that s great and just a follow up is as you guys think about the impact of the election coming up in the fall how have you kind of underwritten the dc portfolio into guidance for say september october neil h shah president and chief operating officer chris one of the things this year in october is actually dc has a fairly good convention calendar right now so to offset what we usually see post labor day in election year is very the congressman and the senator and everybody kind of goes back to their home district especially when its forecast to be a very contentious election this year it is it is good to see that the convention calendar is laid out in a way that should offer sort of any downdraft so our q3 sort of end of q3 and early q4 numbers are actually better than they were last year from a forecast standpoint chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay very helpful thanks guys operator we have a follow up question from anthony powell from barclays please go ahead anthony powell barclays capital analyst hi just one more from me i think we ve talked about weaker corporate travel for a number of years now and not just you but a lot of the other companies given that would you have changed any of your investment decisions over the past few years and looking to the next say five to ten years would you change any of your allocation to be more resort driven or any different clusters that you d like to get into given this kind of weaker corporate demand environment that we ve seen neil h shah president and chief operating officer we don t break out kind of our resort portfolio within our numbers but we have in fact across the last three to five years it was nearly half of our investment activity was in the resort space or maybe a little more than half of the activity on the west coast we think of the sanctuary beach resort the hotel milo and the san ambrose as resort executions we think of on the in florida our assets in miami beach as well as in key west and even the annapolis waterfront resort in on the chesapeake bay as one of our resort executions and they clearly have had great performance across the cycle and across the last three years when the corporate market has been tepid you know yeah i guess if we had perfect information in hindsight we could have lightened the load on new york even more if we felt like the corporate market was going to be as tough as it is but again like it s not a very it s not a regret necessarily it s a fact that we had a little bit of the market was that way generally markets rebound and recover and so we feel like we are highly leveraged to a corporate recovery but in the meantime we are continuing to be able to show better than average growth because of our leisure oriented properties for being a concentrated portfolio it s relatively well balanced and diversified among the major segments anthony powell barclays capital analyst all right great thanks for that operator there are no more questions in the queue this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks ashish r parikh chief financial officer thank you neil h shah president and chief operating officer thank you we know you have a busy morning with some other calls but jay ash and i and greg are here in the office for any follow ups talk to you

cash and cash equivalents table 8 non gaap definitions adjusted net income loss is defined by us as net income loss before mark to market interest rate swap adjustments former parent legacy items restructuring charges the gain loss on the early extinguishment of debt impairments the tax effect of the foregoing adjustments and net income loss from discontinued operations the gross amounts for these items as well as the adjustment for income taxes are presented we revised our definition of this metric in the fourth quarter of 2019 to adjust for net income loss from discontinued operations to facilitate comparison of the results of our ongoing operations operating ebitda is defined by us as net income loss before depreciation and amortization interest expense net income taxes and other items that are not core to the operating activities of the company such as restructuring charges former parent legacy items gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt impairments gains or losses on discontinued operations and gains or losses on the sale of investments or other assets operating ebitda is our primary non gaap measure we present operating ebitda because we believe it is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provides greater transparency into our results of operations our management including our chief operating decision maker uses operating ebitda as a factor in evaluating the performance of our business operating ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations data prepared in accordance with gaap we believe operating ebitda facilitates company to company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting net interest expense taxation the age and book depreciation of facilities affecting relative depreciation expense and the amortization of intangibles as well as other items that are not core to the operating activities of the company such as restructuring charges gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt former parent legacy items impairments gains or losses on discontinued operations and gains or losses on the sale of investments or other assets which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance we further believe that operating ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies many of which present an operating ebitda measure when reporting their results operating ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider operating ebitda either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are this measure does not reflect changes in or cash required for our working capital needs this measure does not reflect our interest expense except for interest related to our securitization obligations or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt this measure does not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes this measure does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future and this measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies may calculate this measure differently so they may not be comparable operating ebitda including discontinued operations includes operating ebitda as defined above plus the operating ebitda contribution from discontinued operations on the same basis free cash flow is defined as net income loss attributable to realogy before income tax expense benefit net of payments interest expense net cash interest payments depreciation and amortization capital expenditures restructuring costs and former parent legacy costs benefits net of payments impairments gain loss on the early extinguishment of debt and working capital adjustments free cash flow including discontinued operations includes free cash flow as defined above plus the free cash flow contribution from discontinued operations on the same basis we use free cash flow in our internal evaluation of operating effectiveness and decisions regarding the allocation of resources as well as measuring the company s ability to generate cash since free cash flow can be viewed as both a performance measure and a cash flow measure the company has provided a reconciliation to both net income attributable to realogy holdings and net cash provided by operating activities free cash flow is not defined by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income loss net cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of the company s operating performance or liquidity free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies we present operating ebitda including discontinued operations and free cash flow including discontinued operations to facilitate period over period results however these non gaap terms are subject to the same limitations noted above for operating ebitda and free cash flow and in addition include the add back of earnings and cash from discontinued operations which is not indicative of the results of our continuing operations source realogy holdings corp related links

photo marcelo hernandez getty images chileans are in a foul mood last october they took to the streets to demand better pensions improved public services quality education and wider access to health care over the past decade slowing growth a soaring cost of living and socioeconomic immobility have become widespread yet this moment of national pessimism is occurring in the country that has enjoyed a reputation as latin america s capitalist success story for the past thirty years with protests still simmering conservative president sebastián piñera has put chile on track for a divisive constitutional reform process slated to conclude by the end of 2021 fears of completely overhauling the nation s basic commitment to laissez faire principles are overblown but an extended period of uncertainty means that the damage to its reputation could be long lasting blow to the economy if chile s economy was already sputtering the economic impact from the country s protests is considerable the chilean peso has fluctuated since demonstrations began becoming one of the worst performing emerging market currencies since the start of the year up to 300 000 chilean jobs are at risk according to analysts the central bank of chile cut growth projections for 2020 to a range of 0 5 to 1 5 from 2 75 to 3 75 previously the government of president sebastián piñera has offered a 5 5 billion stimulus package to rebuild public infrastructure speed up pension payments and support small and medium sized businesses the recovery plan followed additional increases to social benefits including a boost to pensions and the minimum wage but the costs of meeting all these social demands are rising public spending will increase by at least 10 this year leading chile to hit its highest budget deficit of the last 30 years chile s borrowing is now expected to reach nearly 40 of gdp within five years in addition to economic woes stemming from protests the chilean economy s dependence on copper exports has proved painful amid trade wars and china s slowing growth nevertheless the fact that chile s economy is growing instead of contracting following mass upheaval is a positive indicator indeed chile continues to enjoy a credit rating of a aa with a stable outlook according to standard poor s the highest in latin america the chilean protests have proven that political dynamics can shift in an instant even in latin america s most functioning democracy and economically developed country rewriting the constitution the risk in chile has turned more political than economic on april 26 a referendum will be held to determine whether the country will rewrite its constitution this is a foregone conclusion as the vast majority of chileans support the idea the process will culminate with approval of the final text in a second plebiscite giving chile a new constitution by the end of 2021 chile is not the first country in latin america to consider changing its constitution in the last few decades with positive economic benefit for example colombia had a constitutional convention in 1991 chile s constitution has been rewritten several times although this is the first time since the end of chile s military dictatorship that a completely new document could be written a new constitution could be a good thing chile s wealthier business and financial elites are nervous that rewriting the constitution at this time of national gloom could result in a venezuela inspired document that turns chile s democracy into a statist chavism style model the fears in part stem from the fact that a second vote timed to coincide with municipal and regional elections will determine who would write the new constitution and how the timing of the vote could politicize the constitutional process but despite the concerns the chances are high that chile will maintain a competitive market economy with new stronger elements of a european style welfare state a two thirds majority will be required for new laws and most chileans do not want to fundamentally overturn the country s economic model the pillars of chile s economic success an open economy respect for private property central bank independence sound macroeconomic policy are unlikely to disappear a final constitution would be ratified in a third vote in early 2022 a slow grind while a new constitution is unlikely to radically deviate from the chile we know today it s the slow pace of the process that prolongs economic uncertainty and political instability members of the constituent assembly will not be elected until october and will then deliberate for up to a year before a referendum takes place in the meantime it comes as no surprise that much needed domestic and foreign investment in chile might well be shelved the situation is made more difficult by an unpopular central government president piñera who remains in office until 2022 is polling at single digit support while chile s leftist parties dislike the center right leader conservative factions believe he has already given away too many concessions meanwhile the government faces accusations of human rights violations and police repression from international bodies like the inter american commission on human rights and ngos like human rights watch chile s shifting reputation as the constitutional process meanders slowly forward demonstrations could once again intensify if economic activity and employment suffer dramatically but a new constitution that levels the social playing field while defending the free market would have a positive long term impact going forward chile s reputation as a country immune from the region s social turbulence has clearly suffered a hit the recent protests have proven that political dynamics can shift in an instant even in latin america s most functioning democracy and economically developed country
expand evan vucci ap photo in president trump s state of the union speech last month he declared his economy to be the best it has ever been a recent analysis found otherwise capital main is an award winning publication that reports from california on economic political and social issues the american prospect is co publishing this piece new analysis of government data shows that since donald trump took office inflation adjusted income growth has slowed significantly across the u s all but two states saw a decline in growth of real median household income under trump including pennsylvania wisconsin michigan and florida four states widely regarded as the key electoral battlegrounds that will likely determine the 2020 presidential election middle class incomes grew at a rate of 2 7 percent from 2016 through 2018 compared to a 5 8 percent growth rate from 2014 through 2016 when accounting for inflation despite what we heard at the state of the union the truth is that this economy is not performing well for most americans says thea lee president of the washington d c based economic policy institute epi at this point in the business cycle wage and income growth for working households should be accelerating not slowing the new findings from an epi and capital main analysis of the most recent u s census data offer a stark departure from trump s characterization of how well middle class americans are faring as the country heads into the thick of its primary season in his state of the union speech last month he declared his economy to be the best it has ever been in fact the analysis found that among the ten states where the 2016 margin of victory for either trump or hillary clinton was less than four percentage points nine have experienced a drop in the growth of household income between 2016 and 2018 real median household income declined in six states and the district of columbia which has three electoral votes during the 2014 2016 obama expansion median household income declined in one state the decline in real median household income occurred in mostly red states alaska west virginia south dakota and wyoming it also occurred in new mexico which is considered a long shot for trump and in the blue state of connecticut presidents often claim too much credit and take too much blame for the country s economic performance economists agree indeed david cooper a senior analyst with epi who led the analysis of census data says that obama benefited from a prolonged low rate of inflation during the last two years of his presidency a low inflation rate makes it easier for households to stretch a dollar to cover basic necessities but economists also say trump has squandered opportunities to support greater gains for middle class families and in some cases he has backed policies that have worked counter to their interests an infrastructure bill would clearly have a marked impact especially on middle level jobs says mark muro a senior fellow at the brookings institution s metropolitan policy program manufacturing is going in the wrong direction i think there are all kinds of policy opportunities that have not been exploited muro sees some warning signs for 2020 such as the manufacturing recession and uncertainty over trade due to the lingering effects of the trade war and now the coronavirus which has sickened tens of thousands of people in china and shuttered factories factory production in the u s shrank by 1 3 percent in the past year according to the washington post epi s lee argues that trump has taken steps that have hurt the middle class including the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and the overturning of regulations like overtime protection that shore up workers paychecks the current administration s focus on cutting taxes for the wealthy expanding tax incentives for outsourcing and undercutting workers rights has left ordinary working households in most states barely gaining ground notes lee expand capital main trump has claimed that real median household income growth during his presidency vastly exceeds growth under the obama presidency an assertion that relied on research from heritage foundation fellow stephen moore a former trump campaign adviser moore used as his starting point 2009 thereby saddling obama with the consequences of the recession he inherited given the severity of the great recession household incomes continued to plummet for two years after it ended in june 2009 in addition moore drew his data from a private data firm sentier research which uses smaller sample sizes than the u s census to generate monthly and more current estimates of household income whether the trend of slowing household income growth has continued through 2019 and into 2020 is unclear unemployment now at 3 6 percent has been at a historic low while the stock market surged last year a february brookings institution report predicts that the census will document stronger household income growth for 2019 the census will release its 2019 household income data in september but wages for the median worker have not been rising as fast as hoped given the low rate of unemployment real median hourly wages grew just 1 percent during 2019 and in 24 states the median hourly wage grew 1 percent or less according to epi and capital main analysis of u s census data stagnant median wage growth also plagued the obama recovery real hourly wage growth for the typical worker remained under 2 percent even in the final years of his presidency by contrast median hourly wages grew at a rate of 2 7 percent annually during the tight labor market of the late 1990s epi s cooper attributes the comparatively weak wage growth to slack in the labor market as well as to lower unionization rates the weakening of safety net programs and trade policies that have encouraged offshoring of work among other factors employers have greater leverage to hold down wages now than they did during previous periods notes cooper
