overview global equity benchmarks are headed for their third consecutive loss today as caution prevails at the start of q3 after a strong first half ten year benchmark yields are edging higher after a soft start in asia italian bonds continue to outperform greek bonds have been set back as the new government reiterated its commitment to ease fiscal commitments as if tsipras did not try and got a similar rebuff the dollar is firmer against the major currencies and most emerging market currencies the south korean won edged higher after falling in five of the past six sessions and the turkish lira is consolidating after yesterday s drubbing gold and oil are modestly lower asia pacific contrary to some reports japan and south korea are not engaged in a trade war prime minister abe requires the new licenses are needed by south korean companies to purchase three essential materials required for the fabrication of semiconductors and the new screens for mobile phones and tablets reports suggest the license may take up to 90 days to process this is a work slowdown japanese producers of materials will suffer and like the us threatening to cut huawei out of the updates to the mobile operating systems it will be a card that can be played one a consumer boycott against japanese goods may also be spurred south korea must become less dependent on japan based inputs and must eye with suspicions those companies that have set up plants within its country and in china it is not a trade war between japan and south korea and the us has not triggered a global trade war yet note too eu s new trade deal with mercosur and vietnam but there are some troubling if arguable similarities japan actions are driven by one man the move appears likely to hurt its own economy the use of trade as a weapon to express displeasure at a non trade issue working level talks between the two countries are expected to be held in tokyo this week japan s labor cash earnings fell 0 2 in may from a year ago it has fallen every month this year for at an average pace of 0 6 in the first five months of 2018 it rose at an average pace of 1 0 nevertheless the weakness in labor cash earnings is not the only source of household income such as bonuses and capital income from stocks note that even though japan has negative interest rates the dividend yield of japan s topix is 2 4 compared with a little less than 1 90 of the s p 500 in any case the point that the decline in cash wages has not curbed consumption household spending rose 4 in may year over year the strongest pace in four years the biggest sell off in australian stocks in five weeks appears to weigh on the australian dollar which is trading near 2 5 week lows it is the fourth consecutive losing session losing around 1 5 cumulatively the next support is seen near 0 6915 though a potential double top suggests near term potential extends toward 0 6880 meanwhile the dollar has taken out last month s high in the yen and is edging closer to formidable resistance near jpy109 there is an 850 mln option struck that that expires today a break above there would lift the technical tone and suggest the next immediate target of jpy109 60 which is the 50 retracement of the dollar s loss from the year s high in late april a potential head and shoulders formation with a neckline near jpy109 has a measuring objective of near jpy111 00 europe sterling may find greater support is an amendment submitted by grieve is accepted it would effectively block the threat that the next prime minister likely johnson would facilitate the dissolution of parliament to push through a no deal exit the amendment requires parliament to be in session on september 4 october 9 and every two weeks until december 16 if the amendment is accepted by the speaker a vote could be held later today the prospect of a no deal exit which some try to re spin as an exit to the wto has weighed on sterling it is the weakest of the major currencies losing about 4 5 over the past three months the data calendar is light for europe today and the main feature was a disappointing 0 7 decline in italy s may retail sales it is the largest monthly decline this year which has averaged a 0 12 decline in the first five months of 2018 the average was a gain of the same magnitude the euro has been pushed through 1 12 for the first time since june 19 a break below 1 1180 warns of a re test on the year s lows seen in april and may near 1 1100 ideas that the ecb will ease before or more extensive than the fed is weighing on the single currency resistance is seen in the 1 1220 1 1240 band on an intraday basis the euro is overextended and early north american dealers may buy back the euro sold yesterday and look to re set on a bounce today sterling is trading at its lowest level since january s flash crash 1 2440 sterling had forged a base near 1 20 in q4 16 and q1 17 and there is beginning to be some thoughts of a retest meanwhile the euro sterling cross continues to be capped near gbp0 9000 note that the correlation between sterling and the euro percentage change rolling 60 days stands near 0 65 which is twice as high as prevailed for most of q2 america while strategists and analysts are spilling proverbial ink over last week s comments by trump seemingly implicitly threatening intervention the market seems to have paid it no heed what is generally not appreciated is that the federal reserve s real broad trade weighted dollar index fell almost 0 9 in h1 19 a greater response may be spurred by bank of canada governor poloz after tomorrow s meeting only two currencies in the world have appreciated more than the canadian dollar s 4 0 appreciation against the us dollar the russian ruble 9 5 and the thai baht 5 8 with most other central banks with easing biases the bank of canada stands out as staying neutral the risk then maybe for more canadian dollar appreciation which theoretically could short the recovery that appears underway as trade and investments picks up some of the slack of the softer household poloz could be more tactful that trump and emphasize the risks to the economy from the global headwinds slowing world trade china s attempt to punish canada for possibly cooperating with the us on extradition of huawei executive meng wanzhou the us jolts data is more for economists than traders who may look for hints today of powell s testimony before congress over the next two sessions powell and quarles speak today on the stress tests while regional presidents bullard and bostic speak in st louis canada reports housing starts and permits figures which are overshadowed by the bank of canada meeting tomorrow mexico reports june inflation figures and although a dip back into the central bank s range below 4 is expected price pressures are still seen as too high to give officials the latitude to cut rates however the high real and nominal rates are weighing on the economy and friday s industrial production report is expected to show that the contraction on a year over year basis has extended for the seventh consecutive month for the past three sessions the us dollar has carved out a little shelf in the cad1 3040 cad1 3050 range the upper end of the range is seen near cad1 3150 the daily technical indicators macd and slow stochastics suggest the risk in the days ahead is for a stronger us dollar the us dollar is steadying against the mexican peso after falling to its lowest level since may 1 yesterday mxn18 86 during what we anticipate to be a short consolidation period the dollar may test resistance now seen near mxn19 10 the dollar index consolidated the gains scored in response to the pre weekend employment data yesterday but is extended the move today by punching through the 97 50 area the next target is last month s high 97 75 97 80 disclaimer

interview with bfm business tv interview with benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by hedwige chevrillon published on 9 july 2019 mr cœuré your name has frequently been mentioned in recent days and the european central bank ecb has been very much in the news with the proposed appointment of christine lagarde as president of the ecb your name had been mentioned do you understand the reasons for the choice that was made it s an excellent choice it s an excellent choice because christine lagarde s career first in france and then at the international monetary fund imf in washington makes her eminently qualified to be president of the ecb in what way she understands perfectly how the global economy works and how the euro area economy works she knows how to speak to the financial markets she knows the institutional set up in the euro area so she will do an extremely good job there are many economists here in aix you are a distinguished economist with a fine reputation it has been pointed out with some justification that christine lagarde doesn t have a technical background in economics or in monetary policy do we need to worry about the future of monetary policy in europe no it s a criticism that has been made of christine lagarde but she knows the economy very well she has led the imf she has been finance minister so she knows how the economy works in addition she will have a team of excellent ecb economists who will work alongside her and advise her and she will manage things very well yes but the first one of you and that would be you mr cœuré you may for legal reasons for reasons of nationality end up leaving the ecb this is worrying a lot of people i won t hide it from you even people here who are saying that if benoit cœuré were to leave having been one of the main architects of the current monetary policy framework that would leave a huge void at the ecb i ll be leaving the ecb on 31 december 2019 because that s when my eight year term comes to an end irrespective of christine lagarde s appointment i ll be staying until the end of december until the end of my term the ecb s chief economist my colleague philip lane who was previously governor of the central bank of ireland is an excellent macroeconomist and he will be able to steer things extremely well isn t the biggest challenge the question of the team the future team surrounding christine lagarde it s a challenge that everyone faces when they take on a new role of course but she will make good decisions as you said yourself you re going to be leaving the ecb are you a candidate to become managing director of the imf no i m not a candidate for the imf there are plenty of good candidates don t ask me who my preferred candidate would be because the decision is not up to me my speciality is europe and so i d rather stay in europe and continue to serve europe the way in which i do so remains to be seen there are various ways but i m not a candidate for the imf listening to the statements made by mario draghi one has the impression that he is inclined to continue the ecb s current interest rate policy meaning a policy of very low interest rates that policy is giving rise to considerable side effects which we will discuss do you think this policy will be in place for a long time it s a policy that has side effects and this is something that we are monitoring we are aware of the side effects but our policy is necessary why is that it s because our objective is to ensure that inflation comes back to our objective which is close to but below 2 and we re not there yet so monetary policy needs to be accommodative until that objective is met but what if there is deflation with this interest rate policy it s a policy which has created tens of millions of jobs in the euro area which is supporting activity and thus a return of inflation towards 2 and which is all the more necessary right now when we are facing a slowdown in the global economy and significant global risks which are not related to europe but rather to trade tensions caused by various countries and which are affecting confidence in this environment an accommodative monetary policy is needed more than ever the governing council of the ecb has said that we are ready to act if new downside risks materialise so the policy is necessary to fulfil our mandate but what monetary tools do you have at your disposal if you do need to act we have used various tools up until now the forward guidance through which we steer monetary policy expectations interest rates which are very low and which we have said we would be ready to lower further still if necessary and i always stress if necessary and the reinvestment of our securities portfolio which ensures that the ecb has a very significant presence in the markets and theoretically we could also resume making net asset purchases again if warranted by the circumstances but what are the circumstances there are lots of questions about the circumstances is it the growth rate the rate of inflation a lack of inflation i used something of a dirty word before when i referred to deflation i apologise for that but at the same time isn t it a kind of sword of damocles hanging over you there is no deflation in the euro area we are not talking about a risk of deflation inflation is well above zero the risk is that a series of negative shocks might move us further away from our objective of 2 that is what we are looking at what we are trying to understand particularly in the light of the global economy what some people are worried about and we talk about a lot here is the possibility of a financial crisis even a financial explosion whether in the short or medium term i don t know maybe you will give us a time scale is there a risk of the bubble bursting or a liquidity crisis on the horizon there are always risks in the financial sector and as central bankers we are paid to worry about them the role of central bankers and regulators is to worry about risks our first conclusion is that we have to maintain and protect the system of financial regulation that has been built since the great financial crisis since 2007 08 as time goes by people are tending to forget this crisis and the temptation returns particularly under the pressure of different lobby groups to relax financial regulation this temptation must be resisted both in terms of banking and finance more generally then we have to identify the new risks i see two main risks there are many but i would like to highlight two of them first we have the risk that part of the financial sector slips out of the domain of banks and into the domain of non banks that s already the case yes it s already the case the size of banks is now under control the large banks are handling risk much better than they were before the crisis but the price to pay for that has been that part of the financial sector has moved to the domain of non banks investment funds money market funds etc which is regulated differently where we don t have the so called macroprudential instruments in other words a way to control the bubbles as one might say these instruments barely exist or don t even exist at all in the domain of market based finance that s a challenge for regulators particularly for the next cycle of european regulation over the next five years do you think we need to create new regulatory instruments for this non bank finance yes exactly and the second risk i see which is of a different nature is cyber risk the risk linked to cyber attacks at the ecb and elsewhere in europe we are paying close attention to this issue we can t rule out the fact that the next financial crisis may come from a cyber attack on a big financial institution or a financial infrastructure it s our priority to prevent this risk do you think the chances of a cyber attack are quite high it s fairly logical given that we re already seeing cyber attacks against companies ask any company director there are thousands of cyber attacks every day we re being tested all the time including at the ecb it s part of being a company but the financial system has weak points there are systemic infrastructures that could be targeted by cyber attacks at the ecb we ve reacted by creating a forum the euro cyber resilience board which assesses the resilience of major european infrastructures we ve also reacted at the level of the g7 with a recent cyber crisis coordination exercise has the ecb already experienced a major significant cyber attack we experience thousands of small ones every day like everyone so no massive attack not for now no no significant attack but it will come and we have to be ready you talked about this parallel finance that is becoming increasingly important there is also a huge amount of money flowing into private equity why because there is not enough money to be made anywhere else is that an amber warning light for you not private equity specifically no but there are other areas we are monitoring at euro area level like real estate financing which is not a problem in general but there are small warning signs in certain countries there are also these so called leveraged loans more in the united states than in europe but which are starting to become a global problem so there are a number of warning lights that are starting to flash on the global dashboard these are signs of financial fragility and we re keeping a close eye on them and when exactly will we have a financial crisis in the relatively short term maybe as a central banker you can t say i don t know how to answer that question my job is to make sure the financial system is as robust as possible at the level of the financial institutions themselves that s the work of the banking supervisors my colleagues at the ecb who supervise the banks who check that they have enough capital and liquidity to withstand a crisis and at the level of big global infrastructures like payment systems and clearing systems there is a major economic debate around the topic of low rate policies mean we have to completely revisit our traditional macroeconomic models olivier blanchard in particular has been vocal but not just him olivier blanchard the former imf chief economist whom you know well shouldn t we revisit our macroeconomic criteria can t debt help as long as it takes the form of infrastructure investment i didn t interpret olivier blanchard as saying that we had to radically change our economic models quite the contrary what he said was that within the framework of our traditional models there are indicators or parameters that have changed especially the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate which is very different from how it has been in the past and that he says warrants a policy of re indebtedness in certain countries the idea is that current policy is causing countries to pursue a rather tight fiscal policy particularly as regards the level of debt that does not call for a change in economic theory it is actually in line with standard economic theory the parameters have simply changed because interest rates are lower than before i think he is basically right but the analysis needs to be done for each country individually in europe we would need to carefully identify those countries where interest rates will be persistently low relative to growth rates i don t think that countries such as italy or even france fall into that group interest rates have indeed fallen but they will climb up again one day and long term growth rates potential growth rates as economists would say are rather low and the european commission s assessment like our own at the ecb is that there are actually very few countries in europe with the resources to actively deploy fiscal policy germany is one of them but france and italy are not can we permanently have such low interest rates and no return on savings yes people are earning a lower return on their savings but savers are employees and consumers too and the low interest rate policy has enabled a revival in employment and a recovery in economic activity which also boost savings so you don t see a risk in this policy over the long term is there no systemic risk our current monetary policy is designed to respond to a very specific situation namely to a low growth low inflation environment which should not last forever monetary normalisation will have to set in at some point but the prospect of that normalisation is moving a little further away that s because of the risks for the global economy generated by shocks in the united states in china and in the global trade system so for the moment this prospect of normalisation will need to be slightly postponed but i am convinced that normalisation will have to occur eventually yes the question is the long term isn t it we conduct monetary policy based on the data at our disposal and we now see a slowdown in the global economy another issue that s very important because it has and will have a huge impact is cryptocurrencies like the famous libra which will be launched by facebook with the backing of large investors as chair of the working group on these currencies do you see them as a threat or on the contrary as an evolution of traditional currencies a g7 working group on stable coins set up at the request of the french presidency will present an initial report to the meeting of the g7 in chantilly in around ten days time stable coins are a global topic affecting all countries so work will also be carried out at the level of the g20 and the financial stability board i think we need a balanced approach to this question it obviously involves many and varied dimensions of risks which makes this debate rather complex there are risks related to anti money laundering the anonymity of transactions and the use of these instruments for illicit transactions and there are financial stability risks and risks relating to the use of the personal data that are generated by these transactions so we need a multi disciplinary approach and most of all we need a coherent approach at global level because these are projects which have a global dimension from the outset the difference between these new projects and the fintechs as they are traditionally known is that we have been looking at small projects in what are known as regulatory sandboxes and now we have an elephant entering the sandbox that is the issue so we need to understand what this elephant looks like yes an elephant we need to understand the elephant but we also need to look at the opportunities the advances offered by these technologies they pose a challenge to the traditional banking system which has not been quick enough to seize the new technologies particularly in the field of payments they do more than challenge them couldn t they put them at risk yes but a technological innovation enabling less costly and quicker international payments is a welcome innovation banks need to react and adapt to it but innovation in itself is a good thing and it demands a response from us central banks too our instant payments projects at the ecb are a case in point at the ecb we now have an instant payments system known as tips which is inexpensive and works extremely well we need to learn to link these systems with our colleagues in other countries to facilitate cross border payments innovation is also an incentive a stimulus that enables us to work more effectively currencies are normally minted by states don t you find it shocking that a private concern is minting currency so to speak we are not talking about currency but rather what is known as stable coins it s a means of payment they are payment systems a means of payment as you say but they may eventually evolve to become financial instruments perhaps even debt or funding instruments we will identify all these functionalities and we will have to have a regulation for each functionality such that equivalent activities are regulated in the same way regardless of the technology behind them so you have no concerns about these currencies they are not currencies there is only one currency in the euro area only one which is legal tender and that is the euro there is no other benoit cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb thank you for this interview
islamabad pakistan has agreed with the imf to further hike electricity tariff on quarterly adjustments basis by end of the next month the imf has also placed implementation on action plan under financial action task force fatf into structural benchmark till end october 2019 in order to exit the country from grey list a second quarterly adjustment will take place before end august moreover the fy 2020 electricity tariff schedule will be notified as determined by the regulator by end september 2019 under structural benchmark stated the imf the staff appraisal report of imf released on monday stated that pakistan s economy is at a critical juncture pakistan s economy is facing risks of hike in oil prices in international market and implementing policies under the imf programme the imf s mission chief ernesto ramirez rigo said in his teleconference from washington dc on monday he said that the skepticism outside the government was understandable but this time the government took prior actions to demonstrate its will to undertake key structural reforms the imf staff report states that the effectiveness of pakistan s aml cft regime must be urgently strengthened to support its exit from the financial action task force fatf list of jurisdictions with serious deficiencies pakistan was placed in the fatf list in june 2018 owing to shortcomings in effectively addressing terrorist financing risks the authorities are stepping up efforts to implement all measures committed to in an action plan with the fatf end october 2019 structural benchmark to support the country s exit from the fatf list said the imf the national executive committee nec is monitoring and coordinating efforts to implement the fatf action plan the asia pacific group on money laundering is expected to discuss pakistan s mutual evaluation report in august 2019 the authorities will work with technical assistance providers including the imf to complete the action plan and further strengthen the effectiveness of the aml cft regime on power sector the imf states that an adequate pricing structure reflective of costs is essential to eliminate the accumulation of circular debt as new capacity comes into the system and to make the sector a more attractive investment opportunity the authorities have initiated the automatic quarterly adjustment of tariffs with a first tariff increase of over 10 percent to generate rs150 billion in additional revenue prior action this adjustment will help to address the circular debt accumulated over the first half of fy 2019 going forward the authorities are committed to streamlining and making more predictable the tariff notification process it states and added that to this end amendments to the nepra act would be submitted to parliament by end december 2019 under structural benchmark with a view to i ensuring full automaticity of the quarterly tariff adjustments and ii eliminating the gap between the regular annual tariff determination by the regulator and the notification by the government the authorities will prepare by end september 2019 structural benchmark a comprehensive plan to reduce circular debt with quarterly targets for the reduction of arrears through improvements in collection efficiency gains and enhanced governance the plan will also include options to tackle the outstanding stock of circular debt the authorities are also taking actions to improve performance in the gas sector to this end a multi pronged strategy includes i the prompt adoption of the fy 2020 gas tariffs as proposed by the regulator to become effective on july 1 2019 prior action ii the reduction of losses in the sector through the preparation of a comprehensive plan for government approval by end september 2019 and to be monitored through published quarterly reports iii greater participation of the private sector in the gas sector including via the unbundling of the two gas companies and iv amendments to the ogra act to ensure the regular and timely notification of end consumer tariffs 28 the policy of protecting lower income households from higher energy prices will continue currently households consuming 300 units kwt h or below about 70 percent of all household consumers are insulated from annual tariff increases the authorities will continue with this practice and will moreover allocate for this year a new subsidy equivalent to 0 1 0 2 percent of gdp to insulate those same consumers from the impact of the recently introduced quarterly tariff adjustment the imf states that the legacy of misaligned economic policies including large fiscal deficits loose monetary policy and defense of an overvalued exchange rate fueled consumption and short term growth in recent years but steadily eroded macroeconomic buffers increased external and public debt and depleted international reserves structural weaknesses remained largely unaddressed including a chronically weak tax administration a difficult business environment inefficient and loss making soes amid a large informal economy without urgent policy action economic and financial stability could be at risk and growth prospects will be insufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population the authorities comprehensive economic reform program supported by the eff aims to stabilize the economy and lay the foundation for robust and balanced growth key elements include a decisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt and build resilience starting with the adoption of an ambitious fy 2020 budget the adjustment will be supported by comprehensive efforts to drastically increase revenue mobilization by 4 to 5 percent of gdp at the federal and the provincial level over the program period expanding social spending including through the strengthening and broadening of safety nets to support the most vulnerable a flexible market determined exchange rate to restore competitiveness rebuild official reserves and provide a buffer against external shocks this will be supported by an appropriate monetary policy to shore up confidence and contain inflation conducted by an independent central bank energy sector reforms to eliminate quasi fiscal losses and encourage investment including by depoliticizing gas and power tariff setting and over the program period gradually bringing the sector to cost recovery and structural reforms through strengthening institutions increasing governance and transparency and promoting an investment friendly environment necessary to improve productivity entrench lasting reforms and ensure sustainable growth strong financial assistance by pakistan s international partners will support the eff the fund supported program is expected to coalesce broader support from multilateral and bilateral creditors in excess of us 38 billion which is crucial for pakistan to meet its large financing needs in the coming years the imf pointed out that in addition significant financial support by official and bilateral partners aims to provide an important safeguard the program is expected to mobilize total financing of around 38 6 billion over the three years from pakistan s international partners the first 12 months are fully financed with the expected support from multilateral development banks and bilateral creditors as follows china 6 3 billion saudi arabia 6 2 billion uae 1 billion the world bank 1 3 billion the asian development bank 1 6 billion and the islamic development bank 1 1 billion to support long term debt sustainability the authorities have also received firm commitments from key bilateral partners china saudi arabia and uae to maintain their exposure throughout the program period and to adjust the financing modalities to ensure that the new financing will be consistent with the programme debt sustainability objectives by ensuring a manageable external debt servicing profile beyond the end of the imf supported program the imf says that risks to the imf program are significant but the program offers pakistan an opportunity to break from the unsustainable policies of the past pakistan s track record on program implementation has been weak punctuated by incomplete reforms and policy reversals the authorities upfront efforts exchange rate flexibility fiscal consolidation and tariff adjustments in particular may be received with strong backlash from vested interests and the wider population as the benefits may not be immediately obvious pressures to reverse policies may quickly emerge which must be resisted to allow reforms to take hold and restore confidence similarly the fruits from structural reforms may take years to materialize possibly leading to reform fatigue and backtracking of policies strong ownership and an unwavering commitment to program implementation will be critical to ensure program success and turn pakistan s economy around in this context international support will hinge crucially on the implementation of these reforms other political and external shocks may further complicate an already challenging environment the imf concluded
commentary with president donald trump s two previous nominees to the federal reserve board of governors stephen moore and herman cain having withdrawn in the face of stiff resistance in the senate the president has nominated two economists judy shelton and christopher waller to those posts waller s nomination seems safe he s an insider the current executive vice president of the federal reserve bank of st louis shelton on the other hand is encountering some resistance because she s an unconventional choice her opponents condescendingly scorn her as a goldbug because of her minority viewpoint that the dollar should be backed by gold greg ip the erudite economics writer for the wall street journal questioned whether shelton is suitable for the position in his most recent column it should be noted that the journal s editorial page unhesitatingly supports her nomination monetary policy and its political ramifications are incredibly complex far from an exact science and people of goodwill can disagree strongly about them let me say that while ip makes some valid points he s off target on others and so i disagree with the doubts he raises about shelton s nomination ip diplomatically starts off with two balancing statements the first true in certain contexts the second an indisputable truism mainstream economists consider the gold standard impractical and dangerous and mainstream economists have no monopoly on truth is a gold standard impractical yes it is today but it shouldn t be a gold standard is unsustainable thus impractical in a country such as ours where the government doesn t control spending and balance its budget gold is honest money is it dangerous yes but only to power structures that depend on fiat money i e money unbacked by anything of real nonmonetary value for their perpetuation one reason why shelton favors a gold standard is that it has a virtue that ip acknowledged in his article when all countries were on gold it made exchange rates stable and predictable indeed a multinational gold regime facilitates free and fair trade a trump policy goal that most politicians at least pay lip service to contrariwise spasmodic exchange rate fluctuations complicate and undermine free trade the problem is that politicians both here and abroad want the benefits of a gold standard without having to submit to the discipline on government spending that gold imposes at the midpoint ip s article becomes problematical he writes to goldbugs the gold standard s main appeal is ideological why ideological aren t ideologies belief systems that people cling to even when confronted by overwhelming evidence that what they crave doesn t work as advertised see socialism advocates of a gold standard do so for reasons of benevolence they want a currency that ll hold its purchasing power and that makes it harder for government to absorb and commandeer private functions through the printing press the monetary ideologues today are those who advocate fiat currencies that transfer economic power from main street to the governing elite ip chides shelton for having accused the fed of printing money to finance mr obama s deficits that sounds like a fairly accurate accusation to me we can debate whether the various rounds of quantitative easing qe financed the obama deficits directly but the fed s zirp zero interest rate policy certainly did make it easier for president barack obama to run immense deficits the fed enabled uncle sam to tote the notes of federal debt more easily by driving down its annual interest expense concurrently zirp deprived millions of american savers of the ability to earn modest safe returns on their savings at banks in essence under zirp economic power shifted to washington and its wall street auxiliaries at the expense of the u s middle class as for shelton s 2011 declaration that inflation would inevitably result from the fed s money creation she appears to have been wrong in the short term but may prove to be tragically correct in the long term to explain in the short term prices didn t rise much in response to the fed s money printing ok so shelton doesn t have a crystal ball nobody does recall that former fed chairman ben bernanke famously stated circa 2007 that the housing market wouldn t have a significant impact on the economy only to have the housing bubble burst and trigger a financial crisis that became the great recession we re all learning about the effects of various fed policies as we go we can see now in retrospect that the fed s policy of paying banks to hold excess reserves rather than lend those funds out to finance private sector economic activity a policy that shelton has openly criticized restrained consumer prices even as government spending soared another way in which economic power was siphoned from the private sector to the public sector in the long term though it s possible that the chickens of the multi trillion expansion of the fed s balance sheet during the qe years will ultimately come home to roost in dollar depreciation then the dollar may lose its status as the global reserve currency and domestic prices might soar let s all hope it doesn t but we need people on the federal reserve board who like shelton want to avoid a return to the destructive inflation of the 1970s i agree with ip that shelton appears to be somewhat partisan he also writes though that the fed prides itself on political independence does anybody really believe that the fed is above partisan politics after pursuing zirp like policies to the very end of the obama presidency before finally starting to raise rates shortly after trump became president how can anyone believe that the fed is free of partisan sympathies another example janet yellen displayed her partisanship for all to see by using her authority as fed chair to try to persuade economists to jump on board the progressives climate change agenda and urge congress to pass a tax increase i e a carbon tax that was totally inappropriate and is a sure sign that a fresh voice such as shelton s should be added to the board of governors shelton is 100 percent correct when she questions why a dozen people the federal reserve board of governors should set the prices of capital interest rates any more than they should set the price of cars houses or bubble gum markets can do that and do it better as they did before there even was a federal reserve system shelton opposes policies that would be more at home in a centrally planned economy that alone is reason enough to confirm her mark

full recordings and materials are available on the page of the event eurozone agreement a mini revolution good morning thank you for your invitation i like the title you chose for this conference but you should remove the question mark is the eurozone budget a mini revolution yes and more revolution than mini the euro is now 20 years old and it is a tremendous success the euro has helped to boost growth ensure price stability lower interest rates and foster trade between member states it has no doubt been a success no matter how you look at it but the crisis that started ten years ago with the bankruptcy of lehman brothers and morphed into the wider eurozone crisis clearly showed the weaknesses of the euro area architecture many of these weaknesses were addressed during the crisis but not all we all know that the monetary union remains incomplete countless economists and expert international institutions highlight this on a regular basis improvements are needed to better shield eurozone member states from future economic or financial crises and to protect our citizens jobs businesses and savings to help our economies converge and to allow our economies to grow more over the long run in the last ten years the simple fact is that we have not been able to take the necessary decisions to tackle these weaknesses once and for all it s now time to take those decisions so the agreement reached last month is good news very good news it s not the end of the process it s not the finishing line but it s the essential starting point you need to consider where we have come from it is only two years since we started to revive the franco german dynamic with wolfgang schäuble and i remember my first trip to berlin two years ago when i had just been appointed and wolfgang schäuble told me you can say whatever you want but please don t use the words eurozone budget it is just over a year since we reached the historic meseberg agreement thanks to nights of negotiation between olaf scholz and myself we are on the right track and we now need to move further it s like building a house it s a step by step process like the european construction but we have a unique opportunity right now with the new commission and parliament the june agreement is an essential brick it will strengthen the euro area it strengthens the european stability mechanism which is no longer limited to addressing crises but will now also help prevent them a big change in the right direction it finally creates the common backstop for the single resolution fund as the ultimate safety net in case of banking crises and most importantly it creates a eurozone budget that will promote a greater convergence of eurozone economies which will improve competitiveness by financing public investment and reforms i remember full well what everyone probably many of you in this room said two years ago when i started this job and said that france wanted to create a eurozone budget impossible guaranteed failure utopia too many countries would be opposed to the mere concept let alone making it a reality well the doomsayers were wrong a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity winston churchill one said i believe in the exact opposite there is of course still some way to go in the coming weeks and months in particular we need to agree on the specific resources of this budget and i will not be satisfied with a tiny budget although i have always said size is not the most important issue right now an effective budget architecture is by far the most important feature of the budget and that means the most important thing for france is that this budget is decided at 19 the 19 members of the eurozone if you are not in you can join but you can t be in and out this means that the euro area s own resources are needed funding which would come only from the european budget decided by the 28 is not good enough the euro area must have its own decision making autonomy we are the ones who share a currency we are the ones who decide its common priorities this will also enable us to allow this budget to evolve according to needs in particular to face a new crisis it s all a matter of political will and we will keep working and discussing so the first eurozone budget is a reality in 2021 it s a new decisive phase for our economic and monetary union so yes this is a revolution but of course we need to go further further steps remain needed to transform a shared currency into a fully efficient monetary union there is an absolute necessity for more growth within the eurozone the average level of growth is a failure for all of us and it has been a failure for more than 10 years since the start of the crisis it is not sustainable over the long run to have such a low level of growth we need more growth more sustainable and more inclusive growth or we will feed populism if we want to defeat populism we need to take the decisions to ensure greater growth you can t have political stability without economic prosperity that is why i have proposed a compact for growth for the euro area this compact should take into account the current situation of an accommodating monetary policy and low interest rates it is the current situation and politicians should that into account the compact for growth should be based around three main points pursuing structural reforms and controlling public finances for some countries this is more essential than others president macron made a choice we have introduced key structural reforms they are difficult but essential and we will pursue them some other eurozone member states also need to take on such reforms more investment countries with fiscal space need to invest more given its political weight in the euro area germany has an important responsibility there is a desperate need for more investment in the euro area especially in innovation and infrastructure it will benefit germany its neighbours and the whole euro area further strengthening of the euro area implementation of the budget of the euro area is essential but that will not be enough we need deeper integration of the eurozone it requires completing the banking union building a fully fledged capital markets union and in the long a stabilization function for the eurozone budget on the financing of innovation we have fallen behind in 2018 for venture capital 100 billion dollars were channelled to start ups in the united states 80 billion in china 20 billion in europe we need to catch up and take the lead for that we need to build a genuine capital markets union it will help all european companies big and small to finance themselves more easily in particular so they can scale up we have set up a joint high level working group with olaf scholz and wopke hoekstra so that we can provide new ambitious ideas to the new commission on how to deepen the capital markets union we also know we will have to go further with a stabilization function for the euro area some countries are firmly opposed today and this is no secret but i am convinced it remains essential all international institutions agree so do the vast majority of economists as do a large majority of eurozone member states why because a counter cyclical stabilization function is the best response to a shock so it does not end up weighing solely on the public finances of the affected member state in a currency area member states are deprived from the main traditional tool to cope with a shock devaluation we cannot go on ignoring this basic fact and we have to come up with solutions to fill the gap yes reforms and healthy budgets are essential but they are not enough once again look at ireland or spain and the last crisis they had budgetary surpluses before the crisis hit was it enough no so experience shows we need a eurozone budget for convergence but also for stabilisation over the long run in meseberg france and germany put forward specific proposals to build such a tool for instance the euro area unemployment re insurance scheme it s a very good idea establishing this stabilization function must remain our goal in the long term despite the opposition of some today the majority of eurozone countries are already in favour of such a move those who oppose it are vocal but they are not the majority but it s also true we need to reach a consensus so i won t abandon my efforts with those countries that need convincing we also need to strengthen the international role of the euro and i fully support the ideas put forward by the european commission why first i want europe to be sovereign in its foreign policy let s take the example of american sanctions against iran the prospect of being shut out from using the dollar has proven a very powerful tool for the us to exercise leverage on european companies i don t want our companies to suffer from american decisions that we don t always share second point there is a clear advantage for companies who import and export if they can reduce their exposure to exchange rates risks today europe pays 80 of its energy imports in us dollars if the equivalent transactions were in euros the benefit in terms of exchange rates risks could be very significant third point today for transactions globally the euro has become a widely used currency it represents 36 of the value of international payments which is close to the us dollar with 40 but the euro represents only 20 of international reserves whereas the dollar represents 60 i think it is in our overall interest that the euro becomes a larger reserve currency although the effects on exchange rates and the strength of the currency are complex and will need to be managed carefully it s clear a strong euro is essential for our european economic sovereignty but of course the euro area also relies on the core foundations of the eu and its single market and we need to deepen it further too how we need to progress in terms of fiscal harmonization and social convergence it is an essential condition for fair competition within the single market it s the only way we can have competitive firms growing without jeopardizing the social market economy model at the heart of the eu s economic strength on social convergence it will be necessary to accelerate the implementation of the european pillar of social rights for instance through the european semester on tax issues more harmonization will be needed starting with the progressive transition to qualified majority voting as proposed by the commission to modernize our vat regime or finally bring work on ccctb to a conclusion step by step all features of the single market will need deeper integration to remain in the technological race against china and the us it is essential that we make technological sovereignty one of the top priorities of europe because our political sovereignty depends on it this requires building a genuine shared european industrial policy not a state led old style planification this common industrial policy is of course inseparable from competition policy and trade policy the times when these policies could evolve separately are now over competition policy is vital for us to allow european companies to grow and be world leaders and we will need to adapt our competition rules to the new economic realities that are facing us this will be one of the major tasks of the new commission this is why france germany and poland put forward a common proposal last week in poznan it aims at initiating a debate with the commission and member states on the necessary steps which must be taken to adapt competition rules and we call on all member states to join this contribution we are a time when a new impetus for european construction is needed we have not drawn all the consequences of the crisis of 2008 we have done a lot but ten years after the start of the crisis look at the landscape people are hesitating between more nationalism or a new impetus for europe clearly there is a need for a new impetus and now is the time for decisions and in particular for the eurozone as it s at the heart of the european project either we manage to strengthen the euro area by completing its architecture allowing banks and businesses to grow by building genuine banking and capital markets unions deepening our single market adopting a modernised coherent approach to trade competition and industry or we will feed the sceptics of all those who say the eurozone is a failure look at growth and job creation compared to the usa and other big states so let s move forward and let s work with others to make it a reality thank you
read our complete budget analysis here disasters avoided the reform less budget unneeded spending increases all across the board and the march to a flatter fairer tax code something for everyone to hate in this budget something for everyone to love in this budget july 9 2019 a maciver institute analysis the 2019 21 wisconsin state budget is now law after months of debate numerous public hearings countless hours making its way through committee dozens of amendments voted on and almost 80 vetoes assembly bill 56 the state budget bill has been signed into law by governor tony evers and is now 2019 wisconsin act 9 there is something for everyone to love in this budget from fiscal conservatives far left progressives republicans taxpayers democrats big government loving special interests lobbyists to local governments and something in this budget for everyone to hate that makes this budget different than any other budget in recent memory it really should come as no surprise however given the fact that we have divided government with democrat tony evers as governor and both houses of the legislature comfortably controlled by republicans disasters avoided big labor the big loser to fully understand how we got to this place you have to start at the beginning when evers introduced his budget proposal in late february evers budget proposal wasn t just a big liberal wish list but a radical progressive s best dream simply put evers introduced the most irresponsible and anti taxpayer budget in recent memory assembly speaker robin vos r rochester described the evers budget as a big liberal wish list looking at the expansive list of progressive policies that vastly grow the size and scope of government it is hard to argue with that description from medicaid expansion the end of recent welfare work requirements an unneeded increase in the state s minimum wage a green pipe dream to make the state carbon free the creation of many new government programs an assault on proven education reform programs the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana to the end of the property tax freeze the budget wasn t just a big liberal wish list but a radical progressive s best dream as proposed evers budget would have also hiked the gas tax and tied it to inflation for a total gas tax increase of nearly 10 cents per gallon raised taxes on job creating manufacturers by limiting the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit raised taxes on retirees by ending a long term capital gains tax exemption repealed the state s right to work law restored the state and local prevailing wage rolled back tax protections that have led to a property tax freeze giving local units of government more power to raise property taxes frozen enrollment in school choice programs ended the special needs scholarship program stopped new independent charter schools from opening until 2023 raised the minimum wage to 8 25 in 2020 followed by annual 75 cent increases until it reaches 10 50 in 2023 then tying it to inflation and creating a task force to study how to get to a 15 per hour minimum wage for everyone raised the minimum wage for government workers to 15 per hour in 2021 spent 5 million to provide internet access for welfare recipients eliminated work requirements for able bodied adults with school aged dependents eliminated drug testing for most public assistance programs created a new statutory goal for a minimum broadband speed across the state tied revenue limits for school districts to inflation deferred to agency rules and guidance documents bypassing the legislature and broadening the powers of the administrative state created a 2 billion structural deficit while raising general fund taxes by 1 3 billion and local property taxes by untold millions more and much much more thankfully the republican led joint finance committee jfc quickly removed all of these disasters in its first executive session on the budget it stripped out 131 policy items and more than 1 billion in tax increases almost every single big government provision except for gas tax indexing was pulled out in jfc s first budget action as we examine the final product today it is important that we take time to remember how bad evers original budget was and give republicans credit for removing all of this bad public policy medicaid expansion would have devastated health care affordability for the average wisconsinite pushing up premiums and severely limiting access to care low income individuals who currently have subsidized private plans for cents on the dollar would be forced onto a government plan with less access to providers and worse health outcomes it would also push thousands more wisconsinites onto a system that is already struggling to stay sustainable just 2 6 wisconsin workers support each medicaid recipient today in 1998 7 2 workers supported each recipient as it stands medicaid already has a serious math problem pushing enrollment even higher would only make health outcomes access and the program s cost worse if you are still not sure if medicaid expansion is a bad idea just look at the states that have accepted it and what a financial hardship it has been for those states medicaid spending in ohio for example skyrocketed 35 percent in four years from 18 9 billion to 25 7 billion between fiscal year 2013 and 2017 in arizona costly visits to the emergency room have jumped more than 300 percent and providers have shifted an additional 700 million in costs onto private plans after the medicaid expansion in rhode island medicaid enrollment ballooned 63 percent and state spending on the program has increased 25 percent since expansion forcing the state to consider a new payroll tax on employers it also would expand welfare in a time of unprecedented economic growth the final budget delivers substantial increases in health care and medical assistance funding without using money from a debt ridden federal government that has failed to keep funding promises to states those are among the many reasons why republicans fought so hard to keep the idea out of the budget the same can be said of republicans defense of worker freedom it s no secret that big labor targeted gov walker as public enemy number one and made removing him from office its number one priority in the entire country no one should have been surprised when evers first budget proposal handsomely rewarded his big labor allies with a full out assault on worker freedom and the taxpayer evers proposed bringing back big labor s favorite trifecta repealing right to work reinstating the prevailing wage law and forcing large public works construction projects to use project labor agreements wisconsin s previous prevailing wage statute which arbitrarily and unnecessarily tied wages on taxpayer funded construction projects to inflated rates paid by unions was repealed for local and state projects by gov walker without interference from the government wages are set by the market and driven by competition saving wisconsin taxpayers millions of dollars remember the case of the grafton water tower evers budget also would have eliminated wisconsin s right to work law it s called right to work precisely because it prohibits private sector labor organizations from making compulsory union dues a condition of employment wisconsin workers have shown en masse that they don t want to join unions active membership in the national education association fell by 42 percent from 2013 to 2018 the percent of wisconsin workers who belong to a union fell from 15 percent in 2008 to 8 1 percent in 2018 simply put if unions provided a service that members thought was worthy such dramatic drop offs would not have occurred clearly workers are voting with their feet and they are voting that they do not need unions evers budget would have reinstated project labor agreements plas for public works projects local governments beholden to big labor use plas to stipulate that only union firms can bid on a project shutting out competition and dramatically increasing the cost of projects that taxpayers pay for ultimately much of what makes the 2019 21 budget a good document is marked by what s not in it that is thanks to republicans and their willingness to stand up to big labor and the far left that also makes big labor the unquestioned big loser of the 2019 2021 state budget debate finally we would be remiss to not mention one last issue left untouched in the 2019 21 budget act 10 walker s signature 2011 reform was repeatedly slammed by the now governor on the campaign trail and in years past nowhere does the budget roll back taxpayer protections created by the law including increased contribution levels for public sector employee benefits or annual union recertification votes for the taxpayer that is a major disaster averted a fiscal arms race making everyone but the taxpayer happy there s no way around it this budget spends a lot of money when evers released his budget plan in late february republicans slammed the new governor for spending far more than the state could afford yet in the end republicans backtracked on the fiscal austerity rhetoric and in many cases ended up spending a lot more than what was necessary in what can only be called a great disappointment for taxpayers legislative republicans decided in many instances to spend more than they have in recent memory and in some cases spend more than evers original proposal evers had proposed increasing total government jobs by 701 full time positions over the biennium that would have brought the total number of all funds state positions to 71 990 57 in 2020 jfc s plan increased total positions by 482 up to 71 771 59 by 2020 that s still a sizable increase plus this budget gives all state employees 2 percent raises in each year of the biennium and by constantly adding to state rolls those types of increases will only be more expensive in the future in what can only be called a great disappointment for taxpayers legislative republicans tried to keep up with the liberals when it came to government largess in some cases they even outdid evers original spending proposals prison guards personal care workers nursing homes and family care direct care workers get considerably more funding than evers requested taxpayers should also question the wisdom of pumping 655 4 million more gpr into the status quo educational system that fails too many children and is experiencing flat enrollment in this biennium state support to k 12 schools will reach more than 14 billion and dpi s total budget spends north of 15 2 billion evers had proposed a 1 6 billion increase for the agency he headed until january including more than 600 million to increase special education categorical aids the final budget sends 330 million more into the equalization aid formula and 97 million more for special education categorical aids along with a litany of other changes still jfc rejected the vast majority of evers proposed changes to the school funding formula such as adding another weight for impoverished students counting them as 1 2 pupils instead of 1 0 for funding purposes that led evers supporters to slam the education plan calling it a 900 million cut only in madison and the fantasy land of the nonsensical progressive is a 655 million increase in spending described as a cut lost in this debate is the fact that wisconsin s k 12 population has stayed relatively flat for many years if we are not experiencing a huge influx of new elementary kids to educate why do our schools need 600 million in new funds and this 600 million increase is on top of the 600 million increase included in the 2017 2019 state budget over a billion dollars in new funding to educate the same number of kids are we seeing any noticeable return on our increased investment also lost in this debate is the fact that more and more families are choosing other educational choices outside of the public education system choice charter and home schooling are all growing in popularity that s no surprise given that statewide english proficiency sits at just 44 percent and math proficiency at 41 percent the k 12 educational system has continually failed many wisconsin students with thousands of new uw freshmen requiring remedial math or english those classes come with zero credit and the cost of full tuition putting students behind before they even begin plus many of these are students who were told they were doing well in school more than half of wisconsin s five star high schools sent more than 1 000 students who needed math remediation to uw and when just 54 percent of our public education dollars reach the classroom we must ask how hundreds of millions of dollars will improve student achievement for their part legislative republicans acknowledged the system is broken but they didn t take the opportunity to couple a significant funding increase with required better outcomes and meaningful systematic reform the same can be said for the uw system and the 220 million more it received compared to the last budget like the k 12 system enrollment at uw has slowly fallen over the years with a strong economy and record low unemployment young people now know that the math has changed it s no longer a given that taking on tens of thousands of dollars in student debt will pay off in the long run and enrollment trends reflect that still the capital budget sends over 1 billion in new funding for building projects across the uw system numerous campuses like uw eau claire and uw milwaukee will get brand new buildings and every campus will see millions more in improvement projects before the jfc vote on the capital budget finance co chair john nygren r marinette spoke passionately on how broken the system is he lamented that taxpayers pay uw lobbyists that then lobby the state for more money he also lambasted the fact that uw officials are the drivers of new projects setting rates and budgets for new buildings knowing that the legislature usually just goes along with the plan nygren is exactly right on this but he and every other jfc republican voted for the package it s refreshing to see legislators make strong arguments at the table but it d be more refreshing if they would actually pass the reforms they say they want the health care debate brought a similar tone republicans held strong in refusing to expand medicaid but they instead agreed to send 1 6 billion in all funds to dhs of that increase 917 million all funds is the cost to continue price tag for the state s massive medical assistance programs rather than pursuing innovative reforms in taxpayer provided health care programs like direct primary care self funded association health plans limited duration health plans and dental therapy jfc pumped more money into the medicaid system they acknowledge is broken too many politicians are content just throwing more money at these programs and these problems without addressing the fundamental causes of these problems and without making needed reforms to these programs like so many other parts of the state budget the new incredibly generous funding for dhs came with little to no reforms attached for taxpayers this is frustrating and a huge missed opportunity to make wisconsin a better place to live too many politicians are content just throwing more money at these programs without addressing the fundamental causes of the problems and without making needed reforms to these programs the reform less budget as we ve written above on issues from k 12 education medicaid higher education welfare reform to the capital budget legislators enacted few reforms to go along with the billions more in new spending they provided one possible reason for this missed opportunity evers has the most powerful line item veto in the country the majority of the few reforms contained in this budget were predictably vetoed out by the governor nevertheless it s crucial that both sides fight for their beliefs and make their positions known taxpayers deserve an honest and genuine debate about the direction of our great state if the capital building program is clearly broken what s the harm in proposing a groundbreaking new strategy to fix it debating an idea in public is always better than agreeing to compromise behind closed doors why didn t we have a debate about the needed reform of mps why didn t we have a debate about the remedial education crisis and the fact that hundreds of wisconsin high schools send thousands of students to the uw system unprepared to pass basic english and math tests why didn t we have a debate about the need to empower parents to choose a school that s right for their children why didn t we have a debate about the size scope and cost of state government apparently the only area that needs reform transportation republicans deserve kudos for including one important transportation reform in their department of transportation dot omnibus motion a pilot program for design build projects rather than hiring a construction company after a road is designed this active building method would bring in the construction company during the design phase the theory is that the company can apply its practical experience to find efficiencies and cost savings that dot engineers might otherwise miss evers used his veto pen to take out the part about it being a pilot program meaning it is now officially in the dot s tool box still many fiscal hawks wanted more accountability for the troubled agency giving rise to a separate transportation reform package that moved through the legislative process in order to secure enough republican votes in the senate earlier today an assembly committee held a lengthy hearing on a package of dot reform bills repsanfelippo explained that yes there are pressing needs but that makes reforming the department all the more important wibudget wiright wipolitics pic twitter com sbftqwgw7b maciver news service newsmaciver june 12 2019 one reform bill proposed outside of the budget expands the number of road plans on the shelf so that the project pipeline can be managed more efficiently another piece of legislation in the transportation reform package targets a practice that has cost taxpayers a lot of money single bid contracts the bill would require the dot to rebid projects that receive but one bid if that bid exceeds the department s estimated cost of work by 10 percent or more a fallback provision would allow the dot to avoid the requirement in cases of a threat to public safety if jfc approves as maciver news service recently reported the state has awarded 58 single bid contracts worth 309 million since january dot secretary designee craig thompson who spent years working on behalf of road builders and other transportation interests now heads a state agency that refuses to release the original cost estimates even after the contracts are awarded as maciver news service recently reported the state has awarded 58 single bid contracts worth 309 million since january the state highway program audit in 2017 found that one bid contracts cost the state an average of 4 5 million a year from 2006 to 2015 the most controversial reform bill would require local governments considering implementing vehicle registration fees or wheel taxes to first get approval from voters through referendum more controversially the measure demands communities with existing wheel taxes to take the question to voters within 18 months of proposing a fee increase another reform measure before the legislature would create a subgrade efficiency provision in state law allowing contractors to use dot approved alternative lower cost materials for the under layer of road projects the change could lead to big cost savings for the contractor and ultimately the taxpayer a related reform would require the dot to use project materials for sources on the dot right of way rather than paying higher costs to source and transport materials from more distant locations while that package moved through the legislature as its own set of bills the assembly also amended the budget bill on the floor in order to ensure its passage in the senate that amendment did away with a jfc transportation provision that would have given the committee the authority to approve the implementation of a mileage based fee instead any recommendations from a study committee would have to be included in the department of transportation funding request for the next budget critics worried that a decision on tolling recommendations and the controversial mileage fee would ultimately be in the hands of one committee not the full legislature that became a moot point as evers vetoed the tolling and mileage studies out of the final budget implementing these reforms in the dot became even more urgent with the passing of the state budget the dot received a 600 million funding boost in the new state budget which included the enumeration of two new major projects a tax cut to bring fiscal conservatives home continuing the march towards a flatter more equitable tax structure in wisconsin wisconsin has long had one of the country s most regressive individual income tax systems the bottom tax rate of 4 percent is among the very highest in the country for low earners walker made progress in flattening the tax rate to benefit every single wisconsinite but the lowest rates have remained particularly punitive the budget act along with a separate bill championed by sen dale kooyenga r brookfield and rep jessie rodriguez r oak brook lowers the bottom two individual income tax rates in 2019 the bottom rate currently 4 percent will drop to 3 89 percent the second rate of 5 84 percent will shift downward to 5 08 percent in 2020 both rates will fall even further with the lowest rate moving to 3 76 percent and the second rate to 4 93 percent between both sets of changes the average income tax decrease will be 91 in 2019 and another 124 in 2020 totaling 215 in income tax relief over the biennium for the average filer these changes will benefit every single taxpayer in the state and reducing the bottom two tax brackets will help middle class earners the most the bulk of the tax relief in dollars will go toward those earning between 30 000 and 60 000 annually maciver has long argued that a flat tax system is the most equitable and fairest method of taxation while we d prefer a flat 3 percent rate across the board any flattening of tax rates is a substantial win that should be celebrated plus republicans achieved those tax cuts of over 500 million without raising taxes on other people evers proposed tax cuts were not true tax cuts at all but instead they were tax shifts his plan would have limited the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit mac that move would punish job creators driving the growth in wisconsin s economy evers would have also stripped back long term capital gains exclusions a change that would punish retirees and rob their nest eggs not only was evers plan based upon a punitive tax shift but his middle income tax cut would not have changed the actual income tax rates which are the heart of the issue his plan would have given middle class earners 10 percent of their net tax liability back or 100 whichever is greater buying down the income tax rates rather than tinkering with credits is a much more effective direct way to fix wisconsin s income tax structure the long road ahead jfc s budget leaves a 1 4 billion structural deficit for the beginning of the 2021 23 budget cycle that s less than evers almost 2 billion deficit but it s still a massive figure walker took heat for leaving structural deficits in his budgets but taxpayers could rest assured that the former governor would never raise taxes to fill a budget hole we hope legislators remember the hard working taxpayer who foots the bill in the years to come when these tough decisions will need to be made now they shouldn t be so sure evers original budget proposal would have raised taxes by close to 2 billion when considering the general fund and locals abilities to raise property tax levies our governor is clearly an eager tax and spend liberal who will want to increase taxes to solve any structural deficit or budget hole will legislative republicans be strong enough to just say no to new taxes if the economy turns south the state went into this budget cycle with a 753 million surplus higher than expected following months of strong economic growth yet the legislature spent all that and more on various programs leaving the state with a 1 4 billion structural gamble with taxpayers on the hook all it would take is a single bad year for the economy an escalation of the trade war or any number of other crises for any future surpluses to quickly turn into deficits and two years from now we ll be back in the same position with stakeholders from every corner of the state coming to the legislature with hats and hands out asking for more money as we know it ll never be enough we will need to do better next time
by k n c for decades joseph stiglitz has argued that globalisation only works for a few and government needs to reassert itself in terms of redistribution and regulation today the sources of his ire have grown more dire wealth inequality has become a hot button political issue just as populists are on the march in mr sitglitz s latest book people power and profits progressive capitalism for an age of discontent he expands on his left of centre economic prescriptions he believes that capitalism s excesses can be tamed by the state providing a public option in areas like health care or mortgages when the market flounders as part of the economist s open future initiative we conducted a short written interview with mr stiglitz about his ideas it is followed by an excerpt from his book on what he calls the transition to a postindustrial world the economist you argue that right wing populists aren t wrong capitalism is indeed rigged how so joseph stiglitz it s rigged in the obvious sense some the rich and powerful and their children have better opportunities than others enabling the perpetuation of advantages there is not the competitive level playing field described in textbooks in sector after sector there are a few dominant firms that create almost insurmountable barriers to entry too many become wealthy not by adding to the size of the nation s economic pie but by seizing from others a larger share through exploitation whether of market power informational advantages or the vulnerabilities of others the economist how did we get into this mess is it all the republicans fault or can you place a pox on the democrats house as well mr stiglitz there has always been a battle those with power and wealth want to maintain and augment it even when it comes at the expense of others they have resisted attempts to redress the imbalances whether through antitrust laws progressive taxation and expenditure policies or labor legislation but in a series of progressive reforms from the late 19th century through to president johnson progress was made in each of these arenas and america created the first middle class society then with president reagan a new ideology came to prevail leave everything to the market the economy will grow and everyone will be better off what is called trickle down economics instead growth slowed and incomes for the vast majority stagnated some democrats also bought into these ideologies with accompanying policies of unfettered globalisation and financialisation since trump however the splits between the parties have grown ever larger with the republicans arguing for policies that would increase inequality and slow growth as they increase the profits and power of corporations and further eviscerate that of workers and ordinary consumers regulations to restrain banks and to protect the environment are being stripped away taxes on ordinary americans are being increased as those on corporations and the wealthy are being reduced profits of pharmaceutical and health insurance companies are being increased as millions of more americans are being left without health insurance life expectancy in america is remarkably in decline and wages adjusted for inflation for people at the bottom of society remain where they were 60 years ago the economist you offer a wide range of solutions are there one or two that you see as a linchpin mr stiglitz at the core is a new social contract a new balance between the market the state and civil society based on what i call progressive capitalism it channels the power of the market and creative entrepreneurship to enhance the well being of society more generally this will entail rewriting the rules of the economy for instance to curb market power of our 21st century tech and financial behemoths to ensure that globalisation works for ordinary americans not just for corporations and that the financial sector serves the economy rather than the other way around it entails increased government investment in technology education and infrastructure advances in science and technology and our ability to cooperate at scale they are why our standards of living and life expectancies are so much higher today than they were 200 years ago with climate change providing an existential threat both public programs and regulations have to be directed at creating a green economy essential in our ability to ensure that a middle class life is accessible to most citizens will be a public option a government alternative for instance in the provision of mortgages retirement security and medical care the economist behind your reforms is a bigger role for the state but if government is dysfunctional endowing the state with more economic power is like giving a toddler a power drill who knows what damage will ensue aren t you worried that your solutions fall flat if the system that caused the mess is incapable of managing the fixes mr stiglitz all humans and all human institutions are fallible that is true both in the private and public sectors look at the devastation wrought by private banks in the 2008 crisis a loss of gdp from what the economy would otherwise have produced cumulatively now estimated in europe and america to be in excess of 10 trillion but government can and has worked well in many places including in america both social security and medicare have far lower administrative costs than private firms providing comparable services modern economics has made us sensitive to the underlying incentive problems in both the public and private sectors providing tools to enhance efficiency and accountability oversight including systems of checks and balances and an active free press are essential and this is again true both in the private and the public sector the economist in an environment of post fact politics you marshal a lot of evidence to support your views which counts for zilch if the political terrain disdains evidence so how can your reforms stand a chance of being adopted unless you go to battle armed with narrative emotion superficialities and a dash of embitterment mr stiglitz i m a midwestern optimist a position that is perhaps hard to maintain in the face of what has been occurring i believe however that the vast majority of americans can be moved by reason and evidence but i also believe that emotions are also on the progressive side there is something distinctly un american about our un level playing field with 20 of american children growing up in poverty or with so much power concentrated in the hands of so few firms power that they repeatedly abuse polls show that the vast majority of americans support the policy positions which i advance in the book and they want a restoration of true democracy we have to curb the power of money in our politics and end the systematic attempts at disenfranchisement political engagement of the kind we saw in 2018 and the increasing awareness of young people of how much is at stake hopefully is setting the stage for the return of the country to its progressive ideals facilitating the transition to a postindustrial world excerpted from people power and profits progressive capitalism for an age of discontent by joseph stiglitz allen lane 2019 the us like most countries in europe has been struggling to adapt to deindustrialization globalization and the other major shifts in its economy and society this is another area where markets need the help of the government facilitating transition after the fact is extraordinarily costly and problematic we should have done more to help those who were losing their jobs to globalization and advances in technology but republican ideology said no let them fend for themselves government must anticipate the broad strokes of future structural shifts adapting our economy to climate change and to the changing demography are just two of many challenges of transition facing our economy and society in coming years new technologies including robotization and artificial intelligence represent further challenges recent and earlier episodes of such changes have generated one important lesson the market on its own is not up to the task there is a simple reason already explained those most affected for instance those who are losing their jobs are least able to fend for themselves the changes often imply that their skills are less valuable they may have to move to where the jobs are being created and house prices in the growing parts of the country are often far higher even if after training their job prospects might be good they don t have the resources for retraining and financial markets will typically only advance them the money at usurious interest rates they lend at normal interest rates only to those who have good jobs a good credit history and good equity in their home in other words to those who don t need the money thus there is an essential role for government to facilitate the transition through what have been called active labor market policies such policies help retrain individuals for the new jobs and help them find new employment another tool for government is referred to as industrial policies which help restructure the economy into the directions of the future and assist the creation and expansion of firms especially small and medium sized enterprises in these new sectors some countries like those in scandinavia have demonstrated that well designed active labor market and industrial policies can create jobs as fast as jobs get destroyed and can move people from the old jobs to the new there have been failures but that is because sufficient attention has not been paid to what makes for successful policies place based policies as government pursues labor market and industrial policies it needs to be sensitive to questions of location too often economists ignore the social and other capital that is built into a particular place when jobs leave a place and move elsewhere economists sometimes suggest that people should move too but for many with ties to families and friends this is not so easy and especially so since with the high costs of child care many people depend on their parents so they can go to work research in recent years has highlighted the importance of social bonds of community in individuals well being more generally decisions about where to locate are not efficient too many people may want to crowd into the big urban centers causing congestion and putting strains on local infrastructure among the reasons that factories moved to rural areas was that wages were low public education ensured that workers had enough skills nonetheless to be highly productive and our infrastructure was sufficiently good that it was easy to get raw materials into the factories and the finished goods out but some of the same forces that had led to low wages are now contributing to the problem of deindustrialization wages were low in part because of lack of mobility with perfect mobility wages skill adjusted would be the same everywhere but this lack of mobility is key to understanding why deindustrialization is so painful in short we need policies focusing on particular places cities or regions going through stress in what are called place based policies to help restore and revitalize communities some countries have managed such policies extraordinarily well manchester england the textile capital of the world in the nineteenth century has reinvented itself with help from the uk government as an educational and cultural center it still may not be as relatively prosperous as it was in its heyday but it is instructive to compare manchester with detroit which the united states simply let go bankrupt government played a central role in the transition from agriculture to a manufacturing economy it now needs to play a similar role in the transition to the new economy of the twenty first century social protection one of the most important detractors from individual well being is a sense of insecurity insecurity can also affect growth and productivity individuals worrying about whether they will be thrown out of their house or lose their job and only source of income can t focus on the tasks at work in the way they should those who feel more secure can undertake riskier activities often with higher payoffs in our complex society we are constantly confronting risks new technologies may take away jobs even if they also provide new ones climate change itself presents untold new risks as we have recently experienced with hurricanes and fires again large risks like these and ones associated with unemployment health and retirement are risks that markets do not handle well in some cases like unemployment and health insurance for the aged markets simply do not provide insurance in other cases like retirement they provide annuities only at high costs and even then without important provisions such as adjustments for inflation that is why almost all advanced countries provide social insurance to cover at least many of these risks governments have become fairly proficient in providing this insurance transaction costs for the us social security system are a fraction of those associated with comparable private insurance we need to recognize however that there are large gaps in our system of social insurance with many important risks still not being covered either by markets or by government conclusions changes and reforms are necessary to achieve a more dynamic economy growing faster an economy that serves people and not the other way around many of the policies are hardly novel variants of these policies have worked successfully in other countries it s not the economics that are difficult it s the politics even if we get the politics right and succeed in achieving the reforms described here attaining a middle class life may still be difficult even families with reasonable jobs may not be able to have an adequate retirement or afford to send their children to college just as traditionally farmers helped each other raise a new barn and just as families pull together in times of need our society works best when everyone works together the positive agenda of restoring growth for all is part of the broader ambition of making a middle class life accessible to all ______________ from people power and profits progressive capitalism for an age of discontent by joseph stiglitz copyright

expropriation demonstration the sign reads socialization photo jacob blumenfeld it s an unusually warm saturday in berlin if it even makes sense to refer to the weather as unusual anymore i wake up early read a bit write some emails change some diapers and then head out to meet some friends at the café before the big demo the mietwahnsinn or rent insanity protest is an annual gathering of tens of thousands of people at alexanderplatz who come together to loudly and colorfully decry the seemingly unstoppable rise of rents in the german capital like most big protests here it feels like a party strolling down karl marx allee a massive boulevard built in stalinist style for east berlin 40 000 human beings throb to the bass young old parents roommates co workers students tenants and activists all drifting together in common disarray like a roving concert shouting about rent sharks high costs of living and most of all expropriation the word is on everyone s lips not least the city senate the big property owners and real estate companies the struggling tenants and just about anyone else who s read the paper watched the news or walked the streets where posters banners and graffiti calling for the expropriation of deutsche wohnen co are ubiquitous in most cities such radical slogans would be ignored or dismissed as the infantile fantasies of an ultra left fringe but not here the demand to expropriate the largest profit oriented property owners in berlin in other words to socialize over 200 000 private apartments is a serious proposal one that may in fact take place how did this happen real estate state cities across the world are choking on an influx of surplus capital tied to a decline in productive investments the super profits of speculative finance captured by the 0 000001 cannot remain idle in zero interest banks or else they die an inflated death like a cancer capital must circulate reproduce and expand to continue existing it does this through finding new lines of investment specifically by buying trading and selling commodities labor power and means of production transforming its skin along the way into money shares goods titles wages interest rent and profit but with the global drying up of profit rates in manufacturing new dumping grounds are needed to wash the petabytes of capital squeezed from the skin of the global working class here the value of private property reappears in all its glory global real estate is now worth 217 trillion writes urban geographer samuel stein 36 times the value of all the gold ever mined it makes up 60 percent of the world s assets and the vast majority of that wealth roughly 75 percent is in housing 1 the return on investment in real estate is safe stable and a steal so when hedge funds capital firms investment banks and other sadistic associations of our earth melting bourgeoisie need a sink to defecate their surplus wealth into they can always find one in homes apartments offices buildings and land in general the living and working habitats of human beings in turn those who cannot keep up with the spiraling costs of buying or renting a stable space on earth for the simple pleasure of existing in three dimensions those people are disregarded evicted abandoned left to join the floating surplus population moving here or there wherever the price of property allows them to breathe in capital city 2019 samuel stein s essential new book on gentrification real estate and urban planning the logic of this dynamic is laid bare the force behind these trends is the growing centrality of urban real estate to capital s global growth strategy through this process the price of land becomes a central economic determinate and a dominant political issue the clunky term gentrification becomes a household word and displacement an everyday fact of life housing becomes a globally traded financial asset creating the conditions for synchronized bubbles and crashes government particularly at the municipal level becomes increasingly obsessed with raising property values and redistributing wealth upward through land and rents real estate developer donald trump becomes first a celebrity and ultimately a president taken together we witness the rise of the real estate state a political formation in which real estate capital has inordinate influence over the shape of our cities the parameters of our politics and the lives we lead 2 the reasons for the rise of the real estate state are complex but mostly have to do with deindustrialization or better put industrial restructuring which weakens the grip of industrial capital on cities and their interest in keeping land and housing cheap for their workers and buildings and strengthens the power of real estate capital on urban planning and their interest in raising property values at all costs 3 furthermore the falling rate of profit in productive industries leads to more and more capitalists seeking higher rates of return in safer assets like real estate the financialized deregulation of private property plays another role allowing homes to be traded as shares bundled up in investment packages sold and resold to the highest bidder homes become first and foremost a source of wealth and only secondarily a form of housing on top of that quantitative easing creates massive liquidity for banks and that money does not go into creating jobs but directly into hard assets like land and property real estate values are exploding with bubbles on top of bubbles still waiting to pop in other words it is not simply a lack of supply causing a massive overvaluation of property prices but a hyper inflated demand for housing coming from a global store of surplus capital legally buttressed by class interests working directly against you 4 real estate is the preeminent form of wealth today it is our gold whoever owns the property title reaps an exclusive return from the labor value and speculation on that land since property rights are inherited that wealth is inherited too but property wealth is not just passed on to the next generation it is used as the basis for more accumulation more expansion more wealth as everyone knows but no one is supposed to say the best way to own property is to be born into a family that owns property in a capitalist economy the purpose of owning a home house building apartment or land is neither the need it serves nor the use it has but the value it represents until land is socially controlled stein proclaims those who possess property capital and access to power will shape planning priorities 5 the task is clear to be able to lead a life of dignity in our cities without fear of displacement or destitution the power of property must be confronted head on gentrification and anti gentrification in berlin the forces of property present two options for cities gentrification or disinvestment 6 what is gentrification gentrification simply means the improvement of urban space for capital it is as ipsita chatterjee says the theft of space from labor and its conversion into spaces of profit 7 in other words gentrification names the relentless assault on working class neighborhoods by a combination of real estate capital municipal government and city planners all of whom consider raising property values to be the sine qua non of urban policy it is not simply a product of tourists artists hipsters or whatever group one deems responsible at the moment of course the production of the commodity of housing would be worthless without its consumption without a sale the value of a commodity is not realized but a consumption approach to gentrification is woefully one sided mistaking the effect for the cause the logic of investment disinvestment and reinvestment in cities is not driven primarily by hip consumers but by the potential value that developers politicians and landowners can obtain by transforming urban space into territory amenable to people of wealth in other words by choice or by force planners use gentrification to create the physical environments for capital to thrive it is the process by which cities seek capital and capital seeks land its endgame is a city controlled by bankers and developers run like a corporation designed as a luxury product and planned by the finance sector what was public becomes private what was common becomes enclosed what was cheap becomes expensive what was shared becomes traded through the real estate state the city becomes gentrified through gentrification the city becomes neoliberal 8 in berlin a variety of tactics have been deployed to stop this onslaught building frenzies rent brakes public buyouts housing occupations graffiti actions window smashing yuppie frightening political lobbying city planning but none of this has slowed the exploding rents and real estate speculation 9 why were the rents recently so low and why did they finally accelerate the simple explanation is that 15 years ago when the population was stagnant or declining and hundreds of thousands of apartments sat empty the municipal government decided to sell off vast swaths of public housing to private companies so as to help relieve its deficit and now berlin is cool attracting new residents and new jobs at a pace too fast for the city to keep up with 10 in short demand outstrips supply to solve the problem it is claimed just build more houses now it is true that the population has been increasing rapidly but so has construction in the 12 months prior to march 2019 writes journalist feargus o sullivan the number of new construction contracts rose by 11 3 percent furthermore population increases and rising demand does not automatically entail gentrification luxury condos real estate mega mergers displacements evictions and so on the question is why is berlin attractive now to understand that one needs to take into account the planned transition from a period of disinvestment to one of reinvestment the demand for housing does not just come from workers who need homes to live in as a use value but from shareholders who need homes to invest in as an exchange value 11 real estate is the laundromat of surplus capital not only for local and foreign investors but also for banks and firms sitting on billions of quantitatively eased dollars and euros so what is to be done last year google bought part of an old industrial building in the middle of the rapidly gentrifying kreuzberg district in berlin and planned to turn it into a campus for start ups this was a smart move venture capitalists have been circling berlin like vultures of late seeking lean start up meat to devour if you hear or see the words innovate coworking accelerator unicorn pivoting sharing gig incubate pop up or disrupt around your city then the end is nigh for many locals however the prospect of wealthy tech bros segueing along the canal with their designer tote bags and fair trade airpods did not seem like a good idea they know what happens to cities that prostrate themselves before the altar of venture capital increased inequality rapid displacement higher rents informal jobs homogenized culture and a rising surplus population so people fought back with neighborhood assemblies working groups street demos media interviews political pressure campaigns and all sorts of direct actions culminating in a rowdy occupation of the building itself which was forcefully evicted by the police 12 after that google decided to pull out of the project leaving the space to community organizations the people won and yet the trend continues 13 more recently local activists successfully blocked the construction of a planned hostel on skalitzer straße in kreuzberg forcing the owner and city to compromise on a more social use of the space in another case members of a collectively run left wing office space on lausitzer straße have been trying to stop their property owner the taekker group from selling the building off for millions to another investor some residents went to the owner s offices in berlin and some even went to denmark to confront the company they also connected with residents of other buildings owned by the same company in order to create a network of solidarity in defense of such spaces and in may of this year an anonymous group of urban vandals staged a creative action to highlight the harmful role of airbnb and vacation rentals on affordability in the city they opened up an airbnb rental as a temporary art gallery with exhibits of housing maps stories of displaced individuals and bathtub and bedside graffiti full of slogans taken from the streets 14 when an owner of a building wants to sell off housing stock to another company or person the city of berlin has the right of first refusal to buy the property first and keep it in the hands of the public as affordable housing or for other social uses this does not happen nearly enough to keep up with the pace of rising rents but it is also not uncommon and lately increasing 15 the right of first refusal is a tool that can be used to decommodify housing but since it requires buying the property first at market value it presupposes a growing municipal economy this is the dilemma to redistribute wealth there must first be enough wealth to redistribute and for there to be enough wealth the economy must grow which means more privatization of public goods more exploitation of living labor more disinvestment in social welfare and more tax breaks for the private sector in short it means more gentrification stopping gentrification by means of gentrification is probably not going to work but there is another option as engels already knew in 1872 the housing shortage can be remedied immediately by expropriating a part of the luxury dwellings belonging to the propertied classes and by compulsory quartering in the remaining part 16 why not expropriate expropriate the present call for expropriation goes after the biggest profit oriented property owners in berlin mega landlords those who own over 3 000 apartments the public target is deutsche wohnen co which owns about 111 500 apartments in berlin but there are others like vonovia akelius pears with potentially 294 000 apartments at stake 17 according to the german basic law articles 14 and 15 the government would have to compensate the companies for expropriating their property at a rate that balances the public interest and private cost estimates range between 7 and 36 billion euros berlin is currently 58 billion euros in debt so is it worth it who would own the apartments then the city the state the residents and how would it even work 18 the proposal to expropriate large landlords has to first get on the ballot this takes a few steps activists need to collect 20 000 signatures to start the process which they have almost done then gather another 170 000 signatures in a four month period next with the referendum on the ballot they would have to win by a simple majority with 25 of eligible voters actually voting after that the city senate is obliged to do something but even then it is not guaranteed that they will follow through they could make some kind of compromise watering down the demand to expropriate with a promise to build more affordable housing or enjoin a temporary rent freeze even if the city does pull the trigger and expropriate mega landlords it will most likely get challenged in court yet there does exist a legal basis in germany to expropriate property for the public good right there in the basic law grundgesetz article 14 states 1 property and the right of inheritance shall be guaranteed their content and limits shall be defined by the laws 2 property entails obligations its use shall also serve the public good 3 expropriation shall only be permissible for the public good it may only be ordered by or pursuant to a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation such compensation shall be determined by establishing an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected in case of dispute respecting the amount of compensation recourse may be had to the ordinary courts property entails obligations which obligations and to whom and what if those obligations are not met its use shall also serve the public good does private property in land natural resources and means of production actually serve the public good does it satisfy the needs of actual living individuals if not then what shall we do about it expropriation shall only be permissible for the public good if it is in the public good for everyone to lead a life of dignity with basic needs like food clothing and housing met then expropriation for that purpose seems not only fitting but necessary article 15 says land natural resources and means of production may for the purpose of socialization be transferred to public ownership or other forms of public enterprise by a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation with respect to such compensation the third and fourth sentences of paragraph 3 of article 14 shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purpose of socialization this is the key phrase that the deutsche wohnen co enteignen campaign has seized upon a phrase that has never before been put into effect in germany everything depends on how one interprets the key term vergesellschaftung does it mean nationalization or socialization if it means nationalization then the state takes over the property and runs it like social housing public transport national health insurance the army and so on if it means socialization then the tenants local community non profit organization land trust or some other body would own it and run it themselves in short should the expropriated houses belong to those who live in them use them and need them or should it belong to the state as a whole which buys the properties in the first place or maybe it means that land natural resources and means of production can rightfully be expropriated and decommodified when society itself needs socializing if that is the case then it should be done soon the campaign to expropriate mega landlords is a positive development for the city and it is already scaring off some investors although not nearly enough but the results of such a move are unknown critics argue that expropriation in itself will not create any new apartments it will only change the ownership title of around 12 percent of housing stock from private to public in addition the rents for large landlords are not above average for the rest of the city the city of berlin will have to pay out billions of euros to these landlords money that could otherwise be spent on building new social housing and there is no guarantee that expropriations will stabilize rents in private or public housing against this however one can counter that the privatization of social housing did not create any new apartments either and yet that policy is praised by the same market apologists who denounce expropriation those who call for expropriation want to help tenants who are struggling right now who are threatened with displacement and need support 19 and they want to signal to other investors real estate companies politicians and landlords that this city is not for sale if housing is truly a human right as so many universal declarations and conventions proclaim then it cannot also be a commodity for housing to actually satisfy public needs and not private wealth then it cannot be produced or distributed according to the contingency of price signals to stop the expropriation of our daily lives property must be expropriated and now but as article 15 makes clear why stop at housing why not go all the way including land natural resources and means of production why not expropriate everything capitalists know all about expropriation capitalist development is based on the expropriation of small farmers from the land a violent protracted process across generations and continents which rendered individuals propertyless dependent on selling their labor capacity to others in order to meet their needs without the expropriation of land no one would need to chase rents jobs and money just to survive if the beginning of capitalist accumulation lies in the expropriation of the masses by the few then the end of our present misery lies in the expropriation of the few by the masses this is what marx calls the transformation of capitalist private property already practically resting on socialized production into socialized property 20 capitalism itself prepares the way for socializing property by already socializing production for marx this is the imminent way out of our current predicament the centralization of the means of production and socialization of labour reach a point at which they become incompatible with their capitalist integument this integument is burst asunder the knell of capitalist private property sounds the expropriators are expropriated 21 but who will expropriate the expropriators and how as oliver nachtwey documents in his sobering book germany s hidden crisis 2018 we are living through a period of regressive modernization a change from fixed employment to informal labor conditions a period of downward mobility masked through rising employment in unstable part time badly paid jobs the crisis of social reproduction of the inability to meet one s needs is not going to go away on its own social struggles pop up here and there but there is no organized class strong enough to force the expropriation of private wealth for the purposes of socialization nevertheless to slow the slide into barbarism the property question must be confronted the goal writes samuel stein is not abolishing property per se but unmaking the social relations that produce capitalist private property 22 one way to unmake the specific property relations that dominate our lives is to expropriate those relations for ourselves and not just in housing but in transit food energy education child rearing labor all spheres of life in which ownership of our future has been taken away and given over to the sovereignty of the market or as daniel loick argues in the abuse of property 2016 maybe the problem with private property today is not its maldistribution but the very form of making things like housing appropriable at all what would it mean to move beyond a world where things always appear as belonging to someone or another and instead can just exist for the sake of use for satisfying needs for creating pleasure for anything except excluding others from being human the mietwahnsinn march ends across the bridge in kreuzberg where a small occupation is taking place nearby not uncoincidentally a vacant apartment is taken over a call to defend it goes out hundreds arrive a wave of crunched bodies pushes back and forth into rows of inflated riot cops blocking access to the door it only lasts a few hours a couple bloody protesters a few injured cops and some arrested individuals the usual the rent insanity is over time to go home and prepare for the next housing demo which more or less occurs every week now as i wander back through the streets past the people collecting signatures for the expropriation campaign i think about a scene from the beginning of the financial crisis 10 years ago in new york city when bandits hung banners from the rooftops of buildings saying occupy everything calling for generalized occupations of private and public space a few years later that call was taken up across the country but occupying space was always just a temporary solution to a deeper problem to truly reclaim our cities and lives in ways that cannot be foreclosed by police evictions or personal burnouts political action must shift from occupying to expropriating everything otherwise we might as well wait for the weather to change back to normal

promises promises promises it is the season for political promises the candidates competing to be the democratic party candidate for president in 2020 are out in force trying to outbid each other with promised horns of plenty to any and all who might be voting in that party s primaries beginning in a mere matter of months there are a handful of words however that never seems to be uttered by any of them scarcity costs trade offs and liberty instead all of these democratic party hopefuls are busy attempting to match and exceed what any of their rivals come up with as a new tack to prove that they are ideologically more progressive politically further to the left or less afraid of saying socialism with the modifier democratic in front of it and for all of them the sky s the limit when it comes to more government spending first let s keep in mind what progressive means in this political context an increase in the size scope and cost of government in american society those running for that democratic party nomination all call for and agree on the need for more government in each of our lives for instance a single payer national health system is merely another name for socialized medicine the government would be the single provider and allocator of all things relating to the people s medical and related health care needs and desires people at liberty to choose for themselves in a free society each individual makes his own plans about the goals he decides to set for his life and how best to use the income and resources at his disposal to achieve them and in a society as complex and diverse as our own it should come as no surprise that people vary widely on the things they desire to give meaning and happiness to their lives and their judgments about the best ways to accomplish them furthermore not only do people differ in what they consider important but also they evaluate differently the trade offs worth making to get them two individuals may consider that having some type of health insurance is something essential to have to meet their respective family s medical needs but they may vary greatly in what they consider worth giving up to get it a couple with small children may consider a more comprehensive health insurance policy with a higher premium and lower deductibles worth paying for even if it prevents them from having the nicer but more expensive house with a bigger monthly mortgage payment the career oriented couple who decide not to have children or to postpone that decision until they are professionally more established may prefer a health insurance policy with a much lower premium but higher deductibles because they would prefer to have the money to invest in their dream house or to have the money to take those exotic but expensive vacations while they are still young while on the other hand a third person may have spent the money for a dna profile found out that he is not prone to any inheritable illness eats right exercises regularly works in a low risk occupation and decides to have no health insurance with the intention of covering any medical expenses out of pocket as they come along the free market serves the wants of everyone the advantage and the benefit of a free market economy is that all three of these individual healthcare planning decisions and many others can be simultaneously accommodated to meet these preferences with each person or family paying or not paying for what they consider the healthcare plan that best fits their circumstances and desires businesses make profits by fitting the nature and qualities of their products to meet the demands of the consumers from whom they earn their revenues go into to any clothing or shoe store or any supermarket with its huge array of foods and ingredients from which to select and we see before our eyes the diversity of tastes preferences likes and desires that are served and satisfied all at the same time then add to this all the niche industries and businesses that also cater to those who have minority or eccentric wants and wishes to be fulfilled conflicts about goals to pursue or differences about the best means to use to attain them are minimized in a free market society precisely because each individual and family is at liberty to decide these things for themselves and to find willing sellers to satisfy their profile as the means of earning profits but once government takes on responsibility for any or all of these matters the system is soon compressed into either a one size fits all or a much narrower set of options compared to a competitive free market individuals are no longer planning these things for themselves but instead with a single payer socialized healthcare system the government must now design a single plan for everyone and to which and within which everyone in the society must fit and be made to conform the government must decide what is the coverage treatments medications and hospital and recovery times that members of the single payer system will be eligible to receive in other words the entire country must conform to a single scale of values imposed by the government with that government determining what are the acceptable options to be permitted to all the members of the society the natural human diversity of a complex society is straightjacketed within a politically compressed bureaucratic conformity missing questions how much does it cost and who pays the other aspect to this is that nearly nothing is said about the cost of providing such a progressive single payer healthcare system the urban institute a think tank sympathetic to progressive policy agendas estimated not long ago that the cost could be over 32 trillion over the first ten years or 3 2 trillion annually the entire federal budget for fiscal year 2019 is likely to be around 4 4 trillion with medicare medicaid and related healthcare costs coming in at 1 2 trillion according to the congressional budget office cbo socialized medicine therefore once implemented could be equal to about 73 percent of everything the federal government is targeted to spend in the current fiscal year all those democratic party wannabes also promise to not only maintain but to increase social security benefits for the growing number of retirees in the united states but again in its latest long term budgetary projections released in june 2019 the congressional budget office already estimates that under current legislation social security s disability insurance fund will be out of funds in 2028 and its retirement benefits fund will be exhausted in 2032 if the relevant taxes are not increased the existing benefits schedules are not reduced and the minimum retirement ages are not raised for receiving full benefits or some combination of these three who is going to pay for all of this of course our progressives always chant the one percent of wealthy americans so how many of these financial bottomless wells of wealth are there to fund all the free stuff that is promised to everyone in 2016 the top one percent held 25 trillion of household wealth in the united states suppose the government through a wealth tax to fund all these promised free things confiscated every one of these dollars that would not cover even 80 percent of the progressive s single payer healthcare costs over the next ten years which we saw is projected at 32 trillion over a decade by the brookings institute according to one study in 2016 there were 10 8 million millionaires in the united states of these 9 4 million had a net worth of 1 to 5 million 1 3 million individuals had a net worth of 5 to 25 million and there were 156 000 with a net worth of more than 25 million now of course wealth is not income wealth reflects an estimate of the value of all financial and related productive assets minus liabilities owned by someone this reflects the market value of stocks and bonds but also physical capital tied up in plant and equipment and working capital of multitudes of private enterprises wealth therefore is not cash on hand for the government to tax away to use to pay for all the free stuff the progressives want government to hand out according to the internal revenue service irs in 2016 141 million american taxpayers reported adjusted gross incomes totaling 10 2 trillion of which the top one percent of income taxpayers agi of more than 480 804 earned about 20 percent or a bit over 2 trillion that same one percent however paid over 37 percent of all income taxes paid that year or 538 2 billion out of 1 44 trillion collected in income taxes the top 5 percent of income tax filers combined paid 58 percent of all income taxes collected or a total of 940 billion and the top 10 percent of tax filers paid nearly 70 percent of all income taxes collected for a total of over 1 trillion it is clear that even if the net tax burden on the top one five and ten percent of income taxpayers were significantly increased there would not be enough government revenues from these sources to cover all the expenses of all the programs promised for expansion or introduction by the democratic candidates which would also include free education through the phd along with the cancellation of existing college debts massive infrastructure projects and untold trillions of dollars in an attempt to stop the climate from changing over the coming decade this leaves only more deficit spending that is the government spending more than it takes in in taxes through borrowing and adding to the cumulative national debt spending taxing and the borrowing burden this latest congressional budget office long term projection runs from 2019 to 2049 that is for the next 30 years or nearly to the halfway point through the 21st century just under existing taxing and spending legislation between 2019 and 2049 federal government outlays would increase from about 20 7 percent of gross domestic product gdp to at least 27 percent of gdp or a 30 percent increase federal tax revenues would rise from 16 5 percent of gdp in 2019 to 19 2 percent in 2049 for a 15 6 percent increase so government spending is projected to rise twice as fast as the increase in taxes it s not surprising therefore why the cbo anticipates the return to 1 trillion a year or more budget deficits within a year or two and they continue then on getting larger as a percentage of gdp uncle sam s budget deficit will rise from 4 2 in 2019 to 7 9 percent in 2049 or an 88 percent increase the publicly held national debt would increase from the current 78 percent of gdp to 144 percent of gdp in 2049 for an 85 percent increase over the next three decades if the cbo forecast turns out to be correct of course all these are projections based on existing legislation and fiscal rules along with assumptions about annual economic growth the likelihood and severity of any future recessions the level of interest rates and the related demographic trends in the united states if one thing is certain it is that if no restraints are placed on the size and scope of government any expectations about government taxing spending and regulating is likely to be off the mark in underestimating just how bad the future situation is probably going to be reality has turned out to be worse in terms of government fiscal policy and its consequences than the cbo has projected when looking ahead in past years ignoring costs and eating the seed corn advocates of political paternalism of all stripes and types never think of constraints that there may be at any moment of time or over any period of time a limit to what can be done that the means at people s and therefore the society s disposal are inescapably less in quantities and qualities than the various competing ends for which they can and may applied or if the idea of limits enter their minds it is only in the context of the rich living with less so that which they really don t need can be redistributed to those purposes and people that the governmental redistributors considered more deserving and needing the presumption is that the mere having of more material and financial wealth and income than others in society is in itself a sign signal or indicator of undeserved and ill gotten gains here we see the lingering influence of the marxian mythology that private ownership and control over the means of production is the institutional tool for some to exploit and oppress others through the unearned income of profits extracted from the laboring efforts of the workers never asked in this leftist lusting to loot what belongs to other people is has the income earned and wealth accumulated been the result of peaceful and voluntary trade or the outcome of political plunder privilege and favoritism if much or all of the accumulated and productive wealth of others are taxed away from where will come the motives and incentives for future industry and productive effort without which all risk sinking back into the poverty and destitution out of which humanity began see my articles marx s misconceptions about man and markets and the austrian economists who refuted marx and obama eating the seed corn reverses or slows down growth there is a thing called eating the seed corn out of every harvest the farmer must set aside a certain portion of his crop for next season s planting and production without which he cannot maintain his current level of consumption and well being into the future also if he is to increase his agricultural capabilities into the future he must not consume the entire net surplus above his present harvest he must consume less and save a part of it so he can enlarge his field growing capacity and increase his supply of food looking to the years ahead every dollar siphoned off through either taxes collected or savings borrowed by the government reduces the seed corn available for private sector productive uses in all its forms there have been societies in which the fiscal and redistributive burdens have been so heavy on the citizenry that the economic potential of the country has declined that is the productive capacity and the general standard of living has decreased in absolute terms but even when it does not reach such an economically catastrophic state among the costs of government taxing and borrowing is that it reduces the savings and productive capacity of the society to grow as much as it otherwise might have if not for the burdensome presence of political consumption of the society s income and wealth that very slowdown reduces the economy s capacity to bear the weight of growing government spending and resource misdirection forsaking fatalism because trends can change that is the danger suggested in the cbo s long term projection looking to the middle of this century that is looking to the thirty years ahead of us however nothing is written in the stars or irrevocably predestined from a reading of the entrails of the goose a dangerous temptation is for people to fall into fatalism that nothing can change the seemingly inevitable trends at work in society decades ago the conservative sociologist robert nisbet 1913 1996 once pointed out how easy it is as we look back over the past that is of course the past that has been selected for us by historians and social scientists to see in it trends and tendencies that appear to possess the iron necessity and clear directionality of growth in a plant or organism but the relation between the past present and future is chronological not causal what nisbet was highlighting is that apparent trends can change and have changed because what happens in society is at the end of the day the result of the ideas and ideals that guide people in their daily lives including their views on politics and public policies the austrian economist ludwig von mises 1881 1973 once wrote an essay trends can change his words are as relevant today as when it penned them in the last decades there prevailed a trend toward more and more government interference with business the sphere of the private citizen s initiative was narrowed down social control i e government control of business is step by step substituted for private control the progressives are certain that this trend will go on until the welfare state will have supplanted the nefarious capitalistic system which history has doomed forever the prestige of this myth is so enormous that it quells any opposition it spreads defeatism among those who do not share the opinion that everything that comes later is better than what preceded it and are fully aware of the disastrous effects of all round planning it is this mentality of passively accepting defeat that has made socialism triumph in many european countries and may very soon make it conquer in this country too now this doctrine is devoid of any logical or experimental verification historical trends do not necessarily go on forever trends of evolution can change and hitherto they almost always have changed but they changed only because they met firm opposition the prevailing trend toward what hilaire belloc called the servile state will certainly not be reversed if nobody has the courage to attack its underlying dogmas past trends did not always last in the 1930s friends of freedom were often despondent that the twilight of liberty has arrived with the rise of communism in russia fascism in italy nazism in germany and the new deal in america by the middle of the 1940s two of existing totalitarianisms were crushed in the rubble of the second world war in the early 1980s french social critic jean françois revel 1924 2006 wrote how democracies perish 1985 in which he forlornly feared that the democratic west was doomed for defeat at the hands of soviet communism because the marxists knew what they were fighting for while those in west did not know or care about the preservation of their societies less than a decade later the soviet union was gone from the political map of the world when the 21st century began it seemed that democratic capitalism was the only political ideology standing after the fall of communism we have seen over the last twenty years the rise of tyrannical and terrorizing islamic fundamentalism in the middle east there has been an amazingly growing chinese economy with a political leadership in beijing determined to make china great again on the global scene and as part of doing so imprisoning huge numbers of those labeled as dissidents for opposing the communist government there is a rising tide of nationalism and xenophobia in europe and in the united states that can be implemented by no means other than increased and extended government power and there is the resurgent democratic socialist movement in the west determined to impose central planning and totalitarian identity politics in any society over which they can gain control plus there is the potential fiscal train wreck toward which the united states economy appears to be heading if again the trends projected in the congressional budget office forecast were to proceed as traced out in thirty years time that end point of the cbo forecast will the u s economy be strangled with financial disaster because nothing was done to stop and reverse the growth of the interventionist welfare state will the democratic socialists have succeeded in implemented their green new deal and brought central planning to america will nationalism and authoritarianism have triumphed over the remaining elements of free and liberal societies with a resulting loss of personal civil and economic liberties nobody knows but what can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that these trends may likely continue to play out if there are not those who understand and care enough about liberty in all its facets to reason argue and win the intellectual battles that at the end of the day will determine the future of humankind

the center for economic and policy research in washington said were extremely gutsy and necessary for argentina s recovery the economy fell sharply in early 2002 but began to skyrocket after that a demand for argentine commodities such as beef and soybeans helped generate ample financial reserves mr de la rúa weisbrot said did not take the steps necessary to begin an economic recovery instead he

authors note cap uses black and african american interchangeably throughout many of our products we chose to capitalize black in order to reflect that we are discussing a group of people and to be consistent with the capitalization of african american introduction and summary there is no question that education is a powerful driver of prosperity americans with college degrees earn 117 percent more a year than those who do not complete high school 1 based on data for the high school class of 2015 raising the nation s high school graduation rate from 83 percent to 90 percent would result in an additional 3 1 billion in earnings for each high school cohort which would translate into a 5 7 billion increase in gross domestic product 2 moreover americans with higher levels of education are more likely to vote 3 to volunteer 4 and to donate to charity 5 this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply but on the whole the results of the u s education system are not where they need to be between 2000 and 2017 the united states slipped from fifth to 10th among organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries in its rate of postsecondary degree attainment 6 america s 13 year olds continue to languish in the middle of the pack internationally in math and science achievement after some hopeful progress in the early 2000s results on the national assessment of educational progress naep have stagnated in both reading and math 7 even more alarming the nation continues to see the effect of systemic and structural barriers to opportunity for black 8 latinx native american and some asian american and pacific islander children not to mention the ongoing segregation and isolation of students from families with low incomes who are locked into under resourced schools 9 additionally it is clear that students with disabilities students who identify as lgbtq and students who are english language learners continue to grapple with added barriers to accessing a quality education as the 2020 elections near the conversation about how to change the direction of the country will gain even more prominence on education as well as the many other critical issues americans are facing more and more candidates for national office are presenting ideas for how to increase access to high quality early childhood education and how to make higher education more accessible and affordable and yet with a few prominent exceptions presidential candidates have not yet taken clear positions or staked out big ideas on how to ensure that every child has an excellent school 10 elementary and secondary schools are where students learn to read write do math and develop the skills knowledge and abilities that will make them successful lifelong learners and full participants in u s democracy what s more the public wants a focus on education in the 2018 midterm elections it was the second most frequent topic of campaign ads for governors with candidates vying to be their state s pro education governor 11 this year education ranks third among voters top priorities for the president and congress 12 although k 12 education historically has not been a driving force in national elections the nation is in a unique moment in time teacher protests and strikes over the past year have catalyzed increased public support for both teachers and for funding public education more broadly 13 across the country people are recognizing that after a decade of disinvestment following the great recession the support that students teachers and schools need is simply not being provided and the consequences are evident to be sure part of national policymakers hesitation to address k 12 education stems from america s long tradition of state and local control of schooling which can be a barrier to the federal government and the president becoming highly involved in education but the federal government has a critical role to play in creating the conditions for equitable access to educational opportunity for every child regardless of their background states and school districts alone simply cannot achieve the goal of providing every student with a high quality school the nation s current system has led to enormous gaps in the resources provided to students based on geography income and race the difference in spending across states is massive even accounting for varying levels of poverty regional wages and other factors for example new york spends more than 12 400 more per student than idaho 14 only 11 states fund education progressively by providing more resources to the school districts with the highest levels of poverty in the rest of the country the students who need the most actually get the least 15 even today local communities are seceding from their larger school districts and exacerbating segregation 16 unfortunately u s history shows that without a strong federal role it is all too easy for states and local school districts to perpetuate structural inequality that has existed for generations it is also important for future administrations to understand and learn from the lessons of past efforts to reform k 12 education through the past several administrations both democratic and republican there was a general consensus on the key elements of education reform these elements included standards based accountability for schools teacher evaluations based partly on student learning and the expansion of public school choice options at the federal and state levels policymakers and advocates including the center for american progress pushed for major changes to the education system based on these ideas however over the past few years these efforts though in many cases clearly necessary were proven insufficient first despite evidence that standards based accountability led to modest improvements these reforms have not led to progress at the pace needed to give every student a fair shot at success in college and career 17 second parents and teachers have not seen clear positive impacts from these systemwide reform efforts and in many cases have only seen the negative impacts of overtesting 18 narrowing of curriculum 19 frustrated teachers 20 and state disinvestment in education that stretched far beyond the recession 21 what s more in too many places there has been limited input from and engagement with affected communities during the development and implementation of reforms 22 with these lessons in mind a new education agenda must be rooted in the idea of opportunity for all with equity in access at the center this means developing policies in partnership with everyday people with a lens on how these policies will affect students from historically underserved and under resourced communities the focus should be on ensuring that these students receive the greatest benefit while keeping an eye on every child having a quality seat in public schools there is no silver bullet or single idea that will dramatically improve opportunities and outcomes for students but there are ways that federal policymakers including the next presidential administration can take action and set a new agenda for k 12 education this agenda should focus on five key components applying an explicit race equity lens to policy development preparing all students for college and the future workforce modernizing and elevating the teaching profession dramatically increasing investments in public schools and improving the equity of existing investments bringing a balanced approach to charter school policy this report in turn takes a detailed look at each of these components applying an explicit race equity lens to policy development k 12 education reform has long focused on policies that will improve outcomes for students who are underserved and historically disadvantaged now more than ever it is critical for progressive policy to support the students and families that have been denied opportunity in this country in particular policymakers researchers and advocates should intentionally apply an explicit race and resource equity lens to all policies and analysis this means specifically looking at potential impacts on communities that do not identify as white or that have large concentrations of families with low incomes without conflating the two the goal is to forge a path where equity is not merely a trendy concept but rather one centered in all education policymaking and practice and where institutional racism is called out as a barrier to forward progress and appropriately addressed fortunately during the current presidential election cycle there has been an uptick of serious discussion about the debt that the u s government owes citizens who continue to face obstacles to achieving the american dream as a result of the lasting effects of enslavement 23 from enacting slave codes to relegating black residents to particular zip codes american institutions and social networks have denied black people the basic human right to education and a host of other opportunities including home ownership jobs and voting access through policy and practice 24 the results show up as a persistent gap in achievement 25 troubling gaps in school discipline 26 and ongoing gaps in college access and completion 27 all of which ultimately result in a wealth gap that will take more than 100 years to close if nothing changes 28 similar discouraging gaps are clearly evident for some ethnicities of american asian and pacific islander and nonwhite latinx students 29 and for native american students some of these gaps are even more troubling as this group experiences stark gaps in achievement the lowest graduation rates the highest dropout rates and troubling disparities in school discipline even worse native american young people experience a higher rate of suicide than any racial group in america 30 schools operated by the federal bureau of indian education are in unconscionable levels of disrepair a 2016 report from the u s department of the interior s office of inspector general documented major facility deficiencies and health and safety concerns with structural concerns in 12 of the 13 visited schools as well as five condemned buildings 31 these challenges exist against the backdrop of native american students being descendants of genocide and having their native language and culture stripped away by government policy over centuries the current presidential administration s attempts to eliminate tools put in place to disrupt deeply entrenched and persistent disparities in educational attainment offer additional evidence of the ongoing barriers placed in front of nonwhite american students 32 the data make clear how historic and systemic inequities in educational opportunity have created a debt that must be paid 33 and institutions of higher education are already taking the lead to make amends for past atrocities 34 for these reasons a new administration must begin with a comprehensive strategy for addressing disparities in educational opportunity while some of these efforts will inherently benefit public school students of all races and incomes creating policies targeted exclusively at repairing the ongoing harm to nonwhite students in america can also result in unrealized economic prosperity and mobility broad access to quality schools and greater educational opportunities coupled with a comprehensive economic development strategy beyond the educational system would unlock talent currently not realized within underserved communities presidential leadership is needed to address persistent historic gaps in opportunity for nonwhite students a new administration can take a number of specific actions to increase opportunity and to focus explicitly on racial equity these include establishing a mechanism for filling the annual 23 billion gap in funding between predominantly white and predominantly nonwhite school districts 35 identifying and distributing 200 billion for school infrastructure to update crumbling and outdated school buildings 36 establishing a grant program to improve teacher preparation recruitment and ongoing professional development that fully incorporates culturally responsive pedagogy and acknowledges the new majority in public schools across america 37 and issuing guidance through the u s department of education to implement the powell exception in san antonio independent school district v rodriguez which calls for the elimination of property tax based school financing models that privilege wealthy and mostly white districts over predominantly nonwhite districts 38 in addition a new administration can incentivize state education agencies to conduct deep racial equity audits implement strategies to promptly address disparate racial impacts resulting from gaps in educational opportunity and make transparent a framework for applying a race equity lens to future policy and programming decisions preparing all students for college and the future workforce there is no doubt that the world of work is changing not only are many jobs of tomorrow radically different from the jobs of yesterday but americans can also expect to hold more jobs over the course of their careers moving from job to job and even sector to sector with much more frequency 39 as a result it is more important than ever for the education system to provide every child with the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in a wide range of occupations unfortunately despite increases over the past decade 15 percent of high school students who began high school in 2013 did not graduate within four years those numbers rise to 22 percent for black students 20 percent for latinx students and 22 percent for students from families with low incomes 40 with few good jobs available for individuals without a high school diploma these young adults can expect to earn only 27 040 a year compared with 60 996 for college graduates 41 even for those students who do graduate from high school earning a high school diploma does not necessarily mean that they are truly prepared for either postsecondary education or the workforce improvements in the rigor and quality of states academic standards over the past decade have been an important step but these improvements have not yet fully translated to high school graduation requirements prior cap research found that only four states have high school diploma requirements that are fully aligned with the entrance requirements for their four year state institutions of higher education and only two of those states require a rigorous 15 credit college ready curriculum which includes four years of english three years of math up to algebra ii three years of laboratory science three years of social studies and two years of the same foreign language 42 career readiness is even less of a focus only one state delaware requires all students to complete a three credit career and technical education pathway to earn a regular high school diploma and only 8 percent of high school graduates take a college and career ready curriculum that includes both components 43 research is clear that this preparation is critically important students that have both academic and workforce credentials are more likely to be employed and to have higher wages than other students even when they do not go to college 44 new research from the stanford center for education policy analysis found that after california school districts implemented career pathway programs dropout rates in those districts declined by 23 percent 45 too many students particularly black latinx and native american students as well as students from families with low incomes have limited access to advanced courses and dual enrollment opportunities 46 even before students arrive in high school opportunity gaps at the elementary and middle school level mean that white fourth grade students are more than twice as likely as black fourth grade students to be performing at grade level in math and reading 47 and for all students the average student to counselor ratio is 482 to 1 nearly double the recommended ratio of 250 to 1 making it nearly impossible for students to get the additional guidance they need 48 with these barriers across the k 12 continuum it is no wonder that only 56 percent of students from the lowest quintile of socio economic status enroll in college 49 among pell grant recipients who are college students from families with low and moderate incomes 55 percent require remedial coursework when they do enroll 50 and only 49 percent actually graduate from college 51 give every student the opportunity to graduate high school with college credit and a meaningful workforce credential a new federal state industry partnership would identify school models that provide both of these opportunities to all students and would bring these models to scale regionally and within states to ensure that all students have access to new opportunities in high school these models should focus heavily on the middle grades this partnership would require states and industry partners to ensure that career and technical education programs reflect upcoming well paid in demand jobs in their region and that they address structural inequities to increase access to programs for students in the state who have historically been underserved and subsequently locked out of high paying jobs building on their state s college and career ready academic content standards participating school districts could establish a k 12 ladder of course content supporting preparation for careers in the new economy districts would also strengthen family engagement and educator professional development building awareness about the requirements for the future of work as early as kindergarten modernizing and elevating the teaching profession no education reform effort can be successful without teachers great teaching is at the core of all efforts to improve students learning and has the greatest impact for students who due to poverty and structural racism are the most likely to come to school already behind their peers academically namely nonwhite students and students from families with low incomes 52 yet despite what is known about the importance of excellent teaching the teaching profession has for too long been an afterthought teachers are underpaid and undervalued currently too many teachers must learn on the job sometimes without much support not by chance the students who get the least experienced and least qualified teachers are most often nonwhite or from families with low incomes worsening already existing inequities in these students access to a quality education 53 it does not have to be this way in other careers such as medicine and law high expectations and selective and intensive training work together to create a profession that is highly respected and highly compensated as has been true in other fields unions should and must be a component of efforts to modernize the profession particularly since research suggests that their negotiating power may be associated with not only higher salaries but also reduced teacher turnover and boosted student achievement 54 unfortunately teachers are notoriously underpaid 55 as the recent teacher strikes and walkouts brought to light public school teachers make less than other comparable professionals in every state in 2018 they earned 13 1 percent less on average when accounting for nonwage benefits 56 given their low wages teachers are about 30 percent more likely than nonteachers to work a second job and in many states teachers earn so little that they qualify for public benefits 57 compounding the problem many teachers have to spend their own money on classroom supplies because public dollars fall short for example in the 2014 15 school year 94 percent of teachers paid out of pocket for classroom supplies with the average public school teacher spending 479 58 moreover the teaching profession is not highly selective nor is it doing enough to recruit more diversity to the field 59 compared with the united states other countries with higher performing educational systems tend to have more rigorous selection processes for admission into teacher preparation programs 60 in many states the percentage of nonwhite students still substantially outnumbers the percentage of nonwhite teachers and nonwhite teachers have low retention rates across the country 61 and yet in recent years expectations for teachers have risen the job now requires getting all students not just a small percentage as was the status quo a generation ago ready for college and career which means that students need to meet challenging standards each year 62 in addition expectations for how teachers serve their students have rightly been raised they are expected to differentiate and adjust instruction for english language learners special education students and students who are behind or above grade level 63 the nation has underinvested in anti poverty programs and put its faith in education as the great equalizer 64 which means that teachers are being asked to bear a significant portion of the responsibility to meet students basic needs respond to trauma and provide social and emotional learning 65 all of this is not lost on young people or their parents for the first time a majority of parents say that they do not want their kids to become teachers 66 likewise fewer high school students report that they are interested in teaching careers 67 and enrollment in teacher preparation programs is down by more than 30 percent since 2012 68 comprehensive agenda to raise the prestige of teaching and improve teachers working conditions if states and school districts raised teacher pay to match that of other professions provided training to help teachers meet the needs of the changing student population and increased the selectivity of the teaching profession the national narrative about and respect for the teaching profession would shift a comprehensive policy agenda to achieve this goal should be multifaceted and must ensure that teachers are given the necessary training and resources to meet a higher bar components of such an agenda should include efforts to be more purposeful about candidates accepted into teacher preparation programs with an explicit emphasis on diversifying the teaching profession improving teacher preparation programs to provide them with high quality clinical training experience and more rigorous coursework designed to prepare them for modern classrooms aligning requirements for licensure with candidates observable readiness to teach beyond multiple choice exams investing in supports for new teachers such as high quality induction and mentorship programs providing dedicated time and support for meaningful professional development that improves student outcomes and defining career pathways that give excellent teachers the opportunity to expand their effectiveness dramatically increasing investment in the nation s public schools following the great recession in 2008 most states responded to revenue drops by making large cuts to their education budgets 69 schools depend on state funding for almost half of their revenue but by 2015 only a handful of states had returned to pre recession levels of spending 70 today that number is increasing but nearly half of states are still below pre recession levels 71 some states even chose to cut taxes after the recession which exacerbated budget constraints by reducing revenues even as the economy rebounded 72 research shows that money matters in education student scores on the naep are correlated with cumulative per pupil spending 73 problems such as poor air quality and uncomfortable temperatures in schools can have negative effects on student learning74 a study from the journal of environmental psychology even found that building conditions predicted academic outcomes 75 still more than half of u s public schools currently need repairs 76 funding affects every aspect of an excellent well rounded education more money means available funds for smaller class sizes 77 more rigorous course offerings 78 and additional support staff such as mental health professionals 79 all of which have important consequences for student success and well being and these school features are especially important for students living in areas of concentrated poverty who may need additional support for example class size reduction typically has the largest positive effects for students who are black or from families with low incomes 80 unfortunately there are both racial and socio economic disparities in investment and opportunities despite serving the same number of students school districts where more than 75 percent of students are nonwhite receive 23 billion less than districts where more than 75 percent of students are white 81 reinvesting in schools continually results in more positive outcomes for disadvantaged students between 1990 and 2011 states that passed more equitable school finance reforms saw decreased gaps in naep scores between low income and wealthier districts 82 federal investment in education currently covers approximately 8 percent of public school revenues and the amount of funding provided has not kept up with inflation over the past decade 83 title i funds are not enough to create equity across districts or states 84 and the individuals with disabilities education act idea remains underfunded 85 but with states and districts facing extreme inequities in funding inequities that hurt the students who need education investment the most it is time for progressives to fight for the funding that schools and students deserve public education opportunity grants title i is the primary federal funding source for schools and school districts with high percentages of students from families with low incomes 86 years of political compromises and tweaking of the formula however have left funding for the program inequitable underfunded and too widely dispersed to make a meaningful difference in the schools it is designed to serve 87 increasing title i funding should be a priority but a new administration should go further by creating new public education opportunity grants to inform this approach the federal government should appoint a commission to determine a specific set of critical education resources that are typically present in privileged communities but missing from historically disadvantaged schools and districts these resources could include guidance counselors school nurses mental health professionals art and music classes or extracurricular enrichment opportunities which would become available to all u s schools through the grants in exchange for new federal funding states would need to ensure that districts serving high percentages of students from families with low incomes are providing the resources determined necessary by the aforementioned commission states would also need to make changes to support these district efforts such as adjusting state funding formulas to be more equitable bringing a balanced approach to charter school policy charter schools have long been a contentious issue among progressives and secretary of education betsy devos intense focus on expanding both private school vouchers and charters has likely increased that tension yet high quality charter schools have been a critical strategy to increase opportunity and create more good seats for students at the same time some of the critiques of the charter sector do have merit cap has long argued that there is a progressive case for charters focused on growing and learning from successful models while addressing gaps in charter policy such as the many problems with for profit virtual charter schools 88 there are currently slightly more than 7 000 charter schools across 44 states and washington d c that educate more than 3 million students or 6 percent of public school enrollment 89 while the charter sector serves a small percentage of students nationwide in some of the nation s largest cities it serves far more from between 10 and 20 percent in new york chicago miami and houston to between 30 and 60 percent in philadelphia detroit and washington d c this growth has not been without controversy and opposition critiques include concerns about charters impact on traditional districts for example contributions to school closings segregation and budget cuts resistance to supporting organized labor gaps in charter policy that limit transparency and allow profit seeking lack of support for community led models in favor of schools managed by larger entities responsible for multiple replicated schools and claims of privatizing public education a review of charter school research reveals that many studies have found both negative and positive effects on student outcomes 90 most like a recent federal study on the long term impacts of attending charter middle schools find no effect 91 these mixed results are also driven by marked variability in the success of charter schools 92 charter schools in rural or suburban areas typically have slightly negative effects while charter schools in urban areas especially those serving students of color and students from families with low incomes tend to be more successful 93 in successful charter schools there are significant effects on both short term student outcomes such as test scores94 and long term outcomes including graduation college enrollment and college persistence 95 and the effects can be especially pronounced for historically underserved students in boston for example a study found that one year in a charter school erases a third of the racial achievement gap 96 research into charter schools effects on the finances and operations of traditional school districts highlights that charters have a short term negative impact on economies of scale in districts while over the medium term they can lead to improvements in efficiency in district schools 97 one study of the effects of charter schools in new york city even showed that students at traditional district schools experienced the strongest positive achievement effects when a charter school was co located in a building with the district school 98 high quality charter schools as a strategy not a goal in too many places across the country there are not enough good seats in schools especially for black latinx and native american students as well as students from families with low incomes a strong charter sector is a critical component to expanding the number of good public school seats and high quality charter schools are a valuable strategy to address that problem but the growth of charter schools should not be an end in itself a new administration should take a nuanced approach to charters that includes both the expansion of good school options and the coordination across the traditional district and charter sectors to avoid potentially negative impacts this approach should include three key components first it should include strong authorizing and accountability policies for charter schools as well as efforts to proactively address the shortfalls of the sector these efforts should include solutions for pain points such as issues related to backfilling enrollment during the school year providing service to students with disabilities and maintaining transparency in financial operations to name a few second the approach should apply a race equity lens to public school choice policies generally and charter schools specifically with a focus on equitably expanding access to opportunities for underserved students this means that decisions on where to locate schools and programs and how to make enrollment decisions for example boundaries admissions requirements and lottery rules should be analyzed with a race equity lens third this approach should include a balanced assessment of potential charter growth and the impact on traditional districts this assessment should always focus on how to increase the number of good seats for students but may imply different specific recommendations in different places and circumstances conclusion the current u s k 12 educational system should be an engine of opportunity that creates pathways to college family sustaining jobs and the middle class for every student while this is true for some it is far from true for all if america is ever to have a public school system that provides equitable access to these opportunities everyone parents educators policymakers researchers and advocates must wrestle with hard truths making progress toward the goal of shared prosperity means looking at policies very explicitly through the lens of race and income equity this work is critical to breaking down systematic structural and institutional barriers to opportunity future presidential administrations must have a clear vision for policies that will benefit all americans and provide pathways to opportunities certainly addressing the needs of the current workforce is important but national leaders must also consider the more than 50 million students in public schools who want to go to college or get a good job after they leave the k 12 system it is time for a clear robust k 12 education platform that applies an explicit race equity lens to all policies prepares students for college and the future workforce modernizes and elevates the teaching profession dramatically increases the nation s investment in education and takes a balanced approach to opening and supporting charter schools to provide more good choices for families leaders at every level should focus on these priorities in order to enhance the quality of education for every single public school student about the authors
monetary policy is also running low on credibility major central banks have failed to hit their 2 per cent inflation targets during this expansion heightening the risk that prices will slip dangerously low come the next downturn central bank officials insist that they are prepared to act aggressively if another recession flares the ecb stands prepared to stimulate the eurozone and the fed is signalling that it could soon cut interest rates to try to get ahead of mounting risks in the united states but economists across the globe say central banks can no longer be sole saviours the next time a downturn hits fiscal policy has a much more active role to play and it is not yet equipped to do so olivier blanchard a former international monetary fund chief economist said last month at a central banking forum in sintra portugal specifically referring to europe main line of defence when it comes to monetary policy surely there is not enough room to respond to even a run of the mill recession he said advertisement christine lagarde who has been nominated to succeed mario draghi as head of the european central bank and currently heads the imf has warned that central banks are likely to be the main line of defence given fiscal constraints high public debt and low interest rates have left many countries with limited policy room for manoeuvre lagarde said in a june blog post she added that in a downturn nations would need to use their economic tools together with decisive monetary easing and fiscal stimulus wherever possible global economic growth has crept back after a deep recession and as recently as early 2018 a co ordinated international expansion was under way but progress has shown cracks in recent months with trade flows slumping and manufacturing indexes pulling back from asia to europe in the us the fed is considering acting sooner rather than later as it tries to judge whether a rate cut is warranted emerging research suggests that moving quickly and decisively might be the central bank s best defence while the fed is in comparatively good shape because it has got rates off rock bottom chair jerome powell has started a year long review of just what its options are new policy approaches advertisement having low interest rates really challenges the existing tool kits of central banks powell said last month fed officials say they are prepared to revive large scale bond buying programs to stoke economic activity when the next downturn comes the central bank is also contemplating new policy approaches that would leave rates lower for a longer period after a downturn japan offers a cautionary example that mere willingness to act doesn t guarantee success haruhiko kuroda head of the bank of japan has pulled out all stops to reignite the country s economy cutting rates into negative territory and buying government debt and stocks in a bid to bolster markets and stoke confidence the government has helped spending readily to stimulate demand despite all of that effort inflation remains mired below japan s target which is bad news since it increases the risk of outright deflation should growth weaken central bank leaders have increasingly warned that their firepower will be limited without help from fiscal authorities
the enduring crisis in zimbabwe presents a conundrum to a lot of people guest column learnmore zuze the enduring crisis in zimbabwe presents a conundrum to a lot of people to the generality of zimbabweans whose only desire is the pursuit of a dignified existence the debilitating liquidity crunch foreign currency shortages rising inflation spiralling basic commodity prices erosion of disposable incomes power outages and low productivity are a weight unbearable to carry retrospectively inclusive of the former president robert mugabe era it would be accurate to say that zimbabwe has shifted from one crisis to another for nearly two decades now twenty years of skills flight and economic instability are a long time of suffering it is for this reason that zimbabweans seem to have resigned to fate to the extent even of shunning stayaways that always result in loss of lives and property zimbabweans passionately loathe the situation within their country but clearly do not have the wherewithal to alter it they are simply going on with the tide of a catastrophe they cannot stop some zimbabweans born around 1999 are now moving into adulthood having grown under a cloud of economic uncertainty the zimbabwean political and economic tragedy has become the norm of zimbabwean life while it is easier to understand the zimbabwean crisis in terms of how it presents itself through the economy it is profoundly critical to realise that the zimbabwean tragedy is squarely traceable to the politics of the day this self evident truth was symptomatic of the mugabe zanu pf morgan tsvangirai mdc political feud which culminated in the government of national unity in 2009 in any set up no economic progress can occur in the presence of a political crisis where one entity has political power while the other wields economic influence today zimbabwe finds herself caught up in a situation where the economic crisis is nothing but a silhouette of the terrible political problems bedevilling the nation the current government has gone halfway around the world on an offensive to win international confidence the bretton woods institutions among many other potential helpful monetary institutions have been engaged so that they extinguish a colossal us 18 6 debt to no avail meanwhile a raft of measures including direct threats to businesses operating in the country and austerity measures have been applied in an attempt to contain the revolting economy with little success banning of the use of the united states dollar in local transactions has not stopped the public from using it the liberalisation of fuel imports has not tamed the ever growing fuel queues in the country it appears the more efforts are made to control the damage the more the damage continues this simply points to one thing zimbabwean problems are indicative of something deeply wrong with the politics without pulling punches the real key to unlocking the situation in zimbabwe is to start by fixing the politics of the country as long as nothing happens in the way of both political and economic reforms then the country still has a very long way to go it is a given that one of the worst ever things to happen to the present administration is its failure to win the confidence of zimbabweans in particular and that of the world in general for example it is an open secret that zimbabweans have plenty of foreign currency stashed in different places as they mistrust taking it to banks history has contributed to this general apprehension people remain sceptical of taking their hard earned currency to banks in exchange of the bond notes it is simply a question of lack of confidence in the government by zimbabweans the forex reserves held up by people probably run into millions of us dollars but an apparent lack of confidence in the system is feeding the crisis with regards the extent to which the confidence of the international community has been harmed there really is no secret the united states was honest enough to tell the zimbabwean government last month that it needed to fulfil some tough conditions including political and electoral reforms accountability for past atrocities and compensation for the white farmers who lost their land under mugabe s land reform programme among others the us even went further clearly highlighting that it was urgent that the killer soldiers who fired at protesters in the post election august 1 2018 demonstrations be made to account we may debate theories postulate and pontificate about the economic malaise in zimbabwe but the untainted truth is that massive changes have to occur within the broader politics of this country it must be clearly mastered that a simplistic view in mending the economy is self defeating fixing the zimbabwean crisis is not as easy as picking an alternative currency like the south african rand or botswana pula in the absence of production where almost everything has to be imported coupled with an archaic industrial infrastructure then no economy can be revamped it sounds rather trite yet it is the truth about the zimbabwean crisis only when the essential political problems are adequately addressed can the international confidence return zimbabwe is a country of massive potential but remains trapped in an economic paralysis whose major panacea is simply the return of confidence in the zanu pf government learnmore zuze is a legal officer and writes in his personal capacity
constant change is here to stay says michael wilson and that s a good thing but where did all those black swans come from excuse me if i seem to be in a bit of a saturnine orbit this month i ll snap out of it honestly i will but i ve just been watching professor brian cox explaining on the telly about how many times our supposedly unchanging planetary system has in fact been wracked over the billennia by unlucky collisions near misses and gravitational upsets from passing lumps of rock that have continually spun the celestial dice on whether earth lived or like mars died not that our planet gives any particular cause for imminent concern in that department you understand give or take the odd half kilometre asteroid escaping from the kuiper belt now and then there s a 300 metre specimen passing close by in 2029 just so you know in practice right now we are far more likely to do ourselves in with self inflicted environmental damage before the space rocks ever get a chance but at least we can do something about that of which more anon closer to home it isn t just wandering planetary lumps that can change the gravitational pulls that determine our collective experience incoming geopolitical realities like the emergent china the influential euro the increasingly self focused united states and of course brexit itself have all been moving our financial markets in ways that reflect far bigger economic realities or at least they jolly well ought to so how well are we keeping up with the changed global environment and do we need to change our views or our asset allocations professor cox does a pretty good job on putting us into our cosmic place of course but at the end of the day he says the only cosmic constant is mathematics which is a bit of an embarrassment really because we do seem to be hanging onto some 30 year old ideas that don t always stand up to close inspection interesting times now don t get me wrong in the 36 years since i first landed at the financial times i ve never known a time when there was so much interesting stuff going on as a self confessed political nut i am permanently obsessed with the links between politics and economics economics and financial markets and financial markets and prosperity and there are a few very big questions that i can t answer how is it for example that america s terrifying plunge into fiscal debt hasn t killed off the us economy s growth but is in fact creating genuine jobs how did ten years of quantitative easing also known as borrowing from your grandchildren not destroy the currencies of those countries uk us eurozone japan who issued it why do the prices of commodities including oil or iron or copper continue to rollercoaster as if we didn t already know that supply is limited and that we ll be needing them all for a long time yet how are the markets tolerating shiller p e ratios of 30 and above which are broadly the same as they were in 1929 what of the impending top of cycle for corporate profits have we properly factored in the emergence of china or alternative energy where in short are the fundamentals in all this and where in particular are the mathematics those black swans again like everybody else i am indebted to the lebanese american essayist and risk specialist naseem nicholas taleb for his ground breaking theory that so called black swan events can change the market in random ways and with surprising speed and the market s logic with it the question in 2019 is whether we are taking enough notice of the entire squadrons of black swans that seem to be in the air taleb had the good fortune or foresight to publish his book in 2007 on the very eve of the global subprime bond and banking crisis that would undermine everyone s confidence in the perceived certainty of the marketplace taleb s title refers to the wisdom of the ancients that there was no such thing as a black swan and that if such a bird were ever to be discovered the entire logic of any system that underlay that certainty would be subject to re examination on the face of it then taleb s theory seemed to fit the mood at the close of alan greenspan s nineteen year splurge of easy money feelgood liberal and mainly clintonian expansion in the western world as the easy assumptions about responsible central banking and self regulating markets fell into doubt and as banks duly collapsed or had to be rescued the equity markets took the brunt and the world turned to fixed interest which was logical enough in its way once a black swan has landed you need to reassess things except that america s bond markets remained super strong for long after equities had powered their way back to full strength it indicated well to me anyway that there was a substantial weight of risk averse money waiting out there for the us market even though the risk takers also seemed to be taking their chances with considerable success where was it coming from abroad it seemed and from the emerging markets in particular and the thing is in 2019 it s still that way ken fisher the us perma bull investor has been telling us british since the dawn of time that neither foolish governments nor major scandals nor profit downturns will dent the eternal natural superiority of the united states we worry too much says mr fisher and darn it he has an annoying habit of being right fiscal dogs that still aren t barking but back to the irrationality of the current situation china s shanghai equity scene has been suffering especially badly from america s bull market since the late noughties which has often seemed odd given that its economy has been powering ahead by 8 10 a year for most of that time whereas western europe s markets barely held their own while south america s suddenly lost much of their allure there was only one explanation that seemed to fit the bill namely that america s quantitative easing programme which started in 2008 was somehow hoovering the liquidity out of other large markets wasn t that rather odd given that the us was plunging into debt at such a speed well possibly you could of course protest that china was indebting itself even faster than america and with rather fewer controls but against that at normal times investors are prepared to allow more latitude for large fast growing states like india or china with vast untapped consumer potential and the thing is this time they weren t doing so in the present day as donald trump s united states barks and threatens its way to international trade dominance the feeling seems to be that the new global reality might be here to last as we approach the roaring twenty twenties it does sometimes seem as though political sentiment has indeed swung back toward the us in a way that negates anything we might have believed about the traditional relationship between economies and financial markets but is that strictly true let s examine the evidence if we look at china we see the beginning of the end for the public infrastructure boom and a growing concentration on the domestic consumer which is what you might call the second maturing phase of industrialisation so far so promising at the same time we are also about to see china flexing its rare earth muscles possibly the country s best defence against overweening trade pressure from washington rare earths needed for all kinds of high tech gizmos are found all over the world but only china is currently able to extract them cost effectively the perpetual lure of the safety play and yet the markets still don t fancy china my fidelity china special situations it shares have lost 15 in 17 months is it that investors are worried about non performing bank loans which are still kept too obscured for comfort is it that they re mystified by the central bank s rumblings about a looser monetary policy or is it that they re frightened by the uncertainty from trump s aggressive trade posturing and are flocking to shelter behind the bully in the playground we don t know what we do know is that the old refuge currency of last resort has been funnelling cash away to the us in recent years and the fact that china is now holding 1 125 trillion of dollar paper an amount that ought to give beijing some serious leverage doesn t seem to be carrying much weight at all they tell me that china is building its forex reserves 3 3 trillion so as to drive down the value of the renminbi yuan and keep the country s exports cheap which would seem to suggest that beijing wouldn t be any hurry to sell them off no matter what anybody says so the dollar juggernaut rolls on there are no black swans to be seen there it seems the eurozone of course has better reasons for defying the usual wisdom about how every tide will have to turn eventually its woeful economic performance is barely in positive figures its political system is in semi permanent disarray its exporters are seriously worried about trump s trade threats and now the prospect of an imminent british exit perhaps without a deal is casting yet another pall over the mood and yet there are other global trends which are on the whole entirely positive the question is are our asset allocations taking account of them yet no i don t know the answer either i m just posing the question ageing populations one thing we can say for sure is that demography is now tilting the global balance of equity ownership patterns probably for ever as the citizens of the world are encouraged to monetise their own futures by replacing their employers funds with their own retirement portfolios in which they carry all the risk the demand for safer options for high yielding shares and for low maintenance funds such as oeics ucits especially passives has grown that seems straightforward enough of course but what we forget at our peril is that the sheer numbers of elderly are set to grow strongly over the coming decades as baby boomers retire and younger workers who are supposed to support them fail to supplant them because not enough of them have ever been born only two years ago the world economic forum produced a report suggesting that the oecd developed world countries would find themselves carrying a pensions shortfall of 334 trillion by 2050 unless its politicians pulled their pencils out pretty sharply using calculations based on the idea that a retired person would need 70 of what they d earned during their working life the wef forecast that the uk s pensioner deficit would soar from 6 2 trillion to more than 25 trillion by 2050 you can look at this problem any way you like but over the long term it s certain to drive people into buying low risk low maintenance products that don t do fancy things with aggressive growth strategies but what will those be good question any investor or pension fund manager who sought sanctuary in bonds at today s wafer thin yields never mind those of the last ten years may well find that a future capital loss makes a monkey out of whoever told them it was a safety strategy so have we got the risk balances right i wonder diversification it s not all bad news for the equity strategists of course because today s globally interlinked markets are big enough and liquid enough to take a lot more knocks than they used to just as british investors are able to buy us or japanese or indian shares with ease so foreigners are more interested in buying into the uk even if we exclude foreign domiciled listed companies in london and confine ourselves to uk domiciled ones we find that a majority of their market capitalisation is foreign owned the precise figures are hard to pin down because of varied ownership structures but an office for national statistics survey in 2016 put the figure at 53 9 up from 25 in 1997 although barely inching up from 53 3 in 2012 and in case you re wondering the proportion of equity held directly by private citizens had fallen to 12 3 compared with 28 2 in 1981 that s less of a worry than it sounds if we accept that funds of one sort or another have taken up the slack unit trusts owned 9 5 in 2016 so the news that uk pension funds own barely 3 of uk equities is just a tad misleading a better question would be whether uk investors are buying enough foreign equity exposure given that pre brexit london accounts for much less than a tenth of world market capitalisation the growing use of derivatives is another calming aspect of the international investment scene which we ignore at our peril although nobody could or should suppose that a buoyancy vest of currency futures warrants or whatever would provide complete protection from the likes of the 1987 crash they do have an important role to play as shock absorbers all of which adds a little more certainty to the situation which is especially welcome as the us president cranks up the campaign for his next four years in office clean living we spoke a few minutes ago about the strong and very welcome growth in pension funds which are possibly the single most important driver behind global equity prices at the moment and which may almost entirely account for the otherwise hard to justify strength of us equities in particular during these fitful years of uncertainty but a better question would be to ask what kinds of equities these funds prefer lest we forget the worldwide trend toward ethically and socially sustainable products is becoming increasingly pronounced in the retirement planning sector as indeed in the field of investing for children increasingly too ethically responsible funds are becoming active in holding company boards to account for their actions as indeed they must according to hargreaves lansdown which logged a trebling of uk ethical fund assets between 2008 and 2018 even the very largest uk funds are being pressed by their investors to keep company directors on their toes ireland s sovereign wealth fund sold all of its fossil fuels last year and every boeing crisis or every vw dieselgate just adds to the pressure that s not to say that every fund has the same objectives as its peers however acceptance is now growing for us type socially responsible practices as distinct from the traditional resist principles favoured especially by the young in europe so investors are increasingly willing to accept clean living bankers responsible mining companies well intentioned gm food developers or even benevolent warplane manufacturers that wouldn t have got a look in five years ag boldly going where will it all go i m not sure what i do know is that tomorrow s investors are not fools they are facing challenges that we boomers never had to face although we had others and they have better tools at their disposal than we ever did but the political pressures of the last few years have altered the gravitational field and with it the risk mathematics perhaps that s a necessary thing perhaps not
mixed signals left bond investors to their own interpretations the broad bloomberg barclays u s aggregate bond index generated 3 1 its highest quarterly return in over seven years despite signals of

by john mauldin in the general theory of employment interest and money john maynard keynes wrote the ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by little else practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist i think lord keynes himself would appreciate the irony that he has become the defunct economist under whose influence the academic and bureaucratic classes now toil slaves to what has become as much a religious belief system as an economic theory men and women who display appropriate skepticism on other topics indiscriminately funnel facts and data through a keynesian filter without ever questioning the basic assumptions some go on to prescribe government policies that have profound effects upon the citizens of their nations and when those policies create the conditions that engender the income inequality they so righteously oppose they often prescribe more of the same bad medicine like 18th century physicians applying leeches to their patients they take comfort that all right minded people will concur with their recommended treatments this is an ongoing series of a discussion between ray dalio and myself read part 1 part 2 part 3 and part 4 today s article addresses the philosophical problem he is trying to address income and wealth inequality last week i dealt with the equally significant problem of growing debt in the united states and the rest of the world the keynesian tools much of the economic establishment wants to use are exacerbating the problems ray would like to solve it with a blend of monetary and fiscal policy what he calls monetary policy 3 the problem with keynesianism let s start with a classic definition of keynesianism from wikipedia so that we can all be comfortable that i m not coloring the definition with my own bias and yes i admit i have a bias emphasis mine keynesian economics or keynesianism is the view that in the short run especially during recessions economic output is strongly influenced by aggregate demand total spending in the economy in the keynesian view aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy instead it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically affecting production employment and inflation the theories forming the basis of keynesian economics were first presented by the british economist john maynard keynes in his book the general theory of employment interest and money published in 1936 during the great depression keynes contrasted his approach to the aggregate supply focused classical economics that preceded his book the interpretations of keynes that followed are contentious and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy keynesian economists often argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector in particular monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government in order to stabilize output over the business cycle keynesian economics advocates a mixed economy predominantly private sector but with a role for government intervention during recessions central banks around the world and much of academia have been totally captured by keynesian thinking in the current avant garde world of neo keynesianism consumer demand consumption is everything federal reserve policy is clearly driven by the desire to stimulate demand through lower interest rates and easy money and keynesian economists of all stripes want fiscal policy essentially government budgets to increase consumer demand if the consumer can t do it the reasoning goes then the government should step into the breach this of course requires deficit spending and borrowed money including from your local central bank essentially when a central bank lowers interest rates it is encouraging banks to lend money to businesses and telling consumers to borrow money to spend economists like to see fiscal stimulus at the same time as well they point to the numerous recessions that have ended after fiscal stimulus and lower rates were applied they see the ending of recessions as proof that keynesian doctrine works this thinking has several problems the flaws of keynesian stimulus first using leverage borrowed money to stimulate spending today must by definition reduce consumption in the future debt is future consumption denied or future consumption brought forward keynesian economists argue that bringing just enough future consumption into the present to stimulate positive growth outweighs the future drag on consumption as long as there is still positive growth we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us leverage just equalizes the ups and downs this has a certain logic of course which is why it is such a widespread belief keynes argued however that money borrowed to alleviate recession should be repaid when growth resumes my reading of keynes does not suggest he believed in the unending fiscal stimulus his disciples encourage today secondly as has been well documented by ken rogoff and carmen reinhart there comes a point at which too much leverage becomes destructive there is no exact way to know that point it arrives when lenders typically in the private sector decide that borrowers whether private or government might have some difficulty repaying and begin asking for more interest to compensate for their risks an overleveraged economy can t afford the higher rates and economic contraction ensues sometimes the contraction is severe sometimes it can be absorbed when accompanied by the popping of an economic bubble it is particularly disastrous and can take a decade or longer to work itself out as the developed world is finding out now every major economic miracle since the end of world war ii has been a result of leverage often this leverage has been accompanied by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies every single miracle has ended in tears with the exception of the current recent runaway expansion in china which is still in its early stages insufficient income causes recessions i would argue along i think with the austrian economist hayek and other economic schools that recessions are not the result of insufficient consumption but rather insufficient income fiscal and monetary policy should aim to grow incomes over the entire range of the economy that is best accomplished by making it easier for entrepreneurs and businesspeople to provide goods and services when businesses increase production they hire more workers and incomes go up without income there are no tax revenues to redistribute without income and production nothing of any economic significance happens keynes was correct when he observed that recessions are periods of reduced consumption but that is a result and not a cause entrepreneurs must be willing to create a product or offer a service in the hope there will be sufficient demand for their work there are no guarantees and they risk economic peril with their ventures whether we re talking about the local bakery or hairdressing shop or elon musk trying to compete with the world s largest automakers if government or central bank policies hamper their efforts the economy stagnates the reason keynesianism sticks many politicians and academics favor keynesianism because it offers a theory by which government actions can become decisive in the economy it lets governments and central banks meddle in the economy and feel justified it allows 12 people sitting in a board room in washington dc to feel they are in charge of setting the most important price in the world the price of money interest rates of the us dollar and that they know more than the entrepreneurs and businesspeople who are actually in the market risking their own capital every day this is essentially the platonic philosopher king conceit the hubristic notion that a small group of wise elites is capable of directing the economic actions of a country no matter how educated or successful the populace has been on its own and never mind that the world has multiple clear examples of how central controls eventually slow growth and make things worse over time it is only when free people are allowed to set their own prices of goods and services and yes even interest rates that valid market clearing prices can be determined trying to control them results in one group being favored over another in today s world savers and entrepreneurs are left to eat the crumbs that fall from the plates of the well connected crony capitalists and live off the income from repressed interest rates the irony of using cheap money to drive consumer demand is that retirees and savers get less money to spend and that clearly drives their consumption down why is the consumption produced by ballooning debt better than the consumption produced by hard work and savings this is trickle down monetary policy which ironically favors the very large banks and institutions if you ask keynesian central bankers if they want to be seen as helping the rich and connected they will stand back and forcefully tell you no but that is what happens when you start down the road of financial repression someone benefits so far it has not been main street
hartford s high property tax rate was a major reason daniel d aprile said he moved his d d market grocery store to wethersfield where he is saving tens of thousands of dollars annually on property tax costs credit greg bordonaro hartford business journal when d d market closed its franklin avenue storefront in sept 2016 hartford lost more than a landmark small business the third generation family grocer caterer and purveyor of fresh foods traces its capital city roots back to 1932 when present day owner daniel d aprile s grandfather opened a bustling market that became a mainstay on one of hartford s most vibrant small business corridors however things changed dramatically over the decades shifting demographics a shrinking customer base and higher rents all made doing business in hartford more difficult daniel d aprile said in a recent interview but the biggest pain point was property taxes though d aprile didn t own d d s old hartford quarters at 276 franklin ave his father actually does he was still responsible for paying real estate and personal property taxes at its peak he owed 54 000 a year to the city a sum that became too much to bear and led him to buy a smaller property less than four miles away in wethersfield where he d eventually relocate his entire business and 38 employees since opening the wethersfield location on wolcott hill road in 2014 sales are up 35 percent d aprile said just as important he s paying less than a quarter of the property taxes 12 000 annually than he did in hartford i never wanted to move my business out of hartford but the rent was skyrocketing the property taxes were skyrocketing and sales weren t going up d aprile said we were working very hard for nothing there was no money left over after paying property taxes if we stayed in hartford we would have been out of business he added d d market s story isn t wholly unique for years hartford s small and large businesses have complained they re paying an exorbitant and disproportionate share of property taxes hurting their ability to prosper at 74 29 mills hartford s property tax rate is by far the state s highest and among the nation s highest in fact the effective property tax rate for a commercial landlord in hartford over 5 percent is higher than what new york city boston and chicago landlords face that s stifled economic growth in the city hartford s 4 billion grand list is valued 30 percent below what it was near the turn of the 21st century and 38 percent below its 1990 peak of 6 5 billion by comparison neighboring west hartford one of the region s wealthier communities with half the population of hartford has a 41 mill rate and 6 3 billion grand list new haven a city with a comparable population to hartford but lower mill rate 42 98 mills has a 6 6 billion grand list john gale hartford city council credit hbj has brought development to an absolute screeching halt said hartford city councilor and lawyer john gale it s a huge drag this has been the biggest single financial issue the city has faced in the last 15 years with limited exceptions private development has eschewed hartford over the last decade or longer unless it s been supported by state government subsidies or city tax breaks the city s small businesses in particular have felt enormous pressure from the high property tax rate part of the reason key commercial avenues franklin maple main albany etc in various neighborhoods have lost their luster and for anyone who thinks commercial taxpayers will soon get relief after the state last year helped the city avert bankruptcy by agreeing to pay off hartford s 550 million in general obligation debt over the coming decades think again despite its bailout hartford s finances remain in a precarious position and commercial taxpayers aren t likely to see a tax rate reduction anytime soon according to mayor luke bronin hartford mayor luke bronin file photo credit kyle constable ctmirror org file photo for a small business or any property owner paying the full freight 74 mills it s an unsustainable and unfair burden bronin said i think it s a huge issue and one that our state has to confront if we want to be competitive for hartford s mill rate to be competitive over the long run bronin said it needs to be cut in half that however would likely require major reforms at the state level or a miraculous surge in new commercial development house majority leader matt ritter d hartford said he agrees hartford still has a long road to recovery but he also thinks the bailout he helped broker provided the city with much needed financial stability he said it could take 10 to 15 years to put any sizable dent in the mill rate and that s only if hartford is able to grow its grand list and secure additional state funding among other efforts he also said the bailout deal was the best the city could have hoped for given the political environment rep matt ritter the new house majority leader addresses the chamber credit jacqueline rabe thomas ctmirror org for anyone who thinks the deal could have been better they are sorely mistaken ritter said there was not an appetite to reduce the mill rate the hartford business journal has spent months interviewing property tax experts commercial property owners landlord developers policymakers homeowners city officials and others about the effects of hartford s property tax system which is complicated and broken in myriad ways occupying just 18 square miles hartford is a tiny city that also houses many tax exempt properties significantly limiting the city s ability to grow its grand list in fact 59 percent of the assessed real estate in the city is exempt from taxation because it s owned by governments nonprofits churches or other tax exempt organizations an hbj analysis of city property records shows meantime hartford is also home to one of the poorest populations in the country increasing the need for social health care and other services adding insult to injury hartford has the state s only bifurcated property tax system in which commercial property owners pay a higher tax rate than residential homeowners hartford s challenges are a statewide concern because the city s fortunes are directly tied to the state s especially as more employers and skilled workers want to be in or near vibrant cities despite its challenges some business leaders are still bullish about hartford s future especially given downtown s new vibrancy in recent years helped by the additions of dunkin donuts park uconn s west hartford campus a fledgling tech scene and about 1 500 new apartment units jon putnam executive director cushman wakefield credit hbj i m more optimistic about hartford s increasing attractiveness as a location for companies due to the urbanization trend said jon putnam executive director of commercial realty broker cushman wakefield how did we get here hartford didn t land in its current financial and property tax predicament overnight numerous factors over many decades stacked up to create an unstable and untenable situation with no clear or easy solutions the start of the decline of hartford s property tax base and system can be traced to the mid 20th century when the city like many others in connecticut and across the u s was going through major economic and demographic shifts as more people moved to the suburbs that squeezed out a large portion of hartford s middle class and the affluence that went along with it the city s manufacturing and industrial base also began to shrink while its impoverished populace grew leading to higher city government costs as taxes rose to compensate more properties also shifted to nonprofit ownership that came on top of the enormous share of city property already owned by tax exempt institutions like colleges hospitals sewage plants and even the state itself over the past half century the portion of hartford s tax exempt grand list has more than doubled state government reimburses the city for some of its tax exempt property but it doesn t come close to filling the gap city government too has exacerbated the problem over the decades by overborrowing making pension promises whose costs have outpaced grand list growth and then kicking the can down the road either through short term and costly debt restructurings or by raising taxes however bronin who is running for reelection this year said much larger structural issues have been the leading cause of hartford s fiscal stress at the root of the problem is the fundamental flaw of having an 18 square mile city with an enormous concentration of non taxable property and intense concentration of poverty and asking that city to run itself on only one local source of revenue he said referring to the fact that municipalities in connecticut are only allowed to raise revenue through the property tax in addition to permit and other fees the biggest problem is that you have a city built on the tax base of a suburb that from the start is a structural flaw that has all kinds of consequences the biggest problem is that you have a city built on the tax base of a suburb that from the start is a structural flaw that has all kinds of consequences hartford mayor luke bronin bronin said his administration is running a very lean government and has made deep cuts over the last few years the city council just passed the mayor s 573 2 million budget for fiscal 2020 which does raise spending by 3 2 million but doesn t rely on borrowing and keeps the city s workforce excluding public safety personnel 11 percent below 2015 levels notably since taking office in 2016 bronin has also managed to not increase the city s sky high mill rate even still hartford is unable to lower its property tax rate that shows excess borrowing isn t the root cause of hartford s problems bronin said since the state essentially eliminated most of the city s long term debt if the city had never borrowed a single dollar you would still have a mill rate of 74 29 to make the city function he said noting that city finances are now reviewed by a state oversight panel without the state bailout or bankruptcy hartford would have had to quickly raise its mill rate an additional 10 to 15 mills bronin said which wouldn t have been sustainable he argues much more drastic reforms are still needed at the state level including giving the city additional ways to raise revenue the bailout has provided enough relief to prevent a financial armageddon but the city still has limited financial flexibility bronin said at the end of the day he said there is a cost to delivering basic core services in hartford and the value of taxable property does not come anywhere near funding that state rep jason rojas d east hartford credit claude albert ctmirror org state rep jason rojas a democrat from east hartford who co chairs the powerful finance revenue and bonding committee said the city will likely continue to lean on the state absent pretty significant economic growth in the grand list which i think is difficult to do i think there s still a lot more work to do for the long term future of the city rojas said marc fitch an investigative reporter for the yankee institute a free market think tank said there s plenty of blame to spread for hartford s fiscal situation on the one hand the city awarded really generous labor contracts in the past so fitch views the bailout at least partially as rewarding fiscal mismanagement on the other hand the state has not fully reimbursed hartford for its tax exempt property shortchanging it of vital operating funds hartford has avoided bankruptcy for now but fitch who credits bronin for his budgeting discipline said the city appears stuck in limbo for the foreseeable future even with the bailout and everything their finances are razor thin and they re relying on potential grand list growth to hopefully fill those gaps in the next few years and that is a gamble fitch said out of whack property taxes hartford s financial and economic instability over the years have birthed arguably the most dysfunctional commercial property tax structure this state has seen in the last half century besides the exorbitant mill rate hartford is the only connecticut municipality allowed to assess commercial property at a higher tax rate to calculate any property tax bill in connecticut owners must multiply their property s assessed value by a city s or town s mill rate and then divide by 1 000 in the 1970s connecticut passed a law requiring municipalities to adopt a 70 percent assessment ratio that means to determine the assessed value of a property whether it s a single family home commercial property or apartment assessors multiply its market value by 70 percent by the late 1970s hartford faced a crisis the city was in the middle of its first revaluation in 17 years and many residential properties experienced a significant spike in value if all properties were assessed at the same level some homeowners faced average tax increases of well over 80 percent which was deemed practically and politically untenable so city officials hatched an agreement with state policymakers that among other things allowed hartford to lower its residential assessment ratio to 45 8 percent that shielded homeowners from a major tax hike while leaving commercial property owners with a higher tax rate that initial bifurcated tax structure was actually phased out by 1986 but adopted again in 2006 and remains in place today commercial and apartment properties are assessed at 70 percent of value while single family homes are assessed at 35 percent there is a formula in place that gradually raises the residential assessment ratio to 70 percent but it will take decades before that happens said city assessor john s philip bruce becker developer becker becker credit hbj hartford and new haven developer bruce becker says the uneven property tax setup matched with the high mill rate dissuades commercial investment and fosters an environment in which the city must cut tax deals to spur development especially for larger costly projects he knows that firsthand he redeveloped the 777 main st 26 story office tower into 285 apartments in 2015 an 85 million project that relied heavily on public financing and tax credits he also got a tax break from the city without that support he said the project wouldn t have happened relying on the property tax exclusively to fund municipalities is inefficient becker said delayed revals one source of hartford s problems over the years is that it often waited long periods between revaluations when that coincided with wild swings in the real estate market it led to dramatic changes in assessed property values for example hartford waited 10 years before conducting its 1998 1999 reval which shrank the city s grand list 38 percent to 3 6 billion while the mill rate jumped from 29 50 to 47 the grand list nosedived because assessed property values hadn t fully taken into account the effects of the late 1980s and early 1990s savings and loan crisis which put connecticut and the nation into recession over a 40 year period starting in 1962 hartford only conducted three revals today state law requires municipalities to do revaluations at least every five years waiting 10 years to do a revaluation is not a great idea philip said some have pitched the idea of conducting revaluations more frequently to better capture real estate value changes in a more timely manner but it s seen by many as too costly hartford has also experimented with a commercial property tax surcharge that reached as high as 15 percent and stayed at that level for nine years starting in 1997 the surcharge drew the ire of the business community led by the metrohartford alliance which eventually lobbied to phase out the additional tax in 2010 hartford s mill rate has stabilized since 2011 there have been no tax increases under the bronin administration but the mill rate went on a consistent and steady climb at the turn of the 21st century going from 29 50 in 1998 to its current 74 29 mills today bottom line impact the effect of hartford s bifurcated tax system is that commercial landlords and their tenants are shouldering a much higher tax burden than homeowners in fact city homeowners have an effective tax rate of about 2 2 percent on par with the statewide average while commercial properties have an effective tax rate of more than 5 percent that means for every 1 000 of assessed value a hartford commercial taxpayer pays more than 50 in taxes vs 22 for residential by comparison the effective property tax rates on commercial properties in boston and new york city are 1 8 percent and 3 9 percent respectively according to the lincoln institute of land policy businesses in those cities however face other unique costs property values are also much higher in those cities hartford s high tax rate has a negative effect on commercial property values said john mcdermott a former hartford city assessor during the 1970s who is now a consultant to connecticut businesses commercial properties are valued based on how much net operating income they generate from rents property taxes are typically the second highest expense behind a mortgage when taxes rise they eat into a building s profitability thus eroding their market value that in turn negatively impacts the city s grand list in 1996 when hartford s effective commercial mill rate was 33 4 the grand list totaled 5 8 billion today hartford s grand list sits at only 4 billion making things more challenging for commercial landlords particularly those who own downtown s class a office towers is that rents have been stagnant for nearly three decades settling in at about 22 to 26 per square foot while property taxes and operating expenses increased squeezing their bottom lines combined operating expenses and taxes cost downtown landlords around 10 to 11 per square foot in the late 1980s but reached as high as 15 to 17 in the early 2000s those costs have retreated a bit more recently as landlords found ways to reduce operating expenses and the city kept a lid on real estate tax increases said putnam the cushman wakefield commercial realty broker and it s not just landlords stuck paying higher property taxes many commercial tenants have a triple net lease meaning they must pay a share of a building s property taxes businesses must also pay taxes on personal property like machinery and equipment and motor vehicles that s how tax bills begin to add up for small and midsize merchants like d aprile s d d market that rent space in the city mcdermott said hartford s mill rate is a major impediment to renaissance efforts taking place downtown it s a competitive environment he said in today s world clearly entrepreneurs have an opportunity to go anywhere they want to go there are clearly advantages to being in the city but also from an economic perspective the suburbs have a tax impact that is dramatically less you can very easily go to glastonbury or rocky hill where the tax burden is half or two thirds of the city s andy bessette travelers cos executive vice president and chief administrative officer said he is bullish on hartford despite the city s challenges credit hbj file photo urban draw despite hartford s tax burden the city particularly downtown has seen noticeable development and investment in recent years most of it however has been subsidized by the state or is the beneficiary of city tax breaks still many employers find it necessary to have a hartford presence especially as millennials and others desire urban settings where they can live work and play in fact hartford has seen some employers move from the suburbs to downtown in recent years to be closer to a wider talent pool and the various amenities the city offers the vacancy rate for class a office space downtown is currently 17 7 percent down from 25 5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 according to commercial realty firm cbre the city s overall office vacancy rate fell from 26 1 percent to 16 5 percent over that same time period the state s purchase of two major office towers and the conversion of vacant office buildings into apartments have helped lower the vacancy rate meantime the grand list despite being well below historical highs is up 23 percent since 2006 the city lately has also attracted out of state realty investment including from new york landlord shelbourne global solutions llc shelbourne has invested more than 200 million since 2014 buying up some of downtown hartford s most prized office towers cementing it as one of the center city s most prominent landlords most recently it teamed up with hartford parking giant laz parking to buy the city s iconic gold building skyscraper for 70 5 million shelbourne managing member ben schlossberg said his group finds the city attractive because it s walkable uniquely located between new york and boston and has a strong corporate and higher education presence however he is also cognizant of hartford s high tax rate shelbourne sued the city a few years ago after its appeal for lower property taxes on several of its recently revalued buildings was denied it eventually brokered a tax break deal with the city to resolve the issue without that helping hand some of shelbourne s properties would have gone into foreclosure schlossberg said an issue familiar to downtown especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we are very excited about what is going on in hartford schlossberg said however he added the state needs to find a way to lower the mill rate which is oppressive travelers cos is one employer that has made significant investment in hartford in recent years the property and casualty insurer spent about 55 million giving its famous travelers tower office high rise and campus a facelift it s currently spending millions more to spruce up its interior offices the company was also one of three insurers in addition to the hartford and aetna to promise a combined 50 million donation to the city over five years to help hartford deal with its budget crisis travelers which is the second highest taxpayer in the city with 143 2 million in assessed real estate and property is aware of the high property tax rate but is also bullish about hartford s future said andy bessette the company s executive vice president and chief administrative officer he said companies look at more than just taxes when deciding where to locate and he s attracted to hartford because of the insurance talent here and the quality of life and amenities the region offers bessette also sits on the board of the capital region development authority which has helped finance development of 1 500 apartment units downtown in recent years that along with a growing innovation ecosystem has added to the center city s vibrancy do we care about property taxes absolutely bessette said adding he recognizes that the high tax rate might impact small and midsize companies more than a large

the union members were shouting no more workers blood at a protest at the port of piraeus just outside athens on a warm weekday morning in late may a worker had been killed in a scaffolding accident two days earlier and the metal workers union of attica was directing its anger at china cosco shipping the chinese state owned logistics giant that controls the port was the port of piraeus notorious for crippling strikes and protests until the last decade once again turning into a hotbed of dissent if anything the protest proved the opposite it was small maybe 100 workers showed up and a rarity chinese and greek government officials consider piraeus which was a broken down mess of a port for decades a showpiece investment in the belt and road initiative bri beijing s infrastructure based global development strategy that is sometimes known as the new silk road under chinese ownership piraeus has emerged as the second biggest container port in the mediterranean and europe s biggest passenger port it has allowed china to establish a firm foothold in a prominent european union and nato country one that could be used to extend chinese influence throughout the mediterranean countries and into the balkans the port s success may be too much of a good thing for the white house and for the eu strategy officials in brussels as rivalries between china and the west take on the flavour of a new cold war already there are rumours that a recent freeze on further port development by cosco which is ultimately controlled by the chinese communist party was the result of back channel u s and eu pressure in march the eu labelled china a systemic rival marking a hardened tone on beijing s ocean hopping industrial and security ambitions chinese naval vessels have been welcomed at piraeus a sight that must be anathema to the white house and commanders of the u s sixth fleet in the mediterranean piraeus is generally viewed as a winning investment by cosco the greek government the shipping companies and economists the chinese made piraeus competitive said miranda xafa a greek economist who is a senior fellow at the centre for international governance innovation and a former member of the international monetary fund s executive board jobs there used to be inherited they used to retire at age 50 with lump sum payments no more this is a privatization that has worked but cosco is suddenly no longer getting a free ride in piraeus in april without warning greece s powerful central archaeological council and museums kas declared much of piraeus an archeological site the decision froze big portions of cosco s plan to invest another 600 million 880 6 million in piraeus with the addition of luxury hotels a shopping mall warehouses and a very expensive cruise ship terminal in early july greece s port planning and development commission conditionally accepted but did not approve cosco s expansion plans the expansion may go nowhere until well after greece s snap election on july 7 on sunday night results showed the ruling radical left syriza party headed for defeat at the hands of the opposition conservatives new democracy is expected to support additional chinese investments in the port of piraeus as a matter of pride greeks tend to be highly political and a few are prone to conspiracy theories some say the americans encouraged the greek government to put the brakes on cosco s expansion plans though there is zero evidence to support this theory in early june a small but well known greek newspaper liberal implied that the kas decision was indeed political the government in doing a favour for the u s a has come up with so called archeological obstacles in piraeus it said the timing was certainly curious the kas decision came just after china welcomed greece into the club of central and eastern european countries 11 of them eu members known as the 16 1 group the 1 being china it is now the 17 1 group greek prime minister alexis tsipras who once opposed cosco s presence in piraeus as some of his radical left syriza party members still do has since become an enthusiastic backer of the shipping giant and the bri and has made three visits to china since becoming prime minister in 2015 if the kas decision sticks a diplomatic row is inevitable and the chinese embassy in athens is already demanding answers the port of piraeus stretches almost 30 kilometres from the ferry passenger and cruise ship terminals in the heart of gritty piraeus to the ship repair yard to the northwest the waters just off the port were the site of the first great naval battle in recorded history in 480 bc during the greco persian wars greek triremes crippled a much larger persian force in the strait between piraeus and the island of salamis since the 19th century piraeus has been instrumental to greece s development the piraeus port authority ppa was established in 1930 and pier 2 the port s biggest container terminal was completed in 1997 five years later the ppa joined the athens stock exchange although the government kept a majority stake during those years the port was by all accounts barely functioning before cosco got there it was a congregation of wasp nests said konstantinos katsigiannis the athens lawyer who is president of the hellenic canadian chamber of commerce there were strikes demonstrations and clashes you name it it was unbelievably inefficient and crooked nektarios demenopoulos the deputy manager of public and investor relations for the ppa remembers that some dockworker strikes were by design so severe that they could trigger economic hardship in piraeus and athens strikes used to be a very big problem because the unions had monopoly power to close the biggest port in the country he said sometimes the supermarkets had a deficiency of products because of the strikes by 2008 the greek government was fed up with the strikes and the decrepit state of the container port whose main pier was running at half capacity and athens faced a crippling financial crisis that would prevent it from investing in piraeus the port s two biggest container operations pier 2 and pier 3 the latter only partly constructed were put up for auction the long term lease was won by a cosco company called piraeus container terminal the chinese revolution at piraeus was about to begin even before belt and road initiative had entered into the global development lexicon the takeover of the piers would launch one of china s biggest investments in europe kriton valleras adviser to the general secretariat of ports of greece s ministry of maritime affairs and insular policy said the piers had enormous potential as a key destination for cargo ships arriving from asia through the suez canal the piers needed a lot of improvement he said cosco sunk about 600 million into piers 2 and 3 to make them among the biggest and most automated in the mediterranean and a hub for transshipment the transfer of containers from large vessels to smaller ones so the cargo can be sent to smaller ports unlike many bri projects around the world no debt trap was created for the greek state the funds were raised and spent by cosco not loaned to greek agencies the overhaul has turned the port s container operations into a competitive force in 2007 piraeus did not rank among the top 15 mediterranean container ports by 2017 it was eighth measured by the total throughput of 20 foot equivalent containers known as teus according to data from europe s porteconomics site last year it had climbed to sixth position behind valencia spain with a throughput of 4 9 million teus cosco officials boast that piraeus will surpass valencia by the end of this year and keep on going although the top three ports rotterdam antwerp and hamburg are so big they seem unassailable today the piraeus container port sees on average 7 5 ship arrivals a day some of them green hulled monsters from china shipping container lines the port s towering cranes 31 at last count can unload 4 000 containers in 24 hours the newest cranes remove two 40 foot containers at once lifting them side by side last year piers 2 and 3 reported a net profit of 44 1 million on revenues of 56 2 million this is a business with high profit margins the smaller pier 1 under separate control within the cosco group is losing money cosco claims the piraeus container port has not lost a day of work to industrial action since it first invested in the vast operation in 2008 yes there have been strikes by dockworkers as there were last year but none was big enough to cripple the port we proudly say we have offered uninterrupted services for the last 10 years said tassos vamvakidis the commercial manager for the container port cosco got lucky about four years ago when the greek government under pressure from the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund the troika overseeing the greek bailouts insisted that greece ramp up its privatization program part of that effort would see the rest of piraeus privatized including the ferry passenger cruise ship ship repair and car terminals all of which were held under the ppa the privatization effort triggered a crisis in greece whose governments have long opposed privatizations as did the unions which considered them an invitation to mass layoffs and non unionized workers there were lots of strikes at piraeus in response said george pagoulatos a political economist and vice president of the hellenic foundation for european and foreign policy eliamep it was a typical left wing reaction to the privatization of a strategic asset but greece was desperate for foreign investment and the privatization went ahead in 2016 cosco bought 51 per cent of the ppa for about 300 million it has the option to raise its stake to 67 per cent once it completes some 293 million of mandatory investments the biggest being the expansion of the ferry passenger port 136 million and the overhaul of the ship repair yard 55 million many additional investments including the hotels and the cruise ship terminal are in limbo because of the kas freeze on their development the takeover of the ppa has not made everyone happy the unions have complained that cosco is loading up with non unionized workers the company declines to say what the split is between unionized and non unionized workers the association of passenger shipping companies has complained about the lack of cosco investment so far in the ferry terminals nothing has been done for the ferries association president michalis sakellis said we don t talk much to cosco and the job creation numbers while encouraging are hardly breathtaking mr demenopoulos the ppa s public and investor relations manager said the port excluding the core container business had 1 700 employees a decade ago today the number has fallen to a little more than 1 000 but the container business has created 2 000 new positions since cosco leased piers 1 and 2 in 2008 mr pagoulatos the eliamep economist said cosco s investment in piraeus has been a big win over all for greece it was a very positive investment he said it turned piraeus into one of the largest shipping centres in the world a great opportunity for greece the investment may be buying more than piers and cranes in 2017 a year after cosco took majority ownership of the ppa mr tsipras s government vetoed an eu condemnation of china s human rights record at the united nations the government denied the veto was payback for the piraeus investment certainly china seems to be digging its economic claws into greece by going after strategic investments in 2016 china state grid the world s biggest utility bought 24 per cent of greece s power grid operator china is one of the main backers of the redevelopment of athens s abandoned hellinikon international airport an enormous project that has been stalled for years cosco is said to be considering the purchase of other greek ports and has signalled that ports in italy which this year officially joined the bri the first group of seven country to do so will be next the success of the piraeus investment will certainly burnish china s lobbying power in italy the euro zone s third largest economy mr pagoulatos says the bri investments in greece and elsewhere in europe are part of china s plans to raise its global political clout china wants to retain their trade flow and they will couple it with political influence so that these markets do not get closed to them he said greece is still anchored to the eu and has been kept intact within the euro zone with copious amounts of european bailout money but its affection for china is growing and at some point that is bound to set off alarm bells in washington and brussels if it hasn t already if a full blown cold war does erupt between china and the united states greece s allegiance may not be easy to

predatory russia feeds these trends using everything from twitter bots to assassins seven decades of peace and prosperity have made it too easy to forget what happens when europe divides more than 100 million people half a million of them americans were killed during world war i and world war ii those two conflicts capped centuries of nearly nonstop war conquest and revolution the continent s recent stability is the exception not the rule the peace stems largely from american foreign policy the united states was essential to defeating the continent s fascist powers during world war ii helped revive its economy with the marshall plan and now safeguards its security through the north atlantic treaty organization when the balkans descended into war in the 1990s it took american military action through nato to end the bloodshed donald trump has ignored this history he has abandoned pacts that the eu values like the paris agreement on climate change and the iran nuclear deal he has lobbed insults at the bloc s leaders tweeting that french president emmanuel macron suffers from a very low approval rating and that the people of germany are turning against chancellor angela merkel he has even threatened to withdraw from nato the president s actions have rocked europe s confidence in the u s last year merkel remarked that it s no longer the case that the united states will simply just protect us macron called for a european army to safeguard the continent from china russia and even the united states of america the president s behavior has created openings for the kremlin which is forging political and financial alliances with increasingly powerful far right parties across the continent but the fracturing of europe predates trump and it will likely outlast him extreme nationalist parties have made steady gains in eu parliamentary elections unchecked they will win control of more european countries and they will use their authority to persecute minorities weaken civil society and perhaps even rip the union apart given the continent s history that s a scary prospect the united states needs new ways to bind european states to each other to america and to liberal democratic values here s one establish a large powerful trade agreement with the european union call it the atlantic alliance if implemented it would bring europe and america closer together by making them part of the largest free trade zone in the world proposing a new free trade deal in 2019 might sound backward recent trade agreements have been archetypes of the runaway free market ism that produced the very inequality fueling nationalist backlash on both sides of the atlantic there s a reason that trump ran and won on a stridently anti trade platform and indeed the deal that policymakers have already proposed called the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip shows the flaws of the existing system it s designed to liberalize the flow of capital without serious respect for the consequences like trade agreements past it would establish international tribunals that let corporations challenge and undermine the regulations of sovereign states the fracturing of europe predates trump and it will likely outlast him given the continent s history that s a scary prospect the united states needs new ways to bind european states to each other to america and to liberal democratic values but there s no reason why a new deal with europe has to follow this discredited template tariffs between the u s and europe are already low the atlantic alliance would lower them further not as an end in itself but as a means of reinforcing strategic ties and strengthening liberal values for american liberals a deal with europe could advance domestic progressive policies unlike the asian and latin american partners in past trade agreements european countries have labor and environmental standards that tend to be stronger than ours a deal if done right would curb greenhouse gas emissions and raise salaries it would create stronger antitrust rules to liberate entrepreneurs and it would crack down on the use of tax havens by multinational corporations and the ultrarich on both sides of the atlantic like any other trade deal it would increase economic growth but by making the u s and europe more equitable and prosperous it would protect both places from authoritarian countries and help defang the right wing nationalism tearing the west apart it makes imminent strategic sense for the u s to want this said wesley clark nato s former supreme allied commander everything we can do to pull the united states and europe closer together is essential the united states cannot deal effectively with china without the strong complete support of its european allies and right now the u s does not have that support but this is more than just a way to benefit western democracies the united states and the european union make up 45 percent of global gdp outside nations will have to raise their production standards for any goods they want traded as part of the agreement if they want to eventually join the deal they ll have to adopt these terms wholesale that could mean improved labor conditions for billions of workers and a united front on climate change in other words if done right this deal could save the world in the 1930s the international system exploded japan invaded china italy seized control of ethiopia and albania germany annexed czechoslovakia and occupied poland britain and france declared war on germany the deadliest conflict in human history had begun initially americans were reluctant to send troops to europe or the pacific so the united states responded using trade policy instead in a 1940 speech franklin delano roosevelt told americans that to save its allies the u s needed to become the great arsenal of democracy roosevelt then provided friendly powers with vital military and agricultural supplies at virtually no cost many allied leaders later credited these sales with saving their countries after roosevelt s death winston churchill referred to the president s decision as the most unselfish and unsordid financial act of any country in all history postwar liberals shared roosevelt s appreciation for the power of trade to promote democracy in 1947 new deal style policymakers established the havana charter a multilateral trade agreement that would have strengthened international labor rights and limited the power of major corporations and financiers but business interests opposed the deal and congress never ratified it the united states cannot deal effectively with china without the strong complete support of its european allies said wesley clark nato s former supreme allied commander and right now the u s does not have that support still over the next several decades the u s used trade to help rebuild the economies devastated by the war in a way that would prevent future conflict free trade helped japan grow rapidly and bound its economic fortunes closely to america s in europe the marshall plan made billions of dollars in aid contingent on greater economic cooperation and in 1949 congress declared that the policy of the people of the united states to encourage the unification of europe european governments grudgingly went along in 1950 french foreign minister robert schuman proposed that european nations pool coal and steel production so that war between france and germany would be not merely unthinkable but materially impossible four other european countries ended up joining the new european coal and steel community which allowed coal and steel and eventually other goods to travel freely across borders over the course of the next several decades more countries joined leading to the formation of what was eventually named the european union the marshall plan and the eu are perhaps the best examples of how economic policies and trade deals can advance growth security and democracy the marshall plan kickstarted the integration of europe while tying the bloc to the united states in an alliance against the soviet union the eu used economic ties and development spending to turn a continent riven by violent divisions into one of the most peaceful and prosperous places on earth it is an imperfect institution pushing business friendly policies at the expense of unions for example but scholars have found the incentive of eu membership turned many once communist countries into democracies it is proof that globalization can be a means to liberal democratic ends that of course is not the dominant narrative today we re in a retrenchment mode said edward alden a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and a trade expert i think the issue now is not how do trade agreements how does trade liberalization move forward i think the question is how far does it recede there are many things that motivated british and american voters to opt for brexit and trump racism and opposition to immigration were key as they have been in right wing victories throughout the world but economic skepticism of globalization shared by many on the left also played a role this is at least in part a reaction to post cold war trade agreements instead of treating increased interdependence as a means of advancing democracy and liberalism as the european coal and steel community once did these deals tend to serve the interests of multinational corporations consider the world trade organization arguably the most important international institution established since the cold war it has no labor or environmental requirements instead it was designed to liberalize capital flows as much as possible with little regard for avoiding harmful side effects individual trade agreements negotiated by the u s are hardly better many of these deals include investor state dispute settlement provisions the statutes that let companies undercut the regulations of sovereign countries rather than pushing for better labor rights or environmental standards the u s spends its negotiating capital on obtaining strong patent and copyright protections for u s pharmaceutical companies and media conglomerates like disney that s because multinational corporations are interested in shareholder returns not democracy and equality they want patent protections not pollution control they want to be able to source as much as possible from china and other low wage countries with lax environmental and labor standards and they have disproportionate power to push for these preferences through industry trade advisory committees corporations get to see classified negotiating texts and provide drafting suggestions current agreements set a ceiling a country cannot have stronger health financial stability environmental or other policy standards said lori wallach the director of public citizen s global trade watch but there is no floor so there s no rule that says if your food safety is truly miserable or if you have child labor or slave labor or no minimum wage it s kept out of global trade while far right parties did well in europe s 2019 parliamentary elections a variety of pro europe parties on the left made serious gains if a democrat wins the presidency there s reason to think she can work with the eu s combined majority of centrists and leftists that doesn t mean these deals don t have upsides military experts say that agreements like nafta and the never implemented trans pacific partnership increased or would have america s national security by drawing allies closer to the u s and away from hostile powers and there is evidence that post cold war trade deals have helped lift hundreds of millions of people in developing nations out of extreme poverty but research shows that trade deals have also had unsavory consequences a 2015 study by three prominent economists found that between 1999 and 2011 chinese imports alone cost the u s roughly one million manufacturing jobs nafta s impact on the u s economy is exceptionally complex but there is evidence that it has put downward pressure on the wages of non college educated workers this year several political scientists at the university of pittsburgh found that regions in europe that are highly exposed to trade are more likely to support right wing populists unfortunately the growing power of these populists makes cutting any kind of trade deal difficult the nation state is coming back to life said charles kupchan a professor of international affairs at georgetown university and the former senior director for european affairs on the obama administration s national security council this is not a moment when free trade is going to find a lot of adherents for european leaders crafting a deal with the u s is especially difficult because it entails negotiating with a country with weaker labor and environmental laws even french president macron europe s consummate centrist has expressed hesitation no european standard should be suppressed or lowered in the areas of environment health or food he said last fall but that doesn t mean the atlantic alliance would be impossible to pull off while far right parties did well in europe s 2019 parliamentary elections they didn t pick up as many seats as expected more importantly a variety of smaller pro europe parties on the left like the greens made serious gains meanwhile in the u s a 2018 pew survey found that 67 percent of democrats have positive views of free trade up from 53 percent in 2009 likely in reaction to trump s hostility to it if a democrat wins the presidency there s reason to think she can work with the eu s combined majority of centrists and leftists there are plenty of areas where liberal americans and europeans could establish a united front perhaps the most prominent is climate change macron s government has demanded that any nation signing a trade deal with the eu must also sign the paris agreement the next american administration should go even further and put the paris agreement in the new trade deal s text making lower tariffs conditional on saving the planet if you put things in that europeans care a lot about and like such as the paris climate agreement that would be a big deal said kupchan that would win back a lot of confidence in american leadership there s more that europeans and liberal americans could accomplish with the promise of lower tariffs their trade deal for example should require participating countries to set minimum labor standards and pay their citizens a livable minimum wage which would make the u s lift its own pay base the deal should also include strong antitrust provisions that would make the u s address its high levels of corporate concentration in both of these areas european law is more stringent than america s experts i spoke with also pointed to international tax evasion as an area ripe for u s eu collaboration it s become almost impossible to tax corporations because they are so mobile said alden of the council on foreign relations europe s efforts to deal with the problem have been frustrated by some of its own members while germany and france want to fight evasion tax haven states like ireland and luxembourg do not evasion then is an area where the united states could actually help europe if the united states were on board for a cooperative approach that could be put into a chapter of the trade agreement that might alter the internal politics in europe said robert howse a trade expert and international law professor at new york university this in turn would give major european powers an incentive to craft an agreement with the u s then there are reasons to cooperate on trade that are only indirectly related to american domestic politics the u s for example could make it easier for europe to access natural gas reducing its dependence on russia more importantly a trade deal with strict rules of origin would help the u s and europe establish a united front against china s mercantilist environmentally degrading and labor exploiting industrial practices together this would make the atlantic alliance far more popular than the corporate driven trade deals of the past there is after all something quite populist about a deal that binds countries to chasing down corporations that avoid taxes and then making them pay their fair share decades of interdependence helped bring unprecedented stability to the west the last twenty five years of globalization have eroded that promise and helped turn millions of people against it for the deal to accomplish these goals the atlantic alliance would need to be rigorously enforced and hard to reverse the most effective way to do that may be to put the rules into the implementing legislation codifying the deal s terms in european and american law in the case of the united states that means the implementing bill needs to make it through congress this may seem daunting but trade deals have a good legislative track record in part because they are often voted on under fast track authority when subject to fast track trade deals can t be filibustered and congress can t litigate their components all they can do is vote up or down if congress wants the economic growth that comes with trade deals and if business communities want freer access to european markets they will have to support whatever agreement the president produces tucking progressive causes into a trade deal is a double edged sword much like abolishing the filibuster conservatives could then use the same process to advance their own agenda but they already do to ratify the world trade organization for example the united states loosened its meat and poultry inspection standards and gave pharmaceutical companies three extra years of patent exclusivity on their medicines liberals shouldn t be afraid of also using this tool particularly for causes that require international solutions there s no way to fight climate change without commitments from the united states and it will be much harder for republicans to renege on those commitments if they re enshrined in a u s law that s essential to american economic growth even under the most favorable political circumstances the united states and europe will face obstacles in negotiating a deal agriculture is a major minefield the u s has long been frustrated by european labeling requirements meanwhile the u s historically hasn t entered into trade agreements that don t help its politically powerful agricultural industry but if american and european leaders are serious about saving international liberalism they ll have to make some tricky compromises decades of interdependence helped bring unprecedented stability to the west the last twenty five years of globalization have eroded that promise and helped turn millions of people against it trade and commercial policies that don t take into consideration any sort of impact on working people leads people to really distrust the system global trade watch s lori wallach said it s how we got trump it s an important part of how a bunch of these right wing movements are rising in europe what we need is the opposite a deal that fights income inequality environmental degradation and corporate concentration this would show middle class americans and europeans the upsides of interdependence and reduce the appeal of right wing populism if we have learned anything from the last few years it s that the forces behind this kind of populism are global in nature able to thrive in a wide variety of national soils the solution must therefore be global too illiberalism is simply too big and powerful to be stopped by any one state or even one region working with europe a continent full of democracies many our partners since the end of world war ii is the best place to start

rights and poor pay about 100 bicycle and motorcycle delivery workers for the rappi delivery service held a protest at the company s headquarters in bogotá on july 4 the workers known as rappitenderos demanded improvements to their labor rights and pay last october they held a protest over the same issues one of the most important rights demanded by the rappitenderos is for the company to bear responsibility in case of accidents they also want rappi to pay them more for their deliveries since the current rate of 3 000 colombian pesos less than a us dollar is inadequate the gathering spilled over into the street slowing traffic some of the protesters burned orange backpacks the business s characteristic symbol and a few threw rocks at the building rappi which has branches in argentina brazil chile colombia mexico peru and uruguay issued a statement denouncing the actions saying we are not going to permit the behavior of a few to affect the name of thousands of friendly and committed persons in offering a quality service to our customers rappi in the manner of ride services like uber and lyft promotes the fiction that their delivery workers are independent empresarios

former president cristina fernández de kirchner whose left justicialist party lost to macri s cambiemos alliance in 2015 the campaign season for the october elections has begun and both macri with his unpopular economic policies and kirchner who though running for vice president is seen as the power behind presidential candidate alberto fernández and is facing corruption and racketeering charges are seen as vulnerable this has prompted the entry of former economics minister roberto lavagna who postures as an alternative to kirchner and fernández united states valparaiso indiana factory

factor in the strike the raises our members have received the past two contracts don t even begin to cover the costs of their premiums gault told the northwest indiana times the workers and their families are not moving forward they re moving backwards the rhetoric from local 2018 appears to represent an about face by union officials after workers voted down the contract according to the company beloit vice president robert cherry said the union s decision to strike after weeks of bargaining and reaching an agreement which the union s leadership agreed was fair is disappointing we

revered value investor benjamin graham once said buy not on optimism but on arithmetic as the second half of the year gets underway here s the simple equation you need to keep in mind stock valuations are relatively high but corporate earnings are projected to decline for a second straight quarter analysts expect second quarter earnings per share eps of the s p 500 to show a blended year over year decline of 2 8 the negative projection follows a 0 29 eps decline in the first quarter an earnings recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of declines the consensus also calls for negative earnings growth in the third quarter however the forward 12 month price to earnings p e ratio of the s p 500 is currently 17 7 higher than the 10 year average of 14 6 the cyclically adjusted price to earnings cape ratio currently reads 30 3 compared to the median of 15 7 for now the bull market continues but amid this disconnect between valuations and earnings growth can the momentum last morgan stanley nyse ms this week downgraded global stocks and projected poor returns over the next year largely due to the trade war and softening corporate earnings morgan stanley s chief equity strategist predicts a 10 correction in the stock market during the third quarter unless the gap between high valuations and projected weak earnings can be bridged the stock market remains on shaky ground economic data on the docket for the coming week will provide clues see table historically money supply growth has exhibited a close correlation with stock price movements an increasing money supply

who have been praying for an interest rate cut this month you can expect the usual parsing of powell s words as well as the usual market overreaction read this story will the fed play santa in july the fed this year has signaled a more dovish stance although not enough to suit president trump unless powell indicates this week that another rate cut is in the bag and i don t think he will the

producers experts are expecting a wave of bankruptcies this year among these producers who apparently have forgotten the lessons of the past as energy volatility unnerves wall street the flight to safety will continue one classic safe haven that benefits is the utility sector utes get charged up the federal reserve s dovish pivot has been especially beneficial for utility stocks which thrive when interest rates are low with interest rates still at low levels and growth stocks overvalued high dividend utilities are an especially attractive hedge right now the utility sector has been on a tear so far this year and it s poised to continue outperforming when interest rates rise rate sensitive investments such as utility stocks favored by yield hungry investors typically face rough sledding that s chiefly because utilities need money for capital expenditures as rates rise their cost of capital increases and it weighs on their share prices moreover safer interest rate pegged investments such as u s treasuries become more attractive from a risk reward standpoint but economic growth that s only good and not great as we re currently experiencing is manna for utilities goldilocks growth not too hot not too cold is their sweet spot growth has been strong enough to sustain revenue and profits but insufficiently robust to prompt the fed to raise rates that s a lucky break for utilities as well as the broader market because otherwise the 10 year bull market is on weak legs as mentioned above it s a bad sign that we re experiencing weak corporate earnings in the context of high stock valuations in fact actual corporate earnings reports so far have been worse than expected with 21 of s p 500 companies or 4 2 having already reported results actual reported eps is down 14 1 from a year ago a major reason cited by corporate management is the trade war that the u s is waging against well against almost everybody it s not just china when peaceful democratic

china is now pakistan s largest creditor sharp revenue increases to continue for three years utility rates to be adjusted every quarter power tariff hike in august fund wants full fatf compliance islamabad pakistan has entered a high tax environment for the foreseeable future with rs1 56 trillion additional taxes this year followed by another rs1 5tr next year and yet another rs1 31tr the year after according to a staff report released by the interna tional monetary fund imf on monday read imf approves 6 billion loan for pakistan the agreement signed with the imf by adviser to the prime minister on finance abdul hafeez shaikh and state bank of pakistan governor reza baqir also requires an increase in electricity tariff again in august this year and ensures rs1 3tr refunds from the provinces out of the national finance commission share to honour its commitments with the imf the projections contained in the document show that the authorities have promised to increase fbr s total tax collection from rs3 94tr last year to rs5 5tr this year and to rs10 5tr by 2023 24 a cumulative increase of rs6 564tr in five years as such the tax to gdp ratio is forecast to soar to 15 3 per cent from 10 4pc this year speaking to the press via conference call held on monday evening imf mission chief for pakistan ernesto ramirez rigo said the government was expected to ensure this increase came from broadening the base rather than raising tax rates read what the imf numbers say on the foreign exchange front pakistan has to climb out of a deep hole over the programme period show the projections contained the document where net reserves are estimated to be negative 17 7 billion at the end of june they are projected to come in negative 10 8bn by the end of the current fiscal year on this basis the programme aims to take foreign exchange reserves from 6 824bn this fiscal year to 11 187bn next year equal to 1 4 months of imports this year to 2 2 months of imports next year the data contained in the document also shows that china has now become the largest holder of pakistani debt of the 85 482bn in total external debt and liabilities of the government slightly over one quarter of it at 21 891bn is owed to china through a combination of bilateral and commercial loans the fund programme requires pakistan to repay up to 37 359bn on its external debt by the end of the programme of which nearly 40pc at 14 682bn will be paid to china the commercial component of debt owed to china is to be brought to zero by the programme end whereas the bilateral debt will be reduced from 15 155bn today to 7 946 by the programme end the government has also given an undertaking to privatise at least seven small state run entities in the short run and rollout by september 2020 a complete roadmap for the remaining entities that will detail which ones are to be privatised and which ones to be improved upon the authorities have given an undertaking to the imf that pakistan had received firm commitments from china saudi arabia and the uae to keep rolling over their existing loans over the course of the programme in the conference call from washington dc mr rigo said the country would need to improve a number of laws including those relating to sbp s independence debt limitation money laundering terror financing soe s governance and so on responding to a question he said the government did not have a majority in the upper house of parliament and would therefore need to work on consensus with other parties reading the imf programme the government committed that the current year s budget had set rolling a decisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt and build resilience that would be supported by comprehensive efforts to drastically improve revenue mobilisation both at the federal and provincial levels and generate 4 5 percentage points of gdp in additional tax revenue the imf agreed that these measures will place general government debt on a declining path reaching 67pc of gdp by fy2024 after peaking at 80 5pc in fy2020 the authorities also committed with the imf that they would keep on removing tax exemptions and preferential treatments in the tax system and broaden the tax base and over time transform gst into a broad based value added tax vat they said the gst exemptions would end in the near future except for basic food and medicines to significantly improve revenues greater inter provincial harmonisation and coordination of gst will also simplify filing procedures and increase compliance in addition other tax policy measures include further strengthening taxation on real estate and on agricultural turnover or income by the provinces ensuring equivalent taxation of all sources of income and eliminating distortionary withholding taxes the government said it had signed a formal written agreement with the provinces on the fiscal strategy and the required provincial surpluses including revenue and fiscal surplus targets by province for fy2020 and implications in case of missed targets it said the progress toward these goals would be assessed in quarterly meetings of the fiscal coordination committee whose legal basis would be strengthened to make its decisions binding under this agreement the provinces will deliver surpluses of around 1pc of gdp in fy2020 gradually increasing them to 2 7pc by the end of the programme by saving the additional revenues generated through tax policy and administration reforms to support these efforts the provinces will aim to increase collection of property and sales taxes and to assume more spending responsibility the government has also promised that as part of ongoing dialogue on the national finance commission award the federal and

athens with a quiet handshake at the door of maximos mansion on a tree lined street in central athens alexis tsipras ceded the office of prime minister on monday to the new democracy leader kyriakos mitsotakis it was the kind of uneventful handover of power that heralded greece s return to normality after being ground zero of one of the most tumultuous periods in global economic history the election victory on sunday by a traditional center right party was the end of greece s flirtation with radical left wing populist politics even as the radicals of mr tsipras s syriza party transformed themselves into a mainstream force of the center left the tsipras experiment may hold important lessons for europe and its new ranks of anti establishment populists while many as in italy gleefully thumb their noses at the european union and its rules once in power the risks of following through on their rebelliousness may corral them from the extremes
financial markets are eagerly awaiting the beginning of the fed s easing cycle while the us economy enters the 11th year in the current expansion global economic slowdown worries a neverending trade war and deflationary pressures have the fed poised to deliver an insurance cut this month and possibly more in the following meetings to ensure a soft landing the most anticipated event of the week is fed chair powell s two days of testimony on capitol hill despite a robust labor market the us economy is slowing down as global growth concerns remain elevated as trade tensions show no immediate signs of easing equities could fall under pressure if powell commits to only one rate cut and if he is content on waiting to see if inflation continues to stabilize and if the risks to the economy

negotiations over the phone in what is expected to shortly yield an in person meeting both sides are politically motivated to wrap this up china initially thought they would be better waiting out

the 2020 defense budget will be the most important defense budget of the trump administration the 2020 budget request is the first one fully developed by the trump team it is also the first to be fully informed by the january 2018 national defense strategy nds ref this budget must also contend with the final two years of the spending caps mandated by the 2011 budget control act bca which cover fiscal years fys 2020 and 2021 ref in great measure the 2020 budget will determine the destiny of the military rebuild championed by president donald trump and by congress as it currently stands due to budget increases from fy 2017 to fy 2019 the military has seen gains in readiness but the rebuild is far from a completed task every service has expressed the imperative to increase in size and in capabilities in order to counter great power competition described in the national defense strategy the 2020 defense budget represents the fork in the road for the military rebuild and for the viability of the defense strategy the national defense authorization act ndaa for fy 2020 will be a clear signal of how congress intends to shape the resources that will define the military s effort and direction as the old maxim goes a strategy without resources is nothing but a wish the state of the military rebuild since taking office president trump has placed an emphasis on rebuilding the military which led to increased defense budgets the 2017 request for additional appropriations targeted maintenance shortfalls ref and the bipartisan budget act bba of 2018 offered substantial boosts to the resources dedicated to defending the nation ref nonetheless rebuilding the military is not a simple equation in which taxpayers dollars are automatically transformed into a ready force it takes time for increased resources to produce increased readiness and a larger force there is a considerable lag time between the input of resources and the output of increased readiness lethality or force it took multiple years for the readiness cracks to start showing and by the same token it will take years for these cracks to disappear the heritage foundation s index of u s military strength evaluates the changes in the capacity capability and readiness of each military service over the previous year ref measurements are on a five point scale that ranges from very weak to very strong with marginal being the middle option the 2019 edition started to show some of the effects of increased resources the army s readiness increased from weak to strong the navy saw increases in its capability from weak to marginal due to investments in seamanship skills these gains are part of a rebuilding process that is slow fragile and requires consistent funding the previous secretary of defense james mattis described the need for continued effort and attention in 2017 when discussing the department of defense s dod s budget s i mentioned in my opening remarks we didn t get into this situation in one year we re not going to get out of it in one year and i recognize that congress has a responsibility to raise armies and sustain navies but we can t do in one year or put a marker down in one year it s unrealistic and i mentioned that we re going to have to have sustained growth f y 19 to 2023 and this is you ll see the biggest growth army air force and navy showing up as we re still digging ourselves out of a readiness operation and maintenance hole ref the 2020 ndaa represents a pivotal opportunity that will help determine the future of our current effort to rebuild the military both former secretary mattis and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph dunford expressed that the military needs between 3 percent and 5 percent above inflation budget growth between 2018 and 2023 ref the military was able to achieve that growth in 2018 and in 2019 it will require similar growth in order to be able to keep up with the current demands placed on our military by the national defense strategy the 2019 fiscal year in many ways fy 2019 fueled by the bba ref was an exception to the current budgetary problems and delays both the defense authorization and defense appropriation legislation were signed by the president before the start of the fiscal year the budgetary process worked in the timeline that it is supposed to work the john s mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 was presented to the president for signature on august 3 2018 the president signed it on august 13 ref which was the earliest it had been signed since 1978 ref the defense appropriations bill was presented to the president for signature on september 27 2018 and signed the next day ref the passage of both these pieces of legislation before the end of the fiscal year on september 30 2018 is on its face a simple achievement after all it means that congress was capable of following the plan that it outlined for itself for a fiscal year nonetheless it is a major departure from the norm since 2010 every single fiscal year has started under a continuing resolution a temporary mechanism designed to give congress more time to negotiate its annual budget while keeping the budgetary status quo for the federal agencies it is a process that has considerable negative impacts on the dod especially when it comes to efficient contracting for goods and services and the development of new materiel programs ref the pressures in 2020 in many ways the budgetary arguments and legislation for fy 2019 were an exception that is unlikely to happen again in fy 2020 as a matter of fact the 2020 budget has some unique pressures which compound the challenge of an on time budget the coming fiscal year s defense budget cannot count on the benefits experienced in 2019 mainly because of the re imposition of the bca budget cap for defense similar to other years in which the caps were renegotiated it is likely that congress will modify the spending levels for fy 2020 and 2021 however the budget outlook is already unsustainable and it is critical that congress offset any new spending without increasing the debt there are at least two ways to do this first congress could reduce non defense spending by an equal amount to any the proposed defense increase second congress could offset any new spending over the next 10 years using mandatory savings a second pressure is a scheduled transfer of overseas contingency operations oco funds which are exempt from the bca caps to the base dod budget which is not ref the dod had previously announced plans to transfer 49 billion from oco to the base budget in order to align the usage of these funds with its reality ref regardless of the proper account where expenditures should be the important political difference is that whatever amount the dod decides to transfer to the base budget will have to be accounted for in the bca cap otherwise it will be effectively reducing the defense budget a third pressure is the high deficit experienced in fy 2018 which further added to the country s mounting debt the rising debt is a threat not only to the defense budget but to the whole country since it has the potential to slow down the economic growth substantially and to eventually consume all federal government expenditures ref therefore it will be very important to balance all the priorities of the federal budget in order to put the government on a better financial footing breaking the bca firewall under the bca defense and non defense spending are each capped in separate categories rather than one aggregate total this firewall splits the overall discretionary funding allocation between defense and non defense and under the law each are governed by separate limits defense and non defense spending were designed to share an equal proportion of the cuts imposed by the bca a concept termed parity this parity is arbitrary and a political construct that is no longer relevant ref the original bca cuts had a disproportionately negative impact on the national defense budget since 2011 it has also led to irresponsible spending increases national defense is a core constitutional function and the levels set by the bca were too low to fully and properly fund the military this has been the impetus for three separate budget deals passed by congress to increase defense spending however in order to increase defense spending some congressional leaders have demanded an increase in unrelated non defense spending in order to maintain parity ref in total base non defense spending has increased by more than 200 billion since 2013 the president s and house budget proposals have consistently called for the elimination of the firewall between defense and non defense spending ref congress and president trump already departed from this construct in the may 2017 funding bill which provided 16 5 billion more for defense than for non defense ref lawmakers need to continue making progress in prioritizing defense needs over domestic programs congress s goal in budgeting responsibly should be to focus on key constitutional responsibilities such as national defense within existing spending controls congress should revise the current bca structure to eliminate the firewall between defense and non defense spending permanently this will give congress greater flexibility to adjust national defense spending without the need for a statutory change each year a wide variety of cuts could be made to domestic programs and through budget process reforms to offset increases to defense spending the president and congress could also generate billions of dollars in savings by passing a rescissions package and eliminating budget gimmicks which inflate domestic spending each year this would provide more transparency within the budget process and leave less leeway for lawmakers to abuse these designations or use them in non intended ways ref the national defense strategy the release of the national defense strategy in january 2018 marked the beginning of a change of focus from terrorism and counterterrorism operations to great power competition ref in order to actually shift the emphasis toward great power competition the dod must be able to properly invest in the defense of the country the strategy explains that the budget must be sustained and predictable in order to empower the dod to make the necessary investments to maintain the competitive distance between the united states and russia and china this is the reason why the navy and heritage foundation researchers have discussed the importance of increasing the size of the fleet ref it is why the air force has discussed its plans to increase its squadrons by 74 24 percent with the goal of reaching 386 squadrons ref as the index of u s military strength has highlighted since its inaugural edition in 2015 the american military is only marginally ready to engage in two simultaneous major regional contingencies ref index scoring is based on the concept that the united states should size its forces to be able to engage in two major regional contingencies simultaneously and still have a reserve capacity ref it is the enduring measure of what a superpower should be able to execute it is also reflective of the guidance of the national defense strategy to be ready for great power competition with both russia and china the construct driven by the assessment in the index of u s military strength and the national defense strategy requires the country to invest in both rebuilding and expanding its military it is the path that the 2018 and the 2019 defense budgets began some of the gains observed by the military have already shown in the 2019 edition of the index ref nonetheless these readiness gains are ethereal and require consistent and constant maintenance in this sense the military rebuild is at a very fragile moment at which the dod and congress need to assure proper levels of resourcing national defense strategy commission on november 13 2018 the national defense strategy commission released its assessment of the defense strategy ref the bipartisan commission was directed by the 2017 ndaa and was tasked with providing an independent assessment of the national defense strategy ref the commission generally agreed with the direction of the defense strategy but it highlights multiple shortcomings of the strategy mainly the lack of definition of means and the current resource shortcomings ref the commission questions whether the dod has the plans and concepts necessary to meet the challenges outlined by the national defense strategy especially when it comes to engaging in long term near peer competition against china and russia further the commission endorses the 3 percent to 5 percent annual real growth to the dod s budget necessary to meet the threats articulated in the defense strategy budget growth that is not currently planned ref the bipartisan nature of the commission s report reflects that there is still a bipartisan consensus on the threats that the united states faces and on the requirements these threats impose in its report the commission lays out a clear case that there is currently a mismatch between the threats and ambitions outlined in the national defense strategy and the current budgetary plans of the dod and that closing that gap will require more resources and better planning congress has a substantial role to play in realigning the strategy with the resources available to the pentagon realigning with the strategy starts with the topline budget but it permeates every aspect of the ndaa as stated by thomas spoehr director of the center for national defense at the heritage foundation for those seeking to the truth about our defense needs the nds commission s report should serve as an authoritative reference ref in order to build on the gains from the previous two years the ndaa for fy 2020 needs to be designed to continue rebuilding the military and should reflect the recommendations outlined in this special report the topline the federal government has a constitutional mandate to provide for the common defense ref as such it is crucial that congress ensure that the department of defense has the resources to meet the threats that the country faces sufficient funding does not guarantee that the country will be able to meet all threats but insufficient funding guarantees that it will not the authors of this special report detail 57 specific recommendations for rebuilding the military and preparing it for great power competition recommendation 1 increase the discretionary base budget 050 to 697 billion for 2020 the base budget increase is necessary to continue the process of rebuilding the military s capacity capability and readiness it is an important step to show both internal and external audiences that the country is committed to its national defense strategy and to addressing the great power competition that it outlines it is a 5 percent growth over the base topline recommended by heritage foundation experts for 2019 ref recommendation 2 set the overseas contingency operations oco account at 45 billion for 2020 the oco account must be set at a level that supports overseas operations while reducing the reliance on the account for base budget expenditures at 45 billion in 2020 the account will be in a downward trajectory enabling a transition away from relying on the oco account to fund enduring expenses it is important that enduring expenses are represented in the base budget ref the level of funding recommended in this special report would amount to 742 billion for defense in fy 2020 the increase is balanced with other federal budget priorities in order to create a sustainable fiscal direction for the country ref the four military services each of the services is facing unique challenges in how to re orient its current force structure to great power competition and set priorities accordingly additionally there is the important discussion of how to establish a service responsible for space the recommendations in this section detail how each service should prepare for the future and how congress can help the army the army is struggling with two major dilemmas as it enters fy 2020 insufficient size and an anemic modernization program both deserve the attention of congress in the 2020 ndaa in terms of size chief of staff of the army general mark milley has testified that the army is too small to meet wartime requirements we need to be bigger and stronger and more capable ref in june 2018 army secretary dr mark esper while outlining his priorities stated we must grow the regular army above 500 000 soldiers with associated growth in the guard and reserve and we must recruit and retain the very best ref recommendation 3 congress should direct the army to establish an additional armored brigade combat team abct by 2022 this additional abct would be the 12th regular army abct bringing the total of regular army bcts from 31 to 32 in 2019 the army will only field 31 active brigade combat teams 19 below the 50 we assess is required to meet a two major regional contingency mrc requirement ref some critics question the need for a two mrc force the administration s own 2018 national defense strategy does not fully embrace a two mrc construct calling instead for a force capable of defeating aggression by a major power deterring opportunistic aggression elsewhere and disrupting imminent terrorist and wmd threats ref but the bipartisan national defense strategy commission composed of distinguished national security experts unanimously concluded that a two war force sizing construct makes more strategic sense today than at any previous point in the post cold war era ref furthermore the national defense strategy does not explain how the u s could hope to deter opportunistic aggression without the ability to actually fight a second conflict thus the assessment by heritage defense analysts remains that the army needs a two mrc force of 50 bcts and should gradually increase its number of regular army bcts from 31 to 32 recommendation 4 congress should authorize the increase in size of the regular army by 5 000 soldiers to 492 500 soldiers in the 2020 ndaa in the 2019 ndaa congress authorized 4 000 additional soldiers for the regular army bringing the total authorized regular army end strength to 487 500 the army national guard remained unchanged at 343 500 and the army reserve at 199 500 the 2020 ndaa should continue to increase the size of the regular army in order to put it on a firm path to an adequately sized and ready force and congress should authorize more than 500 000 additional soldiers by 2022 the same year the army aims to have achieved its readiness goals ref recommendation 5 congress should closely examine the factors that contribute to the army s and other service s inability to attract volunteers congress should then increase targeted incentives for volunteering for military service recommendation 6 congress should convene a hearing on recruiting problems and demand detailed recommendations from the dod to increase the effectiveness of recruiting programs recruiting sufficient volunteers to meet this higher end strength will not be easy in 2018 the army fell short of its recruiting goals by 6 500 recruits while record low unemployment does make recruiting more difficult that is far from the only reason for the shortfall today 71 percent of americans ages 17 to 24 are ineligible for military service due to obesity poor health or lack of a high school diploma ref propensity and willingness to serve is also declining perhaps in part due to a growing distance between the u s military and the american public congress should be concerned that the challenge that the army had in achieving its recruiting goals in 2018 is the proverbial canary in the coal mine that might signal the beginning of an ever increasingly difficult period for military recruiting overall recommendation 7 in the face of anticipated industry pushback congress should underwrite the army s funding cuts for legacy platform upgrades and other program decrements in favor of investments in next generation technology turning to modernization programs the army has implemented several changes to deliver a modernized force the activation of the army futures command on august 24 2018 was perhaps the most visible of these changes ref the intent behind the army futures command is to achieve better unity of command and execution for army modernization the army has also established six modernization priorities and nine cross functional teams to manage these priorities to its credit the army has also reportedly moved 25 billion for the next five years 2020 through 2024 from lower priority programs which are not focused on the six modernization priorities to higher priority programs such as long range precision fire systems ref these cuts of roughly 4 billion to 5 billion per year in existing lower priority programs are likely to cause immediate industry consternation and subsequent congressional concern to find these amounts of money the army will likely have had to cut into large programs such as the combat vehicle upgrades abrams m1a2 sepv3 bradley a2a4 and armored multipurpose vehicle and helicopter modernization chinook ch 47f and blackhawk uh 60m additionally the army will not be able to enter into procurement for any of its new systems long range precision fire systems next generation combat vehicles or future vertical lift the plan for helicopter development until 2021 at the earliest thus there will be the near term pain of program cuts and eliminations without the immediate procurement of new systems to compensate for the losses in work recommendation 8 congress should authorize the accelerated procurement of no fewer than 4 000 joint light tactical vehicles jltvs in 2020 for the army because of the anticipated shift in army modernization from procurement of legacy upgrades to next generation systems this special report does not contain recommendations on quantities of major platforms for procurement in the 2020 ndaa except for the jltv the jltv is achieving success and meeting all milestones and is urgently needed by the army and the marine corps a full rate production decision on the jltv is expected in 2019 ref congress should continue its strong support for this program despite the fact that the army procurement objective is currently 49 099 jltvs in its 2019 budget request the army only projected procuring 3 035 jltvs in 2020 ref at this rate it will take 16 years to complete the program an unacceptably long time the navy the increased funding that congress provided in fy 2017 and fy 2018 allowed the navy to support greater surface ship operational proficiency ship and aviation depot maintenance aviation spares and flying hours and to purchase additional ships and aircraft to increase fleet size the navy has also done a good job of increasing its end strength to support a growing fleet as well as correcting manning shortfalls on its ships although these larger defense appropriations have already helped to turn the tide of navy readiness and modernization it will take years to restore complete readiness and decades to increase fleet capacity and field the new capabilities needed to execute the 2018 national defense strategy rebuilding a navy capable of winning this new long term strategic competition requires a balance of resources to fund new ships and aircraft sustain research and development r d funding to properly mature and field new capabilities improve readiness through more training and maintenance and increase personnel and infrastructure to properly support the current and much bigger future fleet as the recently released report from the national defense strategy commission recommends the united states needs a larger force than it has today if it is to meet the objectives of the strategy the navy must expand its submarine fleet and dramatically recapitalize and expand its military sealift forces ref the fy 2018 ndaa established a fleet of not fewer than 355 battle force ships ref as the official u s policy coupled with the navy s recent fleet readiness issues also point to the need for a much larger and more capable fleet even with the additional readiness funding provided by congress and the additional 1 778 public shipyard workers hired in fy 2018 the number of days of depot maintenance delays for aircraft carriers surface ships and submarines all increased in fy 2018 ref admiral john richardson chief of naval operations testified before the senate armed services committee that it would take until 2021 or 2022 to restore fleet readiness to an acceptable level and that the continued lack of stable and adequate funding would delay these efforts ref the reality of the time required to modernize aging public shipyards hire and train new shipyard workers and reduce the backlog of ship depot maintenance while addressing current maintenance demands dictates that there is no quick fix solution to navy readiness recommendation 9 increase the navy s end strength the navy successfully recruited 6 000 personnel in fy 2018 and surpassed its end strength goal of 327 900 the navy must still add more than 14 900 additional sailors by fy 2023 to meet the personnel demands of expanding the fleet to 355 ships and eliminating manning gaps a recent study by the government accountability office gao found that even with the efforts to reduce insufficient manning on its ships the sailors on u s navy ships based in japan still work more than 100 hours a week to meet all their watch standing maintenance and training requirements ref congress should therefore authorize the navy to increase its end strength by an additional 5 000 sailors in fy 2020 to a size of 340 400 recommendation 10 increase fleet size and acquire 11 new ships in fy 2020 the navy s fleet size currently at 287 ships remains significantly below the navy s revised fleet requirement of 355 ships as well as heritage defense analysts 400 ship two mrc recommendation ref on november 27 2018 assistant secretary of the navy for research development and acquisition james geurts testified that the navy s shipbuilding plan coupled with service life extensions of the entire class of arleigh burke destroyers will accelerate achieving a 355 ship navy from the 2050s to the year 2034 ref congress should authorize and fully fund the acquisition of 11 battle force ships in fy 2020 two block v virginia class attack submarines two flight iii arleigh burke class guided missile destroyers the first future frigate ffg x one san antonio class flight ii amphibious ship two lewis class oilers one expeditionary sea base and two towing salvage and rescue ships this number would provide one ship above the navy s shipbuilding plan for fy 2020 and would leverage industrial base capacity to help reduce the logistic ship deficit recommendation 11 increase naval aviation capacity navy must have 10 operational carrier air wings by 2025 congress should fully fund and authorize the acquisition of the following manned and unmanned aircraft in fy 2020 16 f 35c joint strike fighters 24 f a 18e f strike fighters four e 2d airborne early warning aircraft nine p 8a maritime patrol aircraft and three mq 4c triton maritime surveillance aircraft in addition congress should fully fund the engineering manufacturing and development of the mq 25 carrier launched unmanned refueling aircraft prototype to ensure that it meets the navy s goal of first flight in 2021 recommendation 12 maximize shipyard capacity to eliminate the attack submarine maintenance backlog even with the additional funding for maintenance in fy 2017 and fy 2018 attack submarines suffered an increased number of days of maintenance delays in fy 2018 public shipyards will be unlikely to meet the demands of ship depot maintenance for the next several years the navy has stated that it is developing a 30 year ship repair and modernization plan to more effectively forecast and efficiently schedule ship maintenance ref the navy should therefore work with private shipyards to plan additional depot maintenance availabilities in fy 2020 to most efficiently balance the demands of submarine maintenance and construction of new submarines recommendation 13 fund service life extensions for six additional attack submarines vice admiral william merz testified before the senate armed services committee on november 27 that the navy is evaluating the potential for an additional six los angeles class submarine service life extensions using available reactor cores beyond the one funded in fy 2019 ref assistant secretary of the navy for research development and acquisition james geurts recently testified that the most looming shortfall in terms of capacity is in attack submarines ref the navy s requirement for attack submarines is 66 yet the current fleet only has 51 attack submarines extending the life of an additional six submarines would change the valley of the attack submarine force from 42 in 2028 to 45 in 2026 ref the navy and congress should fund the service life extension of a second los angeles class attack submarine in fy 2020 and develop a plan to refuel an additional five los angeles class submarines over the next 10 years depending on public and private shipyard capacity recommendation 14 provide funding for the columbia class ballistic missile submarine program congress and the dod should provide the navy with funding for advanced procurement and r d for the columbia class ballistic missile submarine to ensure that the nation s number one priority defense program remains on schedule for its first strategic deterrent patrol in 2031 providing the navy with additional shipbuilding funding would also prevent the columbia class program from adversely affecting the navy s ability to build other much needed ships such as combat fleet logistics ships frigates and attack submarines recommendation 15 fully fund the navy s shipyard optimization plan the navy s shipyard optimization plan is a 20 year plan for public shipyard infrastructure modernization to improve obsolete dry docks and production facilities conditions and layout and to replace aging equipment ref this modernization is critical to reducing current ship maintenance backlogs as well as meeting the maintenance needs of a much larger future fleet the estimated cost for the navy is approximately 21 billion over 20 years well above the navy s historical infrastructure budget and will negatively affect other readiness and acquisition programs if the navy does not receive additional funding in fy 2020 and beyond recommendation 16 fund naval aviation maintenance to 100 percent of the requirement the navy was only able to support aviation maintenance at 92 percent of the projected requirement in fy 2019 due to limited spare parts and a too small maintenance workforce the secretary of defense tasked the navy with achieving 80 percent strike fighter squadron mission capable readiness by the end of fy 2019 even with implemented improvements to the navy s aviation enterprise in fy 2018 which have resulted in f a 18 hornet readiness levels increasing from 31 percent in 2017ref to a mission capable rate of 49 percent by december 2018 ref achieving the secretary of defense s 80 percent mission capable goal by the end of the fiscal year will be a significant challenge the navy must plan and fund aviation maintenance to 100 percent of the projected requirement in fy 2020 and beyond to achieve and maintain acceptable strike fighter force readiness recommendation 17 fully fund research and development congress should fully fund the r d required in fy 2020 to complete initial design studies to support contract awards for the following new ship classes in fy 2023 large surface combatant large unmanned surface vehicle future small auxiliary and future large auxiliary common hull auxiliary multi mission platform additionally congress should ensure that the navy fully funds the development and fielding of critical new weapons capabilities such as an offensive hypersonic missile the surface navy laser weapon system the snakehead large displacement unmanned undersea vehicle the orca extra large unmanned undersea vehicle the mq 25 stingray unmanned aerial refueling aircraft and the electromagnetic railgun these new capabilities are crucial for addressing the growing threats from similar weapons systems that strategic competitors such as china and russia are fielding the chief of naval operations design for maintaining maritime superiority version 2 0 ref has tasked the fleet with fielding several of these new capabilities no later than 2025 ref if this deadline is to be met congress will need to fully fund the r d phase of these systems the marine corps like the other services the marine corps is under immense budgetary pressure to balance the multiple demands of current readiness sustain repeated operational rotations with a smaller force modernize or replace its aging equipment and prepare for the future it is well short of the size it needs to be to handle historically consistent operational tasks much less the new requirements that have arisen such as its contributions to the marine corps forces special operations command marsoc nearly 3 000 marines and the establishment of marine corps forces cyberspace command marforcyber an increase in funding for the marine corps enabled it to make gains in readiness reducing backlogged maintenance replenishing inventories of parts and returning broken equipment to operational status that helped units and individuals such as pilots to do more training the budget for fy 2019 should sustain needed levels of support it will be vitally important for the 2020 ndaa to continue this trend since readiness in particular is fragile it must constantly be attended to and force competency and capacity depends on a stable flow of funding recommendation 18 increase marine corps end strength at present the corps remains too small for the tasks assigned to it its operating forces are still dealing with a deployment to dwell ratio of approximately 1 to 2 meaning seven months deployed and 14 months at home this wears out the force both personnel and equipment the marine corps currently has an authorized end strength of 186 100 which should be increased over time to a minimum of 194 000 and ideally to just over 200 000 in 2011 it was 202 000 the corps has stated that it can responsibly increase the service by an additional 3 000 marines per year and it should do so in 2020 ref the increase would amount to an authorized end strength of 189 100 in 2020 a larger corps will make it possible to reduce the current deployment burden decrease high operational usage for any one piece of equipment or individual thus extending the life of the item or person and enable proper training education and preparation that ensures greater resilience of the force further growth of new capabilities such as marsoc and marforcyber under the funding ceiling imposed by the bca has come at the expense of standard operational units such as infantry battalions which numbered 27 for many years but have fallen to 24 and aviation squadrons worsening the deployment burden borne by the fewer remaining units recommendation 19 fully fund marine corps modernization programs congress should fully fund key modernization programs such as for the amphibious combat vehicle acv intended to augment and eventually replace the vietnam era assault amphibious vehicle aav and the corps aviation modernization plan for which the 2020 ndaa should include the funding needed to accelerate procurement of f 35 and ch 53k aircraft the acv program is finally underway with a contractor selected this past summer to produce the acv 1 1 this should receive congress s full support as the aav is approaching half a century in age in fact the corps decided to stop a survivability enhancement program for the aav determining that funding would be better used for the acv ref for its aviation portfolio the corps decision to pursue an all f 35 fleet meant that it declined to join the navy in purchasing the super hornet the latest version of the f a 18 leaving it with rapidly aging hornets and increasing the importance of fielding the f 35 as quickly as possible similarly the corps ability to move and sustain ground forces that have become heavier due to the evolving need for additional armor on the modern battlefield means the ch 53k is now essential for battlefield mobility the 2020 ndaa should account for both conditions modern aviation assets in both fixed and rotary wing fleets in its support of marine corps warfighting capabilities recommendation 20 examine marine corps air defense capabilities the marine corps has minimal short range air defense capabilities largely limited to two battalions of air defense units that employ the fim 92 stinger a short range low altitude man portable surface to air missile that can also be employed from various vehicle mounted systems this minimal capability has not been a problem since the end of the cold war as u s military engagements dealt with irregular and terrorist opponents who lacked any offensive air capabilities but as the national defense strategy has highlighted the military must prepare itself for potential combat against major powers that will field advanced offensive air forces the 2020 ndaa should include a provision that calls on the marine corps to explain how it intends to protect its forces from such threats recommendation 21 investigate marine corps airborne electronic warfare capabilities with the ea 6b prowler completing its last operational deployment in november 2018 ref the marine corps has no organic electronic warfare aircraft and will have to rely on the u s navy s ea 18g growlers the national defense strategy makes the case that the return of great power competition will require the u s military to prepare for combat against major states with the full range of modern warfighting capabilities this will include advanced electronic warfare and the use of platforms weapons and systems that exploit the electromagnetic spectrum for both offense and defense the 2020 ndaa should include a provision that calls on the corps to explain how it intends to provide sufficient electronic warfare support comparable to what was provided by the ea 6b recommendation 22 assess marine corps operational concepts in relationship to modernization programs the marine corps regularly publishes its thinking on future combat and implications for the tactics techniques organizations and capabilities usually manifested in equipment and how it will be used it will need to succeed on future battlefields the marine corps operating concept ref littoral operations in a contested environment ref and expeditionary advanced base operationsref all posit a combat environment that will feature opponents wielding advanced military capabilities weapons sensors and platforms across all domains and energy spectrums and thus require the corps to operate more dispersed with less signature and more nimbly ref this implies that marine corps acquisition programs and capability portfolios will likely need to change however current programs and portfolios were initiated years ago and do not seem to have been influenced by the corps new thinking the 2020 ndaa should include a provision that calls for the corps to explain how its new concepts are affecting or will affect its program going forward recommendation 23 call on the corps to explain alignment of marine corps concepts and efforts with the navy s shipbuilding program as noted in the recommendation 23 the corps is developing new concepts that have substantial implications for the capabilities it will need in the coming years especially those fielded by the u s navy these include the ships at sea and ship to shore connectors and supporting aviation platforms manned and unmanned and weapons systems that the navy will use to support marine corps operations in a naval campaign the navy s 30 year shipbuilding planref is heavily skewed toward aircraft carriers destroyers and submarines though it does include plans for a 38 ship amphibious fleet however the amphibious ships are large multifunctional platforms that are nearly identical to those that have been acquired since the 1980s albeit with more modern systems the 2020 ndaa should include a provision calling upon the marine corps to explain how it is working with the navy to develop the naval capabilities needed to execute the concepts it is developing and the extent to which current navy aviation and shipbuilding programs reflect such planning the air force during the air force association s 2018 annual conference secretary of the air force heather wilson announced the results of a study to determine how large the air force needs to be in order to meet a national defense strategy that directs the services to prepare for strategic competition with china and russia ref the study revealed that the service needs 74 additional operational squadrons including at least 15 additional tankers 50 bombers 182 fighters and 210 refueling aircraft than it currently has in its inventory when asked if any of these aircraft would be legacy platforms such as fourth generation fighters secretary wilson responded that the new aircraft would be fifth generation fighter and bombers and the kc 46 while the specifics of that study have yet to be revealed few could rightly question the capacity and capability shortfalls spelled out by secretary wilson filling the cockpits of those aircraft will require at least 900 additional pilots who are currently not on the air force roster couple that with the 2 000 pilot shortfall the service is now experiencing and a picture of the lagging nature of every other training pipeline for almost every air force specialty comes into view as the air force moves to fill the airframe capacity shortfall it must find ways to grow accelerate or compress respective training pipelines to meet the needs spelled out by the secretary recommendation 24 increase air force end strength in fy 2020 by 4 000 to 333 100 new airmen billets will be filled as recruiting capacity and training pipelines expand but graduation rates across the spectrum of air force career fields need to accelerate to meet the need gaining the end strength required to manifest the secretary s vision is critically important and in light of the u s army falling short of its 2018 requiting goal it must be done methodically yet if the air force is to be ready for a full out war with a near peer competitor in the 2020s accepting further delay in accelerating the pipeline for most career fields can no longer be tolerated in 2021 the air force should be further increased to 337 100 airmen ref and to 350 000 by 2025 ref recommendation 25 institute flying hour contracts with operational and training wings in fy 2020 that increase flying hours by at least 20 percent above fy 2019 numbers flying hour contracts set a specific number of flying hours that each wing must fly during a fiscal year a contract that wing commanders and their subordinate maintenance commanders must fulfill years of underfunding during sequestration coupled with emphasis on the maintenance level of warfighting units caused the air force to abandon these contracts they were replaced with flexible and easier to reach flying hour goals with the understanding that most wings would fail to meet them the new contracts must stretch the manpower and materiel assets of each wing and respective commander evaluations should be based on fulfilling those contracts the secretary of defense s direction to increase aircraft mission ready rates from as low as 40 percent to 80 percent is an important first step in bringing units up to an acceptable standard ref the second half of that equation is giving pilots enough training time in the air to be fully prepared for high threat high intensity combat operations delivering flying hours at an increased rate will also expand the experience base of pilots in operational and training units more rapidly once these individuals become more experienced they can move on to more senior roles expanding the training pipelines expanding training opportunities will also aid in the absorption of individuals exiting those accelerated training pipelines recommendation 26 cut the duration of pilot training introduction to fighter fundamentals and all aircrew replacement training by 20 percent and increase the number of annual training classes by a commensurate level by the end of fy 2020 the army air corps graduated 249 pilots from a 12 month flight school in 1939 with war on the horizon the army compressed the duration of flight school from 12 months to 10 months in 1939 and to seven months in 1940 ref while wartime demands forced some sacrifices in training to get the course down to seven months most every course within the current air force training pipeline has timelines that can be compressed without sacrificing quality and quality needs to rise the quality of the current pilot training curriculum has been in question for several years due to graduation rates that defy historic thresholds for quality ref between july 1939 and august 1945 the army air corps flying school graduated 193 440 pilots and failed approximately 124 000 cadets ref as the air force increases the number of training classes with the goal of increasing the overall number of graduates for each specialty it should re integrate screening in line with the expectations of a high end conflict on the horizon recommendation 27 increase f 35a acquisition by 12 jets in fy 2020 and increase jet acquisition by 20 percent annually until an annual rate of 100 f 35as is accepted by the air force this increased production rate should be commensurate with flying hour increases and pilot training increases the current f 35a delivery schedule tops out at 60 jets per year in 2026 and the total purchase of 1 763 will not be fulfilled until the year 2048 nearly 30 years from now even if the purchase were reduced to a total of 1 260 f 35as the air force would not receive the last jet until 2037 18 years from now the air force needs to get the f 35 to the flight lines as quickly as it can recommendation 28 curtail the light attack aircraft laa competition and forgo any move to acquire new fourth generation platforms if actualized the laa competition will end with an award for the production of approximately 179 close air support light attack aircraft costing the air force between 3 2 billion and 4 5 billion ref the aircraft is designed for a slow low threat environment and carries limited ordnance capacity making it not worth that amount of money particularly in light of the small mission set it could fill the competition should end with a contract for a handful of laa aircraft purchased to support training requirements of partner nations cost is driving a discussion within the office of secretary of defense for the services particularly the air force to buy more than 200 fourth generation platforms here even the cost argument is not viable as most new fourth generation fighters will cost more per airframe than the projected price of an f 35a while one can argue the operating costs will be higher for the stealth fighter none of the fourth generation fighters in the discussion would survive to engage with air to air missiles or deliver air to ground ordnance in any high threat area as the secretary of the air force has rightly put it capacity is an issue but that capacity shortfall must be filled with platforms that can thrive in and among the threats of today and tomorrow going backward simply does not make sense the space force one of the key issues facing the department of defense will be the issue of outer space security much discussion has already arisen over the creation of a u s space force the first new service proposed since the creation of the u s air force in 1947 because of the bifurcated responsibilities between the services and the combatant commands there has been some uncertainty about the roles and responsibilities of a space force the services do not in fact fight america s wars the u s army navy air force and marine corps do not commit divisions warships or squadrons nor do they develop war plans the services organize train and equip the forces that the combatant commands cocoms such as central command centcom responsible for the middle east or the indo pacific command indopacom responsible for the asian regions from the pacific to the indian ocean employ to fight wars outer space has been part of the purview of strategic command stratcom in part because of the importance of space based early warning systems stratcom has had responsibility for both outer space and the cyber realm indeed it inherited responsibility for some cyber operations when it absorbed the u s space command in 2002 which itself had assumed responsibility for cyber operations in 2000 it has become clear however that both outer space and the cyber realm will be major battlefields in future conflicts this led to the separation of cyber command cybercom as its own unified command in 2017 ref and will see the separation of space and the re creation of the u s space command in the next year recommendation 29 create an independent space force that includes all service and national security space assets and capabilities as a combatant command u s space command however will still not have the authorities necessary to organize train and equip forces the responsibility of a service for the dod to have that authority it will be necessary for congress to reconsider the organization of the dod and the associated title 10 authorities equally important any space force will have to manage its human capital in order to attract bright young officers a clear career path must be available to them including opportunities to command forces which in turn will lead to promotions it was the creation of such clear professional trajectories in the interwar period that helped make american carrier aviation and land based air forces so effective in world war ii what is clear unfortunately is that the u s military has not paid sufficient attention to how to approach the challenge of space when confronted with a peer competitor two decades of counterinsurgency and a decade of fighting far less capable adversaries before that have deeply eroded the skills and mental approaches necessary for confronting an enemy that can challenge the u s not only in the air and at sea but also in outer space and information space both congressional and presidential actions reflect the concern that in the event of a major power conflict the u s military may find itself ill prepared to contest never mind control the ultimate high ground consequently if an effective space force is to emerge it must be oriented toward providing the u s with the ability to secure space dominance ref this will mean bureaucratic streamlining simply aggregating the current range of bureaucracies will not be enough the space force should not be a space version of the department of homeland security it will also require a real focus on warfighting as a central mission with careful attention to properly managing acquisition of forces and promotion of personnel if it is to succeed cyber capabilities the u s military s technological edge is eroding quickly the u s now has peer competitors in cyberspace and as the director of national intelligence observed in the 2018 world wide threat assessment we remain concerned by the increasingly damaging effects of cyber operations and the apparent acceptance by adversaries of collateral damage ref the 2020 ndaa needs to prioritize optimizing the dod s cyber strategy authorities and human capitol pipeline if the military is to thrive in the emerging national security environment recommendation 30 follow through on the cyber solarium commission the 2019 defense budget created the u s cyber solarium commission ref a commission of government and civilian experts tasked with exploring alternative grand strategies for the united states in cyberspace the commission is scheduled to submit its recommendations on september 1 2019 and the dod should be prepared to follow up on these findings accordingly the 2020 ndaa should contain a provision requiring the pentagon to develop a national cyber defense strategy incorporating the research and relevant findings of the cyber solarium commission within 12 months of its submission to congress recommendation 31 expand special operations forces sof authorities to perform offensive cyber operations currently only special mission units regularly receive national level support from the u s intelligence community for offensive cyber operations while theater special operations forces are routinely de prioritized for this support and are explicitly prohibited from conducting offensive cyber operations as the battlefield continues to digitize however this restriction unduly constrains the ability of special operations forces to accomplish their mission while simultaneously forcing them to accept elevated operational risk these authorities should be reviewed specifically the 2020 ndaa should task the dod with reviewing and with providing recommendations on what if any changes should be made to relevant sections of title 10 and to any other relevant statute authority or policy recommendation 32 expand acceptable professional qualifications for cyber talent cyber talent in the united states is in high demand and in short supply as the dod seeks to fill its critical cyber workforce it should accept non traditional professional credentialing and schooling and thereby significantly expand the talent pools from which it draws personnel specifically cyber related credentialing from so called technology boot camps and massive online open courses moocs should be allowed as an alternative to traditional education requirements provided that candidates meet the necessary technical standards further the dod should also allow military personnel to apply gi bill and related benefits toward these cyber related alternatives allies a central cornerstone of american national security is the united states network of allies this network is extensive and requires consistent investment and proper communication this section s recommendations are focused on the u s posture toward allies and alliances recommendation 33 congress should remain interested in stationing additional forces in europe particularly poland these forces should include an abct and air defense and missile defense battalions and batteries recommendation 34 congress should convene a hearing on the subject and continue to press for this change in global posture in terms of global posture in the 2019 ndaa congress required the secretary of defense to submit a report by march 1 2019 on the feasibility and advisability of permanently stationing additional forces in poland ref much of this section s language focuses on the army nevertheless permanently stationing additional forces in europe especially in poland is an excellent means of reinforcing deterrence against opportunism by the russian federation and in the case of conflict making available immediate forces to respond without the need for flow from the united states the last two european command commanders have both advocated permanently stationed versus rotational forces current u s basing structures in europe harken back to a time when denmark west germany and greece represented the front lines of freedom the security situation in europe has changed and the u s should account for this shift by establishing a permanent military presence in allied nations further east including the baltic states and poland the dod is currently studying the feasibility of permanent basing in poland weighing the advantages of permanent versus rotational forces and assessing potential basing sites in addition former defense secretary james mattis has stated that the dod is considering additional support elements which any new permanent u s presence would require stating you know it s not just about a base it s about training ranges it s about maintenance facilities all these kinds of things and a host of details you ve got to study alongside ref the polish government has committed to providing between 1 5 billion and 2 billion to cover the cost of a potential permanent u s presence in poland ref the u s already has a sizeable presence in poland as the framework nation for the multinational battlegroup stationed in orzysz where nearly 800 u s troops form the backbone of nato s enhanced forward presence in poland ref the u s continues to invest heavily in rebuilding infrastructure in europe including 31 million to upgrade amari air base in estonia 4 million at lielvarde air base in latvia 3 million at siauliai air base in lithuania and 4 1 million at powidz air base and 14 million at lask air base both in poland ref despite these significant investments the u s continues to rely on rotational deployments in the baltic states and poland permanent forces would provide a much greater deterrence value than rotational troops in november 2017 army chief of staff general milley emphasized the value of ground forces in deterrence the air maritime capabilities are very important but i would submit that ground forces play an outsize role in conventional deterrence and conventional assurance of allies because your physical presence on the ground speaks volumes ref in addition to providing greater deterrence value permanently stationed forces in europe are better prepared better able to hold exercises build greater interoperability with allies and are more cost effective in addition permanently stationed forces may foster increased morale as families need not be separated ref as the u s continues to reassure allies in response to continued russian aggression establishing a permanent presence in eastern europe will send a strong signal that the u s remains committed to collective defense recommendation 35 ensure that nato retains its lead role in european defense matters in november french president emmanuel macron reiterated calls for the creation of a true european army ref despite assurances that a european union army will complement rather than compete with nato structures the 2016 global strategy for the european union s foreign and security policy very clearly states an ambition of strategic autonomy for the european union ref the establishment of an independent eu army will undermine transatlantic security and will serve to decouple the united states from the legitimate interests it retains in a peaceful and secure european continent as such congress should discontinue its reflexive support for european defense integration the u s should continue to focus on advancing a nato first agenda one that ensures american engagement and influence in european related defense matters nato has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security for almost seven decades it affords the u s a level of influence in the region commensurate with the amount of troops equipment and funding the u s commits to europe the creation of duplicative eu structures whether an unnecessary and expensive eu operational headquarters or the aspirational eu army weakens nato eu defense integration undermines nato by siphoning off scarce resources from the alliance any money spent on the eu s common security and defense policy csdp is less money that can be spent on nato in addition the veto power of six non nato eu states five of which are neutral almost guarantees that any eu assets would not be available for nato operations the csdp has not delivered increased military capability for the u s or for nato rather it competes with nato for scarce european defense resources this in turn undermines nato the ultimate guarantor of transatlantic security a dangerous proposition especially in light of russian aggression u s allies in europe should focus on fixing nato and living up to their article iii commitments under the north atlantic treaty to maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack ref recommendation 36 oppose the development of nord stream ii the nord stream ii pipeline project that would connect germany with russia is neither economically necessary nor is it geopolitically prudent it is a political project to greatly increase european dependence on russian gas magnify russia s ability to use its european energy dominance as political trump card and specifically undermine u s allies in eastern and central europe german chancellor angela merkel acknowledged the political nature of the project in april ref in 2017 russia supplied 45 percent of german natural gas imports ref u s opposition to nord stream ii is having an impact in september germany announced plansref to build a liquefied natural gas import terminal in an effort to address u s concerns over nord stream ii and to add diversification to the country s gas supply while this decision is positive it has not assuaged u s concerns as secretary of energy rick perry recently stated energy security in turn requires energy diversity that is the reason we oppose the nord stream 2 project which would further increase the dangerous energy dependence many european nations have on the russian federation ref indeed estimates are that if completed nord stream ii would help concentrate 70 80 percent of russian gas imports to europe in one kremlin controlled route ref in addition the project poses environmental and security risks including allowing moscow to install undersea surveillance and monitoring equipment in the baltic sea ref nord stream ii will increase russia s economic and political leverage in europe and undermine security congress should continue its strong opposition to the pipeline project and look for ways to hamper its financing and construction recommendation 37 oppose treaties that harm u s national security congress should push the administration to promptly unsign the arms trade treaty att and reject the anti personnel mine ban convention known as the ottawa convention and the convention on cluster munitions cmc the att the ottawa convention and the cmc could have significant harmful effects on u s national security the senate has not provided its advice and consent to any of these treaties the latter two have not been transmitted to the senate and none of them is in the u s national interest arms trade treaty the u s has not ratified the att and a bipartisan majority of the senate opposes its ratification on the grounds that it is vague easily politicized and could hinder the u s in fulfilling its commitments to provide arms to key allies many other leading arms exporting and arms importing countries also oppose the att but despite its own assertion that any att that did not include all u n members would be less than useless the obama administration signed the att in 2013 and belatedly transmitted it to the senate in december 2016 recommendation 38 reject funding for att implementation congress should reiterate its previous rejections of funding to implement the att domestically and should in addition prevent the att from being used as the basis for domestic prosecutions and require that the att ratification process include house and senate implementing legislation as of 2018 the u s paid more of the administrative budget for the att than any nation except japan finally congress should condition the payment of fees to attend the att s annual conferences of states parties by requiring that such fees not exceed the amount reasonably required to pay the actual costs for attendance by the u s delegation and are not used to cross subsidize the att s secretariat anti personnel mine ban convention the u s has not ratified this convention and it has never been submitted to the senate u s anti personnel landmines meet or exceed all relevant international standards and the u s employs such landmines responsibly studies by the nato and other organizations confirm their military utility and in 2014 the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff stated that anti personnel landmines remain an important tool in the arsenal of the armed forces of the united states ref but in june 2014 the obama administration banned their use outside the korean peninsula in the 2017 ndaa congress prohibited the destruction of u s anti personnel landmine stockpiles before the dod completes a comprehensive study on department policy on the use of landmines as required in the 2016 ndaa ref this study should contain a 10 year inventory and cost projection for current stockpiles a similar projection for replacement munitions and an assessment of the effects of the projected inventory on operational plans as well as the briefing on the current state of r d for operational alternatives to anti personnel landmines required by the 2017 ndaa recommendation 39 prohibit the destruction of landmine stockpiles congress should repeat the requirements and prohibitions contained in the 2017 ndaa and should also ban funding for the destruction of existing stockpiles until the dod certifies that the replacement of anti personnel landmines by alternative munitions will not endanger u s or allied forces or pose any operational challenges despite the fact that the study mandated in the 2016 and 2017 ndaas has not been published the 2018 and 2019 ndaas contained no similar provisions ref cluster munitions convention cmc the u s has not ratified this convention and it has never been submitted to the senate in 2009 harold koh legal adviser to the department of state stated that the u s national security interest cannot be fully ensured consistent with the terms of the cmc ref in 2001 secretary of defense william cohen stated that future u s cluster munitions would have a 99 percent or higher functioning rate thus reducing the danger of unexploded ordnances this policy also allowed u s forces to retain and use legacy cluster munitions until replacement by more reliable models in 2008 secretary of defense robert gates stated that after 2018 the u s would only use munitions with a functioning rate of 99 percent or higher the only u s munition that meets this standard is the cbu 105 sensor fused weapon sfw the u s has not budgeted funds to purchase the sfw since 2007 and in 2016 its manufacturer textron announced it would discontinue production of the sfw as of may 2017 jim shields the army s program executive officer peo for ammunition stated that the deadline creates capability gaps that we are really concerned about ref as an interim measure the u s army is purchasing swedish munitions and is considering israeli munitions while developing the guided multiple launch rocket system alternative warhead which replaces the explosive sub munitions in conventional cluster munitions with approximately 160 000 preformed tungsten fragments shields noted that the u s has initiated de milling all of our cluster munitions but we have put a hold on that because we don t know what the current administration s position is with regard to the use of cluster munitions ref the cmc has also created serious problems for the f 35 the f 35 is intended to engage stationary and moving surface targets when the f 35 was in development it was going to use a cluster munition to achieve that objective but then as air force lieutenant general christopher bogdan peo for the f 35 program put it in april 2017 the u s by treaty is not allowed to use those weapons so when that weapon left the inventory we were left without a weapon that could hit moving targets while general bogdan is incorrect that the u s is not allowed by treaty to use these weapons his larger implication is accurate the effect of the cmc which the u s has neither signed nor ratified has been to significantly degrade the f 35 program which is projected to cost over 400 billion ref few enemies have imposed a heavier cost on the armed forces of the united states than the cmc a treaty backed almost entirely by u s allies many of whom are partners in the f 35 program in late november 2017 the dod announced a modification of the 2008 policy which requires military departments to program for capabilities that meet the 99 percent standard while maintaining a stockpile of existing cluster munitions sufficient to meet operational needs these stockpiles will not be demilitarized until sufficient quantities of munitions that meet the 99 percent standard are available finally combatant commanders are now authorized in cases of immediate warfighting need to accept transfers of cluster munitions that do not meet this standard and to use these munitions in combat recommendation 40 ban the destruction of cluster munitions congress should support the november 2017 policy by prohibiting the destruction of u s cluster munitions stockpiles except if required for storage safety reasons until the dod completes a comprehensive study on these munitions and congress explicitly authorizes the dod to resume its de milling program this study should assess the military utility of cluster munitions provide an inventory of current stockpiles coupled with a study of past u s patterns of cluster munitions use and an assessment of the effects of the closure of the sfw line and assess the current state of r d acquisition and deployment of operational alternatives to conventional cluster munitions internal dod operations reforming and refining how the dod works has been a constant since its establishment it is an effort that requires continuous attention and investment nonetheless it has the important benefit of increasing the value that the country gets for its defense dollars and properly providing for the military this section s recommendations focus on improvements and reforms to the dod s operations recommendation 41 establish education savings accounts esas for military connected children the federal government has a constitutional duty to maintain a strong military force to ensure national defense however military families dissatisfaction with education options is a major impediment to retaining a strong military force to the frustration of many military parents most military children are required to enroll in whichever public school is closest to the military base regardless of whether that school is a good fit more than one third of families responding to a military times survey reported that dissatisfaction with their child s education was a significant factor in their decision to remain in or leave military service ref military families who already make many sacrifices should not have to sacrifice their children s education too service members already face an assignment to a military base when they enroll in the armed forces empowering all families who serve with school choice would ensure that their children do not face mandatory assignment to the nearest district school providing military parents with esas would allow them to find education options that are the right fit for their children wherever their next assignment takes them indeed esas have garnered support from 75 percent of active duty military families ref moreover congress can repurpose existing federal revenue sources such as impact aid or other titles in the elementary and secondary education act to fund esas for children of military families ref esas can improve education options for military children since they meet the unique needs of military families through an esa a portion of what would have been spent on a child in the public system goes directly to a parent controlled savings account funds can then be used for private school tuition as well as education products tutoring education therapy and online learning education funds can even be rolled over from year to year and saved for college tuition esas give military families the option to enroll their children in the local school system or pursue a school of choice military esas give parents the ability to make the best education choice for their children ref recommendation 42 support the seamless integration of the national technology and industrial base ntib the 2017 ndaa required the secretary of defense to develop a plan to reduce the barriers to the seamless integration of the ntib s partners ref the 2020 ndaa should support reforms that will make it easier for the u s to export defense technologies to its closest allies such as the united kingdom and australia these should include allowing all defense related exports to be licensed to close allies absent a u s decision to refuse within a specified and limited time period and the system level licensing of such exports which would allow the automatic and immediate export of follow on parts components servicing or technical plans canada is already rightly treated separately under u s law and the defense secretary s plan should reflect this fact and ensure that its exemption is updated to show the pending completion of export control reform and to remove any other impediments discovered in the course of preparing the plan recommendation 43 authorize full pay raises as determined by the employment cost index to assist in recruiting from a shrinking candidate pool demographic trends and lower unemployment rates mean that the dod will have a more difficult time recruiting for the increasing armed forces adding to this problem is a growing number of individuals between the ages of 17 and 24 who are physically or mentally ineligible for military service the center for naval analyses estimates that only 29 percent of americans in this age group are eligible for military service based on recruitment practices and demographic trends ref recommendation 44 reform basic allowance for housing bah congress needs to reform the bah rules the bah needs to be restored to its proper role of an allowance by requiring married military couples to share a single allowance and by requiring all service members to document their housing expenditures in order to receive the allowance these changes would reduce costs and are completely appropriate congress should phase in a more accurate housing allowance since it is solely designed to help service members pay for accommodation this allowance is not military compensation service members are not entitled to nor should they have any expectation that bah money they receive in excess of what they pay for housing can be retained as extra compensation recommendation 45 reduce commissary subsidies and combine commissary and exchange systems congress should merge commissary and exchange systems the dod operates two parallel but similar organizations for providing service members and their families with access to goods and groceries the commissaries provide groceries at cost plus 5 percent which is only sustainable through an annual subsidy in fy 2018 congress subsidized the commissaries at 1 4 billion ref on the other hand the military exchanges operate largely without subsidies by passing appropriate costs on to the consumers maintaining access to affordable groceries and goods is important for service members particularly those stationed overseas or in remote locations in the debates for the 2018 ndaa congress had a reporting requirement that would provide a cost benefit analysis and aim to reduce the operational costs of commissaries and exchanges by 2 billion congress should revisit the question and continue with reforms to the systems this is especially important at a time when the gao has found that the dod does not properly measure the recruiting and retention benefits created by the systems ref recommendation 46 authorize a new round of base realignment and closure brac congress should authorize a new round of brac the dod has assessed that it has more than 19 percent excess infrastructure that would be reduced through a brac ref further congress has mandated that the dod study its excess capacity that report is due with the 2021 budget ref the report should serve as the starting point for a new round of brac not as an excuse to delay the process even further the excess capacity burdens taxpayers and the department with unnecessary costs that would be better allocated elsewhere in the budget the dod estimates that a new round of brac would save 2 billion in fixed costs ref a new round of brac should set a target reduction goal to reduce the infrastructure by a percentage that congress should determine there are multiple ways in which congress can change how a brac round develops to quash questions and doubts that lawmakers might have ref from establishing different criteria for installation assessments to dedicating full time staff to brac and its studies congress and the dod can work together to mitigate all the questions that have led to the rejection of a new round of brac recommendation 47 reject new buy american requirements the dod like other federal agencies has a limited budget on which it relies to support its mission buy american is a great bumper sticker and political slogan but it is bad economic and security policy ref buy american requirements can artificially increase the costs of goods and services procured by the dod increasing the tax burden for americans and reducing the dod s overall purchasing power and ability to procure goods that are essential for national defense not only are buy american laws unnecessary for most commercial goods but ensuring that the dod complies with these regulations can be costly budgeting policies should allow the dod to readily source goods especially items that are non essential for military defense and are widely market accessible buy american requirements like other protectionist measures such as tariffs harm the overall u s economy more than they help as they can lead to higher costs and a decline in american innovation while it is the dod s mission to keep america secure it is not the mission of the dod to execute industrial policies buy american advocates argue that dod resources should subsidize u s industries and employment regardless of the price it is also an attempt to shield local industries from competition the 1933 buy american act sets a price preference for domestic products by requiring the dod to add 50 percent of the lowest foreign offer ref after applying the additional 50 percent to the foreign offer the dod then determines which offer is the best value often the price preference ensures that the domestic producer will win the bid ref this means that a project that could have cost the dod 20 million could cost american taxpayers as much as 30 million before a foreign bid may be considered purchases by the dod under 3 000 have been exempt from the buy american act to allow for expediency around regulatory compliance over the years this threshold has steadily increased to 10 000 given the likely increase in compliance costs the dod is also subject to the berry amendment which restricts the dod from using funds to purchase food clothing tents and certain other goods unless the items are entirely grown reprocessed reused or produced within the united states ref the defense logistics agency has issued waivers for a number of goods such as zipper components gloves fasteners or sandbags that are not 100 percent domestically sourced material ref still the dod continues to go through multiyear review processes to find domestic sources for footwear and other items that are widely available internationally according to the inspector general s report the dod has trouble complying with washington s buy american requirements ref dod contracting personnel did not comply with 40 of 109 contracts that were subject to the berry amendment nor with 41 of 171 contracts that were subject to buy american act requirements in total 214 4 million of 610 million in procurement roughly one third of the contracts were not buy american compliant and required all military services and the defense logistics agency to modify these contracts the same goes for expanding buy america to our strategic allies from a national security perspective the dod already has the authority and flexibility to avoid relying on potential adversaries for critical resources or capabilities free and open competition among friendly countries will produce the best products and best prices and ensure that america s service members overseas receive the supplies they need when they need them recommendation 48 lift the moratorium on public private competition under pressure from federal employee unions since 2012 congress has prohibited competition between public and private organizations for the more cost effective services for the u s government this moratorium even extends to public public competition which leads to situations for instance where the municipality in which a base is located may not offer its services to the installation dod specific competition remains prohibited per section 325 of the 2010 ndaa ref yet even critics will admit that competition is the greatest single driver of performance and cost improvement ref the rand corporation has estimated that opening support services for the military to private competition could result in savings of between 30 percent and 60 percent ref the common criticism levied against such competition is that the process has not been updated and has yield problems for both government and the private sector ref this is more reason for congress to revisit circular a 76 and make the necessary updates to allow implementation ref recommendation 49 exempt the dod from the davis bacon act congress should exempt the dod from davis bacon requirements to ensure that military construction projects are as affordable as possible the davis bacon act requires that construction contractors pay prevailing wages when working on projects for the federal government the increased cost of construction is significant for the dod which requested 10 5 billion for construction projects in fy 2019 ref the prevailing wage rates used by the government bear no resemblance to actual market wages as a result the davis bacon act increases the cost of federally funded construction by 9 9 percent ref recommendation 50 increase use of performance based logistics pbl congress should incentivize and enable the broader use of pbl throughout the acquisition process the dod should increase the use of pbl in weapon systems maintenance and sustainment it is estimated that these arrangements could save between 9 billion and 32 billion a year ref pbl is an arrangement in which the contractor is responsible for a larger portion of the support throughout the life cycle of the product thus instead of having a contract that is associated with the delivery of a platform it is associated with the proper functioning of said platform ref it serves to align the contractors interests with the dod in maintaining the readiness of platforms pbl is both dod policy and a priority for product support solutions and it is estimated that it saves between 5 percent and 20 percent of contract costs ref recommendation 51 congress should direct the pentagon to provide a report listing potential changes to streamline the audit and to focus on the areas of highest payoff on november 15 2018 the pentagon announced that it had failed its financial audit the first it ever had to undergo ref to be more accurate the auditors gave the pentagon a disclaimer on their books meaning they were unable to render an opinion because the records were insufficiently available or maintained for decades the pentagon has struggled to comply with the law which requires it to undergo an audit ref and the struggle is real and it is related to the size and history of the dod the dod is the largest of all federal departments it has more than 2 7 trillion in assets and more than 2 million people spread over the globe the nation s military is 243 years old and it was not built for auditability it was constructed incrementally over time to win wars and today finds itself composed of a multitude of overlapping and diverse financial and inventory systems and processes pentagon comptroller david norquist estimated that in 2018 the audit will cost 918 million 367 million in direct costs and 551 million to fix the problems the audit finds that is a small fraction of the dod s 2018 budget of 700 billion but still enough to buy nine f 35 jet fighters there is a widespread but misplaced belief in congress that the financial audit of the dod will identify large areas of waste or fraud yet the audit experiences of other federal agencies and private corporations largely do not support that expectation ref there are better methods to reduce waste or inefficiency such as waste audits or zero based budgeting techniques further many of the audit requirements imposed on private corporations make little sense when applied to the dod an example of the illogic of the financial audit construct as applied to the dod is the requirement to report precisely the value of all 2 4 trillion worth of its tangible assets including decades old equipment like m113 armored personnel carriers purchased in the 1970s and buildings constructed hundreds of years ago this makes sense in the private sector not for the dod clearly the pentagon should be held accountable for the funds with which it is entrusted no one is arguing for a free pass for the dod but since the pentagon downplayed the importance of the audit for so many years it now is in an unfavorable position to take the lead in advocating changes in the requirements to make the audit more effective then congress must take the lead lawmakers must engage with the pentagon and together with the federal accounting standards advisory board implement commonsense changes to the audit for example congress could remove non value added areas such as balance sheet valuation and accounting for the existence and completeness of major military equipment an area in which no problems were found in the 2018 audit recommendation 52 create a pilot program to roll over unused funds congress should authorize a program that allows the dod to roll over unused funding to the next fiscal year on october 1 of every fiscal year any funding that remains unused vanishes this creates the fear among dod agencies that unused funds could mean less funding the next year this creates a use it or lose it mentality within the department which leads to poor spending choices as unnecessary purchases are made in the interest of using up the funds dod agencies tend to spend up to 31 percent of their annual funds in the fourth quarter september is especially busy with spending twice as high as during the other months of the year ref as jason fichtner and robert greene economists at the mercatus center assessed this acceleration of federal spending decreases the quality of spending as poor choices are made in the interest of quickly using funds ref so long as the entities do not benefit from saving funds there is no incentive for them to spend more efficiently a pilot program for specific dod agencies enabling them to roll over 5 percent of their budget could go a long way toward finding a solution to this problem across the entire department this program would have the added benefit of helping the dod cope with the constant continuing resolutions that erode spending authorities recommendation 53 increase the lifespan of operations and maintenance o m funding to two years recent budget years have led to multiple years starting under a continuing resolution these continuing resolutions reduce the time that the dod has to allocate taxpayers dollars since they reduce the time available to implement changes ref the time reduction is especially important when dealing with dollars allocated to the o m account since this is funding that must be spent in the same fiscal year in which they are appropriated the funding for other accounts has a longer shelf life and the dod has been able to take advantage of that longer shelf life to dampen the effects of continuing resolutions congress should increase the lifespan of resources in the o m account to enable the pentagon to better navigate the realities created by continuing resolutions it is a recommendation backed by the nds commission which states that ne concrete step would be for congress to authorize dod to expend operations and maintenance funds from any given fiscal year during that fiscal year and the subsequent one ref it would be a simple solution that would help the dod cope with the realities of congress s budget discussions recommendation 54 remove non defense research funding congress should keep non defense research funding out of the ndaa congress has the bad habit of inserting non defense research projects into the ndaa that do not directly contribute to the national defense or to the better functioning of the armed forces these tend to concentrate around medical research such as the army s congressionally directed medical research programs ref these programs are better suited elsewhere in the medical community be it inside or outside government it is a stretch to argue that the army is the best institution to conduct research on breast cancer recommendation 55 review reporting requirements as they write the 2020 ndaa members of congress should be cognizant of the fact that a portion of the workforce s size in the pentagon is directly driven by the need to prepare and review congressionally required reports reporting requirements have increased and crept up through time these requirements lead to increased staff time dedicated to producing these reports congress should start to sunset reports that are no longer relevant and also be mindful of new reporting requirements recommendation 56 advance reform of occupational licensing for military families occupational licensing requirements can restrict a myriad of employment opportunities with minimal or no public safety benefit and these barriers to lawful employment can be particularly troublesome for military families ref while the states should continue to reduce unnecessary occupational licensing restrictions the 114th congress introduced legislation to begin to address this issue and the 116th congress should return to that debate ref many states make it difficult for former service members to find work in the private sector in fields such as nursing and truck driving even though the military fully trained them in those occupations ref military spouses face similar hardship they are 10 times more likely than the average american to move interstate 35 percent to 50 percent have occupations that require licensure and approximately 75 percent require re licensure after moving interstate ref it is unsurprising therefore that unemployment among military spouses is nearly 12 percent higher than the national average ref in 2018 the u s departments of homeland security and defense reported that they have worked successfully with some state legislatures to establish interstate compacts adopting uniform standards for license portability for certain occupations and the two departments aptly recommended that states continue to increase economic opportunity through those compacts ref in 2016 both chambers of congress introduced the alternatives to licensing that lower obstacles to work allow act which in part would have enabled military spouses to use on military bases whatever professional licenses they earned elsewhere ref that would also be a step in the right direction the 116th congress should reintroduce a revised version of that bill to permit any licensed military spouse to continue practicing anywhere in his new state of residence or at least to apply to any property owned or leased by the federal government on a military installation or elsewhere to further expand economic opportunities to military families ref recommendation 57 strengthen spiritual fitness resources in veteran suicide prevention congress should direct the dod in consultation with commanders chaplains and military medical professionals to develop a suicide prevention program based on the findings and recommendations of harold koenig and tyler vanderweele ref the program should be available to all members of the armed forces and their dependents it incorporates as an optional component opportunities for religious practice in accordance with each member s faith congress should direct the dod to make appropriate training on the availability and reported benefits of such a suicide prevention program available to commanders chaplains and military medical professionals conclusion the ndaa for fy 2020 will determine whether the military will sustain the gains in readiness of the past few years or if the rebuild will languish in its infancy congress needs to be a part of the solution and provide the department of defense with the resources it needs to continue the rebuild a fy 2020 topline of 742 billion would show u s allies and adversaries alike that the united states intends to follow through with its new national defense strategy and focus on great power competition after all the defense budget not only serves to equip the armed forces but also to signal america s posture abroad congress

china is now pakistan s largest creditor sharp revenue increases to continue for three years utility rates to be adjusted every quarter power tariff hike in august fund wants full fatf compliance islamabad pakistan has entered a high tax environment for the foreseeable future with rs1 56 trillion additional taxes this year followed by another rs1 5tr next year and yet another rs1 31tr the year after according to a staff report released by the interna tional monetary fund imf on monday read imf approves 6 billion loan for pakistan the agreement signed with the imf by adviser to the prime minister on finance abdul hafeez shaikh and state bank of pakistan governor reza baqir also requires an increase in electricity tariff again in august this year and ensures rs1 3tr refunds from the provinces out of the national finance commission share to honour its commitments with the imf the projections contained in the document show that the authorities have promised to increase fbr s total tax collection from rs3 94tr last year to rs5 5tr this year and to rs10 5tr by 2023 24 a cumulative increase of rs6 564tr in five years as such the tax to gdp ratio is forecast to soar to 15 3 per cent from 10 4pc this year speaking to the press via conference call held on monday evening imf mission chief for pakistan ernesto ramirez rigo said the government was expected to ensure this increase came from broadening the base rather than raising tax rates read what the imf numbers say on the foreign exchange front pakistan has to climb out of a deep hole over the programme period show the projections contained the document where net reserves are estimated to be negative 17 7 billion at the end of june they are projected to come in negative 10 8bn by the end of the current fiscal year on this basis the programme aims to take foreign exchange reserves from 6 824bn this fiscal year to 11 187bn next year equal to 1 4 months of imports this year to 2 2 months of imports next year the data contained in the document also shows that china has now become the largest holder of pakistani debt of the 85 482bn in total external debt and liabilities of the government slightly over one quarter of it at 21 891bn is owed to china through a combination of bilateral and commercial loans the fund programme requires pakistan to repay up to 37 359bn on its external debt by the end of the programme of which nearly 40pc at 14 682bn will be paid to china the commercial component of debt owed to china is to be brought to zero by the programme end whereas the bilateral debt will be reduced from 15 155bn today to 7 946 by the programme end the government has also given an undertaking to privatise at least seven small state run entities in the short run and rollout by september 2020 a complete roadmap for the remaining entities that will detail which ones are to be privatised and which ones to be improved upon the authorities have given an undertaking to the imf that pakistan had received firm commitments from china saudi arabia and the uae to keep rolling over their existing loans over the course of the programme in the conference call from washington dc mr rigo said the country would need to improve a number of laws including those relating to sbp s independence debt limitation money laundering terror financing soe s governance and so on responding to a question he said the government did not have a majority in the upper house of parliament and would therefore need to work on consensus with other parties reading the imf programme the government committed that the current year s budget had set rolling a decisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt and build resilience that would be supported by comprehensive efforts to drastically improve revenue mobilisation both at the federal and provincial levels and generate 4 5 percentage points of gdp in additional tax revenue the imf agreed that these measures will place general government debt on a declining path reaching 67pc of gdp by fy2024 after peaking at 80 5pc in fy2020 the authorities also committed with the imf that they would keep on removing tax exemptions and preferential treatments in the tax system and broaden the tax base and over time transform gst into a broad based value added tax vat they said the gst exemptions would end in the near future except for basic food and medicines to significantly improve revenues greater inter provincial harmonisation and coordination of gst will also simplify filing procedures and increase compliance in addition other tax policy measures include further strengthening taxation on real estate and on agricultural turnover or income by the provinces ensuring equivalent taxation of all sources of income and eliminating distortionary withholding taxes the government said it had signed a formal written agreement with the provinces on the fiscal strategy and the required provincial surpluses including revenue and fiscal surplus targets by province for fy2020 and implications in case of missed targets it said the progress toward these goals would be assessed in quarterly meetings of the fiscal coordination committee whose legal basis would be strengthened to make its decisions binding under this agreement the provinces will deliver surpluses of around 1pc of gdp in fy2020 gradually increasing them to 2 7pc by the end of the programme by saving the additional revenues generated through tax policy and administration reforms to support these efforts the provinces will aim to increase collection of property and sales taxes and to assume more spending responsibility the government has also promised that as part of ongoing dialogue on the national finance commission award the federal and provincial governments will make progress on measures aimed at better rebalancing inter governmental relationships and improve inter provincial horizontal equity the imf asserted that the effectiveness of pakistan s aml cft regime must be urgently strengthened to support its exit from the financial action task force fatf list of jurisdictions with serious deficiencies the authorities are stepping up efforts to implement all measures committed to in an action plan with the fatf by end october 2019 which has also been made structural benchmark of the imf programme the authorities will work with technical assistance providers including the imf to complete the action plan and further strengthen the effectiveness of the aml cft regime under the agreement pakistan agreed that sbp financing of budget deficit will be completely eliminated and it has also been made a performance criteria to support the new monetary policy framework the fund noted that direct sbp financing of the budget had increased from around rs3 6tr in fy2018 to over rs7 7tr around 20pc of gdp now this fiscal dominance has greatly compromised the sbp s operational independence jeopardising the achievement of the inflation objective the authorities said they stand committed to refrain from any new direct financing of the budget by the sbp and to gradually reduce the sbp stock of net government budgetary borrowing moreover the sbp and the government would re profile the stock of mostly short term government debt held by the sbp into short and long term tradable instruments of various maturities one three five and 10 years at interest rates close to market levels the authorities have also given a commitment that electricity rates would be adjusted on a quarterly basis and the second quarterly adjustment will take place before end august moreover the fy2020 electricity tariff schedule will be notified as determined by the regulator by end september 2019 the laws relating to electricity and oil and gas regulators would be amended to ensure immediate notification of tariffs determined by them to ensure full cost recoveries published in dawn july 9th 2019

the turkish currency took a hit on monday as markets reacted for the first time since president recep tayyip erdogan fired the head of the central bank on july 6 a move that will increase concerns over the independence of the country s monetary policy analysts have told the media line the lira lost over 2 percent of its value against the dollar as turkish markets opened on monday morning while at one point it lost 3 in asia trading the turkish newspaper hurriyet daily news reported on sunday that according to erdogan murat çetinkaya was fired because he would not lower interest rates the firing has led to concerns that turkey is continuing to apply unorthodox economic polices and could go toward looser economic programs according to merve hande akmehmet a washington based economist focusing on turkey i think it s definitely going to damage the confidence of foreign investors even more she told the media line akmehmet stated that the firing would lead to the perception that turkey s economic policy was following erdogan s will going against the long standing principle that a central bank should be independent she added that decreasing interest rates might ease pressure on the economy in the short term but would inevitably lead to more inflation it will make things worse in the future she said interest rates increased in response to a currency crisis last year when the turkish lira lost nearly 30 of its value erodgan wants the interest rates lowered in the belief that it fuels economic growth but instead it will likely increase turkey s debt burden while lowering the value of the lira the announcement of the firing came by a presidential decree published on saturday çetinkaya whose term as head of the central bank was to end in 2020 will be replaced by his deputy murat uysal the new bank head will likely be more willing to follow erdogan s wishes with lowering interest rates stated nafez zouk lead economist of emerging markets at oxford economics based in london we had become accustomed to a turkish central bank with eroded credibility but firing its governor leaves very little by way of confidence in the future of turkey s monetary policy zouk wrote to the media line in a twitter message there is to be even greater interference in economic policy setting he predicted zouk added that erdogan had been expected to go back to more orthodox economic policies after the recent municipal elections but the firing of çetinkaya seems to signal that this will not be the case turkey s economic growth has been largely dependent on foreign investors yet decreasing the central bank s independence will make them less willing to put money into the country hence making it harder to return to growth he said when a basic anchor such as independence of the central bank is tempered with that capital will be much slower to arrive zouk added last year s currency free fall led to inflation rising food prices and a recession at the end of 2018 the crisis largely contributed to erdogan s party losing the mayoral races for ankara and istanbul in one of the biggest political defeats for the turkish president since he came to power timothy ash an economist who focuses on turkey for bluebay asset management in london agreed that erdogan was expected to go back to orthodox monetary policy once the elections were over but the replacement of the governor has gone against that assumption it s a risky move ash told the media line he said that çetinkaya s dismissal wasn t entirely surprising as there have long been rumors that he would be replaced before his four year term was up however ash said it was odd to replace him with a high ranking official in the central bank rather than choosing someone outside the institution who would be more in line with fiscally orthodox rules such an official would eventually be better able to cut rates because markets would have more trust in him the firing comes at an especially sensitive time turkey is expected to receive russia s s 400 missile defense system this month which will likely lead to a major crisis with the united states washington is concerned that its military secrets could be jeopardized if turkey a nato country uses russian weapons alongside those from the us washington has already started the process of taking turkey out of the f 35 fighter jet program and could impose sanctions turkey s currency crisis last year was partly fueled by the us implementing limited sanctions over a diplomatic row with ankara ash stated that the sanctions would likely be tougher this year however the global economic climate was now more favorable to turkey and the country s current deficit is lower so the fallout might not be as severe a year later the economy has rebalanced significantly he stated that helps but they have little creditability this is not helpful that s pretty clear

it is unlikely the fed will undergo aggressive rate cuts or quantative easing unless absolutely necessary but other countries and regions are likely to ease further and this is putting upwards pressure on the usd fx intervention by the us government may grow in popularity tuesday s session is another light one in terms of scheduled data releases but market volatility continues nonetheless much like previous sessions stocks are lower and the us dollar is rallying with the dxy dollar basket now back at the mid june pivot in the 97 6 area it appears the market is re positioning ahead of a cluster of central bank speeches this week in which the fed is expected to shed more light on actions in july and beyond with the us jobs report coming in strong and us stock markets making new all time highs some of the dovish expectations for 2019 appear to be overdone and the market has undone some of the moves made in previous weeks fed chair powell is due to make opening remarks at a boston fed conference on banking stress tests on tuesday this may not be market moving but the fed s bullard quarles and bostic are also scheduled to speak later tonight however they may not reveal too much ahead of powell s semi annual testimonies to house financial services panel scheduled for wednesday and the senate banking committee on thursday after all of these speeches it should be clearer what the fed s intentions will be even if all they actually signal is a rate cut in july this is almost certain even if it can be argued it is not absolutely necessary with president trump breathing down their necks and the market fully pricing in a cut any kind of let down would cause a big stir and an equally big move down in stocks dollar problems with the us dollar making solid gains in recent sessions and now less than 1 away from new 2019 highs usd strength may again become an issue for the us government and for president trump who has openly called for policies to weaken it the issue is not only the recent rally on the back of decent data and falling expectations for aggressive fed cuts but also the policies of other countries and regions the eurozone in particular has a very good case for easing and this is putting downward pressure on the euro and upwards pressure on the dollar as maybank reports coeure said that accommodative policy was needed more than ever and that ecb could restart qe if needed while rehn said last week that we should no longer see the recent slowdown in growth as a brief temporary dip or a soft patch he added that ecb is ready to take further action if necessary to achieve price stability target he also said that we have not finished qe and can resume buying assets anytime these comments are consistent with draghi s message at sintra s ecb forum rising expectations for ecb easing would add to eur softness markets are now pricing in about 15bps cut by jan 2020 advertisement it is possible washington may start to look at its own tools to weaken the dollar there have been no direct suggestions from the white house so far but tweets regarding the need to match the currency manipulation of other trading partners have the market speculating over whether president trump would instruct the us treasury to sell dollars and buy fx in a unilateral intervention the issue of us fx intervention has also gained attention after post from ex us treasury official and respected blogger brad setser a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations supporting calls for countervailing currency intervention cci effectively laying the groundwork for the us treasury to sell dollars and buy currencies of those countries having been deemed to be manipulating their currencies lower for trade gains expect to hear more on this the higher the dollar goes

j ohn maynard keynes once fantasised about a world of permanently low interest rates in the final chapter of the general theory he imagined an economy in which abundant available capital causes investors bargaining power and hence rates to collapse in such a world markets would reward risk taking and entrepreneurial talent but not the mere accumulation of capital the result would be the euthanasia of the rentier listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element that low rates could feature in a leftish utopian vision might come as a surprise today it is commonly argued that a decade of monetary policy stimulus has filled the pockets of the rich low rates and quantitative easing qe are said to have sent stock and bond markets soaring thereby exacerbating wealth inequality they have also boosted house prices adding to intergenerational tension a glance at financial markets suggests more of the same is coming long term rates have tumbled this year in anticipation of monetary easing while stockmarkets have boomed central bankers have defended their policies by arguing that without loose money unemployment would have been much higher badly hurting the poor that is true but the effect of monetary stimulus on financial markets has nonetheless angered left and right alike judy shelton one of president donald trump s new picks for the board of the federal reserve has blamed central banks for exacerbating income inequality she has called for a return to the gold standard the left meanwhile prefers fiscal loosening such as giving money to the poor or fiscal monetary hybrids such as the people s qe once advocated by jeremy corbyn the leader of britain s labour party under which the central bank would finance government investment who is right do low rates spell euthanasia or euphoria for those who live off capital and should concerns about inequality determine which policy lever to pull in a downturn a starting point is that falling interest rates make all streams of future income more valuable that includes dividends from stocks coupons on bonds and homeowners privilege of being able to occupy their houses without paying rent but the resulting increases in asset values can be captured easily only by people who are willing to change their plans imagine a homeowner a higher house price is of little benefit to him if he has no desire to sell and move similarly a bondholder about to retire may need the steady stream of coupon payments the bond provides a capital gain from selling bonds today might fund a lavish around the world cruise but blowing through retirement funds is unlikely to be prudent now consider a penniless millennial she sees no capital gain when low rates boost asset prices but she does have assets that will yield income in the future education and skills were this human capital valued on financial markets it too would rise in value when interest rates fall she too could change plans and spend more today but by borrowing cheaply rather than selling assets a recent paper by adrien auclert of stanford university sets out a framework for judging who wins and who loses from changes in monetary policy three channels must be considered one concerns the impact of lower rates on the macroeconomy the effect trumpeted by central banks another concerns the higher inflation that lower rates might cause that hurts creditors and benefits debtors who see the real value of their obligations shrink the third channel concerns asset prices it is wrong to claim that asset holders generally benefit when rates fall says mr auclert what matters is the full picture of an individual s assets and liabilities the latter he defines to include future consumption plans such as whether the homeowner wants to stay in his house or whether the retired person seeks to maintain a steady standard of living only by looking at an individual s balance sheet in full can you judge whether he wins or loses from low rates or whether in the jargon he has unhedged interest rate exposure the crucial question is whether someone s assets and liabilities mature at different points in time people with short dated assets but long dated liabilities for example a saver with lots of cash in the bank to fund a purchase ten years hence do badly when rates fall they are the euthanised rentiers who must save more to fund spending later a rare example of lower rates depressing consumption but those who wish to spend today and hold long dated assets such as long term government bonds do well what does this framework imply for rich and poor mr auclert presents some evidence that americans who are older or whose incomes are higher tend to be on the losing end of asset price effects when rates fall but he says it is hard to measure the effect precisely a recent working paper by panagiota tzamourani of the bundesbank finds that within the euro area average unhedged interest exposure varies a lot between countries seemingly in line with the prevalence of floating rate mortgages but ms tzamourani also finds that younger households and those with low net wealth benefit from lower rates almost everywhere good hedges make good neighbours that seems to turn conventional wisdom on its head far from helping the well heeled the changes to financial markets induced by low rates could be hurting them just as keynes argued some might object that they do not deserve the hit surely those who save in cash for future consumption are more responsible than those who wish to borrow and spend keynes would have retorted that in a world awash with capital extra saving does not benefit society in a slump it is harmful in any case if fiscal stimulus is preferred to low interest rates taxpayers would end up with debts instead monetary stimulus may not help the poor as much as deficit financed welfare or progressive tax cuts structural problems in the economy such as market power may allow the rich to earn high returns even as rates fall but egalitarians and those without wealth probably need not fear doveish central banks sources monetary policy and the

ross perot who died tuesday has not been much in the news in the past few years but his ideas surely have his staunch opposition to the north american free trade agreement in the 1990s found a powerful echo two decades later when donald trump ran for the presidency calling for a wall on the mexican border and dismissing nafta as perhaps the worst trade deal ever made we do the world s dumbest trade agreements mr perot told vice president al gore in a televised debate in 1993 you go back to the agreements we ve done all over the world you d be amazed that adults did them mr perot s call for using tariffs not nafta to force mexico to improve its workers standard of living is not unlike president trump s attempt to use tariffs to force mexicans to stop migrants seeking to come to the united states many of mr perot s predictions about nafta s impact notably his claim of the giant sucking sound americans would hear as businesses shuttered operations in the united states proved either wrong or overstated paradoxically however his skepticism about lowering trade barriers has proved prescient some industries indeed relocated operations to mexico or added new capacity there following nafta mexico added many manufacturing jobs in the first several years after the deal but in the five years after nafta came into force in 1994 manufacturing employment in the united states increased too by 800 000 many got their jobs from a surge in exports from the united states to mexico
pakistan currently has a currency reserve of less than 8 billion enough to cover only 1 7 months of imports the latest bailout package is worth 6 billion of which 1 billion is to be disbursed immediately and the rest in the next three years photo ap washington pakistan s economy is at a critical juncture where it needs an ambitious and bold set of reforms the international monetary fund has said days after the global lender agreed to give a 6 billion bailout package to the cash strapped country pakistan which currently has a currency reserve of less than 8 billion enough to cover only 1 7 months of imports approached the washington based international monetary fund imf in august 2018 for a bailout package after the imran khan government took over the imf last week formally approved the 6 billion loan to pakistan which is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth pakistan is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth david lipton first deputy managing director and acting chair of the imf executive board said last week the imf approved the 13th bailout package for pakistan since the late 1980s the latest bailout package is worth 6 billion of which 1 billion is to be disbursed immediately and the rest in the next three years a decisive fiscal consolidation is key to reducing the large public debt and building resilience and the adoption of the fiscal year 2020 budget is an important initial step lipton said achieving the fiscal objectives will require a multi year revenue mobilisation strategy to broaden the tax base and raise tax revenue in a well balanced and equitable manner he said it will also require a strong commitment by the provinces to support the consolidation effort and effective public financial management to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending he said observing that protecting the most vulnerable from the impact of adjustment policies will be an important priority lipton said that this will be achieved by a significant increase in resources allocated to key social assistance programmes supporting measures for the economic empowerment of women and investment in areas where poverty is high a flexible market determined exchange rate and an adequately tight monetary policy will be key to correcting imbalances rebuilding reserves and keeping inflation low he said adding that an ambitious agenda to strengthen institutions and remove impediments to growth will allow pakistan to reach its full economic potential in an accompanying report the imf said that pakistan s economy is at a critical juncture the legacy of misaligned economic policies including large fiscal deficits loose monetary policy and defence of an overvalued exchange rate fuelled consumption and short term growth in recent years but steadily eroded macroeconomic buffers increased external and public debt and depleted international reserves structural weaknesses remained largely unaddressed including a chronically weak tax administration a difficult business environment inefficient and loss making state owned enterprises amid a large informal economy without urgent policy action economic and financial stability could be at risk and growth prospects will be insufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population the imf said the fund supported programme is expected to coalesce broader support from multilateral and bilateral creditors in excess of 38 billion which is crucial for pakistan to meet its large financing needs in the coming years it added pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid packages from friendly countries like china saudi arabia and the uae during the current fiscal year
w hat good is it to throw a man ten feet of rope if he is drowning in 20 feet of water asked kenneth rogoff former chief economist of the imf in this newspaper 15 years ago his question still bothers the institution he used to advise last june the fund uncoiled its biggest ever loan 50bn for argentina four months later it added 6bn more it hoped its generosity would rescue argentina and salvage its reputation in a country that regards it as complicit in the economic disasters of 2001 02 but a year later argentina s economy is still far from safety will more rope be needed listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the first thing a drowning man should do is jettison excess weight argentina s government led by mauricio macri has slashed its fiscal deficit aiming to balance the budget this year excluding interest payments and some capital and social spending approved by the imf that austerity has helped squeeze imports turning the trade deficit into a surplus but such fiscal rigour will be hard to sustain and imports are not the only claim on argentina s dollars it must make substantial payments on foreign debt in 2020 when the inflow of dollars from the imf s three year loan will slow dramatically many analysts think it will eventually need a new longer imf loan to help it pay back the existing one investors also fear a resumption of capital flight by residents especially if mr macri looks likely to lose the october election to his populist opponents led by alberto fernández and cristina fernández de kirchner a former president mr macri s government is in a bind tougher measures to appease creditors will anger voters and angry voters will alarm creditors who fear ms fernández s return that return is possible because growth has been slow to recover the economy has shrunk for five quarters in a row and inflation hard to repress consumer prices rose by over 57 in the year to may high inflation has put downward pressure on the peso see chart the peso s falls have in turn put upward pressure on prices argentines are quick to convert their deposits into foreign currency and many wages and prices are set with an eye on the dollar it is thus hard to stabilise prices without also stabilising the exchange rate despite this the imf has discouraged the central bank from intervening directly in the currency markets to prop up the peso in september it asked that the currency be allowed to float freely within a wide non intervention zone but in april it had to change course after a bad opinion poll for the macri government sent the peso tumbling the central bank said it would intervene within the zone if necessary that announcement as well as a good harvest seem to have worked for now the peso is up 5 against the dollar since its april low some in argentina think the size and speed of the imf s loan meant it could not be tailored to the country s idiosyncrasies though argentina might have liked a large fast customised loan it had to settle for two out of the three that said the imf has been remarkably willing to refit the agreement as circumstances require expanding its size speeding up disbursements and even endorsing the central bank s new intervention policy in april the fund and its biggest shareholder america seem eager to give this government the benefit of the doubt for its part the government has not blamed the fund for its predicament even the opposition which defied the imf when néstor kirchner ms fernández s husband was president in 2005 has said it will not walk away from the programme if it wins the election though it will seek to renegotiate the terms

the capitalist media have recently been filled with competing headlines some issuing stark warnings of an impending economic slowdown others dismissing this prediction outright but a look past the blaring headlines reveals growing signs that a worldwide contraction of the capitalist economy could soon tip the u s and other major economies into recession this is in spite of the fact that the super casino for the rich known as the stock market has once again reached record highs the time since the last major financial collapse is nearing the longest in recent history these two things of course do not reflect the reality of the lives of the vast majority of society the workers and the oppressed a survey released june 14 by bankrate com found that nearly a quarter of u s workers reported they were worse off since the 2007 economic crash surely this tells only part of the story of the profound ways in which the lives of many workers across the globe were impacted by the capitalist financial crisis of 2007 which wiped out workers savings and pensions led to a massive wave of foreclosures and layoffs introduced punishing austerity invigorated attacks on workers ability to organize and fight and gave rise to the gig economy and greater insecurity for wider sections of the working class the same survey found that the median family income in 2016 was nearly the same as in 2000 the price of a gallon of gas a carton of milk a college degree a visit to the doctor and nearly every other good or service has risen substantially since that time leading many to take on increasing amounts of debt many workers particularly the most oppressed live paycheck to paycheck signs point to impending downturn the bankers bank the u s federal reserve has pumped trillions upon trillions of dollars into the economy to keep it afloat from direct handovers to the banks during the bailouts in 2008 to interest rate cuts that make it easier for bankers and other large capitalist corporations to borrow money the central banks of many of the major capitalist powers across the world have taken similar interventions to prevent their economies from contracting and entering a recession this is on top of the massive handout to the super rich via trump s tax cuts in 2017 the effectiveness of this strategy to resuscitate the capitalist economy by the cabal of central bankers who exercise a considerable amount of control over the global economy appears to be reaching its conclusion on june 13 morgan stanley reported that its business conditions index which reflects sentiment about economic conditions fell by 32 points a record decline month to month reaching its lowest level since december 2008 the may report by the bureau of labor statistics showed that the u s economy added only 75 000 jobs that month far below expectations unemployment claims in may also spiked although the official u s employment rate remains below 4 percent the unemployment rate for black and latinx workers as well as women workers is nearly double that by official counts these official statistics artificially conceal the reality for many u s workers who have to take on two or three low wage part time or gig jobs or work in informal sectors of the economy just to make ends meet or have given up looking for work altogether the first quarter of the 2019 gross domestic product was officially reported as having grown by 3 2 percent however a deeper look reveals that the core metrics of the economy spending and investment grew only 1 1 percent forbes april 30 several indicators viewed as benchmarks showing the direction that the economy is heading also revealed an impending financial crisis the cass freight index which measures the volume of movement of commodities showed negative growth year over year for the past five months this echoes similar statistics showing that air freight at many of the global capitalist economies most important ports from london to singapore memphis to frankfurt were all flat or in negative territory compared with this time in 2018 some by significant margins orders for new aircraft also declined a topic of much discussion in the capitalist media has been the inverted yield curve on government bonds or debt this refers to the fact that interest rates paid on government short term bonds are now greater than those on longer term bonds this has happened before when there was pessimism about the longer term prospects for the economy and it has preceded every u s economic crisis banks and major corporations are the primary purchasers of u s treasury bonds the curve inverted briefly in march and has once again been inverted since late may newly released data also show that consumer debt in the u s on things like student loans credit cards car loans etc has ballooned to over 14 trillion surpassing levels that preceded the 2008 financial collapse student debt alone has risen to nearly 1 5 trillion compared to 611 billion in 2008 manufacturing data in the u s have shown a steep decline in recent months the empire state manufacturing index in june registered its largest one month decline in its 18 year history a similar index measured by the philadelphia federal reserve also reflected a steep decline meanwhile as jobs are being cut and production slows in manufacturing the trucking industry is reporting a pronounced slowdown and there have also been a series of bankruptcies of shipping companies we have no crystal ball but these are just a few of the many signs that point to an impending contraction of the capitalist economy not just in the u s but on a worldwide basis role of global developments the aggressive posture of u s imperialism in decline coupled with the fracturing of long standing imperialist alliances is contributing to the concerns among ruling circles of an impending economic contraction and revealing divisions among them in an effort to contain and undermine china the u s has opened an expanding trade war with tariffs targeting key sectors of the world s second largest economy u s imperialism s desperate attempts to recapture markets and regain an advantage over china are revealing emerging divisions within the ruling class here they focus on trump s imposition of tariffs on chinese products and his continued threats to raise them even higher these efforts are causing fear among some sections of the ruling class that a prolonged trade war may end up negatively impacting their capitalist plunder of the world this is on top of the brutal and racist war trump is waging on migrant workers which has been accompanied by the threat of tariffs of up to 25 percent on imports from mexico the threat of u s war on iran looms as the u s seeks to expand its export of oil and natural gas nearly a third of the world s tanker carried oil and petroleum passes close to iran through the strait of hormuz the u s energy information center describes the strait as the most important chokepoint for the world s oil industry tendency of rate of profit to fall and capitalist overproduction an article in the june 11 new york times pointed out corporate profits may be particularly vulnerable right now revenue overall is growing faster than earnings in the first quarter sales rose about 5 percent from a year earlier while profits declined 0 4 percent that dynamic is expected to persist over the next two quarters suggest companies have little ability to increase their bottom lines by expanding profit margins one of karl marx s key discoveries about the capitalist system was a contradiction that leads to crises of overproduction and the tendency of the rate of profit to fall this system is driven by competition among the owners of capital to carve out wider markets for their commodities and expand production if they do not they will be gobbled up and taken over by other capitalists who succeed in doing so this leads the capitalist class to invest more and more capital into the process of production itself including more efficient machinery for the production of commodities while reducing the amount of labor needed but profits are derived from the value that workers produce above and beyond what they are paid at first the capitalists using the more efficient technology get a competitive edge but eventually the new technology requiring fewer workers becomes the industry standard marx called the capital invested in plant and machinery constant capital its cost is pretty much the same for all capitalists in the same industry and is incorporated into the value of the commodities produced what the bosses pay out for the human labor consumed in production however is called variable capital because it varies depending on how much the bosses can squeeze out of the workers by speeding up production and reducing wages the more the bosses spend on machinery etc in order to replace workers the greater the ratio of constant capital to variable capital but profits come from variable capital the exploitation of labor so spending more on machines and less on labor eventually causes the rate of profit to fall this is a key contradiction of the capitalist system while the quote from the new york times does not in and of itself indicate this phenomenon it is an interesting revelation when taken as a whole based on official historical data compiled through 2017 the rate of profit in the u s has declined substantially over the last few decades after the capitalist economic crisis in 2007 08 as jobs were slashed and the means of production destroyed the rate of profit recovered somewhat and peaked in 2014 it has been on a relative decline ever since tinyurl com y5e2vgg5 this contradiction leads to the crisis of overproduction which is where the capitalist system on a worldwide basis is currently heading the anarchic nature of production under capitalism and the need to expand in order to increase profit leads to the overproduction of commodities not more than what people need but more than can be sold which in turn causes the system to eventually fall into depression workers and the oppressed know all too well what this means mass layoffs cutbacks austerity and a wholesale attack on our class particularly the most oppressed it can also be a time of explosive and dynamic struggles of the working class as the depravity and inhumanity of the capitalist system are on stark display in these crises elevating global solidarity on a class basis which rejects and confronts the many ways the ruling class attempts to divide workers with racism sexism anti lgbtq2s bigotry and other walls of oppression will be key it s up to communists and revolutionary forces to lay the foundation to raise revolutionary class consciousness and organization to intervene in these crises and help point the way forward for struggle that can resolve the contradictions of the capitalist system by prosecuting the class struggle and socialist revolution capitalism at a dead end struggle orientation needed there is widespread speculation that the federal reserve will cut interest rates at least once and perhaps several times before the end of the year 2020 is a presidential election year and trump will do all he can to prevent an economic crisis before then which would certainly vanquish his chances of re election trump plans to hold the republican national convention in charlotte n c the city with the second largest concentration of finance capital in the u s also known as the wall street of the south despite the fact that sections of the ruling class may be forced to reluctantly admonish trump for his more odious comments and policies he has brought them lavish profits and most will likely be happy to oblige him to undertake any measures to safeguard his re election and their profitability what will trump do however if a contraction occurs before the election the dangers are very real of war increased attacks on the most oppressed including migrants lgbtq2s people women and people of color or other drastic measures to distract from an economic crisis the capitalist system is on life support and has relied upon intervention from the central banks to keep it afloat a new crisis of the system is not a question of if but when the impending capitalist crisis threatens to be violent and devastating for workers and oppressed in the u s and around the world who already face a battery of attacks every day as in every previous crisis wall street will do all it can to place the burden of the crisis onto the backs of workers the 2020 elections will be and already are used to demobilize the struggle we must be prepared to mobilize on a global basis in our class interests to direct the fury of the workers and the oppressed against the capitalist system itself
cnn central banks aren t perfect but they work best when politicians aren t calling the shots that pillar of monetary policy is now under siege president donald trump continued over the weekend to try to bully his hand picked central bank chief into slashing interest rates trump is begging the federal reserve to juice the economy seemingly contradicting his own claim that the american economy is the best it has ever been it s not turkish president recep tayyip erdogan took his dislike for his country s monetary policy to the next level over the weekend firing his central bank chief no official reason was given for the ouster of murat cetinkaya but erdogan was frustrated by turkey s high interest rates which he blamed as the cause for the nation s high inflation it isn t the dramatic firing sent the turkish lira sinking 2 against the us dollar and deepened doubts about the independence of the country s central bank under president erdogan the credibility of monetary policy has been severely undermined said jason tuvey senior emerging market economist at capital economics central banks under assault turkey is the poster child for what can happen when political leaders meddle with central banks years of pressure from erdogan limited the central bank s willingness to cool off the red hot economy by raising rates that led to higher inflation that the central bank only belatedly tried to tackle turkey is the classic case of how efforts by politicians to take control of monetary policy have undermined the inflation fighting credibility of central banks said tuvey central banks in most modern economies are designed to be insulated from the short term whims of politicians the goal is to give central bankers the freedom to snuff out inflation even if that hurts political leaders at the ballot box in turkey the annual inflation rate spiked to 25 last year as the central bank under pressure from erdogan failed to aggressively raise interest rates the turkish lira crashed to record lows and the stock market plunged economic ignorance turkey s new central bank chief murat uysal may launch a large cut of several percentage points at the next meeting on july 25 to appease erdogan according to a research report published by piotr matys rabobank s emerging markets foreign exchange strategist matys warned that such a move would be a major policy mistake given the lira s slide and suggested the reshuffling at turkey s central bank could mark the end of its independence win thin global head of currency strategy at brown brothers harriman said the only crime of turkey s central bank governor was failing to cut rates we all know who really controls monetary policy now thin wrote in a note to clients but erdogan s views are unorthodox the turkish president has called himself the enemy of interest rates which he sees as the cause of inflation that s just economic ignorance said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group in reality central banks use interest rate hikes as a way to cool off overheating economies to prevent inflation from spiraling out of control is powell feeling the heat trump s own economic views have been questioned he s put severe pressure on fed chief jerome powell to slash interest rates even though the stock market is at all time highs credit conditions are strong and the jobs market looks healthy our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve trump tweeted on friday adding that the us central bank doesn t have a clue boockvar said there is no way to square trump s call for rate cuts with his argument that the american economy is the best it s ever been and yet the fed is widely expected to cut rates later this month for its part the fed has sought to ease fears that it is acting at the behest of trump the fed is insulated from short term political pressures powell said in a speech late last month powell noted that congress purposely designed the fed to be independent because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short term political interests in a press conference last month powell also dismissed trump s argument that he can be demoted i think the law is clear that i have a four year term and i fully intend to serve it powell told reporters still some have questioned whether the fed really should be independent why should monetary policy this very powerful tool to control the economy not be subject to the democracy just like every other instrument of government art laffer co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy told cnbc on monday boockvar suggested that the fed may already be feeling the heat as much as the fed and jay powell tell us they do what they think is right they are still human beings and are subject to pressure boockvar said he s in a very tough situation when you have the president breathing down your neck perhaps a new era is beginning one where politicians have greater say over central bank policy but it s hard to see how monetary policy based on political calendars instead of economic fundamentals will end well

described as a shocking 30 profit warning deutsche bank tumbled another 4 too having already dropped 5 4 the previous day after it axed 18 000 staff while apple s overnight drop of more than 2 on wall

very big he said in time meyerson became the president of eds he imagined a multibillion dollar company at a time when people like me would have been imagining a 10 million company it was radical scale differences meyerson says perot launched eds with 1000 from his wife margot it took off after winning contracts from health care providers like blue cross blue shield he was shocked by what happened in this contract because it was vastly larger than anything that had been done before meyerson said and it actually shocked me one month was equal to a year s revenue multiply those numbers they are astronomically large meyerson says in addition to financial success eds pioneered the concept of global outsourcing in 1984 general motors bought eds for 2 5 billion perot s story changed again in 1992 when he ran for president as an independent candidate he campaigned against the nation s growing deficits and debt and criticized the north american free trade agreement in a debate with

century republicans say he cost george h w bush the re election perot ran again four years later pulling just 8 of the vote his legacy might ve been sealed but kern wildenthal knew better the

years later was far less successful he was shut out of presidential debates when organizers said he lacked sufficient support he got just 8 of the vote and the reform party that he founded and hoped to build into a national political force began to fall apart however perot s ideas on trade and deficit reduction remained part of the political landscape he blamed both major parties for running up a

set in the previous session the dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was also higher at 97 550 while the euro drooped back under 1 12 for the first since mid june it would be pretty

opinions of tuesday 9 july 2019 columnist fredrick addai kwarteng not very long ago the ghana statistical service released the new inflation figures for the month of april 2019 according to the data released by the gss the inflation rate for the month of april rose to 9 5 percent from a rate of 9 3 percent recorded in march the same year this increase to 9 5 percent represents a 0 2 percentage points increase over that of the previous month for the benefit of proper understanding for persons who are not technically positioned to understand most of these economic terms let s take a moment to explain what inflation and consumer price index mean inflation in this context refers to an increase in the general level of prices of goods and services or an increase in the cost of living over a period of time so generally inflation is about the rate at which the prices of goods and services increase over time how do we arrive at the rate of inflation inflation rate is calculated by the use of the consumer price index cpi people often misconstrue the difference between inflation rate and consumer price index the cpi is just an index used to calculate inflation rate cpi measures the change over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption with reference to a base year in simple terms cpi measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services on the other hand inflation is the general upward price movement of goods and services in the economy on the whole cpi is a factor in determining inflation why inflation rate is an issue as far as standard of living is concerned inflation is the major factor that determines the standard of living of people standard of living refers to the degree of wealth and material comfort available to a person or a group of people in a defined locality in essence standard of living is about how a person or in general persons within a specific geographic setting afford the necessities of life and how comfortably they live standard of living is largely based on two factors 1 income 2 expenses 3 inflation occurs when day to day expenses rise many at times inflation is slow that it goes unnoticed however there are instances where the increase in prices are so dramatic that it becomes significant for consumers to notice a persistent increase in the prices they pay for the same goods the ripple effect of this is that consumers start to experience high cost of living that is with a constant income they begin to pay more for the same basket of goods and services this comes as a result of a decrease in their purchasing power to put it succinctly a product that a consumer purchased for ghs 10 before a rise in inflation will cost higher say ghs 15 depending on the rate of inflation so in general with high levels of inflation the basket of goods and services that a consumer used to purchase at a certain price is reduced with the same income this implies that with the same amount of income in the face of high levels of inflation consumers can t keep up with their levels of consumption to maintain their previous levels consumption in the face of high inflation rate there must be a corresponding increase in income of consumers as the rate of increase in the inflation for instance if inflation increases by 10 basis points there should be a corresponding 10 basis point increase in incomes of consumers before they can maintain the same level of consumption since this is almost impossible consumers purchasing power is reduced due to the high cost of living thereby leading to a fall in the standard of living the most affected in this event of high levels of inflation is the poor a synopsis of ghana s inflation rate for april now that it is established that everybody is affected by inflation with the poor being the most affected let s focus on the components of inflation and what really caused the increase in the rate for april the consumer basket over which the cpi is calculated has various goods and services that can be categorized into two food and non food the inflation rate for food is calculated differently so as the non food components of the food inflation the components of the food inflation comprise of the following major subgroups 1 coffee cocoa and tea 2 fruits 3 mineral water soft drinks 4 meat and meat products 5 vegetables 6 fish and sea food 7 sugar jam honey and chocolate 8 oils and fats 9 food products n e c 10 milk cheese and eggs 11 cereals and cereal products in general the inflation rate for the food inflation in the month of april was 7 3 percent compared to 8 4 percent in the previous month that is there was 1 1 percent deflation this implies that the rate at which food prices increased in the month of march slowed by 1 1 percent this is very positive for the economy as food which is a basic necessity of life had it s prices remaining stable lets now focus on the other component of the national inflation which is the non food inflation this will be the focus of the subsequent discussions let s not forget that the first component of the national inflation which is food inflation for the month of april recorded 1 1 percent decrease that is from 8 4 percent in march to 7 3percent in april non food inflation for the non food inflation aspect of the national inflation the components are grouped into the following groupings 1 clothing and footwear 2 recreation and culture 3 transport 4 furnishings and household equipment 5 miscellaneous good and services 6 alcoholic beverages and tobacco 7 hotels cafes and restaurants 8 education 9 communication 10 housing water electricity gas etc 11 health in general the inflation rate of non food inflation which comprise of the above groupings recorded a rate of 10 4 percent in april 2019 compared to 9 7 percent in march 2019 this implies that there was an increase of 0 7 percent in the month of april 2019 from the above analysis it can be deduced that what really caused the increase in the national inflation was the non food inflation component that is the 0 7 percent increase in the non food inflation reflected in a 0 2 percent increase in the national inflation thanks to the decrease in the food inflation component s rate else the increase would have been much worse than what was recorded let s now focus on the driving forces that really caused the upsurge in the non food inflation rate which also then rippled in the increase of the national inflation first of all it has been established that the inflation rate for the non food component was 10 4 percent which also doubles as the average of the group the inflation rate for the non food component is derived from averaging the inflation rate for all the various groups within the non food inflation components four of the groups within the non inflation component were the main driving forces the caused the increase in the rate of inflation for the non food component these groups recorded group inflation rate greater than the rate of the entire non food inflation rate of 10 4 percent the table below shows these groups and their inflation rate in effect the above groupings are main the main drivers that caused the increase in the national inflation for the month of april 2019 a critical analyses of these groups depicts that these goods and services are mostly imported things and things that are highly volatile to price change in any instance of exchange rate imbalances for instance the clothing and footwear group and furnishing household equipment and routine maintenance group are goods that are mostly imported from outside economies transport cost is mostly associated with crude oil price increase on the international market and exchange rate instability with this high importation of these goods and services coupled with the cedi depreciation in the first quarter of 2019 has resulted in this monthly increase in inflation since january 2019 as it is widely known an economy which is heavily dependent on importation cannot be spared in any case of exchange rate imbalances since the cedi depreciated within the first quarter of 2019 which implied that importers needed more cedi currency for the same unit of dollars in order to import importers being rational economic agents will increase their prices to make up for the extra cedi lost as result of the depreciation hence consumers had to pay the price through the increase in prices of this imported goods and services what made the situation worse was the persistent nature of the cedi depreciation challenge experienced this year this resulted in a repetitive cycle of price increase whenever the cedi depreciates as it was been explained earlier whenever an increase in prices become persistent indicates inflation therefore the high import driven economy augmented by the cedi depreciation encountered this year are the main reasons for the slight upsurge in ghana s inflation rate it can be said that this is as a result of our consumption pattern of heavily depending on imported commodities this is because from the data above the drivers of april 2019 inflation rate are good and services mostly imported what to do high levels of inflation is very destructive of standard of living especially with the poor being the most affected it therefore very reasonable to keep inflation at very moderate levels that will ensure good standard of living for all although the inflation rate of 9 5 percent currently is within the target of 8 or 2 percent set for the 2019 fiscal year if care is not taken the target will be missed it is therefore needful for a change in our consumption pattern the high taste of foreign goods have proven to destabilize our exchange rate which in turn results in inflation we all must therefore patronize the substitute of these goods produced locally in order to an economy devoid of exchange rate instability and high inflation that is the attitude of having strong taste for foreign goods at the expense of locally made goods needs to be eschewed we must strongly desist from that character of patronizing more foreign goods than locally made goods the implication of such behavior is that by patronizing foreign made goods you are helping to grow the economy of foreign countries as we cripple our own we need to fully complement the efforts of government s transformational change agenda by patronizing goods and services made locally for instance china as we see today as an economic powerhouse s transformation to an economy of mass production was complemented by the chinese conscious effort of patronizing their locally made goods this act of patronage stimulated further production expanded production and again stimulated expanded industrialization this continuous act of local patronage has culminated to what we see today as a chinese economy competing with the likes of usa uk germany and the rest other strong economies like malaysia singapore brazil are examples of economies that shifted from mass importation to mass production let s commend the president s effort on this front by being the lead advocate for made in ghana goods such efforts include the president s initiative of promoting made in ghana products campaign the campaign entails proper branding of made in ghana products appointing ambassadors for made in ghana products and other significant reliefs for local entrepreneurs through this effort

file photo not very long ago the ghana statistical service released the new inflation figures for the month of april 2019 according to the data released by the gss the inflation rate for the month of april rose to 9 5 percent from a rate of 9 3 percent recorded in march the same year this increase to 9 5 percent represents a 0 2 percentage points increase over that of the previous month for the benefit of proper understanding for persons who are not technically positioned to understand most of these economic terms let s take a moment to explain what inflation and consumer price index mean inflation in this context refers to an increase in the general level of prices of goods and services or an increase in the cost of living over a period of time so generally inflation is about the rate at which the prices of goods and services increase over time how do we arrive at the rate of inflation inflation rate is calculated by the use of the consumer price index cpi people often misconstrue the difference between inflation rate and consumer price index the cpi is just an index used to calculate inflation rate cpi measures the change over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption with reference to a base year in simple terms cpi measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services on the other hand inflation is the general upward price movement of goods and services in the economy on the whole cpi is a factor in determining inflation why inflation rate is an issue as far as standard of living is concerned inflation is the major factor that determines the standard of living of people standard of living refers to the degree of wealth and material comfort available to a person or a group of people in a defined locality in essence standard of living is about how a person or in general persons within a specific geographic setting afford the necessities of life and how comfortably they live standard of living is largely based on two factors 1 income 2 expenses 3 inflation occurs when day to day expenses rise many at times inflation is slow that it goes unnoticed however there are instances where the increase in prices are so dramatic that it becomes significant for consumers to notice a persistent increase in the prices they pay for the same goods the ripple effect of this is that consumers start to experience high cost of living that is with a constant income they begin to pay more for the same basket of goods and services this comes as a result of a decrease in their purchasing power to put it succinctly a product that a consumer purchased for ghs 10 before a rise in inflation will cost higher say ghs 15 depending on the rate of inflation so in general with high levels of inflation the basket of goods and services that a consumer used to purchase at a certain price is reduced with the same income this implies that with the same amount of income in the face of high levels of inflation consumers can t keep up with their levels of consumption to maintain their previous levels consumption in the face of high inflation rate there must be a corresponding increase in income of consumers as the rate of increase in the inflation for instance if inflation increases by 10 basis points there should be a corresponding 10 basis point increase in incomes of consumers before they can maintain the same level of consumption since this is almost impossible consumers purchasing power is reduced due to the high cost of living thereby leading to a fall in the standard of living the most affected in this event of high levels of inflation is the poor a synopsis of ghana s inflation rate for april now that it is established that everybody is affected by inflation with the poor being the most affected let s focus on the components of inflation and what really caused the increase in the rate for april the consumer basket over which the cpi is calculated has various goods and services that can be categorized into two food and non food the inflation rate for food is calculated differently so as the non food components of the food inflation the components of the food inflation comprise of the following major subgroups 1 coffee cocoa and tea 2 fruits 3 mineral water soft drinks 4 meat and meat products 5 vegetables 6 fish and sea food 7 sugar jam honey and chocolate 8 oils and fats 9 food products n e c 10 milk cheese and eggs 11 cereals and cereal products in general the inflation rate for the food inflation in the month of april was 7 3 percent compared to 8 4 percent in the previous month that is there was 1 1 percent deflation this implies that the rate at which food prices increased in the month of march slowed by 1 1 percent this is very positive for the economy as food which is a basic necessity of life had it s prices remaining stable lets now focus on the other component of the national inflation which is the non food inflation this will be the focus of the subsequent discussions let s not forget that the first component of the national inflation which is food inflation for the month of april recorded 1 1 percent decrease that is from 8 4 percent in march to 7 3percent in april non food inflation for the non food inflation aspect of the national inflation the components are grouped into the following groupings 1 clothing and footwear 2 recreation and culture 3 transport 4 furnishings and household equipment 5 miscellaneous good and services 6 alcoholic beverages and tobacco 7 hotels cafes and restaurants 8 education 9 communication 10 housing water electricity gas etc 11 health in general the inflation rate of non food inflation which comprise of the above groupings recorded a rate of 10 4 percent in april 2019 compared to 9 7 percent in march 2019 this implies that there was an increase of 0 7 percent in the month of april 2019 from the above analysis it can be deduced that what really caused the increase in the national inflation was the non food inflation component that is the 0 7 percent increase in the non food inflation reflected in a 0 2 percent increase in the national inflation thanks to the decrease in the food inflation component s rate else the increase would have been much worse than what was recorded let s now focus on the driving forces that really caused the upsurge in the non food inflation rate which also then rippled in the increase of the national inflation first of all it has been established that the inflation rate for the non food component was 10 4 percent which also doubles as the average of the group the inflation rate for the non food component is derived from averaging the inflation rate for all the various groups within the non food inflation components four of the groups within the non inflation component were the main driving forces the caused the increase in the rate of inflation for the non food component these groups recorded group inflation rate greater than the rate of the entire non food inflation rate of 10 4 percent the table below shows these groups and their inflation rate in effect the above groupings are main the main drivers that caused the increase in the national inflation for the month of april 2019 a critical analyses of these groups depicts that these goods and services are mostly imported things and things that are highly volatile to price change in any instance of exchange rate imbalances for instance the clothing and footwear group and furnishing household equipment and routine maintenance group are goods that are mostly imported from outside economies transport cost is mostly associated with crude oil price increase on the international market and exchange rate instability with this high importation of these goods and services coupled with the cedi depreciation in the first quarter of 2019 has resulted in this monthly increase in inflation since january 2019 as it is widely known an economy which is heavily dependent on importation cannot be spared in any case of exchange rate imbalances since the cedi depreciated within the first quarter of 2019 which implied that importers needed more cedi currency for the same unit of dollars in order to import importers being rational economic agents will increase their prices to make up for the extra cedi lost as result of the depreciation hence consumers had to pay the price through the increase in prices of this imported goods and services what made the situation worse was the persistent nature of the cedi depreciation challenge experienced this year this resulted in a repetitive cycle of price increase whenever the cedi depreciates as it was been explained earlier whenever an increase in prices become persistent indicates inflation therefore the high import driven economy augmented by the cedi depreciation encountered this year are the main reasons for the slight upsurge in ghana s inflation rate it can be said that this is as a result of our consumption pattern of heavily depending on imported commodities this is because from the data above the drivers of april 2019 inflation rate are good and services mostly imported what to do high levels of inflation is very destructive of standard of living especially with the poor being the most affected it therefore very reasonable to keep inflation at very moderate levels that will ensure good standard of living for all although the inflation rate of 9 5 percent currently is within the target of 8 or 2 percent set for the 2019 fiscal year if care is not taken the target will be missed it is therefore needful for a change in our consumption pattern the high taste of foreign goods have proven to destabilize our exchange rate which in turn results in inflation we all must therefore patronize the substitute of these goods produced locally in order to an economy devoid of exchange rate instability and high inflation that is the attitude of having strong taste for foreign goods at the expense of locally made goods needs to be eschewed we must strongly desist from that character of patronizing more foreign goods than locally made goods the implication of such behavior is that by patronizing foreign made goods you are helping to grow the economy of foreign countries as we cripple our own we need to fully complement the efforts of government s transformational change agenda by patronizing goods and services made locally for instance china as we see today as an economic powerhouse s transformation to an economy of mass production was complemented by the chinese conscious effort of patronizing their locally made goods this act of patronage stimulated further production expanded production and again stimulated expanded industrialization this continuous act of local patronage has culminated to what we see today as a chinese economy competing with the likes of usa uk germany and the rest other strong economies like malaysia singapore brazil are examples of economies that shifted from mass importation to mass production let s commend the president s effort on this front by being the lead advocate for made in ghana goods such efforts include the president s initiative of promoting made in ghana products campaign the campaign entails proper branding of made in ghana products appointing ambassadors for made in ghana products and other significant reliefs for local entrepreneurs through this effort coupled with proper monetary policy from bank of ghana we will overcome the menace of persistent cedi depreciation and keep inflation under control with this the standard of living for both the rich and the poor will not be compromised
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by marc jones london reuters world stocks fell for a third straight day on tuesday after a stinging warning from german chemicals giant basf about the effects of the global trade war and as hopes dwindled of a hefty u s interest rate cut this month with global macroeconomic clouds looming and markets waiting for policy signals from u s federal reserve chief jerome powell on wednesday the focus of headlines and sentiment turned to three individual heavyweight stocks related stories for europe it was an almost 7 early slump in german chemicals giant basf after it had blamed a global slowdown and trade war between the united states and china for what one trader described as a shocking 30 profit warning deutsche bank tumbled another 4 too having already dropped 5 4 the previous day after it axed 18 000 staff while apple s overnight drop of more than 2 on wall street after a broker downgrade dragged both global tech sectors lower both from a bottom up and top down perspective equity market valuations appear far too ambitious analysts at morgan stanley wrote in a note it was particularly stark they said as the u s business cycle was in a downturn and both forward looking indicators such as global pmis and global trade are now in contraction territory indeed companies have begun cutting their 2019 profit forecasts citing the trade conflict as a reason ms added in the currency markets britain s pound was threatening to slip to a more than 2 year low against the dollar and a 6 month trough versus the euro amid a worsening uk economic outlook and rising fears about a no deal brexit with the key 1 25 level against the dollar giving way in early asian trade traders quickly pushed the british currency down half a percent and it barely budged even as opposition labour party leader jeremy corbyn inched closer to backing a second brexit referendum the broader theme though remained the potential reaction to the weaker global outlook from the world s top central banks especially on what fed chairman powell will say during a testimony and grilling from congress on wednesday money market futures are still fully pricing in a 25 basis point bps cut at the fed s july 30 31 meeting but have almost priced out a larger 50 bps move that had been seen as a real possibility just a couple of weeks ago benchmark government bond yields were clawing away from their recent lows and the dollar changed hands at 108 81 yen to build on the more than month high it had set in the previous session the dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was also higher at 97 550 while the euro drooped back under 1 12 for the first since mid june it would be pretty disruptive at this stage for powell to rule out a cut in july or dampen expectations of a cut in july said michael metcalfe head of global macro strategy at state street global markets the last few fed speakers albeit non voting speakers have suggested july is not a done deal and even now if you look at economists forecasts there is not a consensus that there will be a move and yet the market is

after the 2008 financial crisis economic policymakers in the united states did enough to avert another great depression but fell far short of what was needed to ensure a strong recovery attributing that failure to the malign influence of the plutocracy is tempting but it misses the root of the problem berkeley why did the policy response to the great recession only partly reflect the lessons learned from the great depression until recently the smart money was on the answers given by the financial times commentator martin wolf and my berkeley colleague barry eichengreen each has argued that while enough was remembered to prevent the 1929 size shock of 2008 from producing another great depression many lessons were plowed under by a rightward ideological shift in the years following the crisis since then the fact that the worst was avoided has served as an alibi for a suboptimal status quo now nobel laureate economist paul krugman has offered an alternative explanation plutocracy at the start of the 2010s the top 0 01 30 000 people around the world half of them in the united states cared little about high unemployment which didn t seem to affect them but were greatly alarmed by government debt they began demanding austerity and as krugman contends the political and media establishment internalized the preferences of the extremely wealthy would the us economy of the 2010s have been materially different if the share of total income accruing to the top 0 01 had not quadrupled in recent decades from 1 3 to 5 krugman certainly thinks so while vigilance can mitigate the extent to which the wealthy get to define the policy agenda he writes in the end big money will find a way unless there s less big money to begin with hence curbing plutocracy should be america s top priority in fact big money does not always find a way nor does its influence necessarily increase as the top 0 01 captures a larger share of total income whether the average plutocrat has 1 000 or 50 000 times more than the average worker makes little difference in this respect more to the point big money wasn t the primary determinant of whether policymakers heeded or forgot the lessons of the great depression for example one lesson from that earlier episode is that high unemployment is extremely unhealthy for an economy and society a depression is not as the early twentieth century economist joseph schumpeter once claimed a good cold douche for the economy but this lesson was forgotten only by a lunatic fringe some of whom suggested that the great recession was needed to shift workers out of bloated sectors such as home construction as for lessons that were forgotten one is that persistent ultra low interest rates mean the economy is still short of safe liquid stores of value and thus in need of further monetary expansion during and after the great recession denying this plain truth and calling for an end to stimulus became a litmus test for any republican holding or seeking office worse these politicians were joined by an astonishingly large number of conservative economists who conveniently seemed to forget that the short term safe interest rate is a good thermometer for the economy subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now to be sure big finance did play a role here by insisting that the fed was trying to push value away from fundamentals even though economic fundamentals are generally whatever the fed says they are but an even more obvious culprit was hyper partisanship another lesson is that printing or borrowing money to buy stuff is an effective means for governments to address worryingly high unemployment after 2009 the obama administration effectively rejected this lesson in favor of the logic of austerity even though the unemployment rate was still 9 9 a related lesson is that high levels of government debt need not lead to price instability or an inflationary spiral as john maynard keynes argued in january 1937 the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity at the treasury unfortunately in the early 2010s those of us who recalled this lesson were consigned to the margins of debate yet here big money influence was a secondary problem compared to the democratic party s broader surrender to neoliberalism which started under president bill clinton but reached its apotheosis in the obama era after all the plutocracy itself profits when money is cheap and lending is dear the larger issue then is an absence of alternative voices if the 2010s had been anything like the 1930s the national association of manufacturers and the conference board would have been aggressively calling for more investment in america and these arguments would have commanded the attention of the press labor unions would have had a prominent voice as advocates for a high pressure economy both would have had very powerful voices inside the political process through their support of candidates did the top 0 01 put something in the water to make the media freeze out such voices after 2008 did the ultra wealthy create our modern campaign finance system in which elite social networks and door to door canvassing are less important than a candidate s fund raising totals the problem is not so much that the plutocracy has grown stronger as that countervailing powers have disappeared after all there are wealthy donors and philanthropists on the left as well as the right and some billionaires have even started to demand that they be taxed more of course the political implications of plutocracy are dangerous and destructive in the us olin money has captured the judiciary koch money has misinformed the public about global warming and murdoch money routinely terrifies retirees about immigrants but just because the public sphere is tainted and skewed by plutocratic influence does not mean that more rational policymaking is doomed once we are aware of the problem we can begin to work around it krugman admits as much when he warns centrist politicians and the media not to pull another 2011 treating the policy preferences of the 0 1 as the right thing as opposed to well what a certain small class of people want for journalists academics elected officials and concerned citizens generally the first task is to ask oneself everyday whose voices are getting more attention than they deserve and who isn t being heard at all ultimately it is the public that will decide the fate of the public sphere

by the time you read this independence day 2019 may have come and gone nevertheless the real fireworks in the gold and silver market seem yet to come it s as if we are in a period of time compression with many of the trends previously discussed moving faster together simultaneously propelling the metals to new heights in the coming months while it has been a good year so far for precious metals we believe the best is yet to come so far we have seen gold and platinum operate in the neighborhood of where we suspected they would when writing projections for 2019 silver has some catching up to do while palladium has surprised to the upside as always the big question is where do we go from here platinum continues to offer good long term value whereas palladium currently seems overpriced over the next year we believe 1 600 gold and 18 50 silver are in view for the following reasons it seems all but certain that the federal reserve will soon be pressured to lower interest rates again according to our friends that recently retired from there this will act as a relief valve for the us dollar allowing it to deflate somewhat when compared to precious metals some make the point that gold stays the same it is the dollar that moves up and down either way lower interest rates tend to act as a tail wind for precious metals prices causing them to gain altitude this is because higher interest rates sometimes offer greater competition for gold offering an alternative way for investors to battle the ravages of inflation recently however even with interest rates rising more than they have in over a decade gold and silver prices have shown amazing strength and resilience lower interest rates will likely magnify that strength elevating the metals ever higher we have written earlier about the tendency of the united states to over apply the tool of sanctions which over time reduces our economic influence in the world this is because the targets of our sanctions eventually find a way around using the dollar and dollar based financial systems to conduct trade over the weekend it was made public that now even our allies are beginning to conduct trade outside the realm of the dollar instex is the name of a new trading system put into place by our european allies that will allow them to conduct trade with iran largely out of the influence or control of us sanctions china and russia also have developed their own trading mechanisms which allow them to trade in their own currencies for energy and other commodities the swift system developed by the united states used to be nearly the sole arbiter of global trade but that role has been diminished in many regions worldwide while technology is part of what is enabling new trading systems to develop gold is also playing a significant role in cases like venezuela turkey and iran gold has been used to conduct trade in a way that is hard to track outside of the realm of any technology based trading system in other cases such as china russia and various oil producing nations gold is used in conjunction with technology based trading mechanisms to facilitate economic trade china has started using cips to trade it s own currency for goods and services worldwide china has also begun to offer a yuan based oil contract which can be converted into gold for those who do not wish to accumulate yuan russia also uses the cips system for international trade as well as it s own spfs system for domestic purposes all these alternative systems including gold drain resources and demand away from swift and the dollar based universe as we warned about previously real estate in many regions of the united states and the world were in danger of falling with gold and silver being a likely beneficiary in the 16 most expensive real estate markets in the us prices have fallen in 13 of these markets some have dropped as much as 22 from their recent peaks officials in california are beginning to panic as there seems to be a trend of employed people leaving the state in increasing numbers helping spur the drop in real estate prices there california currently has 10 of the national population and 25 of the homeless population when taxpayers leave an area pressure is added to those that remain chicago is also having trouble paying its bills and is looking for a bailout the new mayor recently asked the state to take over chicago s pension obligations thereby saddling residents statewide with extra taxes for services they never received illinois itself as well as other states are also on the brink of bankruptcy and looking to the federal government to bail them out against this backdrop of fiscal brokenness in some parts of the united states there are similar time bombs ticking on the balance sheets of us corporations many whose debt is rated bbb is at risk of being lowered to junk bond status with the next economic hiccup some believe a recession is just ahead after seeing what is going on in the automotive sector recently with a stock market showing signs of topping it is better to get out a few months early than a couple days too late precious metals like most things rarely go up in a straight line there can always be fits and starts even in the most powerful rally but most other markets equities bonds real estate etc appear to be sputtering out near the top of their cycles what does all this have to do with gold silver and precious metals plenty some of the resources sitting in all these other things that are beginning to have trouble are looking for somewhere else to go unless you are looking to jump from the frying pan into the fire precious metals currently seem to offer relative safety with plenty of growth potential in the current climate and in the days ahead while silver has some catching up to do in regards to gold we believe it will continue to climb after eclipsing gold s return on a percentage basis looking a year into the future we believe gold can reach 1 600 in dollar terms from near 1 400 today a rise of 14 it is also reasonable to see silver at 18 50 from it s current 15 30 which is a further rise of 21 in the near term with further gains likely when extended out 2 3 years from now

by mac slavo of shtfplan an influential survey of some of the world s largest fund managers shows that the risk for a global financial downturn is the highest it has been in four years investors are now preparing themselves for the next recession which some say will make the great recession look like a cakewalk according to investors surveyed by absolute strategy research as reported by thefinancial times investors are buckling up for the economic downturn they believe is imminent asr s findings which are based on a survey of more than 200 institutions controlling a combined 4 trillion of assets suggest that the bond rally is not a blip global bond markets have rallied in recent weeks as central banks have been responding to the numerous signs that major economies are looking increasingly weak investors have since ramped up purchases of government debt last week after christine lagarde s nomination as the next european central bank ecb president it appears that investors are betting that the international monetary fund chief s appointment would mean the era of ecb stimulus is set to continue we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the survey indicates that investors anticipate a 45 percent chance of a global recession in the coming 12 months the highest since the survey began in 2014 investors have also shifted their views on where bonds markets are headed next the majority now expect short term us bond yields to be lower in a year s time a reversal since march when more than half were banking on higher yields expectations that longer dated yields and record low yields in europe will rebound have all but disappeared financial times according to david bowers the asr head of research the united states indices are yet to show some of the telltale signs of doom and gloom if the bond market is really telling us something at what point will the equity market wake up he said the survey embodies a fundamental tension in markets he added with recession risks running so high you would expect a worse outlook for earnings but the implicit assumption is that earnings risks for equities are not that great fund managers are also more bearish on the dollar than at any point in the past five years the survey showed according to the financial timesreport a weaker united states dollar would be excellent news for precious metals with nearly two thirds of investors expecting gold prices to rise in the next year that makes now a great time to invest in gold or other precious metals take the time to look around and get what you can afford now isn t the time to go into debt to but gold but there are some less expensive options out there you could also grab some silver some silver is better than none if the dollar crashes under the weight of endless money printing and government debt
