read the full transcript of our discussion about western democracy political freedom and economic reform mehdi vo from the brexit vote in britain nigel farage archive a victory for real people mehdi vo to the election of donald trump donald trump archive a new vision will govern our land mehdi vo people around the world are rebelling against the ruling elite and increasingly turning to the political extremes so what lies behind the recent rise in populism and authoritarianism my guest tonight is an economist who blames the political establishment in her new book edge of chaos why democracy is failing to deliver economic growth and how to fix it she believes democracy is in crisis and has some pretty controversial suggestions for how to save it mehdi hasan i am mehdi hasan and today i have come to the oxford union to go head to head with economist and best selling author dambisa moyo i ll ask her why she seems to blame democracy for falling economic growth and whether her plan to save democracy by giving some voters more power and influence than others could end up killing it instead mehdi vo tonight i ll be joined by ann pettifor author of the production of money and one of only a handful of economists who correctly predicted the financial crisis jamie whyte director of research at the institute of economic affairs the iea and a former new zealand politician and philosophy lecturer and jason hickel an anthropologist at the london school of economics and author of the divide a brief guide to global inequality and its solutions mehdi hasan ladies and gentlemen please welcome dambisa moyo dambisa s first book dead aid caused waves when she argued that rather than helping africa foreign aid was actually making the continent poorer she is a former goldman sachs banker and ex consultant at the world bank dambisa moyo welcome to head to head dambisa moyo thank you mehdi hasan one of the central premises of your book is that the popular discontent that we see across the west right now for example the brexit vote the election of donald trump the rise of populist parties is driven by the failure of governments to deliver economic growth yet many experts pollsters people who have studied this stuff would say brexit wasn t driven by economics trump wasn t elected by the poor or the left behind it s a complete myth it had much more to do with culture and identity issues which you don t really address in the book you focus more on growth dambisa moyo i mean obviously my doctorate that i completed here at oxford a while ago is in economics and so i very much see these issues of challenge through that lens i m not dismissing that there might be other aspects and i ll leave that to people who are focused on those areas to to make the case for that i am concerned about the economics we do know that real wages have come down in virtually every developed country over the past 30 years social mobility has declined income inequality has widened and so the threat of a lack of participation in the labour force because people have essentially given up on work all these aspects have created a schism mehdi hasan but the link of things like trump and brexit not necessarily true i get that that s your prism and that s your specialism it doesn t make it correct the majority of americans earning less than 50 000 a year voted for hillary clinton not donald trump the voters in the rustbelt states who said the economy is the most important issue for the country went with hillary not trump on brexit income class were not predictors of vote in fact views of multiculturalism of feminism the death penalty was actually a greater predictor of people s views on brexit and their economic status dambisa moyo let me clarify a couple of things so first of all a lot of what you ve just said certainly culture issues around immigration which have been basically sort of put forward as a main argument for brexit and for the rise of trump and populism more generally across europe to me are masking a more fundamental problem which still has its roots in economics if people feel that their lives are improving that the future generations lives are improving i would argue that we would see much more stability we have seen much more stability in those periods mehdi hasan i get that but then donald trump also won more votes from rich people than he did from poor people he won the majority of college it wasn t just about stagnating wages dambisa moyo i ll give you a statistic that illustrates the story as you are aware the sort of general high level number is that hillary won the popular vote by three million if you take out new york i m not talking about the state just the metropolitan city of new york and if you take out the metropolitan city of los angeles not california just los angeles donald trump won the vote by over three million votes that is how split this country is people in new york city and in los angeles are essentially very liberal tend to be much more wealthy and tend to be deriving their welfare and in terms of their living standards from a global society and unlike you perhaps i take the view that there is no point in making arguments that i have no basis in fact or knowledge to make mehdi hasan okay you seem to treat growth as some sort of magic bullet and yet if you look at some of the biggest problems facing the world today problems you recognise in the book income inequality climate change more and more economic growth has not only failed to solve those problems many would argue experts would say it is in fact a driver of those very same problems would you accept that dambisa moyo i would not and i would not accept it because i think one of the key points that people tend to miss is not that we have not gained from a model where we have depended on growth we have failed to redistribute that growth in a way that actually enhances the lives of many people around the world if i think specifically of some of the examples of this there are many policies today that have short term gains particularly in western societies but have very deep long term problematic consequences i ll give you one example trade protectionism the fact that the united states through farm subsidies and europe through the common agriculture policy have locked out the goods that are produced in places like africa and south america have essentially created an environment where we have not only created more impoverished people but we ve also created or fed into issues of political instability mehdi hasan i m saying deal with the real world not your aspiration noble aspiration which is more growth more growth dambisa moyo look at the oxfam report every january they re putting out reports and saying the world is growing we know that i think the estimate for this year is that the eight wealthiest people in the world have more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of the world and so mehdi hasan more growth doesn t cut inequality in fact it increases it dambisa moyo i was very clear i said that the point is not about growth the fact is that how we redistribute that growth mehdi hasan and on climate change you talk about the edge of chaos but what about climate chaos isn t it irresponsible to talk about growth growth growth given experts like kevin anderson at the tyndall centre for climate change research have said that continuing with economic growth over the coming two decades is incompatible with meeting our international obligations on climate change dambisa moyo well there s a whole literature which obviously you haven t cited or perhaps you ve not seen which is focused specifically on what we call green growth there s massive discussion around this and in fact you talked about china earlier china is quite a lead ahead in terms of trying to ensure that mehdi hasan on the environment dambisa moyo of course they are have you been there recently beijing has more solar panels than most of the other countries around the world mehdi hasan and yet the un s environmental protection index formulated by yale university puts china at 120 out of 180 countries in the world dambisa moyo listen china is the second largest economy in gdp terms it s ranked near number 100 in per capita income terms this is one of the poorest countries on that metric the notion that somehow they should wake up and have an economy that s functioning at the highest levels is absurd the united states even in the last 20 years they ve had cities where there s been mass pollution just flint michigan is not 20 years ago where they polluted water and the notion that you re putting all this pressure on china which is still a nascent economy in many respects to me is foolhardy mehdi hasan i m not putting pressure you cited china i think you were talking about green growth well you were talking about green growth you don t advocate for green growth in the book dambisa moyo i sure do i sure do mehdi hasan how many times is climate change mentioned in your book dambisa moyo have you read my book mehdi hasan yes how many times dambisa moyo have you read my no seriously mehdi hasan okay let s ask you a question dambisa moyo i m a bit worried you may have just read some reviews mehdi hasan well let s have a test let s have a test on your book how many times have you mentioned climate change in your book dambisa moyo well there s a whole section mehdi hasan how many times it s a very simple question how many times do you mention climate change dambisa moyo there s a whole section i ve mentioned it multiple times mehdi hasan you mentioned four times the words climate change appear in this 200 multiple page four times dambisa moyo what pages mehdi hasan i can give you the pages but it s only four dambisa moyo i d love to check mehdi hasan so all i m saying is it s great please do check go home buy the book tell me now though what is your position on growth and climate change summarise it for us in a sentence dambisa moyo well as i said i think the framing is around green growth we have 90 percent of the world s population that lives in the emerging markets 90 percent those people including myself who comes from africa have been assured have been encouraged that we can live like americans live like british people if you decide you want to go and put the genie back in the bottle good luck mehdi hasan i do want to go to the panel on this but just before i do one last question i must ask this to you you were working at goldman sachs back in 2008 when dambisa moyo yes for ten years actually i worked there almost ten years mehdi hasan but you were there in 2008 at the time of the financial crash that goldman sachs helped cause which killed growth many might argue that are you really the right person to be writing a book about growth given the association with goldman sachs dambisa moyo i don t understand the connection mehdi hasan the question is if you work at an institution and you re part of an institution that did so much damage to the global economy and then you come around and say these are the solutions for growth the biggest hit to growth came from the banks and from goldman sachs dambisa moyo you know what you re exhibiting is a pure lack of understanding in how the global economy works so let me just mehdi hasan so goldman sachs didn t pay a five billion fine and say we were responsible for that dambisa moyo let me elucidate for you many governments not just this government in this country but also governments in the united states is a good example of this they have a clear and stated policy called housing for all this is a policy where they deliberately encouraged everybody to own a house it doesn t matter what your income is and your ability to pay mehdi hasan so this is the argument that the government was to blame dambisa moyo i m not saying the government was to blame we re all to blame because we essentially many of us mehdi hasan but goldman sachs didn t have a special role to play dambisa moyo i think to mehdi hasan it s a very simple question does goldman sachs have a special role to play they paid a five billion dollar fine and said we accept our role dambisa moyo many institutions pay fines i m trying to help you become a bit more educated in this field because mehdi hasan you can keep insulting me i m just asking a very simple question dambisa moyo i m not i m just saying that we all have to take a responsibility i know you want me to give you a one liner mehdi hasan yeah i want a yes or no does goldman sachs have a special responsibility dambisa moyo no there s no special responsibility mehdi hasan got it okay let s go to the panel we have an excellent panel here waiting to join this very interesting discussion i m joined by ann pettifor who s the author of the production of money one of a handful of economists as the newspapers often remind us to correctly predict the financial crisis ann what do you when you hear the arguments about the importance of growth as presented by dambisa both here and in the book what s your response ann pettifor dambisa you said governments should be making formulating public policy policy requires boundaries capital hates boundaries goldman sachs hates boundaries it wants to go where it wants to go and where it can make the biggest profits and you were advocating essentially a globalised economy where boundaries won t matter where governments won t matter where public policy will not have an effect because markets will decide and i find that there is a really deep hypocrisy in that you re on the one hand trying to blame governments on the other hand you are mostly in favour of markets making the most important decisions that affect millions of people across the world mehdi hasan do you want to respond dambisa moyo yes i d love to respond i am a supporter of this idea of globalisation the movement of trade and goods and services movement of capital but also the movement of people as an immigrant however we know that what is defined and explained in textbooks does not actually happen in real life because public policy and imperatives and trade offs and real politique the fact that especially democratic governments want to win elections means that these things do not apply in real life mehdi hasan jamie whyte s with us who s a director of research at the institute of economic affairs the iea he s also a former new zealand politician and philosophy lecturer david attenborough sir david attenborough one of britain s great naturalists says anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in a finite environment is either a madman or an economist do you agree with him jamie whyte well infinite of course not you can t have it but i really couldn t agree more with dambisa the era of globalisation imperfect as it s been has seen billions of people lifted from poverty it s really been the most astonishing period of success in human history in 1980 40 percent of the world s population lived on today s money two dollars a day or less today it s about eight percent i think and it s coming down down down that is a fantastic achievement which we should be celebrating and all these funny little i mean i find it astonishing that people are hostile towards the processes that have brought about what is close to a miracle mehdi hasan okay let me just bring in jason hickel waiting very patiently there anthropologist at the london school of economics author of the divide a brief guide to global inequality and it s solutions jason i m interested in the climate argument because dambisa has very forcefully rejected the idea that there is a clash there you can focus on green growth what do you think about that jason hickel so it s interesting because the only reports that were published by international institutions on green growth were done in 2012 for the un summits on sustainability what s interesting is that they did not cite any substantial models to justify this idea that rich economies can manage to grow while at the same time massively reducing material consumption of emissions down to the current budget of two degrees celcius since then fortunately there have been a number of key studies which i write a lot about and literally every single one of the models that has been developed shows that uh that green growth is not a thing it s literally physically impossible to have exponential growth at the same time as reducing material consumptions and reducing emissions fast enough to stay within the two degree celsius carbon budget and to me it s fundamentally irresponsible to have a book out there promoting endless growth in rich nations where it s not necessary in the face of all the research we have about planetary boundaries dambisa moyo so who has promoted endless growth in developed countries that s not my book i don t know whose book that is but just to be absolutely clear that s not mine jason hickel it s very clear in your book that you re talking about the united states you re talking about nations like the uk we re talking about brexit and you re talking about trump and you re trying to say these people are upset because there s not enough growth you re trying to say what we need is more growth in these countries dambisa moyo no thank god i m here because if i were dead you d be saying these things and i wouldn t be here to defend myself so i m glad i m here and i don t worry about the united states growing at three percent i worry about emerging countries and i talk about this very explicitly about emerging countries growing below seven percent you need to grow at least seven percent to double per capita incomes in one generation i m desperately worried when south africa russia brazil are growing at one two percent i am worried that india s growing four five percent that s not mehdi hasan but you also are worried about america and the uk otherwise why talk about trump and brexit dambisa moyo only to the extent that public policy is derived mehdi hasan we ve got to move on in the show we re going to run out of time let s talk about public policy but the most provocative chapter of your book that s got the most attention of the reviewers and people who ve read it so far is chapter seven which is called blueprint for a new democracy in it you talk about various proposals for the form dambisa moyo ten proposals mehdi hasan and you say quote radical reform of democracy is needed to save it from decay one of your most contentious proposals is to have voters in the west pass a test a knowledge test a civics test in order to gain the right to vote surely you must see how tests of that kind could be deployed probably would be deployed to disenfranchise the poor those with less access to education minority communities dambisa moyo absolutely and i talk about that i mean obviously i am black obviously i m a woman and obviously i m from africa if i were to purport and to support types of regimes or systems that actually do not allow people to vote based on a whole list of adjectives race gender wealth land ownership i d be the first person that d be disenfranchised so it d be crazy and i ve been accused of being crazy i m not that crazy to suggest that i should not be allowed to vote mehdi hasan but you are suggesting dambisa moyo and just to be clear as immigrants and i m sure there are many immigrants in this room they will tell you if you want to be a citizen in this country you want to be a citizen in the united states you have to pass a test it is already the case so i don t know if people aren t aware of this mehdi hasan for immigrants not for people who were born here dambisa moyo and it doesn t matter it doesn t matter mehdi hasan well it does because citizenship requires dambisa moyo i said it doesn t matter what your income or your origin or your race or gender is when you re an immigrant that shows up in these countries you have to take a test all i m suggesting is the test is designed to reward people for engagement mehdi hasan you mentioned reward many people would say voting is a right not a reward a lot are and second of all dambisa moyo people aren t using that forty two percent participation rates doesn t mean a lot are 42 percent mehdi hasan where s 42 percent dambisa moyo the average across europe the united states 50 percent 30 percent of people who are low income we do not want that situation mehdi hasan so the idea is then you make it harder for them to vote by putting a test in front of them dambisa moyo hold on hold on mehdi hasan that s a weird way of getting people to vote dambisa moyo well you don t understand the book once again i m desperately concerned mehdi hasan i don t understand the book dambisa moyo well because the argument was very clear mehdi hasan maybe i ll fail your test then as well dambisa moyo yeah you probably would mehdi hasan just deal with the discrimination point you say you re a black woman from africa so then why propose a test when in the us deep south literacy tests were explicitly used to disenfranchise black voters dambisa moyo because once again you re not appreciating what i m trying to do of which there are two goals number one we want to increase participation rate we want to ensure that the idea of one man one vote which is essentially the mantra that everybody s been told for many years about liberal democracy we want that to hold as many people must vote but we also want to make sure that the people who are voting have some good knowledge of what exactly we re voting on the day after brexit i m sure many people know this apparently the most googled term was what is brexit or what is eu mehdi hasan that s a bit of an urban legend dambisa moyo well it may be but you know what in a world of fake news even urban legends become facts and i think that whatever the case mehdi hasan in a world of fake news what was that urban legends become facts dambisa moyo i just want to be clear and by fact i don t mean they become true what i mean is that it goes around as you said urban legend people start to quote it like myself and i was very clear i said mehdi hasan why quote something that s untrue dambisa moyo i don t know it to be untrue do you know it to be untrue with certainty mehdi hasan well yes actually google did a study and a thousand people only asked google if you re going to extrapolate from a thousand people to all of the people who voted so all of the people that voted for brexit were thick is that what you re trying to say i don t understand what the point of that question is dambisa moyo the point of the matter is i was trying to explain to you that the book is designed to target two things participation rates and to ensure that we have a knowledge mehdi hasan got it okay so let s deal with the more controversial proposal you say that not just people should pass a test but people who are more qualified or more knowledgeable should have more votes or more influence you say quote three tiers of voters the unqualified the standard qualified voter and the highly qualified voter in a world of brexit and trump and populism in the far right do you really think giving some people more votes than others based on education will stop populism or help populism dambisa moyo okay so let me take a step back and explain exactly what this chapter seven is doing chapter seven offers ten proposals these proposals are not supposed to be taken in wholesale because countries have different levels of democracy but also very importantly they all have some precedence somewhere in the world so you re picking on a specific point around this question of ranking voters that already exists already in the united states in the democratic party super delegates have a bigger weight in switzerland there is a massive movement by the young parliament there to actually increase the participation in fact the weight of young peoples vote between 18 and 40 so that it s double the weight of people over 60 mehdi hasan you don t think people will go crazy if certain people get more power more votes than them based on their education or qualifications nor do you think that will increase inequality dambisa moyo you re not listening you re not listening nobody said anything about education once again the test is based on participation not on education you re taking sentences out that have a broader context mehdi hasan let me just read to you in context page 201 weighting could also be tied to one s professional qualification such as certification as a doctor teacher lawyer employment status level of educational attainment on the assumption that excelling in these domains makes one more likely to make well informed choices in the voting dambisa moyo and once again i m saying to you mehdi hasan do you stand by that dambisa moyo i m explaining if you actually read the paragraph before that you ll see that i was essentially saying here is how the argument goes the argument would be that you could have votes based on education and if you read that part after that paragraph i quickly dispel that mehdi hasan okay let s go to our panel ann you were eager to come in there what do you make of this ann pettifor well i wanted to just remind dambisa of why we had the french revolution and why thomas paine wrote his book the rights of man and why mary wollstonecraft wrote the vindication of the rights of women but i think i find the book disappointing in that it was shallow it s true that participation rates have fallen but i think the question to be asked is why have participation rates fallen and that s not asked in the book instead you re trying to tell patronise the public tell them that they haven t got it right and they need to be tested and trained in order to vote instead of asking why they re not participating they re not participating because they find that markets invisible unaccountable remote markets are making decisions that affect their livelihoods mehdi hasan jamie is shaking his head jamie whyte i don t want to be diverted by this funny idea that markets make decisions only people make decisions i think that there is a problem with voter ignorance since each vote has very little influence on the outcome of the election it s not worth investing a lot of time and effort to get the knowledge you would need to be an informed voter and i think it s very interesting that lots of people come up with ideas about how to deal with this i m not actually all that keen on your specific ones not all of them but i think it s a very worthy area of enquiry and we don t want this kind of hysterical reaction to any proposal that it s undemocratic or all democratic systems have undemocratic elements in them otherwise they wouldn t function at all i think we ve got way too much democracy now in the sense that far too many decisions are collectivised and they re made by people that are ill informed and it s wonderful to see somebody trying to engage with these issues we re not going to answer it tonight obviously mehdi hasan jason we have too much democracy jamie says jason hickel yeah so i actually think that you ve done yourself a disservice dambisa because your last chapter is full of these interesting proposals about gerrymandering about media regulation etcetera but then you give this kind of absurd proposal about weighted voting which overshadows all of that and no one s talking about any of your actual good reforms so i think you should probably renounce the position and then talk about the other bits you have dambisa moyo oh my god who has never heard about gerrymandering and campaign finance reform i mean i wanted to be innovative and now i m being crucified jason hickel the crucial point i want to make here is i think the biggest issues about democracy you actually failed to address at all that is this if we re talking about the global economy we have to look at the institutions that are governing global economic policy like the world bank and the imf where voting power is monopolised by the us and a handful of rich nations where the global south which has 85 percent of the world s population has less than 50 percent of the vote on crucial decisions on macroeconomic policy that affects them dambisa moyo i have written extensively about this my book dead aid was specifically targeting international institutions and the fact that the policy making decisions were centralised in a particular place where are very much removed from recipient countries mehdi hasan you say in the book you re very critical of professional politicians as are many people and you talk about how to raise the standard of people in public office that they should have experience outside of politics have real world jobs how do you feel about the president of the united states did electing a ceo billionaire make america more stable less corrupt in your view dambisa moyo so i don t necessarily like the way the president talks about women in fact i don t like the way he talks about women at all i don t like a whole host of other things but all i would say is the american economy is functioning they re getting stock market highs all the time their unemployment rate not just for the average of society but also for minority groups is at all time lows there are some big concerns that they are dealing with but we all have to accept that americans have made enormous sacrifices and unfortunately until european governments start to take more responsibility for what they have to pay and more generally we start to feel a bit sympathetic for what has happened to that economy and that country i think we re being a bit too simplistic mehdi hasan okay on that note we re going to have to take a pause join us for part two of a very lively discussion here with dambisa moyo on head to head we re going to be talking about china democracy development and we re going to hear from our very patient audience here in the oxford union here after the break part ii mehdi hasan welcome back to head to head on al jazeera english i m here in the oxford union with dambisa moyo best selling author economist she s got a new book out the edge of chaos dambisa what i didn t get reading your book is that you heap praise on liberal democracy on capitalism you say you want to save it from some of the problems that it undoubtedly faces its market but then you also are full of praise on china and you talk about how quote economic growth is a prerequisite for democracy not the other way around so is democracy i m wondering something you think gets in the way of growth and prosperity dambisa moyo so it s a brilliant question that i ve talked about there s a lot of fantastic research out about this because ultimately we want a democracy that functions and survives professor przeworski he was a professor in the united states talks about this he s got a model that predicts how long democracy will survive based on per capita incomes in a country and his argument s very which i subscribe to is very basic which is that if you don t have a middle class that actually is participating in the process of voting then you end up with a very narrow set of voters and that is a system you don t want to support we want to have a system where the population is at a critical mass to hold the government accountable and i ve argued in previous work my book dead aid for example talked about the failure of democracy in africa precisely because of this point our governments very rationally are able to pay attention to our foreign aid because they don t have to rely on the critical mass at home and so there is i believe a very clear correlation mehdi hasan so i know you don t like simplistic yes or no questions but are you saying then just to be clear that the say the chinese model or the undemocratic authoritarian model is better for growth for the economy than a liberal democratic model at this moment in our history dambisa moyo okay so once again i do have to explain there is essentially a comparing apples and oranges the proverbial apples and oranges these are two very different ideological systems western ideology puts the individual as paramount the most important entity is the individual china s model is based on prioritising society the entity of society as the most important entity the reason this is critically important is that there are enormous social costs from a model where you have an individual as paramount many of those costs we ve kind of swept under the rug population growth so the idea that i can have as many children as i want that s great that s my freedom that s my right i m not impinging on anybody s rights in theory but in practice we know issues of climate change issues of green growth and the trade offs around growth but also in terms of healthcare there are many ways in which this idea of i can do whatever i like actually does impinge on society s ability to grow and transform the chinese model is not at the end of the day the only model and the best model because it also has its own costs but this is the trade off that we re dealing with mehdi hasan a pretty huge cost in terms of human rights abuses it s a dictatorship dambisa moyo well china s also the largest foreign lender to the united states and so for all our objections perhaps let s be very careful about how first of all we can go into history and talk about suffrage 1971 was the first time that in switzerland women had the right to vote we can talk about the civil rights movement which is only in the 1960s in the united states so let s not all get hot and bothered about where china is china is on a path it does have to do a lot of work on its democratic process it s already underwent many democratic mehdi hasan it s under way most people say it s going the other direction xi jinping just made himself dictator for life dambisa moyo first of all if you go to china and spend time there which i have they have democratic elections at the mayoral level there is innovation already happening in that political system i would just say physician heal thyself i think this is the problem i want to avoid because we re very good at spending time talking about countries that are blatantly non democratic when actually this book and i think where the focus really needs to be and where the problems have come just in terms of the rise of populism and also the financial crisis these are in the west let s solve the problems of the west mehdi hasan earlier on you were telling me your focus wasn t the west it was the developing world dambisa moyo yes it is ultimately because public policy comes from the west mehdi hasan so you talk about not giving the west a pass most of the guests on this show have actually many of them have been from western governments i ve held them to account but when you say china is masterfully executing a carefully choreographed plan for growth which is largely attributable to its political system it does sound like you re endorsing that political system which is a horrific dictatorship dambisa moyo i m merely saying we cannot pretend that over 300 million people have been moved out of poverty in 30 years in china the bottom line is that has been done and no other country in history or prehistory has ever been able to do what the chinese have done i don t think we should spend a lot of time pointing fingers at china you know physician heal thyself mehdi hasan why not dambisa moyo our economies and our political system in the west mehdi hasan i get you re an economist but there are people suffering hugely dambisa moyo i said economies if you let me finish economies and political environment are under siege right now they are voter participation mehdi hasan where in the uk and the us and the west dambisa moyo yes mehdi hasan okay but we don t have reeducation programmes we don t have a secret police things are bad i m a big critic of western democracy but we re not on a chinese level of political dambisa moyo don t delude yourself voter participation rates are low number one number two mehdi hasan at least we can vote dambisa moyo money has seeped into the political mehdi hasan i mean this is a bizarre argument dambisa moyo that s all well mehdi hasan can you vote for xi jinping dambisa moyo that s all well and good vote away then because money money money has seeped into the political process okay 158 families mehdi hasan i m not disagreeing with anything you re saying i m just saying we re not china dambisa moyo i m offering a perspective i m offering a perspective let s focus on our own democracies where we have populism we have real concerns we have mehdi hasan i get that i get that but then i also read your book dambisa moyo we ve got a hungarian prime minister orban talking about mehdi hasan exactly exactly so how dambisa moyo we have russia which is producing 40 percent of the energy into this country into this region mehdi hasan i get that but this is classic what aboutery dambisa moyo it s not mehdi hasan i m going to ask you a simple question about something you wrote you re a very influential woman you re a bestselling author the reason we invited you on this show you have millions of followers on social media when you say china s contemporary economic success is largely attributable to its political system is that not some might say that s irresponsible because it sounds like you re saying that s the system you need for growth that s a good system dambisa moyo let me explain what i think the virtues of that system are that system is a long term system we have a fundamental schism between the long term economic challenges and headwinds that the global economy is facing led by developed countries things like debt etcetera productivity declines versus the short termism embedded in the electoral process in the united states they have elections every two years this is incredibly disruptive and it creates this mismatch between long term economic challenges and short termism in the political system the chinese model doesn t have to deal with that they re not seduced by today s voter or they don t need to seduce today s voter in order to remain in political office mehdi hasan let s go to our panel jason hickel is an anthropologist at the london school of economics when you hear dambisa talking about china in that way does that make sense the long termism jason hickel yeah it s actually i found this argument very frustrating and the reason is because the book is basically about the value of neo liberal free markets and you say that we need more of them okay but then you go into quite a lot of detail about how you admire china you admire the new deal in the us it s exactly the opposite economic ideology so where exactly do you fall on this i mean it s quite confusing and you re very slippery on that dambisa moyo so i think it s pretty obvious because what you described the new deal manhattan institute sort of manhattan project china what do they have in common they have the government playing an incredibly important role jason hickel not in dambisa moyo the government is not seduced by short term voters every two years or every electoral cycle that is what they have in common jason hickel but it seems the problem here dambisa moyo their capital allocation decisions are based on long term thinking long term planning issues which focus on future generations that s the basic thing jason hickel the problem here is you ve actually targeted the wrong enemy it s not democracy that s the problem because again the new deal happened in a democratic society it s not democracy that s the problem right actually what the problem is here is free market capitalism which is itself short termist and so the solutions are accurate that the new deal dambisa moyo i have ten very clear problems with democracy we don t unfortunately don t have the time for me to go through them the notion that democracy is not a problem is mad it s crazy we re looking at across europe right now we ve got masses of populism my own host here my host here jason hickel i think the problem is here you re very confused which economic ideology you actually support dambisa moyo oh my god so first of all no i m sorry i do have to answer that mehdi hasan jason you made the point let her respond dambisa moyo can i just add to it because that is at the crux of the matter he s just asked the question i want to know what ideological model she supports i am not an ideologue let me be absolutely clear mehdi hasan isn t that what ideologues always say dambisa moyo no it s very mehdi hasan you re an ideologue but i m not dambisa moyo he rightly pointed out that i m not ideological at all the bottom line is that there are definitely benefits and merits from the capitalist western system there are also very clear benefits from china mehdi hasan jamie democracy is a problem not a problem when it comes to economic growth where do you stand on that debate jamie whyte well i want to first agree with the basic position that democracy isn t a required precursor for economic growth and in fact if you look at the economic growth that occurred in the united states and britain in the 19th century which was basically founded on institutions such as private property and the rule of law and so on those institutions got came into place the british legal system prior to anything that we would today call democracy and then democracy came later so the basic point i think holds what s going on in china is indeed completely different that isn t a rule of law a liberal democracy type system but i think that the main point is to see that democracy is not a required precursor and indeed can get in the way for the kinds of reasons that dambisa s pointing out that it instead of setting up the institutions required for a stable and developing economy you get kind of politicians doing deals with the electorate in a certain sense over the short term in ways that are destructive but by that way i want to say that i am an idealogue ann pettifor i just want to say that the most popular president of all time was roosevelt and that was because employment was high because people had jobs people had decent incomes and they had public services and they loved that and they participated and they voted what we have had since 1971 and liberalisation neo liberalism is that people have found themselves becoming disempowered because there are forces beyond their control beyond the control of their governments if parliaments are unfashionable it s because parliaments don t make the decisions anymore mehdi hasan where do you stand on china is that a political economic model worthy of emulation ann pettifor it s a very clear it s an authoritarian it s socialist it s communist the people are educated the people are housed unlike many governments in africa the people are cared for and the market has managed but then there s a lot of social unrest which is repressed brutally by the government dambisa moyo i think it s it s not very surprising that we re looking very fondly back in the 1930s when actually the civil rights movement was just gaining momentum in the united states it s all well and good to remember those good old days but guess what people like me were not even allowed to vote at that time so i mean it might be it might already you said it not i so there are significant weaknesses in the democratic process this is absolutely the case i mean the notion that we can sit here take foreign direct investment from china trade with china have china lend our government enormous amount of money and then turn around and say well this is a big bad wolf and we don t want to actually deal with them i think is farcical mehdi hasan okay let s go to our audience here in the oxford union do you want to raise your hands and wait for the microphone to come to you yes audience participant 1 thanks very much if i can go back to the question around the weighted voting so the post apartheid south african constitution accord said that the vote of each and every citizen is a badge of dignity and of person who quite literally says that everyone counts now given the voting is not just an instrumental exercise it s also an exercise in personal self worth saying that some people can vote others can vote and worth more isn t that just fundamentally offensive dambisa moyo well i have a sense of what you mean by offensive i mean i m not really interested in emotional reactions i m more interested in something that s quite sustainable this is about engagement it s how it is that we expect citizens to engage in the process i think that we need to explore everything i was very clear that i do not think that this type of weighted voting works in a general election i consider myself pretty well read i m pretty engaged i m quite interested in what s going on in the world but i would not argue that i actually know what the best use or what the best decisions around healthcare system should be and i do believe that if i spoke to doctors nurses or people who work in the medical field they d be better able to tell me mehdi hasan dambisa if doctors had been asked to vote in 1948 we wouldn t have a national health service dambisa moyo i know what you re going to say mehdi hasan we wouldn t have a national health service if we d asked doctors to choose whether they want to have a public healthcare system audience participant 2 thank you from your comments it sounded like you re making a very broad distinction between government and private companies and the free market is this distinction reasonable and that for example if we were to limit protections the protections that governments enforce wouldn t private companies like goldman sachs operate like governments dambisa moyo so it is absolutely the case that we now live in a world where corporations but not just corporations wealthy individuals are taking a bigger responsibility and a bigger role in participation in public things that used to be the purview of only public affairs public governments think about the gates foundation think about many other foundations around the world that are delivering healthcare outcomes outside of the electoral process education etcetera so these lines are certainly becoming more and more blurred i personally think that we are moving more into the world that was requiring that not only because shareholders are demanding it but other stakeholders and communities they re saying if you re going to set up a company in our backyard we want you to help with infrastructure we want you to build schools we want you to invest in healthcare audience participant 3 you ve mentioned this quite a few times that debates and dialogues on africa at the moment when they talk about political aid business politics or glamour aid as you so succinctly put it different people are taking part rich the powerful white upper class men are part of the conversation so what do you suggest needs to happen for africans to take back control of the dialogue the conversation and decide what happens in our countries dambisa moyo well one of the most interesting questions that i received when i was marketing dead aid was if i were given a billion dollars what would i do with it and my answer was i would invest it all in a pr organisation because as far as i m concerned the aid movement has been tremendously successful for 60 years in convincing africans that they re not worth being having a seat around the table they re not that smart they re not that good and they re always going to be a drag on the global economy the narrative of africa has been in my lifetime one of corruption disease war and poverty over the past ten years there s been a significant shift with the arrival of china and many other countries and those countries do have their issues but the notion that anyone would think that there s been a positive narrative around what the stories around africa it s just foolhardy mehdi hasan ok let s go back the gentleman here in the front audience participant 4 hi there i work on aid policy for oxfam we do believe that aid can contribute to addressing challenges like inequality and redistribution in almost ten years since your book in regions like africa we ve seen aid double but tax revenues have quadrupled deaths from diseases like malaria hiv have halved and we ve also seen poverty rates come down and aid has made a contribution and we have seen democracy move forward in fits and starts so the idea that you continue to hold those views and you would actually firm them up even stronger is hard to understand can you explain dambisa moyo yeah for sure so two things first of all i don t know entirely know what the oxfam aid budget comes from but many aid agencies that are proliferated across africa are heavily reliant on their government on western governments the corrosive nature of uh of aid is around this question of of democracy on the african continent we do want to be able to hold our governments accountable but we can t do that if actually oxfam is going to solve the healthcare problem somebody else is going to solve education how are we able to hold our governments accountable from a public policy stance if they are not the ones who are delivering these outcomes we do need to move away i was very clear that i didn t say we need to go to zero i think there are some initiatives and there are some good things that i myself am involved in some aid initiatives that i think are very good they re very targeted but even the aid programmes to europe after world war two in the form of marshall plan were short sharp and targeted they were not open ended concessions that have been very corrosive to africa not just because of corruption but because of inflation the debt burden that they ve left on the continent and i will just say one last thing you ve given a whole list of positive things that have happened in the continent over the last decade you re absolutely right there have been significant wins but the notion that those are because of aid i think is wrong i mean as i said we ve had china come in there s been significant investment from china we re able to trade with the chinese for better or for worse and i think that that is just one example many other governments are now going to the capital markets to raise capital so i think aid is producing some help but it s absolutely not the case that it is all because of the aid regime which has been around for 60 years mehdi hasan we will go to the gentleman at the back and then the lady here audience participant 5 you talk about the very long term view economic policy needs to take root in a country and the short termism that democracy brings but when we look at the example of rwanda what paul kagame is doing he is basically limiting civil rights for the benefit of growth now in an african context do you feel that critical mass can be amassed within the middle class to allow for a distributive power within the economy so that rights and progress and democracy can take root without having it hijacked by dictatorships and things like that mehdi hasan i want to get where you re coming from are you someone who thinks it s a good thing what kagame is doing on the growth front regardless of the political front or vice versa audience participant 6 i believe that what paul kagame is doing is interesting mehdi hasan you should be up here you should be sitting in this chair i don t do yes or no questions what do you think about rwanda under kagame and what s happened dambisa moyo i m not rwandan i don t live in rwanda so it would be kind of arrogant of me to sit here and start pointing fingers at that economy what i will say is that that country came from a genocide that the world turned their backs we flew people out within 90 days ten percent of the population was massacred and we didn t really we did nothing the international community did nothing and so i am sympathetic to the fact that they had a very difficult challenge everything was razed to the ground i think that they are showing improvements in many of the metrics that economists care about things like doing business the participation rate 61 percent of women in parliament more than anywhere else in the world there are things that i can pick out and say that that is something for us to look at and emulate audience participant 7 one of the things you do suggest quite often is actually to make voting mandatory and in brazil uh it is mandatory and in fact more than 20 percent of the population does not go and vote and resents the fact that there is this policy and you could not argue that brazil certainly in the last few years has been a disengaged society in any shape or form don t you think that not voting is not only a reflection of how the society feels about their elites and their representatives but also ultimately part and parcel of the right to vote is the right not to vote dambisa moyo well i actually believe in the civic right people died for the right to vote and so i really i would i talk about mandatory voting because i think it s something we should explore and i think it really is interesting and as you know there are 27 countries around the world that have mandatory voting from australia belgium greece many countries in south america do i think that that people the only reason people don t vote is because they re trying to send a message to the political class and the elite no i think there are a lot of economic arguments there are a lot of people in the united states as you know the presidential election every four years is on a tuesday there are a lot of people who are on minimum wage who would like to vote who are not able to go to vote because it takes too long and there s a process audience participant 8 i was wondering about the importance of voters being informed as well as misinformed what do you think is the balance of responsibility between voters informing themselves and educating themselves and the government preventing misinformation and campaign finance reform that will get more accurate information out to the voters what is the balance of responsibilities or are they equal dambisa moyo yeah i think that s a great question particularly in a world where we have fake news we have social media a different conduit and so one of the things that i ve been looking at and i ve written about is whether or not we need some kind of glass steagall regulation that sort of this refers to the banking sector where we separate retail consumer banking from investment banking do we need that kind of regulation in the media so in other words some clear delineation between fact versus fiction i think that s something that s on the agenda right now and i would be very supportive of that traditionally bbc walter cronkite of the united states it didn t matter what race or gender or what part of the political spectrum you were on everybody got the there was this one font of knowledge basically one font of knowledge that is very different now we are all sort of quite siloed we get out information from the places where we want to sort of reinforce our views and so i do think if government and public policy actually want to survive we do need to have much more diversity of thought audience participant 9 yeah i read dead aid and find it challenging on one hand it talks about kind of aid and that being about culture and that being making it difficult to kind of create change and then on the other hand talking about trade and then you have kind the market you know supporting people and helping to kind of develop economies i just wonder are we swapping one kind of challenging institution for another dambisa moyo so in dead aid i offered five proposals for alternatives for aid and again just to be absolutely clear nowhere in dead aid did i say we want to go to zero aid even in developed countries there are areas of society that are based on charitable outcomes welfare systems of the government etcetera so we don t have to go to zero aid but we do need to think about things like foreign direct investment issues around tapping the capital markets this is just the suite of things that other countries that are very successful at it developed and developing use and so trade you re right it s under a lot of challenge and threat right now with the rise of protectionism emanating from the leading economies but i do think that we it s not just about one solution it s about a whole host of portfolio of initiatives and i offer them in the book as well mehdi hasan you keep saying you didn t say aid should go to zero dambisa moyo yes mehdi hasan but didn t you famously i mean there was a lot of controversy around when it came it the book that you said what if one by one african countries each received a phone call telling them in exactly five years the aid taps would be shut off permanently dambisa moyo yes but i didn t say that that s what they should do i said what if what if is a question it is not a statement mehdi hasan and one final question robert kennedy famously said in 1968 that gdp this measuring of economic growth quote does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages it measures neither our wisdom nor our learning neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile do you agree with him dambisa moyo well yes and to some degree because simon kuznets when he came up with the gdp statistics and he had a brilliant saying he said the truth of the matter is that there are four categories of countries they are underdeveloped developed japan and argentina nobody knows why japan grows and why argentina doesn t and i think that really is emblematic of the field of economics we are learning we re evolving we re innovating and a lot of what has been said here is food for thought it s things that people are trying to re engineer to improve on and i would not suggest that we should throw out all the knowledge and all the impact that was mentioned earlier all the benefits and the significant improvements that the world has seen i mean today 71 years old is the global average for life expectancy these are significant benefits that have occurred over the last half century and i think we do need to actually recognise that there have been benefits on the system and we do need to tweak and focus on improving the ones where there have been weaknesses mehdi hasan dambisa moyo we ll have to leave it there thanks to our audience here in the oxford union thanks to our panel of amazing experts and thanks to dambisa moyo for joining us on head to head dambisa moyo thank you thank you

across the board with the pound sterling us dollar gbpusd retreating from a weekly high of 1 2797 finding a floor at 1 2706 before a slight rebound at the start of the asian session the pull back in

is the potential for an economic slowdown priced in to financial assets there s been no bigger question in global markets after riskier assets such as stocks melted down in december judging by the recent performance msci all country world index the answer seems to be yes in the u s for example the 19 9 percent plunge in the msci usa index between late september and christmas eve left shares trading at their lowest levels since 2013 relative to estimated earnings even with the rebound since then investors are pricing in about a 60 percent chance of a typical recession this year where earnings drop by 9 percent according to strategists at jpmorgan chase co led by nikolaos panigirtzoglou that seems extreme considering economists surveyed by bloomberg news put the odds at about 20 percent market participants will get a better sense of how corporate america sees the outlook in coming weeks as companies report fourth quarter results the cynics might argue that given the deep slide in stocks last quarter executives have cover to lowball the outlook so they can look good by beating these lowered expectations later in the year although the consensus is for u s companies to report greater than 12 percent growth in fourth quarter earnings increases in the first quarter are forecast to be less than 4 percent and less than 5 percent for the second quarter as the benefit of lower tax rates wear off according to bianco research for the year earnings are seen rising a bit less than 8 percent while that wouldn t be as good as the greater than 20 percent gains in earnings seen in recent quarters it would be a nice surprise given jpmorgan s analysis that stocks have traded as if a 9 percent decline is likely on monday the msci usa index rallied 0 74 percent adding to friday s 3 45 percent surge the global msci all country world index posted a two day gain of 3 52 percent the most since mid 2016 we have a respectable probability that friday s rally and the last week and a half s rally has more legs behind it david sowerby managing director and portfolio manager at ancora advisors in cleveland told bloomberg news junk bond sell off takes a breather speculative grade corporate bonds and loans are also enjoying a rebound which would be unusual if fixed income investors generally considered more savvy when it comes to the economy than equity investors were really convinced that a recession was on the horizon an index measuring the cost to insure speculative grade corporate bonds with credit default swaps has posted its biggest two day drop since august 2015 morgan stanley s credit strategists wrote in a research note monday that they are turning a bit less bearish reducing their underweight recommendation on u s credit markets and recommending investors add some credit risk tactically while noting that this is not a change in our long term view we continue to believe that credit is in a bear market and that a long slow turn in the credit cycle has begun they wrote as of last week investors were demanding an extra 5 37 percentage points in yield over benchmark u s treasuries to own junk bonds up from less than 3 20 percent points in early october by way of comparison spreads ballooned to almost 9 percentage points in early 2016 valuations just got too cheap unless you expect a recession and a spike in default activity michael marzouk a portfolio manager at pacific asset management told bloomberg news in regards to a corresponding rally in leveraged loans emerging markets back in goldilocks mode it would be easy to dismiss the rally in u s stocks and junk bonds as just a short term bounce inside an inevitable bear market brought on by a synchronized global economic slowdown until emerging markets are brought into the conversation while the outlook for developed economies is rather gloomy the currencies of emerging markets are enjoying a bit of a renaissance suggesting any global slowdown may not be too severe on monday the msci emerging markets currency index rose to its highest level since july having risen in eight of the past 10 weeks the brazilian real south african rand and russian ruble are leading the gains so far this year with all three currencies appreciating at least 3 percent against the dollar emerging markets have been buoyed by signals from federal reserve officials that they might slow the pace of interest rate increases if u s economic growth continues to decelerate rate hikes from the fed was largely blamed for the poor performance of emerging market assets through the first three quarters of 2018 the goldilocks scenario turned to tatters during 2018 piotr matys an emerging market foreign exchange strategist at rabobank wrote in a research note monday as reported by bloomberg news s justin carrigan however it seems that this expression has been dusted off from the lexicon of financial markets following comments from fed chairman jerome powell on friday who gave severely battered investors what they wanted to hear dollars and debts the government may be shut but the treasury department is open and it said monday that the amount of u s debt outstanding as of year end was 21 974 trillion an all time high what that means is that the government added 1 48 trillion of debt in 2018 almost triple the 515 9 billion added in 2017 as the u s increased borrowing to help make up for the revenue lost by slashing corporate tax rates a number of strategists have cited the rising debt load and widening budget deficit as a reason for the recent weakness in the greenback the bloomberg dollar spot index which measures the currency against its major peers fell on monday to its lowest since october the international monetary fund released its quarterly report

we ve been warning for a while now a u s recession when it happens will be the game changer for the dollar and would likely push it into a multi year downtrend as the fed cuts rates and the budget deficit blows out the currency strategists at brown brothers harriman wrote in a research note monday the only thing limiting the dollar s losses recently is that things in the rest of the world aren t looking too good either sugar s on a sugar high all eyes in the commodities market monday were on sugar which posted its biggest rally since april 2016 by rising as much as 6 20 percent it was rare bright spot for a commodity that has fallen 17 percent over the past 12 months oddly enough the rally appears tied to the rebound in oil prices amid news that opec is following through on its pledge to cut output the thinking is that rising oil prices will help boost demand for cane based ethanol from brazil which happens to be the world s biggest sugar producer more specifically brazilian sugar mills may switch to the biofuel to take advantage of higher prices limiting supplies of sweetener from the world s largest exporter according to bloomberg news s gerson freitas jr and lynn thomasson motorists in brazil have become used to filling the tank with ethanol after a change in government policies on gasoline pricing made the cane based fuel more competitive hedge funds and other large

futures and options show tea leaves there s no end in sight to the u s government shutdown which means the normally steady release of economic data has slowed to a trickle as such there s the chance that those releases that don t come from the government and don t usually get top billing will suddenly get a lot more scrutiny the national federation of small business s optimism index is one such report due to be released on tuesday the median estimate among economists surveyed by bloomberg is for a fourth consecutive decline to 103 for december from 104 8 in november that s still a very high level given that the index was below 95 in the months before donald trump was elected u s president in november 2016 what market participants want to keep an eye on is the percentage of respondents who expect the economy to improve in november s survey that percentage collapsed to 22 percent the lowest since november 2016 and down from 33 percent in october and as we now know the economy slowed markedly in december as bloomberg economics notes small businesses benefited from tax reform in 2018 but those benefits are going away also a split congress implies there is likely to be less benefit

a statue of alexander hamilton in front of the u s treasury department headquarters in washington dc flickr tyler merbler with the u s national debt already exceeding 15 trillion tax reform championed by president trump and increased spending are adding to the country s deficits by james mcbride left and andrew chatzky right introduction the u s national debt is once again raising alarm bells federal borrowing from outside investors expanded rapidly over the past decade totaling more than 15 trillion in 2018 and it is projected to grow even faster over the next ten years under current law major budget legislation signed by president donald j trump along with continued growth in entitlements and higher interest rates will see the debt nearly double by 2028 coming close to the size of the entire u s economy if the debt continues to grow at an unsustainable level it could expose the country to a number of dangers economists say in the extreme the risk rises that washington s lenders many of whom are foreign could suddenly lose confidence demand higher interest rates and trigger a fiscal crisis short of that rising debt could gradually squeeze discretionary spending and deny the country tools it needs for security and economic stability reducing the debt experts say will require politically difficult decisions to either curb entitlement spending raise taxes or both how did the debt get where it is today the united states has run annual deficits spending more than the treasury collects almost every year since the nation s founding the period since world war ii during which the united states emerged as a global superpower is a good starting point from which to examine modern debt levels defense spending during the war led to unprecedented borrowing with the debt skyrocketing to more than 100 percent of gross domestic product gdp in 1946 the deficit is a yearly measure while debt refers to the cumulative amount that the government owes measuring both deficits and debt as a proportion of gdp is a standard way of comparing spending over time since it automatically adjusts for inflation population growth and changes in per capita income over the next thirty years sustained economic growth gradually reduced the debt as a percentage of the economy despite wars in korea and vietnam and the establishment of medicare and medicaid in 1967 the entitlement programs first year in existence spending for both of them amounted to less than 1 percent of gdp overall debt as a percentage of gdp bottomed out in 1974 at 24 percent beginning in the 1980s ballooning defense spending and sweeping tax cuts ushered in a new period of rising debt during the 1990s a combination of tax increases defense cuts and an economic boom reduced the debt as a percentage of gdp and beginning in 1998 brought four consecutive years of budget surpluses the first such streak in forty years deficits returned under president george w bush who oversaw a period of tax cuts war spending in afghanistan and iraq and major new entitlements such as medicare part d annual deficits hit record levels more than 1 trillion under president barack obama who in response to the great recession continued the bush administration s bank bailout program and provided hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus what does the current federal budget and debt look like in 2018 the federal government spent 4 1 trillion while it took in just 3 3 trillion in revenue leaving a budget deficit of almost 800 billion according to the congressional budget office cbo a nonpartisan government agency most of the federal budget goes toward entitlement programs such as social security medicare and medicaid unlike discretionary spending which congress must authorize each year through the appropriations process entitlements are mandatory spending which is automatic unless congress alters the underlying legislation in the 2017 fiscal year the most recent for which the cbo has provided its detailed breakdown only thirty percent of federal spending went toward discretionary spending programs with defense spending taking up roughly half that debt held by the public the measure of how much the government owes to outside investors stands at 15 3 trillion it has nearly doubled since 2007 rising from about 40 percent to nearly 80 percent of gdp counting intragovernmental debt or debts owed by one u s government agency to another brings the total to more than 20 trillion more than 120 percent of gdp where is the debt headed the cbo projects that annual deficits will breach the 1 trillion mark again by 2020 and remain above that level indefinitely under the current tax and spending regime on this steep trajectory the publicly held u s debt will nearly double to 29 trillion over the next decade this would bring the number close to 100 percent of gdp a level not reached since 1946 what are the primary drivers of future debt the main drivers are mandatory spending programs namely social security the largest u s government program medicare and medicaid their costs which currently account for 45 percent of all federal spending are expected to surge as a percentage of gdp because of the aging u s population and resultant rising health expenses meanwhile interest payments on the debt which now account for 7 percent of the budget are expected to rise relative to other outlays as interest rates rebound from historically low levels and debt continues to accumulate the discretionary budget which includes spending on programs ranging from defense to transportation is expected to shrink as a portion of the budget how do recent budget measures factor into this president trump signed off on several pieces of legislation with implications for the debt the most significant of these is the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 signed into law in december 2017 it is the most comprehensive tax reform legislation in three decades trump and some republican lawmakers have said the bill s tax cuts will boost economic growth enough to increase government revenues and balance the budget but many economists are skeptical of this claim the cbo says that by cutting both corporate and individual taxes the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 combined with the administration s sweeping deregulatory moves will increase savings investment and labor force participation which the agency says will boost annual gdp by close to 1 percent over the next ten years cfr symposium american debt causes consequences and fixes however the cbo projects the law will add significantly to annual budget shortfalls in the coming years analysts at the agency say the tax cuts will add another roughly 1 85 trillion to the debt over the next ten years even more worrisome they say is a scenario in which many of the provisions that are set to expire by 2025 such as tax cuts for individuals are renewed which would pile on even more to the debt spending deals passed in 2018 are also projected to increase the deficit congressional leaders agreed in february 2018 on a two year budget deal funding some discretionary programs through 2019 the deal raised discretionary spending by some 300 billion increasing the deficit more rapidly than would have been the case under the status quo moreover the legislation did not make any cuts to entitlements a politically unpopular move that most budget experts say is nevertheless necessary to contain the debt how does u s debt compare to that of other countries the united states debt to gdp ratio is among the highest in the developed world among other major industrialized countries the united states is behind only belgium portugal italy greece and japan what makes u s borrowing special the united states has long been the world s largest economy with no record of defaulting on its debt moreover since the 1940s it has been the world s reserve currency country as a result the u s dollar is considered the most desirable currency in the world high demand for the dollar has helped the united states finance its debt as many investors put a premium on holding low risk dollar denominated assets such as u s treasury bills notes and bonds these treasuries are the primary financial instruments that the u s treasury issues to finance its spending steady demand from foreign creditors largely central banks adding to their dollar reserves rather than market investors is one factor that has helped the united states to borrow money at relatively low interest rates who holds the debt the bulk of u s debt is held by investors who buy treasuries at varying maturities and interest rates this includes both domestic and foreign investors as well as both governmental and private funds foreign investors mostly governments hold more than 40 percent of the total by far the two largest holders of treasuries are china and japan which each hold more than 1 trillion for most of the last decade china has been the largest creditor of the united states apart from china and japan no other country holds more than 317 billion why does rising u s debt matter economists say there are a number of risks associated with rising u s debt it could divert investment from vital areas servicing an ever growing debt especially if interest rates rise significantly will consume resources that could rob spending from sectors such as infrastructure education and basic research it could shrink the u s global footprint without legislative action interest on the debt and mandatory government programs such as medicare will claim a growing piece of the budget pie leaving fewer dollars for u s military diplomatic and humanitarian operations around the world it could become a drag on the economy some experts argue that there is a tipping point beyond which large accumulations of government debt begin to slow growth they posit that this could be a result of investors becoming more pessimistic about the economy as debt levels rise which could rapidly drive up interest rates and thereby reduce private investment it could precipitate a fiscal crisis many experts warn that if u s debt continues to rise investors will eventually lose confidence in washington s ability to right its fiscal ship and become unwilling to finance u s borrowing without much higher interest rates if many investors begin fleeing to alternatives it may become prohibitively expensive for washington to attract new buyers of debt resulting in even larger deficits and increased borrowing or what is sometimes called a debt spiral a fiscal crisis of this nature could necessitate sudden and economically painful spending cuts or tax increases it could hamper the country s ability to navigate future economic crises in the view of some experts massive debt accumulation could undermine u s global leadership by eroding washington s ability to respond to future crises another major financial crisis like that of 2008 2009 could require new large scale stimulus spending a response that would be difficult given the u s debt load it could also constrain the nation s ability to mobilize for an unexpected military conflict weaken its global aid commitments or siphon funds from the national security budget finally it could leave the country vulnerable to foreign governments especially china that hold large chunks of u s debt and could potentially use the threat of a sell off as leverage i think it s clear if you do simple arithmetic that the fiscal path that the nation is on is simply not sustainable said erskine bowles the democratic co chair of president obama s bipartisan national commission on fiscal responsibility otherwise known as the simpson bowles commission at a 2012 cfr event and if i had to give you an analogy i would say that the deficits are truly like a cancer and over time they are going to destroy our country from within he said however a few economists including nobel laureate paul krugman maintain that some of the debt concerns are overblown and suggest that washington still has decades to tackle the problem they say entitlement spending and health care costs are not growing as quickly as predicted and that the cost of actually financing the debt in terms of interest payments as a portion of gdp is at its lowest level since the 1970s jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities warned at a cfr meeting in may 2018 about a deficit attention disorder that focuses too much on the issue we ve been so outspoken about the downsides of these deficits and they haven t materialized he said what are the policy options for dealing with the debt politicians and policy experts have put forward countless plans over the years to balance the federal budget and reduce the debt most include a combination of deep spending cuts and tax increases to bend the debt curve cut spending most comprehensive proposals to rein in the debt include major spending cuts especially for growing entitlement programs which are the main drivers of future spending increases for instance the 2010 simpson bowles plan which many experts considered the gold standard of deficit reduction plans would have put debt on a downward path and reduced overall spending including military spending it also would have reduced medicare and medicaid payments and put social security on a sustainable footing by reducing some benefits and raising the retirement age raise revenue most budget reform plans also seek to raise tax revenue whether by eliminating deductions and other tax subsidies raising rates on higher earners or introducing new taxes such as a carbon tax simpson bowles would have raised more than 1 trillion in new tax revenue analysts estimate that the 2017 tax reform will reduce federal revenue by some 1 5 trillion over ten years some optimists believe that the federal government could continue expanding the debt many years into the future with few consequences thanks to the deep reservoirs of trust the u s economy has accumulated in the eyes of investors but many economists say this is simply too risky why run the experiment former cbo director douglas holtz eakin said at a cfr symposium in may 2018 fix it these are all self inflicted problems we should just fix it originally published by the

speaking at a meeting with former fed officials at a conference in atlanta last friday federal reserve chairman jerome powell said that the fed does not have a predetermined plan to raise the key interest rate and that the central bank will be more flexible in its monetary policy this year this is the new position of the head of the fed earlier in december powell argued that the process of reducing the balance goes smoothly and reaches its goal so they do not intend to change anything at the central bank after powell s speech on friday the dollar fell sharply and stock indices closed the day with a noticeable gain futures on federal funds which investors use to bet on fed policy last wednesday indicated a 91 chance that interest rates would be reduced this year or remain at the same level investors are increasingly inclined to think that in 2019 the fed will not raise interest rates the more cautious position of the fed in this matter voiced by powell on friday confirms investors opinion that the fed is likely to refrain from raising rates in 2019 at all this is a fundamental change compared to the beginning of november when a 90 probability of a rate hike in 2019 was predicted this means that stock markets have already reached the local bottom in late december and if the macro data from the united states comes with positive indicators and there is a positive trend in resolving the trade conflict between the united states and china stock indexes will quickly regain their positions and the threat of breaking the almost 10 year bull trend of the us stock market will change to a return of positive dynamics the fate of the dollar will also depend entirely on the actions of the fed and other global central banks if the fed does not raise rates and other central banks begin to curtail its soft monetary policy the dollar which grew by about 4 8 last year will be vulnerable to other competing currencies this year 15 00 cad bank of canada interest rate decision accompanying statement of the bank of canada report of the bank of canada monetary policy committee the bank of canada will decide on the interest rate in december the bank of canada did not change its monetary policy in a companion statement the central bank stated that the pace of further rate hikes will depend on a number of factors including the impact of this process on consumption and the housing market as well as on the situation in international trade policy shock resilience in relation to oil prices the situation with companies investments and the economic assessment given by the bank of canada will also play an important role in making decisions about the future course of monetary policy the bank of canada said probably at a meeting on wednesday the bank of canada will once again keep the interest rate at 1 75 probably on the eve of this meeting of the bank the canadian dollar will remain under pressure economists forecast a further slowdown in the canadian economy amid falling oil prices and deferred effects of earlier increases in interest rates the consequences of a tightening policy by the bank of canada as well as a slowdown in wages and a weak housing market have a negative impact on the activity of the country s households in their accompanying statement and report on changes in monetary policy representatives of the bank of canada will explain the position of the bank and assess the current economic situation in the country the hard tone of the accompanying statement of the bank of canada regarding rising inflation and the prospects for further monetary tightening will cause a strengthening of the canadian dollar if the bank of canada signals to extend the period for maintaining a soft monetary policy the canadian currency will

the report may cause cad reinforcement 15 15 cad press conference of the bank of canada during the press conference the head of the bank of canada stephen poloz will explain the position of the bank

future policy of the central bank of great britain volatility during his speech usually increases dramatically in the pound trade and in the ftse index of the london stock exchange if mark carney gives any hints of tightening or easing of monetary policy if he does not touch the monetary policy issues of the bank of england then the reaction to his speech will be weak also investors will be interested in the current position of the bank of england in relation to brexit in one of his recent speeches mark carney said that the management of the bank of england does not doubt the ability of british banks to resist if the brexit negotiations end in nothing in his opinion the withdrawal of great britain from the eu without an agreement would be a real economic shock in this situation raising or lowering interest rates by the bank of england is not so important for the economy probably during his speech mark carney will again talk about the prospects of the uk economy and the

us dollars reducing stocks as a rule has a positive effect on oil prices the previous value is 0 007 million barrels of oil and petroleum products if the reserves of oil and petroleum products in the united states rose again last week then this will adversely affect oil prices in recent days there has been an increase in oil prices after a sharp drop in the last 3 months in september the price of brent crude oil was 86 60 per barrel which is a multi year high the fall in global stock indices and signs of a slowdown in global economic growth also adversely affect oil prices there is no sign of

increases because the text of the protocol often contains either changes or clarification of details regarding the outcome of the december meeting of the fomc fed the soft tone of the protocol will

zimbabwe s ongoing currency crisis can be best described as a conundrum not only is it problematic but it is also confusing and complex zimbabwe s ongoing currency crisis can be best described as a conundrum not only is it problematic but it is also confusing and complex by tatira zwinoira on the one hand you have an evident devaluation of local money electronic transfers and mobile money and on the other government still insists parity between the two mediums of exchange curiously the same government which directed banks to separate local money from hard currency deposits last october is now demanding taxes in foreign currency from businesses that trade in foreign currency analysts note that the growing devaluation of local money is as a result of an increase in money supply through mainly treasury bills tbs issuances according to reserve bank of zimbabwe statistics nostro accounts averaged 227 12 million a month between january and october last year while broad money supply averaged 8 91 billion to unravel this conundrum one needs to examine the origin of the crisis followed by the resulting problem distortion and possible solutions experts agree that the current currency crisis was triggered by a gradual increase in money supply in the country over the past years against its ability to generate foreign currency largely blamed on tbs before dollarisation tbs used to be issued to control money supply raise short term finance for government and provide financial institutions with liquid security to use as collateral to borrow money however this stopped after dollarisation resulting in a loss of monetary autonomy and the central bank ceasing to act as a lender of last resort as such in 2012 tbs once more started to be issued to restore the bank s lender of last resort status as it could no longer control money supply generate forex and had an indebtedness of over 1 billion accumulated during the hyperinflationary period but over the years since its re emergence tb issuances slowly became an increasingly reliable way to fund government expenditure to a point where by the end of 2016 at least 2 1 billion had been issued with no other means of borrowing zero external support due to a huge foreign debt and government failing to control its spending the issuance of statutory paper drastically increased as a result from the end of 2016 to august last year tbs grew by 5 1 billion thus increasing the money supply at a rate faster than the country s ability to generate forex to support it considering the economy was now dollarised in zimbabwe forex generation is largely from exports foreign direct investment fdi and diaspora remittances three sources that have been severely constrained in recent years exports have not increased at a corresponding pace with the rise in imports leading to a high trade deficit fdi has been low averaging between 250 million and 400 million as the country has failed to attract investment from abroad diaspora remittances have also not been forthcoming reaching some 440 million as of september last year so that was the problem too much money in the economy which was not supported by production or available foreign currency so by the end of 2016 we started to see the emergence of cash premiums at around 10 or so because we had injected 1 4 billion tbs into the economy and did not stop there economic analyst persistence gwanyanya said government continued to print more tbs and inject them into the economy resulting in the money supply continuing to grow we saw the government continue to print more money for different reasons such as support of its parastatals and other state entities we saw a significant raise between 2017 and 2018 where our money supply increased by about 5 billion or so which is what worsened the current currency situation within such a short space of time so it is largely linked to the indiscipline at government level whose result was an increase in money supply he said between 2009 and 2013 money supply was contained within the available levels of circulation a report titled zimbabwe food security outlook december 2018 to may 2019 by a united states agency noted that currency shortages were behind the rise in basic living costs critical foreign currency shortages continue affecting almost every sector of the economy the parallel market for foreign currency persists despite some government measures to curb it although the official exchange rate remains at 1 1 with the bond note the us dollar is trading at over 300 against the local bond note real time gross settlement rtgs and mobile money transfers the report reads to further compound the economic situation currency shortages continue to drive nationwide shortages in fuel including diesel petrol paraffin and cooking gas and prices for these fuels have increased these shortages and high prices are adversely affecting industries and the general population since the introduction of new tax and currency measures in october most commodity prices have more than doubled these measures also spurred speculative pricing in the economy most goods and services are increasingly being charged in scarce us dollars or at highly inflated parallel market prices in bond notes rtgs or mobile transfers making them inaccessible to a large section of the population the rise in prices led to the official year on year inflation rate jumping 15 46 percentage points to 20 85 in october 2018 and another 10 16 percentage points to 31 01 in november last year however economists continue to dispute these figures as they seem to greatly differ with what is transpiring on the market such inflationary pressures have led to two tier prices where customers paying in us dollar receive discounts to solve the current currency challenges experts have been pushing government to liberalise the foreign currency exchange system the most effective and efficient way of doing it is to have an exchange control policy framework that then guides the market so i am not saying there should just be a free market it is much like what we used to have in the 1980s even in the 90s banking expert clive mphambela said we had a framework which worked which said these are the priority areas and these are the exchange control areas where you go to the market to access foreign exchange depending on how you fit into that framework what we currently have is a situation where everything goes into a pot and someone decides who and who not to give finance minister mthuli ncube last friday set up a forex allocation committee comprising four members from the central bank two drawn from the finance ministry and another two from industry and commerce as well as energy and power development ministries however the business community has largely slammed this committee zimbabwe national chamber of commerce chief executive officer christopher mugaga speaking to newsday yesterday said the central bank had no right to control forex it does not earn in november 2018 economist ashok chakravarti proposed a hybrid foreign currency management system or the creation of a long maturity us dollar brady type bond to preserve savings we have to create a liberalised interbank foreign exchange market in this market all exporters holders of foreign exchange and diasporans will be freely allowed to sell their foreign exchange to importers initially we start with priority areas because we don t have enough for luxury uses chakravarti said so this interbank market has been created in nigeria and in west africa it is highly successful so that is what we need to do since then businesses and consumers alike have been calling on government to liberalise the foreign exchange market which it may be forced to do considering the worsening currency crisis
the u s economy will show strength in 2019 clocking a modest growth of 2 6 percent as it benefits from the tax cuts and spending increases of the previous year but other major economies will see growth slowing further continuing on the divergent trend seen last year nariman behravesh chief economist at ihs markit said in a note that the fundamentals of the u s economy remained fairly solid with estimates pointing toward sustainable growth in labor force and productivity he expects the u s economy to grow at a 2 6 percent annualized rate this year the economy grew 2 9 percent in 2018 compared with only 2 2 percent in 2017 the acceleration was almost entirely due to a large dose of fiscal stimulus tax cuts and spending increases put in place at the beginning of the year the impact of this stimulus will still be felt in 2019 but with diminishing potency as the year progresses behravesh said ihs markit said the u s economy will face pressures in the form of weakness in the housing market strength in the dollar tightening credit conditions and higher tariffs the economy will find support in lower interest rates at least by recent historical standards fiscal stimulus that is still aiding growth and lower oil prices it said ihs markit sees policy mistakes as the biggest threat to global growth in 2019 and beyond the effect of major fiscal stimulus unveiled by the u s will fade leaving the world s largest economy with a legacy of trillion dollar annual budget deficits as far as the eye can see and steadily rising debt levels this means that the united states will have very little room for fiscal stimulus when the economy next goes into recession ihs markit said the u s federal reserve s monetary policy this year is expected to be more dependent on the incoming economic data estimates of the neutral federal funds rate and the implications of a partially inverted yield curve ihs markit said majority analysts polled by international business times expected the fed to reduce the number of rate increases in 2019 given weaker growth and muted inflationary pressures however the pace of removing accommodation is likely to be even more modest than previously expected it said ihs markit expects three interest rate increases in 2019 and one in 2020 ihs markit sees a modest increase in u s core personal consumption inflation the fed s preferred measure of inflation for which it has a target of 2 percent at 2 1 percent this year from 1 8 percent in 2018 the u s dollar is expected to continue to hold at current elevated levels for much of 2019 continued above trend u s growth and more rate hikes by the fed compared with most other central banks are the primary reasons for this expected strength ihs markit said the strength in the u s dollar along with weaker global growth and gradual tightening of credit conditions will continue to see volatility in commodity markets and pose significant downside risks global economies face headwinds while the global economy started strong in 2018 the momentum faded as the year advanced fiscal stimulus in the u s helped the economy grow however growth in other economies including the euro zone united kingdom japan and china began to weaken ihs expects this divergent trend to continue in 2019 growth in europe japan china and emerging markets will likely decelerate in 2019 and decline further in 2020 ihs markit predicts that global growth will edge down from 3 2 percent in 2018 to 3 0 percent in 2019 and will keep decelerating over the next few years behravesh said in the note ihs markit expects expansion in europe to slow further euro zone growth will slip to 1 5 percent in 2019 and decline to 1 2 percent in 2020 growth in the euro area has been trending down since peaking at 2 5 percent in second half of 2017 it was 1 9 percent last year less accommodative credit conditions global trade growth and political risks including uncertainty surrounding brexit were marked as main factors for the deceleration in growth in the region japan s recovery will remain weak ihs said in its note growth will likely hold close to a rate of 0 9 percent in 2019 before slipping to 0 5 percent in 2020 the expected rise in construction spending ahead of the 2020 olympics will sustain growth in 2019 but the boost will fade by the end of the year the note said growth in china will continue to edge lower to 6 3 percent in 2019 before declining further to 6 percent in 2020 china s real gdp in the third quarter 2018 was 6 5 percent on a year on year rate the lowest since the financial crisis while several monetary and fiscal measures have been taken by the chinese authorities to support the economy during the ongoing trade war ihs markit said the measures are likely to remain modest credit growth will continue to be constrained by the massive debt overhang and the government s commitment to deleveraging at least in the medium to long term on the other hand the government s stimulus efforts may well become more aggressive if the trade tensions with the united states re escalate and growth is seriously damaged ihs markit said growth in the emerging world has topped out ihs markit said adding growth in the region will slide to 4 6 percent in 2019 growth among the emerging market countries edged lower to 4 8 percent in 2018 after growing at 4 9 percent in 2017 ihs expects emerging markets to face a number of headwinds in 2019 first growth in the advanced economies about 60 percent of world gdp is slowing as is the pace of world trade second global financial conditions are getting gradually tighter and the dollar is expected to remain strong third commodity prices will remain volatile and could be trending down over the next year last but by no means least rising political uncertainty in countries such as brazil and mexico could scare away foreign capital inflows a few countries will be able to buck these trends especially dynamic economies with low levels of debt notably in asia ihs said in its note

nafta had been in effect for just a few months when ruben ruiz got a job at the itapsa factory in mexico city in the summer of 1994 itapsa made auto brakes for echlin a u s manufacturer later bought out by the huge dana aftermarket group in the factory asbestos dust from brake parts coated machines and people alike ruiz had hardly begun his first shift when a machine malfunctioned cutting four fingers from the hand of the man operating it it seemed clear to ruiz that things were very wrong so he went to a meeting to talk about organizing a union when itapsa managers got wind of the effort they began firing the organizers nevertheless many of the workers joined stimahcs an independent democratic union of metalworkers itapsa workers filed a petition for an election but then discovered that they already a had union a unit of the confederation of mexican workers ctm they d never seen the union contract in essence a protection contract which insulates the company from labor unrest the plant s hr manager told ruiz that echlin management in the u s said any worker organizing an independent union should be immediately fired he told me my name was on a list of those people ruiz recounted and i was discharged right there nevertheless there was a vote in september 1997 to decide which union workers wanted but before the election a state police agent drove a car filled with rifles into the plant two busloads of strangers arrived armed with clubs and copper rods expand david bacon during the voting workers were escorted by ctm functionaries past the club and rifle wielding strangers some workers were forcibly kept in a part of the factory to keep them from voting at the polling station employees were asked aloud which union they favored in front of management and ctm representatives stimahcs tried to get the election canceled but the government body administering it the conciliation and arbitration board jca went ahead even after thugs roughed up one of the independent union s organizers predictably stimahcs lost for 20 years the itapsa election has been a symbol of all that s gone wrong with mexico s labor law which provides protection on paper for workers seeking to organize but which has been routinely undermined by a succession of governments bent on using a low wage workforce to attract foreign investment dana corporation was just one beneficiary itapsa has been the norm not the exception in 2015 thousands of farm workers struck u s growers in baja california instead of recognizing their new independent union however growers signed protection contracts with the ctm which were certified by the local jca strikers were blacklisted later that year workers tried to register an independent union in four juarez factories some 120 workers making ink cartridges for lexmark were fired as were another 170 at adc commscope and many more at foxconn and eaton the labor board declined to reinstate the fired workers in juarez and baja following the pattern it had set at itapsa two decades earlier indeed the jncs have been key to the defeat of workers attempts to form democratic unions invariably protecting employers and corporate friendly unions the new mexican government headed by president andres manuel lopez obrador amlo says that s all over deputy secretary of labor in the new administration alfredo dominguez marrufo promises that after all these struggles we can finally get rid of the protection contract system we can make our unions democratic choose our own leaders and negotiate our own contracts this government will defend the freedom of workers to organize that right has existed in theory but we ve had a structure making it impossible this will change that could have a big impact on political life in mexico where corporate union leaders have had an inside track to political power and corruption it could change the dominating role u s corporations have played in the mexican economy and affect relations between workers in both countries most of all it would raise a standard of living for workers that lopez obrador has called among the lowest on the planet in his speech to the mexican congress during his december 1 inauguration the new president charged that 36 years of neoliberal economic reforms had lowered the purchasing power of mexico s minimum wage by 60 percent today on the border that wage comes to a little above 4 per day according to university of california professor harley shaiken the mexican government created an investment climate that depends on a vast number of low wage earners this climate gets all the government s attention while the consumer climate the ability of people to buy what they produce is sacrificed protecting corporations from demands for higher wages has made mexico a profitable place to do business big auto companies the world s major garment manufacturers the global high tech electronic assemblers all built huge plants to take advantage of mexico s neoliberal economic policies starting more than two decades before the negotiation of the north american free trade agreement that wild west climate for investors produced more than low wages however be tween 1988 and 1992 163 juarez children were born with anencephaly without brains an extremely rare disorder health critics charged that the defects were due to exposure to toxic chemicals in the factories or their toxic discharges the chilpancingo colonia below the mesa in tijuana where the battery plant of metales y derivados was located experienced the same plague as the companies came south the people came north during the neoliberal period we became the second country in the world with the highest migration lopez obrador charged they live and work in the united states 24 million mexicans they are sending 30 billion a year to their families the greatest social benefit we receive from abroad in his six year campaign for office in which he spoke in practically every sizeable town in the country lopez obrador repeated what he later told the congress that only development to combat poverty and marginalization as has never been done in history would provide an alternative to migration we will put aside the neoliberal hypocrisy he announced those born poor will not be condemned to die poor we want migration to be optional not mandatory happy where they were born where their family members their customs and their cultures are in his speech lopez obrador criticized two other neoliberal articles of faith that privatization of the state owned section of the mexican economy would lead to economic growth and that pro corporate changes in its labor law would create jobs and higher incomes starting before nafta was passed mexican president carlos salinas de gortari rammed through the congress changes in the constitution s guarantees of land reform to make private land ownership easier many of the communal ejidos created in previous decades were dissolved and their lands sold to investors farmers became wage workers on land they d previously owned subsequent land reforms led to granting foreign mining companies concessions on over a third of mexico s territory allowing them to develop operations even in the face of local opposition prices on basic goods were decontrolled and government subsidies on food were cut back or ended altogether in 1998 the government dissolved conasupo a system of state run stores selling basic foodstuffs like tortillas and milk at subsidized low prices at the same time price supports for small corn growers were also ended as nafta allowed u s corporations to flood the mexican market with cheap subsidized imported corn millions of farmers were displaced no longer able to sell their corn at a price that paid for growing it mexico is the origin of corn that blessed plant lopez obrador noted bitterly and now we are the nation that imports the most corn in the world he announced that a conasupo like subsidized food production and distribution system would be reestablished privatization marked a 180 degree change in the direction of mexican economic policy after its 1910 20 revolution nationalists believed that to be truly independent mexico had to ensure its resources were controlled by mexicans and used for their benefit the route to this control was nationalization to stop the transfer of wealth out of the country and to set up an internal market in which what was produced in mexico would be sold there as well mexico therefore guaranteed rights to workers that u s unions and workers could only dream of severance pay was mandatory and workers had a right to profit sharing during legal strikes companies had to shut their doors until the dispute was resolved on paper the government acknowledged the right of all people to education and housing in return however mexican unions gave up autonomy and control of their own affairs the government registered unions and oversaw their internal processes and choice of leaders it never tolerated independent action by workers and unions outside its political structure when the government changed its basic economic policy using low wages to attract foreign investment and producing for the us market instead of for mexico the government could and did punish resistance severely under presidents salinas de gortari and ernesto zedillo 1988 2000 privatization reforms became a whirlwind among the companies and industries affected were the aeromexico airline the telephone company the petrochemical industry dependent on the state run oil company the sicartsa steel mill the railroad network many mexican mines and the operation of the country s ports the leader of the union at aeromexico was imprisoned after he refused to accept the company s privatization and the layoff of thousands of workers the head of one of the largest sections of the union for employees of the social security system imss also spent months in jail in 1995 for denouncing government plans to privatize the enormous federal pension and health care agency expand david bacon in 1991 the mexican army took over the port of veracruz disbanded the longshore union and installed three private contractors to load and unload ships hourly wages of veracruz longshoremen fell from about 7 00 to 1 00 even as productivity rose from 18 to over 40 shipping containers handled per hour when the sicartsa steel mill was privatized in 1992 wages were cut in half and 1500 of the mill s 5000 workers were laid off they were then rehired as temporary labor under 28 day contracts the mexican government sold the cananea and nacozari copper mines among the world s largest to german larrea s grupo mexico at a fraction of their book value in 1997 larrea bought the 4052 mile pacific north railroad in partnership with pennsylvania based union pacific workers throughout northern mexico mounted a series of rolling wildcat strikes over cuts in its workforce of 13 000 by more than half they lost thirteen mexican financiers became billionaires during the salinas administration and larrea was one of them grupo mexico forced cananea s miners union to go on strike in 2009 a conflict that is still unresolved after 65 miners were entombed by an explosion in grupo mexico s pasta de conchos coal mine in 2006 the union s president napoleon gomez urrutia was forced into exile in canada he d accused larrea of industrial homicide for giving up rescue efforts after only three days this october gomez urrutia was elected senator in sonora on the morena ticket lopez obrador s party in formation and finally returned from canada to take office the harshest privatization came in 2009 when president felipe calderon dissolved the state owned power and light company of central mexico in firing all its 44 000 workers calderon hoped to destroy one of mexico s oldest and most democratic unions the mexican electrical workers sme the company s operations were folded into the federal electricity commission private electrical generation was already permitted by salinas and zedillo and lopez obrador s immediate predecessor enrique peña nieto had set up plans for private power sale to consumers meanwhile the federal electricity commission itself was slated for elimination peña nieto pushed a constitutional reform through congress to reverse the guarantee of national ownership of both the oil and electrical industries expand david bacon far from increasing productivity and investment however the damage caused to the national energy sector during neoliberalism is so serious lopez obrador charged that we are not only the oil country that imports the most gasoline in the world but we are now buying crude oil to supply the only six refineries that barely survive humberto montes de oca foreign secretary of the sme union says the country is bankrupt before we can redistribute wealth we have to recover it we know the banks will act against reversing the energy reform along with the others we will all have to participate in order to defend any changes this new government tries to make the sme has established a cooperative and has regained control of seven power generation stations along with other property that formerly belonged to the old company privatization has been synonymous with corruption in mexico lopez obrador charged in his speech the robbery of the goods of the people and the riches of the nation has been a modus operandi the government will no longer facilitate looting and will no longer be a committee in the service of a rapacious minority to date only one economic reform enacted by lopez obrador s predecessors has been repealed outright the education reform that mandated standardized testing for students and of teachers themselves which led to many politicized firings mexico s teachers have a long history of resistance and radical politics more than 100 teachers in the state of oaxaca alone were killed during their struggle over control of their union and in defense of the indigenous communities in which they lived years of massive teacher strikes against the government s education reform eventually led to a massacre in nochixtlan in june 2016 in which nine people were gunned down by federal and state police the disappearance and murder of 43 students from the ayotzinapa training school in september 2014 was also an indirect product of the corporate education reform program their school had a reputation for turning out radical teachers as do many rural training schools like it and their students came from some of the poorest families in the countryside expand david bacon claudio x gonzález guajardo cofounder of the televisa foundation and the mexicanos primeros corporate education reform lobby called such public schools a swarm of politics and shouting he demanded the government replace them with private institutions following lopez obrador s speech to the congress gonzalez tweeted amlo against the free market against the energy reform a retrograde statist interventionist stagnant vision the markets will react negatively it will go very badly with us very badly a shame in his address lopez obrador had promised the so called education reform will be canceled the right to free education will be established in article 3 of the constitution at all levels of schooling and the government will never again offend teachers the disappearance of ayotzinapa s youth will be thoroughly investigated the truth will be known and those responsible will be punished in meetings with the democratic teachers caucus he also promised free elections in their union the largest in latin america eliminating the authoritarian group that has held power in the union for decades could shift the balance between the left and right in mexico s institutional politics despite the move against education reform most mexican unions do not expect the new government to reverse the privatizations that have already taken place at least not for the first three years of lopez obrador s six year term instead they have concentrated on winning a basic reform of mexico s labor law which has changed radically during the past two decades in may 2000 the world bank made a series of recommendations to the mexican administration an integral agenda of development for the new era the bank recommended rewriting mexico s constitution and federal labor law by eliminating its requirements that companies give workers permanent status after 90 days limit part time work and abide by the 40 hour week pay severance when they lay workers off and negotiate over the closure of factories the bank called for ending the law s ban on strikebreaking and its guarantees of job training health care and housing the recommendations were so extreme that even some employers condemned them president vicente fox embraced the proposal but it failed to pass the congress after further attempts however president felipe calderon did get a similar reform adopted in 2012 it allows companies to outsource or subcontract jobs which was previously banned it allows part time and temporary work and pay by the hour rather than the day workers now can be terminated without cause for their first six months on the job arturo alcalde one of mexico s most respected labor lawyers and past president of the national association of democratic lawyers called the reforms a road to a paradise of firings as he predicted subcontracting proliferated with disastrous results in just one instance grupo mexico replaced strikers at the cananea mine by contracting out their jobs inexperienced replacements died in mine accidents and allowed a huge spill of toxic mine tailings into the sonora river contaminating communities and sickening residents according to benedicto martinez co president of the authentic labor front the union federation to which stimahcs belongs the motivation of the government assisted by corporate unions was to encourage the layoff of longtime employees who could be replaced by subcontracted workers there are companies now where all the workers are subcontracted who have no employees of their own at all the conditions are very low just slightly above the legal minimum and sometimes below last year under pressure from the european union which sought a free trade agreement with mexico the peña nieto administration had to agree to reform some of the pro corporate labor practices the government was forced to ratify convention 98 of the international labor organization guaranteeing freedom of association something the united states has not done peña nieto then got the mexican congress to pass a constitutional reform embodying these changes corporate unions like the ctm clearly feeling threatened by the reform introduced their own legislation in 2017 to nullify its effect they couldn t get it passed however as it became evident that lopez obrador would be elected the next president in martinez eyes the constitutional reform is the most advanced proposal that you could imagine it includes union democracy and the disappearance of the conciliation and arbitration boards which have always been complicit with the bosses and the corporate unions in some states a union contract is treated like a state secret that no one is allowed to see martinez believes the reform was the fruit of many years of groups like his fighting the government it was like talking to a wall he recalls we were accused of being traitors to the country because we organized international pressure with unions all over the world denouncing the practices here in mexico domingues marrufo lopez obrador s deputy labor secretary agrees if it were not for that support from the united steelworkers and other unions it would have been impossible to achieve the constitutional reform but changing the constitution does not change the particular laws that govern labor activity implementing legislation must be passed to define rights and procedures and set up the structure for enforcing the reform after lopez obrador won the election in july but before he took office in december mexican unions and labor lawyers set up a discussion group the citizens labor observatory and debated how far the new changes should go some wanted to undo calderon s 2012 reform completely by reversing for instance the reform laws that now allow subcontracting and temporary employment in the end though the consensus among the democratic unions was to limit the proposal to the implementing legislation that gives workers the right to vote for the union and union leaders of their choice and to approve or reject their contracts it was clear this was lopez obrador s favored choice as mexico city mayor in 2000 he had appointed another dean of mexican labor lawyers jesus campos linas as head of the city s labor board campos linas then made public an estimated 70 80 000 protection contracts whose contents had never been released to the workers they covered two days before christmas deputies from lopez obrador s morena party in formation introduced their labor reform bill into the chamber of deputies it will abolish the jcas and substitute an independent system of labor tribunals unions will be independent of the government and business and leaders must be elected by a majority of the workers union contracts will be public and must be ratified by the majority of the workers in a free and secret vote sweeping though it will be the new labor law is just a beginning on taking office lopez obrador appointed maria luisa alcalde the new labor secretary she is a former legislator daughter of labor lawyer arturo alcalde and at 31 the youngest person in amlo s cabinet she is very clear that the democratization of the unions will create a new situation and our society will have a much better chance to raise living standards dominguez says but he warned we aren t accustomed to organizing ourselves we re used to waiting for some powerful person to come from above to help us expand david bacon and while waiting for unions and workers to use the new law the government is still faced with many legacy strikes and fights inherited from 36 years of neoliberal administrations the telecommunications reform for instance mandated the breakup of telmex the old telephone monopoly sold to billionaire carlos slim in february it is set to be divided in two a move the telephone workers union bitterly opposes they are threatening to strike if it isn t stopped in the mid 1990s the telefonistas together with the authentic labor front fat and two other unions formed the national union of workers an independent labor federation they supported lopez obrador very strongly our corporate elite had to respond to the fact that the vast majority of mexicans voted for him and were unable to use their electoral fraud strategy to deny him victory as they had in the past says victor enrique fabela vice president of the union but he doesn t believe that lopez obrador will simply do what unions ask pointing out that the new president invited carlos slim to hear his inaugural speech to the congress an invitation not extended to the union s general secretary francisco hernandez juarez further long term operating concessions have been renewed for televisa and teleazteca two media giants with a record of right wing politics we have to be critical he cautioned while understanding that we have to support the direction amlo is moving the strike in cananea has yet to be settled and there and in nacozari two of the world s largest copper mines the miners union was forced out by previous jca decisions favoring the ctm and grupo mexico the communities on the rio sonora are still suffering the health effects of the toxic spill three years later and on november 29 at the giant pkc wire harness plant in ciudad acuña just two days before lopez obrador was sworn in ctm thugs marched into the facility shouting mineros afuera as workers were about to vote on the miners union as their representative they overturned ballot boxes the election was canceled and the mineros say the union s representatives were beaten we all want a change charged moises acuña the mineros political secretary we have a chance to move forward now and we have to use it meanwhile a new federation of independent unions in the auto industry has also been formed and plans to fight with the ctm over the right to negotiate contracts with the industry s giants in dealing with the workers upsurge and the emergence of new unions however lopez obrador s government faces a complex situation the jcas will disappear and the new tribunals will be formed but there are no judges yet and they won t be in place for the first three years the tribunals have to be funded and judges and personnel trained in administering a completely new law but during that time in order to represent workers and negotiate a union still has to be certified by the authorities martinez says there must be some way to ensure that the workers have approved this union and this approval must take place before any negotiation begins plus who are the inspectors now responsible for investigating the outsourcing to make sure it s legal we need an army of them and there s no money to hire them despite the institutional challenges dominguez believes that the time has arrived when mexican workers may be able to reshape their nation today many workers live in poverty on one or two dollars a day this is the fundamental problem but we re not just fighting for an economic goal not just for decent wages but for the revitalization of the democratic life of workers of our unions and the organizations we belong to
alexandria ocasio cortez has said that mmt needs to be a larger part of the conversation photo cbs you may have heard of modern monetary theory an approach to economics that is increasingly popular on the left and which is sometimes mischaracterized by advocates and especially detractors as holding that budget deficits are either unimportant or inherently good for the economy this week freshman representative alexandria ocasio cortez told business insider that mmt needs to be a larger part of our conversation you will often hear mmt cited in response to questions about how significant expansions of federal government spending such as single payer health care would be financed the idea is that mmt renders those financing questions much less important because it counsels worrying less about the deficit mmt or at least the part of mmt that is most directly relevant to current debates about government spending is neither crackpottery nor a revelation it s a way of stating an idea that can be stated equally well within an orthodox economics framework that the desirability of budget deficits depends on the economic situation in question mmt does not relieve policy makers of pay for questions it just describes differently how policy makers should evaluate whether they re collecting enough taxes for a given level of government spending jw mason a leftist economist at the city university of new york who isn t an adherent to mmt but describes himself as sympathetic to the approach co authored a paper last year with arjun jayadev of the university of massachusetts boston that helpfully seeks to map mmt onto a neo keynesian approach that s the approach typically associated with economic policy makers in the democratic party and further to the left and it holds that when the economy goes into recession the government should engage in deficit spending to make up for lost economic activity in the private sector reduce unemployment and engage otherwise idle resources the way mason and jayadev describe it is that mmt takes the traditional framework and reassigns the primary purposes of fiscal and monetary policy usually we would say that the government uses fiscal policy to keep public debt at an appropriate level and uses monetary policy to control inflation mmt flips this on its head espousing the use of fiscal policy to control inflation and of monetary policy to keep the public debt sustainable so while a conventional economic thinker might say you establish a new government program and levy taxes now or in the future to pay for it an mmt thinker would say you establish a new government program and the government prints the money to pay for it but that does not mean the mmt thinker thinks the new program is free the government is not constrained by its ability to obtain dollars but the economy is constrained by real limits on productive capacity if the government prints and spends money when the economy is at or near full employment mmt counsels correctly that this will lead to inflation and prescribes deficit reducing tax increases to reduce aggregate demand and thereby control inflation see how we have ended up back where we started whether you take a keynesian view or an mmt view if the government spends more it s likely going to need to tax more sooner or later of course it matters how you describe things and mmt economists will tell you there has been a strong bias in policy making toward seeing the downsides of deficits instead of the upsides in part because of the way we have become used to talking about deficits one of the things that mmt has tried to do is say yes of course the deficit can be too big evidence of that would be an acceleration in inflation says the economist stephanie kelton a professor at the state university of new york at stony brook former adviser to senate budget committee democrats and probably the most prominent mmt advocate in the economics profession but the deficit can also be too small that s something we ve said for a long time that not a lot of other economists have pointed out not a lot is an overstatement automatic and discretionary policies to expand budget deficits are policy tools both liberal and conservative governments reach for in recessions whether they emphasize it in their rhetoric or not and some economists must have been advising those policy makers to use those tools but i believe kelton is correct that both economists and economic policymakers have been too focused on the risks of high deficits relative to low ones and too focused on the risk of inflation versus the risk of unemployment that is while policymakers know we should run deficits in recessions when the recession is really big they don t run them large enough for long enough mason argues that the key usefulness of mmt is for political economy to restructure the choices facing policymakers so they re more likely to achieve the goals of full employment and stable inflation and less likely to err as they have on the side of low deficits high unemployment and missed inflation targets in the down parts of economic cycles but there is a reason to believe an mmt approach would not lead to better management of the economy in the long run the fact that it calls for raising taxes to control inflation when the economy is strong it is hard enough to sell voters on the idea of raising taxes in order to provide them valuable services now we are supposed to tell voters that taxes aren t for financing the government but we need to raise them anyway so we don t overshoot an inflation target the strong argument against mmt is precisely the one you made that tax increases will be potentially difficult to carry out mason told me when i asked him about this issue the contractionary piece of that might not be followed in practice because it would be very unpopular and mason thinks this issue could come up a lot because contrary to the views of some mmt scholars and most mmt enthusiasts in the political sphere he believes that consistently implemented mmt would call for smaller budget deficits in the long run than a traditional keynesian approach remember the primary way the government controls inflation now is through monetary policy the fed raises interest rates when it believes correctly or otherwise that inflation threatens a rise but mmt thinkers tend to believe interest rates should be kept low and stable regardless of inflation conditions warren mosler one of the founders of the movement says they should be set permanently at zero without the interest rate lever once mmt policymakers achieved their goal of an economy at full employment the tool they d have to use to control inflation is a very unappealing fiscal one tax financed budget surpluses whatever the federal reserve s demerits the idea of depending on congress to pass surplus generating tax increases in order to keep the economy stable and prevent runaway inflation gives me hives the key question about mmt is whether expecting congress to implement a novel model of economic management in a way that could go haywire is really the best way to address biases in economic policymaking when those biases could be addressed more directly the economics profession is already working on this olivier blanchard outgoing president of the american economic association and former chief economist at the international monetary fund used his speech at the aea s annual meeting last week to urge a rethinking of the merits of public debt arguing that its fiscal and social costs are lower than economists have often thought essentially this is the core of the kelton critique that we have been too quick to assume deficits are bad and too reluctant to see when they are good but expressed without departing from the keynesian model of spending and deficits i think there are a lot of reasons to rethink fiscal policy and almost all of them are because the parameters in our models have changed says jason furman an economics professor at harvard s kennedy school of government who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under barack obama what parameters furman notes as blanchard did in his speech that it s become clear that risk free interest rates are persistently below the rate of economic growth which makes it easier for governments to be confident that their economies will grow faster than their debts and he notes that the link between deficits and interest rates appears to be weaker so there s less reason to worry that high borrowing levels will lead to out of control borrowing costs i have a certain sympathy for mmt i think they are more correct than the people who are trying to revive bowles simpson says furman referring to a proposal from early this decade to sharply reduce federal budget deficits those people may have the right model and the wrong parameters mmt may have the wrong model but it may get you the same thing as the right model if you have the right parameters furman like mason says he has significant reservations about mmt prescriptions like keeping interest rates permanently low and seeking to control inflation through tax increases that ocasio cortez and some commentators on the left turn to mmt to argue for the feasibility of significant increases in government spending is odd given another talking point they use that other countries have found ways to finance larger and more generous governments than the us does providing benefits like free education and single payer health care to their populations this is true and a valid rejoinder to anyone who thinks such programs are impossible as for how difficult they might be to implement here it is important to note that the us starts off a higher per capita cost base than any other country that has ever previously sought to move nearly all health care expenditure onto the public ledger but it also undermines the case for mmt none of those countries that have single payer health care needed mmt to make it work they did it the conventional way by taxing the public maybe that s a sign that that s the best way to implement such programs or maybe it just reflects the fact that you d still need to tax the citizenry to implement single payer health care even with an mmt worldview
file photo a sign is pictured outside the bank of canada building in ottawa ontario canada may 23 2017 reuters chris wattie by david ljunggren ottawa reuters the bank of canada held interest rates steady as expected on wednesday but said more increases would be necessary even though low oil prices and a weak housing market will harm the economy in the short term governor stephen poloz said the challenges were temporary and he still believed the economy would at some stage be operating at full capacity with inflation on target and with interest rates in a zone where they are no longer stimulating or contracting aggregate demand the bank has raised rates five times since july 2017 and as recently as last month said the pace of tightening could be sped up depending on economic data but on wednesday it said rates would need to rise over time the first time it has used those words to describe the pace of tightening advertisement poloz told a news conference the reference to over time was meant to inject a degree of ambiguity into the timing of future rate increases given the setbacks from oil and housing the talk of further hikes helped boost the canadian dollar which extended earlier gains touching c 1 3180 to the u s greenback or 75 87 u s cents it later settled back to c 1 3225 to the u s dollar or 75 61 u s cents it s a bit more hawkish than the market expected at this point the market was expecting that maybe we are done said benjamin tal deputy chief economist at cibc world markets the central bank cut its near term growth forecasts to reflect the impact of crude prices but said the slowdown should be temporary and predicted the economy would post above potential growth in 2020 the bank noted that much of the economy was operating close to capacity but said consumption spending and housing investment had been weaker than expected as housing markets adjusted to tougher mortgage rules and higher interest rates looking ahead the bank said exports and non energy investment were expected to grow solidly moved forward by foreign demand a new north american free trade pact a weaker canadian dollar and federal tax measures aimed at investment story continues the bank noted signs that the u s chinese trade war was hitting global demand and commodity prices but adopted a positive long term outlook the bank held its overnight interest rate at 1 75 percent well below the neutral rate of 2 5 percent to 3 5 percent where monetary policy is neither stimulative or accommodative we still expect further modest tightening this year they re indicating that there s an ongoing commitment to move official rates to a neutral range so further rate hikes are in the offing said paul ferley assistant chief economist at the royal bank of canada the bank cut its forecast for fourth quarter annualized growth to 1 3 percent from the 2 3 percent it predicted in october and pegged first quarter growth at just 0 8 percent it trimmed the forecast for overall 2019 growth to 1 7 percent from 2 1 percent investment in the canadian oil and gas sector would decline by about 12 percent in 2019 compared with the 1 5 percent drop it predicted in october it said the bank said the damage that current low oil prices will inflict on the economy would be about a quarter of that done during a crude slump from 2014 to 2016 since that time the importance of the energy sector has lessened additional reporting by matt scuffham nichola saminather fergal smith and anna mehler paperny in toronto editing by steve orlofsky and james dalgleish

contained in our projections or forward looking statements now let me turn this call over to vern nagel more from the motley fool vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you dan good morning everyone ricky and i would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions our results for the first quarter were solid despite continuing inflationary cost pressures we took several actions in the quarter to address these cost issues including price increases and productivity improvements further our top line growth this quarter continued our long trend of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets we serve while diluted earnings per share grew 17 to 1 98 a first quarter record i know many of you have already seen have seen our results and ricky will provide more detail later in the call but i d like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the first quarter of 2019 our net sales for the first quarter were a record 933 million an increase of 11 compared with the year ago period reported operating profit was 116 4 million compared with 120 2 million in the year ago period reported diluted earnings per share was 1 98 compared with 1 70 in the year ago period there were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as ricky will explain later in the call in adding back these items one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2019 was 134 1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of 135 5 million in the year ago period a slight decrease of 1 adjusted operating profit margin was 14 4 a decrease of 170 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share was 2 32 a first quarter record up 20 from the year ago period net cash provided by operating activities was a solid 132 million this quarter while our cash position at the end of the quarter grew to 215 million even after repurchasing 25 million of the company s stock during the quarter leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies looking at some specific details for the quarter net sales increased almost 11 over the year ago period overall net sales volume grew approximately 11 while price mix of products sold was essentially flat this quarter acquisitions net of divestitures added about one point to our growth which was essentially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency and the adoption of the new accounting standard asc 606 our significant growth in net sales this quarter was due in large part because of continued efforts to expand our customer base and the introduction of new products and solutions we also believe our net sales were favorably impacted somewhat this quarter by customers accelerating orders in advance of the effective dates for announced price increases overall we experienced solid growth in net sales in most channels and geographies as well as most product categories the largest contributors to the increase in net sales volume were due to greater demand for our atrius based luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as several building management solutions created by our distech team and greater shipments of certain high volume more basic lesser featured led fixtures primarily for applications on smaller and mid sized commercial projects as well as our infrastructure and utility products solutions sold through our independent sales network which serves the c i utility and building management channels grew 10 this quarter compared with the year ago period this network comprises approximately 70 of our total net sales this growth was impacted somewhat by continued weak demand for larger nonresidential lighting projects as well as continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain lighting products during the quarter we announced two price increases to recover higher costs for both component and other input items due to inflation as well as the impact of government tariffs enacted on certain china sourced finished goods and components as noted earlier we believe some of the increase in net sales this quarter was due in part to customers buying products this quarter in advance of the effective dates of the announced price increases it is impossible to quantify the exact impact this had on our sales growth is quarter we expect this to have a small dampening effect on our growth rate in the second quarter historically our lowest net sales quarter in any given year due to seasonality though again it is impossible to quantify the impact as you all know changes in price mix have been a headwind each quarter for the last few years so to experience a very slight favorability call it neutral this quarter was a welcome change while it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold we estimate the neutral impact of price mix this quarter was primarily due to changes in channel mix mostly offset by both product price and mix which included substitutions to lower priced alternatives primarily for more basic lesser featured led luminaires sold in certain channels as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects as noted earlier lastly while we believe the price increases we ve put in place will be realized much of the sales in the first quarter were at pre increased levels due to both the timing of price increases implemented in various channels as well as shipments of orders at pre increased prices were previously committed projects as part of the company s backlog based on the information from various data collection and forecasting organizations we believe the overall growth rate in the first quarter as measured at dollars for the lighting market in north america was up low single digits reflecting continued improvement in demand reversing the sluggish trend over the last several quarters our net sales growth rate of approximately 11 even excluding any potential pull forward of sales due to the announced price increases stands in stark contrast of the overall goal growth rate of the luminaire market in north america we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to continue to gain overall share in the north american market this quarter our profitability measures for the first quarter were solid given overall market conditions they were impacted mostly by significantly higher costs particularly for certain commodities and components as well as freight and wages which i will address in a moment and to a lesser degree continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives as well as weakness for larger commercial projects our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was 134 million down approximately 1 compared with the year ago period while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14 4 down about 170 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period the decrease in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to the decline in adjusted gross profit margin adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 39 5 a decrease of about 200 basis points compared with the year ago period it is very important to understand the underlying factors that drove the decline in our margins this quarter and the actions we took to counter those factors as well as the timing of financial impact of those actions adjusted gross profit increased 19 million this quarter over the year ago period driven primarily by higher sales volume and productivity improvements partially offset by higher input costs our adjusted gross profit and margin were negatively impacted by higher input costs for certain items including electronic and oil based components freight and certain other commodity related items such as steel many of these items experienced dramatic increases in price over the last half of our fiscal 2018 due to several economic factors including new tariffs and wage inflation caused by tight labor markets we estimate the inflationary impact of these items reduced our gross profit this quarter by approximately 16 million and lowered our gross profit margin by approximately 170 basis points as noted earlier we took significant actions this quarter that we believe both help and will continue to help offset these and other cost increases including wage inflation as well as the impact of currently enacted increases in tariffs these actions included announced price increases and other measures to improve productivity and reduce costs we believe that due to the timing of price increases they had limited positive benefit on our first quarter results we believe these price increases will begin to offset higher input costs including recently enacted tariffs in our second quarter and beyond it is important to note that our adjusted gross profit margin increased 60 basis points on a sequential basis this quarter from the fourth quarter of 2018 on lower revenues primarily due to the improvement in sales channel mix and actions to improve our cost structure next our adjusted sda expenses were up approximately 20 million compared with the year ago period adjusted sda expense as a percentage of net sales was 25 2 in the first quarter a decrease of 20 basis points from the year ago period demonstrating the leverage of our sda investment as our net sales volume grows the increase in adjusted sda expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales greater employee related cost and to a lesser degree added expenses from recent acquisitions partially offset by actions taken in prior periods to streamline the organization excluding the impact of higher freight and commission expense due to the increase in net sales volume more than half of the increase in sda expense compared with prior periods was due to greater employee related costs while our salaried headcount remained essentially flat year over year even after acquisitions we expect that employee related costs will continue to rise in fiscal 2019 as markets for certain skills remain tight contributing to a rise in wage inflation our adjusted diluted eps was a first quarter record of 2 32 compared with 1 94 reported in the year ago period an increase of 20 the increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the new tax law and the lower average shares outstanding due to stock repurchases during the past year partially offset by a slight decline in operating profit in the quarter as i noted earlier we believe the year over year increases in certain input costs reduced our gross profit by approximately 16 million in the quarter and obviously negatively impact our diluted earnings per share before i turn the call over to ricky i would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter on the strategic and technology front we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong revenue growth and profitability over the long term we continue to gain market share in many important product categories and sales channels our tier 3 and 4 solutions were up over 25 this quarter from a commercial perspective we continue to accelerate a number of atrius enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of the largest u s based retailers our atrius based iot luminaires and solutions are becoming the industry standard in the retail segment additionally we continue to expand these solutions into other channels as awareness by customer grows as they come to recognize the full benefits of these solutions including superior visual comfort and energy savings as well as the capabilities of our iot solutions providing them with the opportunity to transform their spaces from nothing more than an expense item into a strategic asset as i mentioned in prior earnings calls it is clear that certain chinese based lighting companies many obviously being subsidized in some form are influencing pricing for certain basic lesser featured fixtures sold in certain channels we will not yield this space for many strategic reasons as such we continued to aggressively expand our contractor select portfolio to profitably compete in this portion of the market also as i mentioned last quarter we introduced in late 2018 the next generation of our industry leading lighting control system nlight air a wireless control system with a wide range of options and functionality for which there was strong customer demand this quarter we believe acuity has the most comprehensive and feature rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available in the nonresidential construction market and importantly they are connected to our growing bms solutions lastly we initiated many actions last year to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity we believe these initiatives both enhanced our performance this quarter and will continue to benefit our operating and financial performance in the future as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment we ve been able to create these capabilities while providing industry leading results because of the dedication resolve of our many associates who are maniacally focused on serving solving and supporting the needs of our customers i will talk more about our expectations for the balance of 2019 later in the call i would like to now turn the call over to ricky ricky ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you vern and good morning everyone as vern mentioned earlier we had some adjustments to the gaap results in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable in our earnings release and form 10 q we provide a detailed reconciliation of non gaap measures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and 2018 adjusted results exclude the impact of acquisition related items amortization expense for acquired intangible assets share based payment expense and special charges for streamlining activities we believe adjusting for these items and providing these non gaap measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations we think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we recognized a pre tax special charge of 1 million primarily related to move costs associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from a planned facility closure in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year we recorded a pre tax special charge of 200 000 we expect to continue to incur additional costs primarily attributed to early lease termination and moving costs in future periods associated with the closing of certain facilities related to the streamlining actions announced in fiscal year 2018 fiscal 2019 first quarter results were impacted by the adoption of accounting standards codification 606 revenues from contracts with customers which negatively impacted current period revenues by 2 4 million gross profit by 1 1 million and operating profit by 1 2 million as compared with the prior year period additionally fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting a new accounting standard regarding retirement benefits which resulted in an increase in operating profit of 1 6 million with an equal offsetting increase in other expenses resulting in no impact on fiscal 2018 reported net income or eps please refer to note 4 and 5 to our financial statements included in our form 10 q filed earlier today for additional details of the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on both the income statement and balance sheet as part of adopting asc 606 you can see in our form 10 q filed today that we are providing disaggregated revenues by the major sales channels of one independent sales network which includes c i agencies infrastructure utility agencies system integrators and showrooms two direct sales network three retail network which includes home centers and digital retail four corporate accounts and five all other which is primarily oem international and catalog the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 25 2 compared with 35 5 in the prior year quarter the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was significantly impacted by the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 24 to 26 for fiscal 2019 we generated 132 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 140 million for the year ago period operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables decreased 31 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019 this decrease is largely due to reduced account receivable balance our operating working capital days increased 10 days to 60 days primarily due to higher inventory at november 30 2018 compared to august 31 2018 at november 30 2018 we added cash and cash equivalent balance of 215 million an increase of 86 million since august 31 2018 this increase was due primarily to cash flow from operations partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock to invest in plant and equipment and to pay dividends we repurchased 200 000 shares for 25 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in addition we have repurchased an additional 200 000 shares for 24 million since the end of our first quarter we have 4 8 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase board authorization our investment in capital expenditures was 14 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 an increase of almost 4 million compared with the prior year period we currently expect to invest approximately 1 5 of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 on june 29 2018 we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a 400 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility and a 400 million unsecured delayed draw five year term loan facility our total debt outstanding was 357 million at november 30 2018 our debt to capitalization at august 31 2018 was 16 9 and net debt to capital was 7 5 we had additional borrowing capacity of 795 million at november 30 2018 under our new credit and term loan facilities which do not expire until june 2023 we clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities which may include acquisitions and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value thank you and i ll turn the call back over to vern vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ricky while current market conditions in the lighting industry continue to be challenging we continue to be optimistic regarding our long term future we believe our many actions to improve our market reach enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and to drive companywide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high growth potential over the long term our robust sales growth significant cash flow and upper quartile return on invested capital are reflective of our strong operating performance despite some of these current industry headwinds our views on overall market demand for the lighting market and items influencing costs have not really changed over the last quarter so let me reiterate some of those key items that could influence our performance for the balance of fiscal 2019 many independent third party forecasts continue to suggest the overall construction market as measured in dollars will grow in the low to mid single digit range we still believe the lighting industry will lag the overall growth rate of construction market somewhat primarily due to continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels though recent industry pricing actions should have a favorable impact on growth as measured in dollars additionally we expect that labor shortages in certain markets could continue to negatively impact growth rates for both construction and lighting while the u s government delayed the implementation of increased tariffs to 25 from the current 10 for certain imported chinese made finished goods until march 1 we believe the outcome of the entire tariff situation could have a dampening effect on overall demand due to higher component cost and finished good prices further it is evident that the global trade issues have certainly created greater volatility in demand in our various end markets and we expect that to continue as previously mentioned we believe the announced price increases and other actions taken will in time offset the increases in cost for various items noted earlier while increases in some input costs such as steel have leveled off for now we expect other costs and expenses such as imported electrical components and finished goods freight and wages will continue to rise these potential cost increases questions and answers operator thank you matt mccall from seaport global securities you may go ahead matt mccall seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning guys so vern maybe start with the comment you made about expanding contractor select to profitably compete in that market can you talk about the just the trends since the reinvigoration or reintroduction of that product the trends in the profitability in recent quarters and then expectations just trying to understand what you were referencing when you made that specific comment vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer sure well just to further make a comment i wasn t able to finish the prepared remarks so there are probably some other important things that i ll touch on as we get toward the end of the call but matt let me begin to address your questions yes contractor select was a relaunch of a product portfolio that was directed at if you will lesser featured more value oriented products and what we did is we had a number of products branded maybe under lithonia but we created recreated if you will a contractor select to have a more fulsome portfolio directed specifically at that market with new products that had better cost structures for us better price points some of those products continue to be manufactured both in asia as well as in our north american manufacturing footprint so our margins in those have improved and we continue to see growth contractor select is designed to serve both the home center channel as well as the electrical distribution channel and then to a lesser degree showrooms and our digital retail capability so we continue to see growth in those in that portfolio and it did have or has had some positive impact on our margins as we said in the quarter which was really exciting for us price mix overall was very slightly favorable let s just call it neutral which is the first time we ve experienced that geez ricky in probably in the last two to three years so part of that benefit has been due to actions taken like the introduction of contractor select matt mccall seaport global securities analyst ok thank you and maybe continuing on that thought the you mentioned some of the product comes from asia your manufacturing part of it i guess i m trying to understand the impact on your gross contribution margin do you still get the same leverage opportunities from that sourced product and will that i m really thinking about the substitution effect of just the product coming in out of asia do you sacrifice some maybe leverage opportunity but you benefit from lower costs i m assuming or i m sure just help me understand the impact in how we should think about gross contribution margin from just pure volume just given the shifts in substitution or trends with substitution dan smith senior vice president treasurer and secretary sure so as we stated in our 10 k approximately 20 of our total sales are produced by others about 15 ricky is produced in asia ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer correct 15 yes vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer i think that was the number so that s up a little bit from say prior years we obviously have a very strong supply chain in asia when you say we lose a little bit of leverage sure when you re not manufacturing in your own facilities increases in volume you re not able to really leverage that across your fixed cost base but we like the margin profile of our portfolio and contractor select and as we think about product substitution again this quarter it was essentially awash price mix was essential awash which again first time in a long time so the efforts that we re putting in to products like contractor select not just contractor select allowed us to again have price mix be awashed i would tell you that product substitution it will continue and the way we are attacking that to offset product substitution and what that simply means is that we are moving from a product that has one price point to something that has a lower price point it s entirely possible that the gross profit margin on the lower price point item is actually higher as a percentage of the sale than on the higher price point so we continue to push our mix as a company into those areas that we realize both higher profit dollars as well as higher profit margin a good example of that is in our controls business our controls overall business and it s impossible to call it a separate business because so much of our controls are embedded into our luminaires but we re seeing great uplift as we continue to introduce new products and solutions such as nlight air into the marketplace with great demand so that benefit of that price mix was also because of the introduction of products like that matt mccall seaport global securities analyst ok very helpful thank you vern operator thank you and our next question comes from jeffrey sprague from vertical research partners you may go ahead sir jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone hey two from me first on substitution i wonder if you have a sense of how much is happening kind of at the front end relative to the initial bid versus a response to price cost dynamics in the project later in the construction process and a need to get costs out given other inflationary pressures that may have arisen during the project itself is there is a discernible difference there vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer well let me take a cut at it and then ricky can take a cut product substitution is occurring in two key areas and it s just it s interesting it s trends of how people want to if you will use light the shift from certain 2 by 2 2 by 4 1 by 4 fixtures to flat panels for example is a trend that has been in the marketplace for a while so as acuity ramps up its capabilities in the flat panel business and i believe that today we are the largest seller of flat panels in the north american market at least that s what our data would suggest and that s over the last call it less than 18 months that that s occurred well that product is replacing certain other form factors and those other form factors were simply at higher prices and so that s an example another example is slim form wafers replacing certain types of down lighting again profitability off of those products for us is from a margin percentage is favorable but yet just pure dollars because the physical construct of that product is meaningfully different than something that it is substituting in certain applications so it is both upfront but it s also in our stock business it s also being sold through whether it s electrical distribution channel or whether it s being sold through the home center or the showroom or our digital retail capabilities for what i ll call renovation projects it s just people looking at different choices that they have in terms of how they want their space to look and how they want it to operate and so that product substitution or that shift is having some change on top line if you will dollars units are obviously up higher but dollars tend to be lower and this is again why for me it s very exciting for us to show an almost an 11 top line growth while all of this is going on jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst and also just on tier 3 tier 4 you continue to see good growth in units can you give us a little update though in terms of actually turning the capabilities on what s happening there service revenues associated with it etc vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes we re seeing nice growth but off of an incredibly small base and so what we ve learned in this process is that people who deploy our atrius based luminaires are looking for some level of critical mass within their own facilities or number of facilities so as they install they re now beginning to experiment use we have certain customers that are much further along than others and they are now actually starting to use apps within their space we re helping them do that that obviously creates an increase in if you will revenue stream for acuity but the tier 4 saas revenues are still really small but growing i mean they re doubling so we re very very excited about the prospects of what that saas revenue looks like particularly as customers start to use the solutions or use the capabilities of the solutions that they purchased and so as expected it s now starting to ramp and you re seeing that multiplier effect occur but again against the 3 8 billion acuity brands it really does not move the needle just yet but it will it s moving the needle by the way in us selling iot enabled luminaires in a very significant way the part of our growth is because of our enterprise solutions capability which is selling virtually all iot enabled luminaires and that piece of our business continues to grow nicely jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst right thanks operator thank you our next question comes from john walsh with credit suisse you may go ahead sir john walsh credit suisse analyst hi good morning vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer good morning john walsh credit suisse analyst so i m going to apologize because i don t know if i fully understood the answer to jeff s question but maybe i can just ask it again in a little different way as we think about the product substitution is that when the project first starts so when the initial bid happens or are you seeing the general contractors actually break the spec later in the construction process and then seeing the substitution happening there where you have to go and fight what the contractor is trying to do to the spec just trying to understand that dynamic a little bit better vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question so generally speaking for projects products like this are spec ed in but the normal cycle of just general contracting capabilities is that they may spec something else and this has happened historically for years for decades you get down to now at the end of the project because lighting is some of the last stuff in someone may say listen i need to alter the specification to a degree because i m out of budget and i need to be in budget so some of these products provide great alternatives but their features and benefits are not the same as what may have been spec ed in so you can have a combination of both but for acuity again if you go back to more traditional lighting acuity never participated in the lamp ballast replacement business today we have a product portfolio that is amply suited for replacement of existing luminaires so when we sell these types of products through certain channels very often they are for renovation projects which we have said for a long time is a growth rich opportunity for acuity or they may be part of smaller projects where there is not a specification and the builder is saying hey this product looks like it s a fantastic opportunity or the owner says this is something that i like flat panels as a form factor are becoming very popular and so again that product substitution is because that product category is growing significantly because people like those form factors it s simply displacing other types of product that may have had a higher price point and they re willing to accept any feature or benefit difference should there be any so it can be both but generally speaking someone is not using that flat panel to break a spec they re using it as something that they have specified in and acuity will be introducing a spec grade product or a flat panel family which is a whole different opportunity but no i would say that it s part of the normal course of business and these features and benefits that these products have are attractive at those price points john walsh credit suisse analyst ok thank you and then just thinking about this potential or the prebuy impact ahead of the price increases obviously very difficult to parse that out but you did say you thought there could be some dampening impact in the next quarter i mean is that to think a couple of points is that kind of the order of magnitude that you have in your head when you use the word dampening or is there a more specific range that you would point us to vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would say to the extent because it s impossible for us to precisely quantify it i would say that to the extent we assume there was some and we ve seen some evidence but to quantify that and say ok here is a number we just we didn t even try because it wouldn t have been worth that effort but to the extent that there was some it would have been generally speaking a pull primarily from q2 into q1 we can t estimate it ricky any other thoughts on that ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean we ve looked at it in a lot of different ways some of the pull forward was within the same quarter so obviously it has no impact on our quarterly results so it s pretty hard to put a bread basket around it john walsh credit suisse analyst ok i appreciate it thank you ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you the next question comes from tim wojs from baird you may go ahead sir tim wojs robert w baird co analyst hey guys good morning vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tim wojs robert w baird co analyst just on i m just curious just if you could give us a little bit of color on just what you re seeing around pricing traction in the marketplace i know there s a lot of variabilities between price and mix but if you just look at like for like pricing and based on some of the increases that you ve put in the market is there any sort of estimate you could give or what you re seeing in terms of how much of those price increases are starting to stick vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer ricky do you want to tackle that ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer yes in the quarter is as vern said in his prepared remarks very little impact in this first quarter most of the price increases were implemented mid quarter and we protected certain channels as well as the delay due to projects as vern mentioned that were in our backlog but we are committed to the price increase and do see evidence that in most of the channels it is sticking it is coming in at different time lines in different channels but we are continuing to be pretty firm in our resolve with the increases because they were real cost increases inflationary as well as the tariffs that we re needing to offset and we are holding firm most of the major competitors have announced similar if not identical price increases to us so that is encouraging but as we always see in price increases it varies by geography it will vary by channel somewhat as to how quickly they get implemented and to what extent but we still are very committed to the announced increases we put out vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer and ricky if i could just pile on a little bit two thirds of our total business is bid business and so and that hasn t changed we have experienced real cost increases we will continue to aggressively look to recover those both through price increases that we ve announced as well as productivity improvements we look at every project and decide whether that s something a piece of business that we re after as ricky pointed out different channels have different contractual obligations so we are implementing our price increases because these cost increases are real to us and we re evaluating as we always do what our product portfolio looks like relative to how we serve and support our customer base relative to how we make money and so we are aggressively focused on pushing through price generally speaking the industry is pretty disciplined when cost increases come about of putting those into the marketplace and to the extent that those things ebb and flow yes on the bid business we look to optimize our profitability by all measures so we have seen our price increases be implemented into the marketplace and we re pleased with the progress that we ve made so far tim wojs robert w baird co analyst great great and then just thinking about seasonality and just trying to make sure we re all on the same page the second quarter is typically your weakest revenue quarter so while i think price would probably have a little bit of a sequential impact you d also lose some leverage so is it fair to assume that the gross margin sequentially are down some from q1 just in line with historical seasonality before seeing a more market improvement in the stronger months in your fiscal year vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would say that this seasonality is normal we ve had this for forever and you re absolutely correct in assuming that the leverage of volume does have an impact we are looking to recover some of the cost increases that we ve through price again as we said earlier the timing of some of these things depending on the channel the contracts that you have with the customer but no our expectation is that as we enter into q2 it will not be materially different than other q2s as it relates to the seasonality i do have well we are optimistic we re seeing positive signs within the construction market we continue to see some of the volatility in demand that is caused by people s concerns around tariffs and what s going to happen in trade negotiations i wish i could tell you differently we have a positive view of the overall market but it s still tempered by what happens intra quarter from one quarter to the next because someone says hey i m going to wait to see what happens with this trade policy it s just it s frustrating for us because we believe that there is momentum out there and there is a real need if i look at all of the demographics of rising employment vacancy rates going down rental rates going up absorption of real estate these are all favorable signs and longer term bullish signs for nonresidential construction so it s a bit of a dr jekyll and hyde kind of thing but overall we re net positive in what we see going forward tim wojs robert w baird co analyst thanks for the comments good luck operator thank you our next question comes from ryan merkel with william blair you may go ahead sir ryan merkel william blair analyst hey thanks i just want to follow up on the gross margin question so do you think that you re going to recover the 170 basis points of price cost in the fiscal second quarter or might it take a little longer vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer so as ricky and i said the price increases that have been enacted some of those take time to roll in because of contractual obligations because of our backlog i think we will make good progress on recapturing those costs we don t give guidance on that entirely i don t want to comment completely on that but our price increases and our resolve around capturing those price increases are important for us to recover our costs ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer and i would just comment brian that and vern had it in his prepared remarks we are still seeing inflationary cost increases beyond what we ve historic what are in our first quarter results so wage inflation is alive and well our merit increases went into effect mid or second last third of our first quarter so all of that impact will be in our second quarter so we will continue to have some inflationary cost increases we need to offset all the reason why these price increases were so necessary ryan merkel william blair analyst got it so it sounds like you expect to make progress that we shouldn t expect you can recover the full amount in the fiscal second quarter vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer we don t give guidance ryan merkel william blair analyst ok fair enough all right and then back to the issue of pull forward maybe just comment on the order rate in december potentially that could tell us a little bit about what s going on and what the pull forward could be vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes we have not seen a meaningful change compared to the prior year in our order rates again my concern is less around the pull forward and more around just how do people release projects how are people feeling about their businesses it is becoming more and more evident to us that labor shortages in large markets are having a dampening effect on construction in general and then lighting to a lesser degree so we are looking at the overall demand and why are people doing things we continue to see strength in smaller and midsized projects which may not be as impacted by labor shortages as larger projects so we can continue to see this dynamic going on it gets exacerbated to a degree or the fluctuation volatility to a degree because of q2 weather related things but no we continue to see what we would call normal trend so again that s why it s impossible for us to say oh gosh it s this percent that will impact first quarter versus second quarter ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer i would just mention while not directly part of your question another uncertainty out there is this potentially next round of tariff increases on finished goods coming from china march 1 is the date the administration said those would become effective which is obviously the end of our second quarter will those go forward what impact may that have on demand but also on potential pull forward because we ve indicated as others that we re going to have a price increase contemporaneous with that tariff increase so that s another uncertainty we re looking at here in the second quarter it could have an impact on order rates depending on whether that tariff increase goes forward or not ryan merkel william blair analyst very helpful guys i ll pass it on thanks operator thank you our next question comes from rich kwas with wells fargo securities deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst good morning this is deepa for rich kwas hope you re well two quick questions for me first one is can you comment on the state of nonres cycle and what you re hearing from the field especially commercial versus institutional large commercial softness obviously you continue to mention that in your project commentary but do you think that is cycle driven or is that more like a short term impact from all the headline uncertainty tariffs etc that we see vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer so on the nonres piece for small medium projects i think that again the portfolio of solutions that acuity and to a degree others have to offer are favorable energy saving so good returns on investments so i think that people continue to move those along particularly to the extent that they have access to electricians in their local market so i see that as being favorable larger projects all of the big indicators rental rates rental vacancy absorption of real estate employment all of those are usually leading indicators of construction particularly around medium and larger projects without getting into the specific verticals of nonresidential construction we still have favorable but our favorability or optimism is somewhat tempered by again in some of these key markets the availability of electricians to do some of these projects and by the way what we re talking about here is growth right all of these folks have good backlogs they have projects out there whether they re the electrical distributor or the electrical contractor it s just that if their workforce is a limiting factor to their ability to grow and again in the lighting space we continue to experience a bit of deflation for the reasons we ve all articulated i think that there should be legs there in terms of what s going to happen in nonresidential construction but we have to solve some of these labor issues deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it can you comment on your residential piece of business i mean what was your resi growth in the quarter and have you seen any deceleration or stability in that piece of your business vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes so we don t measure it exactly as residential because we sell product that has residential applications and or light commercial applications through multiple channels we would sell those products through the home center channel we would sell them through the electrical distribution channel we would sell them through the showroom channel those products or those channels as ricky pointed out earlier are network sales for us that represents about 70 of our business which would have some resi in there it was up about 10 on the retail channel ricky which would also be resi and light commercial we saw favorability there so we continue to see favorable movements i know that residential construction has kind of moved sideways here a little bit but i think that that is just temporary i mean you look at the number of workers the population continues to grow rental rates continue to increase i just i m still bullish over the long term on residential construction and capabilities and i think acuity is well positioned to play there deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it final one for me so just given all the prebuy and all the due to the price increases can you comment on the state of inventory in the channel should we be concerned at all i mean you talked about some pull forward but just curious on the inventory in the channel vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i don t know that i m saying that there s inventory in the channel i think that the channel manages its inventory pretty well both on residential and nonresidential but from our perspective our inventories are up a bit because we have extended some of our supply chain to asia that s increased a little bit adding a little bit more inventory into the system but we also continue to grow in certain markets pick our enterprise solution market where as that business grows we re required to maintain certain levels of inventory to support store renovation construction and so that s caused us to have to carry a little bit more inventory but i think that the channel of the electrical distribution the channel of the home center so on and so forth all those inventory levels seem to be appropriate given the economic activity that s out there operator thank you and our final question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer you may go ahead sir christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thanks good morning guys vern did i catch that someone out there may be thought you should tighten your prepared comments i guess so vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you chris i think that was you and by the way all the questions that folks asked that was in my prepared remarks christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst i m sure so your volume outgrowth was pretty profound in the second half of last year i m wondering how to think about those comparison run rates there in the absence of guidance how would you advise we consider that and maybe part of that context is if you could describe the trend with the building breadth of customers now creating critical tier 3 mass for themselves pursuant to entering the tier 4 base vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes our business continues to diversify both in terms of within channels so if you look at the home center business we continue to diversify our customer base there also looking to evaluate our portfolio in some of those things so there s a little bit of ebbing and flowing going on i love what we re doing in our enterprise solutions capabilities this is really where we re selling our iot and atrius enabled luminaires into retail and other segments specifically on how they purchase well those the acceptance of those products are significant but the problem not the problem the opportunity is that that s very lumpy i mean when someone says hey look we don t want you in our retail stores from the beginning of november until the kind of middle of january you could appreciate that s when they make most of their money in terms of a lot of these retailers so anyway i expect our growth to continue to outpace the overall growth rate of the markets that we serve we ve had a good track record of doing that some of the influences that we ve had here over the last couple of quarters as we mentioned we expanded our customer base in certain channels which caused us to have a bit of call it load in of certain things some of those things will come back to normal volume and activity so it may not be quite to the level because you don t have those load ins happening every quarter that we experienced in fourth and first quarter but again i think that we will we have a long track record of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets that we serve and i think that that s probably a pretty good indicator as you think about your models of how did we grow last year how do you think the markets going to grow where do you think acuity is going to be i think you can get yourself into a reasonable range around that christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst yes that works and then just the inventory is up on the magnitude of a quarter year over year just wondering if you could comment on the strategic aspects of that inventory build versus whatever working capital execution factors and the free cash flow conversion outlook for the year vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer sure so we continue to have good cash flow conversion our inventory levels as we bring on whether it be through enterprise solutions or customers in certain other channels we are working that into our business but our expectations would be that we would improve our inventory turns as our business processes to support that those growing aspects of our business come into both focus as well as we get our processes honed out said simply we have too much inventory right now relative to the service levels it s just getting those processes honed between ourselves and the customers their pos their store increases some of the projects that we have worked on within our utility channel our utility business continues to grow significantly well there are requirements for inventory until we get that pipeline really smoothed out we ve added inventory to support the service levels so our expectation as a company and it s really critical to us to get our inventory turns back to where they should be with levels of service that are commensurate with customers expectations so i believe that by the end of the year you will see our inventory turns and our inventory levels improve relative to the it s days on hand that s important and it s service that s important it s not the dollars that are important so we want to get those metrics back to where we think we ought to be operating christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thanks have a good one operator thank you i would like to turn the call back over to mr vernon nagel for closing remarks vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer folks thank you so much yes some of my remarks were cut off a bit but i think we answered some of the things i would have said during the q a so again i d like to thank you for your time this morning again we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders our future is bright thank you for your support operator duration 65 minutes call

washington january 8 2019 global economic growth is projected to soften from a downwardly revised 3 percent in 2018 to 2 9 percent in 2019 amid rising downside risks to the outlook the world bank said on tuesday international trade and manufacturing activity have softened trade tensions remain elevated and some large emerging markets have experienced substantial financial market pressures growth among advanced economies is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year the january 2019 global economic prospects says slowing external demand rising borrowing costs and persistent policy uncertainties are expected to weigh on the outlook for emerging market and developing economies growth for this group is anticipated to hold steady at a weaker than expected 4 2 percent this year download the january 2019 global economic prospects report the upswing in commodity exporters has stagnated while activity in commodity importers is decelerating per capita growth will be insufficient to narrow the income gap with advanced economies in about 35 percent of emerging market and developing economies in 2019 with the share increasing to 60 percent in countries affected by fragility conflict and violence a number of developments could act as a further brake on activity a sharper tightening in borrowing costs could depress capital inflows and lead to slower growth in many emerging market and developing economies past increases in public and private debt could heighten vulnerability to swings in financing conditions and market sentiment intensifying trade tensions could result in weaker global growth and disrupt globally interconnected value chains robust economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity said world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions ceyla pazarbasioglu as the outlook for the global economy has darkened strengthening contingency planning facilitating trade and improving access to finance will be crucial to navigate current uncertainties and invigorate growth analytical chapters address key current topics the informal sector accounts for about 70 percent of employment and 30 percent of gdp in emerging market and developing economies since it is associated with lower productivity and tax revenues and greater poverty and inequality this is symptomatic of opportunities lost reducing tax and regulatory burdens improving access to finance offering better education and public services and strengthening public revenue frameworks could level the playing field between formal and informal sectors debt vulnerabilities in low income countries are rising while borrowing has enabled many countries to tackle important development needs the median debt to gdp ratio of low income countries has climbed and the composition of debt has shifted toward more expensive market based sources of financing these economies should focus on mobilizing domestic resources strengthening debt and investment management practices and building more resilient macro fiscal frameworks sustaining historically low and stable inflation is not guaranteed in emerging market and developing economies cyclical pressures that have depressed inflation over the past decade are gradually dissipating the long term factors that have helped reduce inflation over the past five decades global trade and financial integration widespread adoption of robust monetary policy frameworks may lose momentum or reverse maintaining low global inflation may become as much of a challenge as achieving it policies aimed at softening the blow of global food price swings can have unintended consequences if implemented by many governments in uncoordinated fashion government interventions can provide short term relief but widespread actions are likely to exacerbate food price spikes with heaviest impact on the poor for example trade policies introduced during the 2010 11 food price spike may have accounted for more than one quarter of the increase in the world price of wheat and maize the 2010 11 food price spike tipped 8 3 million people almost 1 percent of the world s poor into poverty designing tax and social policies to level the playing field for formal and informal sectors as well as strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and debt management will be important priorities for policymakers to overcome the challenges associated with informality in developing economies saidworld bank prospects group director ayhan kose as the economic outlook dims such efforts become even more important

open this photo in gallery bank of canada governor stephen poloz listens to a question during a news conference in ottawa on jan 9 2019 chris wattie reuters the bank of canada has put planned higher interest rates on hold for now in the face of a new grimmer forecast that shows canada s economy is slowing down fast as it did in december the central bank left its benchmark rate at 1 75 per cent on wednesday as the economy slows as a result of lower oil prices weaker housing activity and the u s china trade clash the bank of canada insists it s still committed to getting interest rates back up to neutral the level where they are neither driving the economy forward nor slowing it down but only over time the appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on how the outlook evolves with a particular focus on developments in oil markets the canadian housing market and global trade policy the bank said in a statement for homeowners and consumers this means a reprieve of at least a few months from higher rates on mortgages and car loans the downside is that the economy is clearly deteriorating and that will likely mean less business activity and poorer job prospects in 2019 the bank s new qualified commitment to raise rates over time is meant to inject ambiguity into what it will do in the months ahead bank of canada governor stephen poloz explained to reporters he said the bank is hoping to have a clearer picture of how the economy is evolving by the time it releases its next forecast in april it s all about the data mr poloz said the bank of canada has taken itself out of the rate hike game and its message suggests that it isn t quite as sure about when it will come off the sidelines and hike again cibc chief economist avery shenfeld said in a research note as recently as the fall many analysts were expecting up to three rate hikes from the central bank this year the bank estimates its neutral rate is about 3 per cent or 1 25 percentage points above where the rate is now the bank has already hiked rates five times since mid 2017 in spite of that longer term interest rates have been falling in recent months and many analysts are predicting lenders may soon cut rates on home mortgages gluskin scheff chief economist and strategist david rosenberg said the bank has shifted from being hawkish on wanting higher rates to dovish in the span of a few short months the next move may very well be a rate cut he said the bank also released its first quarterly forecast of 2019 highlighted by a sharp downgrade in gdp growth the bank of canada says the economy will grow just 1 7 per cent this year down sharply from its previous forecast of 2 1 per cent and below the estimated 2 per cent pace of 2018 the central bank pointed out that the u s china tariff fight is weighing on the global economy depressing the prices for many of the commodities that dominate canadian exports the bank also highlighted that housing activity has been weaker than expected as home buyers adjust to tougher mortgage rules new restrictions on foreign buyers in some provinces and previous mortgage rate hikes it s the bank s first hint that the real estate slump in toronto and vancouver may be worse than initially thought nonetheless the bank of canada reckons the economic swoon will be short lived lasting only through the first half of the year it says the economy will grow 2 1 per cent in 2020 up from its previous estimate of 1 9 per cent it bases its optimism on a host of factors including an expectation of stronger exports higher investments outside the oil patch a cheaper canadian dollar and the positive impact of the newly agreed usmca which will replace the north american free trade agreement our belief is that the economy will be back to where it was a few months ago within a few months mr poloz told reporters the most significant change in the bank of canada s short term thinking comes from the drop in oil prices which is hurting business investment and the value of canadian exports the price of crude at roughly us 52 a barrel is 25 per cent lower than the central bank expected in october the recent oil price slump is now projected to shave 0 5 per cent off the level of gdp by the end of 2020 and the bank expects investment in canada s oil and gas sector to fall 12 per cent this year the industry now accounts for roughly 15 per cent of business investment in canada down from 30 per cent in 2014 largely reflecting the cancellation and postponement of numerous projects in the oil sands the grimmer forecast comes in spite of a significant narrowing of the gap between the price of western canadian select wcs the benchmark for canadian heavy crude and west texas intermediate wti that price differential is down to less than us 10 from more than us 50 in october inflation is expected to dip temporarily below the central bank s guiding 2 per cent target for much of this year largely because of the effect of lower energy prices the bank expects inflation to be back to near target by the third quarter of this year the central bank cautioned that its forecast is subject to several upside and downside risks among other things it said trade tensions may ease the price of crude could bounce back and the u s economy could keep growing at a healthy clip
china s economy is slowing and facing increasingly powerful headwinds economists have been watching evidence pile up for some time but apple ceo tim cook s warning that sales of its iphone have been slowing in china sent apple shares along with those of other technology companies into a slide chinese authorities are trying to cushion the impact of a slowdown but the causes are diverse and sustained growth is increasingly difficult policy makers must prepare for troubles in china and protect their own economies from the fallout cook was forced to revise downward apple s growth forecasts because of slowing iphone sales in china in 2015 apple boasted of multiple quarters in which revenue growth in greater china topped 100 percent per year in november 2018 that number plummeted to 16 percent and it is expected to fall still further those grim numbers sparked a 10 percent drop in apple s share price and worrying falls in the dow jones industrial average standard poor s 500 stock index and the nasdaq composite index these problems are not apple s alone the stock price of taiwanese companies that supply apple quickly fell as did japanese manufacturers such as japan display which makes the liquid crystal displays for the iphone xr according to the japan machine tool builders association orders from china of machine tools for electrical and precision machinery plummeted over 90 6 percent from the previous year in november consistent with that manufacturing indexes across southeast asia have all fallen in the wake of apple s announcement this week samsung electronics announced that it too would reduce its anticipated fourth quarter profits it blamed mounting macro uncertainties and lackluster demand for memory chips which constitute a majority of its profits and more than a third of its sales
the bank of canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ¾ per cent the bank rate is correspondingly 2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 ½ per cent the global economic expansion continues to moderate with growth forecast to slow to 3 4 per cent in 2019 from 3 7 per cent in 2018 in particular growth in the united states remains solid but is expected to slow to a more sustainable pace through 2019 however there are increasing signs that the us china trade conflict is weighing on global demand and commodity prices global benchmark prices for oil have been about 25 per cent lower than assumed in the october monetary policy report mpr the lower prices primarily reflect sustained increases in us oil supply and more recently increased worries about global demand these worries among market participants have also been reflected in bond and equity markets the drop in global oil prices has a material impact on the canadian outlook resulting in lower terms of trade and national income as well transportation constraints and rising production have combined to push up oil inventories in the west and exert even more downward pressure on canadian benchmark prices while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in alberta investment in canada s oil sector is projected to weaken further these developments are occurring in the context of a canadian economy that has been performing well overall growth has been running close to potential employment growth has been strong and unemployment is at a 40 year low looking ahead exports and non energy investment are projected to grow solidly supported by foreign demand the cusma the lower canadian dollar and federal tax measures targeted at investment meanwhile consumption spending and housing investment have been weaker than expected as housing markets adjust to municipal and provincial measures changes to mortgage guidelines and higher interest rates household spending will be dampened further by slow growth in oil producing provinces the bank will continue to monitor these adjustments the bank projects real gdp will grow by 1 7 per cent in 2019 0 4 percentage points slower than the october outlook this revised forecast reflects a temporary slowing in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 this will open up a modest amount of excess capacity primarily in oil producing regions nevertheless indicators of demand should start to show renewed momentum in early 2019 leading to above potential growth of 2 1 per cent in 2020 core inflation measures remain clustered close to 2 per cent as expected cpi inflation eased to 1 7 in november due to lower gasoline prices cpi inflation is projected to edge further down and be below 2 per cent through much of 2019 owing mainly to lower gasoline prices on the other hand the lower level of the canadian dollar will exert some upward pressure on inflation as these transitory effects unwind and excess capacity is absorbed inflation will return to around the 2 per cent target by late 2019 weighing all of these factors governing council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise over time into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target the appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on how the outlook evolves with a particular focus on developments in oil markets the canadian housing market and global trade policy information note the next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is march 6 2019 the next full update of the bank s outlook for the economy and inflation including risks to the projection will be published in the mpr on april 24 2019

the youth have seen enough greta thunberg from sweden over 10 000 people took to the streets of helsinki to demand swift action on climate change greenpeace and other ngo s encouraged citizens to join the march and show the political decision makers that there s no time to waste when it comes to climate change we need to act now the world s youth have finally seen and heard enough from the deplorable political process from compromised delegates corrupted political appointees and criminal corporations who sabotage these critical international discussions the truth of our ecological crisis is not difficult to see fragile ecosystems are unraveling all around us we have been warned by scientists for two centuries by the 1972 limits to growth study william catton s 1980 book overshoot by reliable scientists and by millions of ecology activists we were warned by the 2009 nature article planetary boundaries showing that humanity has breached seven critical tipping points and by the 2012 nature article approaching a state shift in earth s biosphere by 22 international scientists warning of an irreversible planetary scale transition unknown in human experience and yet politicians and delegates travel around the world stay in luxury hotels and dither about our children s future as carbon emissions rise species blink from existence rivers run dry and ancient forests burn it is no wonder and a welcome sight that the world s youth have seen enough and are not impressed thirty years of pep talks on 12 december 2018 at the cop 24 un climate conference in katowice poland swedish student greta thunberg finally said what the politicized delegates have failed to say thunberg is a direct descendant of swedish chemist svante arrhenius who predicted global heating from carbon emissions in 1896 during this year s heat wave and wildfires in sweden thunberg gained world attention by staging a school strike outside the swedish riksdag holding a sign that read skolstrejk för klimatet school strike for climate she demanded that the swedish government reduce carbon emissions her actions inspired student strikes in over 270 cities around the world speaking on behalf of climate justice now thunberg chastised the delegates and member nations for failing to take action appropriate to the climate crisis until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible there is no hope we can t solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis we need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground thunberg pointed out that if solutions within the system are so impossible to find maybe we should change the system itself and she spoke directly to the errors and injustice of our economic system our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury it is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few she exposed the errors of convenient but false solutions that have displaced the genuine solutions to climate change and ecological collapse you only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular she said you only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake we ve had thirty years of pep talking and selling positive ideas she said in stockholm prior to departing for poland and i m sorry but it doesn t work because if it would have the emissions would have gone down by now they haven t meanwhile outside the conference 330 organizations from 129 countries presented six people s demands for climate justice beginning with keep fossil fuels in the ground and end subsidies to fossil fuel industry the youth leaders urged nations to reject false solutions techno fixes and offsetting schemes in favor of real solutions that are just feasible and essential they particularly called out corporations and rich nations who use the excuse of carbon sinks to seize indigenous land they called on the rich nations whose historical carbon emissions have caused the climate crisis to accept their fair share of climate reparation costs by honoring their green climate fund obligations finally the coalition demanded that un conferences end corporate interference and sabotage of the climate talks extraction corporations have been getting massively wealthy said sriram madhusoodanan from corporate accountability they re in these talks blocking real solutions and advancing false solutions that will continue to propagate their business model why thunberg is correct thunberg is correct about years decades of pep talks and positive ideas that have failed to reduce carbon emissions scientists have known about the threat of global heating since thunberg s ancestor arrhenius calculated the impact in the nineteenth century the modern world has been meeting about the crisis for almost forty years since the first world climate conference in geneva in 1979 since then human carbon emissions have doubled from about 5 gigatonnes of carbon per year gtc yr to 2018 s record breaking 10 88 gtc yr meanwhile co 2 concentration in the atmosphere has grown by 22 from 337 parts per million ppm in 1979 to over 412 ppm today these results represent an enormous failure on the part of world governments she is also correct about the unfulfilled promise of green growth a notion made popular in 2012 at the un conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro by the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development both dedicated to industrial growth however recent studies show that green or sustainable growth are delusions in 2018 anthropologist jason hickel reviewed recent data and wrote in foreign policy that green growth is based more on wishful thinking than on evidence a 2012 study by german resource economist monika dittrich and colleagues showed that even under optimum conditions decoupling economic growth from resource use has not occurred the united nations environment programme came to similar conclusions in 2016 and 2017 studies they predicted that by 2050 with continued growth resource use would double to 180 billion metric tons per year gt y ecological footprint data shows that a sustainable level of resource use is about 50 gt y a limit breached in 2000 studies have consistently and rigidly linked economic growth to energy in a 2012 paper no way out the double bind in seeking global prosperity alongside mitigated climate change t j garrett at the university of utah performed the calculations and determined that every single dollar us dollar 1990 of global economic growth in recent decades required approximately 9 7 milliwatts of energy global co 2 emission rates wrote garrett cannot be decoupled from wealth through efficiency gains wealthy nations such as the uk and us have claimed to decouple energy use from gdp but only because they have exported energy intensive industries and now import finished goods cars computers trinkets which represent massive embedded energy based on recent data thunberg is entirely correct that green growth is a delusion pull the break finally thunberg is correct that the only paths out of our predicament require that we change the system itself global heating biodiversity loss environmental toxins nutrient cycle disruption and all other ecological challenges arise as symptoms of a single larger biophysical reality humanity is in a state of ecological overshoot there is no way to grow out of overshoot all genuine solutions to overshoot require that the species contract not grow as thunberg says it is time to face these facts to slow down and to pull the emergency brake on economic growth this is the reality that the climate conference delegates are too scared to voice our status quo economic system industrial capitalism requires growth to survive without endless economic growth the 250 trillion global debt to bankers and investors cannot be paid as thunberg says our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people can live in luxury the biosphere is being sacrificed so bankers can receive their interest payments to keep stock prices up and to avoid facing reality the current system is biased for the rich to get richer as multitudes suffer as the ecosystem collapses and as other species disappear economist jeremy grantham concurs in the race for our lives when he states that capitalism and mainstream economics simply cannot deal with these problems corporate sabotage of the climate talks is not new in the 1920s and 30s standard oil general motors and firestone tires acquired and sabotaged public transportation throughout north america for the purpose of replacing efficient public transport with gas guzzling cars today in nigeria ecuador canada in the arctic around the world and at these un conferences oil companies are still sabotaging the public interest for profits it gives us some measure of hope that young leaders appear to be among the few who have the courage and insight to speak the truth greta thunberg closed her short talk by announcing we have not come here to beg world leaders to care we have come here to let you know that change is coming whether you like it or not her speech stands as one of the most hopeful moments for ecological realism in recent years

in 2019 from 3 7 per cent in 2018 in particular growth in the united states remains solid but is expected to slow to a more sustainable pace through 2019 however there are increasing signs that the us china trade conflict is weighing on global demand and commodity prices global benchmark prices for oil have been about 25 per cent lower than assumed in the october monetary policy report mpr the lower prices primarily reflect sustained increases in us oil supply and more recently increased worries about global demand these worries among market participants have also been reflected in bond and equity markets the drop in global oil prices has a material impact on the canadian outlook resulting in lower terms of trade and national income as well transportation constraints and rising production have combined to push up oil inventories in the west and exert even more downward pressure on canadian benchmark prices while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following

washington ap feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations in this jan 2 2019 photo acting secretary of the interior david bernhardt left and acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan right listen as president donald trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the white house in washington ap photo evan vucci trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totaling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have willfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election ___ the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall ___ trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30 ___ associated press writers eric tucker chad day josh boak michael balsamo colleen long jill colvin ricardo

including retail industry metrics this press release makes reference to certain non ifrs measures including certain retail industry metrics these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information

a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under ifrs we use non ifrs measures including ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted net income per diluted share and gross

prices primarily reflect sustained increases in us oil supply and more recently increased worries about global demand these worries among market participants have also been reflected in bond and equity markets the drop in global oil prices has a material impact on the canadian outlook resulting in lower terms of trade and national income as well transportation constraints and rising production have combined to push up oil inventories in the west and exert even more downward pressure on canadian benchmark prices while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in alberta investment in canada s oil sector is projected to weaken further these developments are occurring in the context of a canadian economy that has been performing well overall growth has been running close to potential employment growth has been strong and unemployment is at a 40 year low looking ahead exports and non energy investment are projected

bank projects real gdp will grow by 1 7 per cent in 2019 0 4 percentage points slower than the october outlook this revised forecast reflects a temporary slowing in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 this will open up a modest amount of excess capacity primarily in oil producing regions nevertheless indicators of demand should start to show renewed momentum in early 2019 leading to above potential growth of 2 1 per cent in 2020 core inflation measures remain clustered close to 2 per cent as expected cpi inflation eased to 1 7 in november due to lower gasoline prices cpi inflation is projected to edge further down and be below 2 per cent through much of 2019 owing mainly to lower gasoline prices on the other hand the lower level of the canadian dollar will exert some upward pressure on inflation as these transitory effects unwind and excess capacity is absorbed inflation will return to around the 2 per cent target by late 2019 weighing all of these factors

acknowledges that the deutsche bank list is comprehensive however he notes that after reading through the various scenarios that can potentially trigger a black swan event i realized that the author of the article had neglected to point out the elephant in the room the possible collapse of deutsche bank henschen s commentary continues by discussing recent red flags for deutsche bank the stock price for deutsche bank recently broke the 8 mark and is looking eerily similar to lehman brothers it holds a gargantuan quantity of derivatives which have multiple layers of derivatives backing primary derivatives reminiscent of the 2008 derivative debacle in june the wall street journal published an article deutsche bank fails fed s stress test citing material weakness in capital planning and the lender falling short in capabilities to forecast revenues and losses in key business lines and was deficient in risk management controls henschen then cites simon paige a writer for the data driven investor who also works for the emerging long short crypto currency investing group bitcoin enhanced as a trader paige works with cautioned via email be mindful of anything you do that has deutsche bank as counterparty the largest derivative counterparty in the market and not much capital to back it up as paige explains because derivatives have spawned a financial system of mutual dependencies between institutions there is no knowing which part of the system may be the trigger for general collapse watch the movie margin call if deutsche bank goes down so may the institutions you bought your stocks mutual funds tracker funds and property funds from the assets themselves would also likely lose some or all of their value to further make the point on the danger of derivatives henschen s article notes the size of the derivatives market worldwide using data for the bank of international settlements which shows that the value of these contracts was close to 595 trillion as of june 30 2018 the value of derivative contract positions held by u s commercial banks stood at 207 trillion as of sept 30 2018 according to the office of the comptroller of the currency the market value of assets underlying these contracts though is 12 7 trillion according to henschen we have learned little from the 2007 2008 economic crisis when it comes to derivatives which warren buffet has referred to as financial weapons of mass destruction the major irony of this global risks list is that deutsche bank should have put itself at the top of the list says henschen jon henschen is

china s economy is slowing and facing increasingly powerful headwinds economists have been watching evidence pile up for some time but apple ceo tim cook s warning that sales of its iphone have been slowing in china sent apple shares along with those of other technology companies into a slide chinese authorities are trying to cushion the impact of a slowdown but the causes are diverse and sustained growth is increasingly difficult policy makers must prepare for troubles in china and protect their own economies from the fallout cook was forced to revise downward apple s growth forecasts because of slowing iphone sales in china in 2015 apple boasted of multiple quarters in which revenue growth in greater china topped 100 percent per year in november 2018 that number plummeted to 16 percent and it is expected to fall still further those grim numbers sparked a 10 percent drop in apple s share price and worrying falls in the dow jones industrial average standard poor s 500 stock index and the nasdaq composite index these problems are not apple s alone the stock price of taiwanese companies that supply apple quickly fell as did japanese manufacturers such as japan display which makes the liquid crystal displays for the iphone xr according to the japan machine tool builders association orders from china of machine tools for electrical and precision machinery plummeted over 90 6 percent from the previous year in november consistent with that manufacturing indexes across southeast asia have all fallen in the wake of apple s announcement this week samsung electronics announced that it too would reduce its anticipated fourth quarter profits it blamed mounting macro uncertainties and lackluster demand for memory chips which constitute a majority of its profits and more than a third of its sales
washington on its 20th birthday the best that can be said of the euro the european currency used by 19 countries is that it has survived two decades after being introduced in 1999 it has not achieved its central goals increasing economic growth and strengthening public support for european political institutions in many ways just the opposite has occurred the economy of the eurozone all the countries that adopted the euro great britain and some other nations declined to join still lags the united states in growth for 2019 growth is forecast at only 1 6 percent compared with 2 6 percent for the united states even worse the contentious negotiations over rescuing the eurozone s weaker members greece spain portugal and italy have left a bitter aftertaste debtor countries feel they were treated badly by the wealthier creditor countries particularly germany meanwhile the creditors resent having to bail out their poorer neighbors animosities remain all this looms over europe s present political crisis its rising populism its anger over immigration and the conflict over brexit another euro crisis a clear possibility would make things worse italy seems especially vulnerable with little economic growth and government debt at about 130 percent of its gross domestic product notes rebecca patterson in a report for the bessemer trust a financial services firm the euro s appeal was simple eliminating separate currencies for the european union s member countries would reduce the nuisance of money conversions promote stable exchange rates and stimulate trade faster economic growth would make the case for more centralized control a more powerful eu at first things went well interest rates dropped sharply especially for weaker borrowers in january 1999 rates on italian 10 year government bonds were virtually the same as rates on similar german bonds although the german economy and its repayment prospects were much better than italy s advertisement by contrast italian interest rates had been much higher before the euro the gap or spread between german and italian rates was 5 percentage points in early 1995 other debtor countries got similar relief from higher interest rates the apparent justification for the lower rates was this investors believed that the discipline of a single currency would force many poorer eu countries to improve their economies and less optimistically if they got in trouble they would be bailed out by others so the risk of lending had declined more could be lent the result should have surprised no one there was a credit boom says economist adam posen of the peterson institute german french dutch and belgian banks lent to greek spanish italian and portuguese borrowers money flooded into greek bonds and spanish real estate everyone was happy greece spain and other debtors enjoyed the pleasures of easy money germany and other creditor nations benefited from strong exports which in turn were ultimately financed by loans from these countries banks the trouble was that the creditors overlent and the debtors overborrowed america s 2007 09 great recession was fatal its side effects including a steep fall in global trade hurt many european borrowers and lenders some lenders were unwilling or unable to renew their loans there were sudden stops as posen puts it to stay solvent borrowers had to get government credit from central banks and international agencies such as the international monetary fund or cut spending and raise taxes it was here that the toughest negotiations occurred as lenders and borrowers argued over terms advertisement one possible solution was for debtor countries to abandon the euro and revert to national currencies and to do so at conversion rates that favored borrowers this didn t happen though there was much speculation that it might almost everyone agreed that ditching the euro would have involved hugely difficult legal political operational and moral issues still it was a possibility if a few countries had jettisoned the euro what would have happened nothing many countries doing likewise a deep global recession none of this occurred in part because no one could confidently answer these questions another reason is that the euro remains popular at home by one survey 74 percent of euro users support it people favor the euro though not the measures needed to make it workable in the end the european central bank bought 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds nearly 3 trillion at present exchange rates to prop up the currency after mario draghi president of the ecb pledged in mid 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro the story continues eventually we re going to have another u s recession says patterson author of the bessemer trust report then we ll see whether europe s governments banks and businesses can withstand the pressures created by high debt and low economic growth and whether the euro can still survive robert samuelson is a columnist

improvement in risk appetite trading more than 1 per cent higher again today having rebounded almost 20 per cent from its christmas lows oanda analyst craig erlam said the rebound in stock markets that has occurred in the same period is no coincidence and strongly suggests that global growth fears which were arguably overdone were at least partly responsible for such a severe decline in prices

sector and financial markets but will try to strike a balanced tone as the longer term forecast is largely intact we expect just modest downward revisions to 2019 growth he said the td report also says bank of canada governor stepehn poloz will likely reiterate that the bank s policy rate will need to move back to the neutral range depending on data of course markets will have hard time pricing

been about 25 per cent lower than assumed in the october monetary policy report mpr the lower prices primarily reflect sustained increases in us oil supply and more recently increased worries about global demand these worries among market participants have also been reflected in bond and equity markets the drop in global oil prices has a material impact on the canadian outlook resulting in lower terms of trade and national income as well transportation constraints and rising production have combined to push up oil inventories in the west and exert even more downward pressure on canadian benchmark prices while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in alberta investment in canada s oil sector is projected to weaken further these developments are occurring in the context of a canadian economy that has been performing well overall growth has been running close to potential employment growth has been strong and unemployment is

in oil producing provinces the bank will continue to monitor these adjustments the bank projects real gdp will grow by 1 7 per cent in 2019 0 4 percentage points slower than the october outlook this revised forecast reflects a temporary slowing in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 this will open up a modest amount of excess capacity primarily in oil producing regions nevertheless indicators of demand should start to show renewed momentum in early 2019 leading to above potential growth of 2 1 per cent in 2020 core inflation measures remain clustered close to 2 per cent as expected cpi inflation eased to 1 7 in november due to lower gasoline prices cpi inflation is projected to edge further down and be below 2 per cent through much of 2019 owing mainly to lower gasoline prices on the other hand the lower level of the canadian dollar will exert some upward pressure on inflation as these transitory effects unwind and excess capacity is absorbed inflation will return to around the 2 per cent target by late 2019 weighing all of these factors governing council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise over time into a neutral range to

commodity currencies are trading broadly higher today as risk appetite is lifted by optimism over us china trade negotiations in beijing canadian dollar is additionally supported by rally in oil price with wti breaking 50 handle on the other hand yen is trading as the weakest one followed by swiss franc and dollar euro is not too far away boc rate decision will be a bit of wild card today while it

for next near term fibonacci level at 1 3118 while the fall is steep and deep it s too early to declare medium term bearish reversal yet reactions to 1 3118 might provide some clues though yen crosses

third day with good progress global stocks are lifted by news that china us trade talks in beijing are extending into an unscheduled third day with signs of good progress it s confirmed by a us trade representative spokesperson who said a statement will likely follow then nevertheless the extension itself is affirmative as both sides need time and efforts to full exchange their views before getting close to an agreement by 90 day deadline on march 2 trump tweeted yesterday that talks with china are going very well reuters also reported quoting unnamed source saying overall the talks have been constructive our sense is that there s good progress on the purchase piece however it s unknown how china is going to address a key issue of intellectual property theft but at least this week china issued long awaited approvals for import of five genetically modified crops which would boost import of us grains there was also another larger purchase of us soybeans these are widely seen as gestures of good will separately the china daily said in an editorial china will not seek a solution to the trade frictions by making unreasonable concessions and any agreement has to involve give and take from both sides trump s oval speech did no breakthrough on government shutdown trump used his oval speech to bluntly demand the congress to provide usd 5 7b funding to build the border wall trump questioned how much more american blood must be shed before congress does its job and pointed to the numbers of crimes committed by illegal immigrants but he didn t declare national emergency to use military funds for the wall democratic speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi responded and said the president has chosen fear we want to start with the facts she added the fact is president trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health safety and well being of the american people and withhold the paychecks of 800 000 innocent workers across the nation many of them veterans senate democratic leader chuck schumer said the symbol of america should be the statue of liberty not a 30 foot wall and so our suggestion is a simple one mr president reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security but end this shutdown now so overall there is no sign of a breakthrough regarding the shutdown yet which is already in it s third week boc to stand pat might downgrade growth forecasts boc rate decision will be a major focus today we d maintain that boc will keep policy rate unchanged at 1 75 besides releasing the statement and monetary policy report the central bank would also update the economic forecasts and host a press conference the focus of the meeting would be possible downward revisions on the growth outlook and forward guidance on the policy stance we expect the central bank to maintain the dovish tone laid down in the december meeting we expect boc to trim its inflation forecast due to lower energy prices current rebound in oil price was mainly driven by the saudi led production cut and us china trade talk we believe the boosts to oil prices are short lived global economic slowdown this year is prone to limit demand for oil limiting the rally in oil prices boc should also downgrade its gdp growth estimate modestly in the near term growth would be dampened by alberta s compulsory reduction in oil output effective in the new year in the longer term the country s economic growth would be affected by the overall slowdown in the global economy more in boc preview no change in

stays on the downside for 61 8 retracement of 1 2781 to 1 3664 at 1 3118 we ll look for bottoming sign below there on the upside above 1 3323 minor resistance will turn bias neutral first in the bigger picture the medium term rise from 1 2061 2017 low might continue further but the structure of such rise is not clearly impulsive so far hence we d stay cautious on strong resistance from 61 8 retracement of 1 4689 2016 high to 1 2061 at 1 3685 and 1 3793 resistance to limit upside and bring medium term topping but in any case medium term outlook will stay bullish as long as channel support

the bursting of the us housing bubble in 2007 offers a case in point no one doubted the us was the epicentre of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the us capital actually flooded into it in the last three months of 2008 net purchases of us assets reached us 500 billion historically the safe haven par excellence was the united states in the form of treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as one investment strategist put it back in 2012 when people are worried all roads lead to treasuries with equities slumping exchange rate volatility increasing and political risks intensifying financial markets around the world have hit a rough patch in times like these international investors generally grow cautious and prioritise safety over returns so money flees to safe havens that provide secure liquid investment grade assets on a sufficiently large scale but there are no obvious safe havens today for the first time in living memory investors lack a quiet port where they can take shelter from a storm to be sure some of the dollar claims were added to portfolios because foreign banks and institutional investors were meeting funding needs with greenbacks after interbank and other wholesale short term markets seized up but that was hardly the only reason why portfolio managers piled into the us much of the increased demand was due to sheer fear at a time when nobody knew how bad things might get the us was widely seen as the safest bet the prototypes for us president donald trump s border wall are seen behind the border fence between mexico and the us the us government has been shut down by a dispute over funding for the wall photo reuters but this was before the arrival of us president donald trump who has managed to undermine confidence in the dollar to an unprecedented degree in addition to abandoning any notion of fiscal responsibility trump has spent his first two years in office attacking international institutions and picking fights with us allies to be sure even before trump confidence in the dollar suffered a blow in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded the us debt rating by one notch in response to a near shutdown of the government that episode was triggered by a stand off between then president barack obama and congressional republicans over a routine proposal to raise the federal debt ceiling today investors have even more reason to worry about the us government s credit rating in 2018 alone the us government was shut down three times and it remains in a partial shutdown to this day owing to trump s demand for funds to build a big beautiful wall on the border with mexico where can investors go if not the us the euro zone might seem like a logical alternative after the dollar the euro is the world s most widely used currency and taken together the capital markets of the 19 euro zone members are close in size to the us market but europe has troubles of its own economic growth is slowing not least in germany and the risk of a banking crisis looms in italy the euro zone s third largest economy worse still is the uncertainty over brexit which could be highly disruptive if britain crashes out of the european union without a divorce agreement needless to say britain too can be ruled out as a safe haven at least until the brexit fiasco is resolved the european central bank has taken control of a troubled italian bank banca carige photo reuters what about the swiss franc its attractions are obvious but switzerland s financial markets are simply too small to serve as an adequate substitute for the us that leaves japan with its abundant supply of government bonds it is the biggest single market for public debt outside the us the question for portfolio managers though is whether it is really safe to invest in a country where government debt exceeds 230 per cent of gdp for comparison the public debt to gdp ratio in the us is around 88 per cent and even in troubled italy it is no more than 130 per cent admittedly the market for japanese government debt is more stable than most owing to the fact that much of it is held by domestic savers which is to say it is safely tucked under the mattress but japan is an ageing country with an economy that has remained almost stagnant for a quarter of a century investors would be right to wonder where it would find the resources to continue servicing its massive debt and then there is china with the world s third largest national market for public debt certainly the supply of assets in china is ample but the chinese market is so tightly controlled that it is essentially the opposite of a safe haven it will be a long time before global investors even consider putting much faith in chinese securities with secure ports becoming scarce investors will become increasingly jittery they will be inclined to move funds at the slightest sign of danger which will add substantially to market volatility today

in a press conference bank of canada governor stephen poloz said over time was inserted to introduce a degree of ambiguity into the timing of future rate hikes and that they are not on some pre set course we are decidedly data dependent and will adapt our inflation outlook and interest rate profile to developments as they unfold he said in a prepared speech the policy interest rate will need to rise over time into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target according to the bank s jan 9 press release the insertion of over time distinguishes the sentence from the dec 5 press release ottawa the fall in oil prices and greater than expected weakness in housing markets are two developments temporarily dampening the bank of canada s outlook for the canadian economy to no surprise the boc kept its overnight rate target at 1 75 percent on jan 9 and implied more uncertainty about the pace of rate hikes going forward as the economy works through a soft patch i do think the over time statement was significant but they did try their best to present a balanced picture said andrew kelvin senior canada strategist at td securities kelvin said markets are pricing in about a 60 percent chance of only one more rate hike in 2019 i wouldn t be surprised to see zero said economics professor steve ambler there s really not too much sign of inflation picking up ambler the c d howe institute s david dodge chair in monetary policy said that if the u s federal reserve doesn t raise rates as much as was thought then neither will the boc the bank did an about face in december given the sharp drop in oil prices and widening of the differential between canadian oil and the u s benchmark west texas intermediate wti the updated quarterly monetary policy report mpr backs this up forecasting 2019 growth at 1 7 percent which is 0 4 percentage points lower than what was forecast in october despite the downgrade poloz said the bank s governing council feels the economy is still on solid footing in the end i m confident that we re going to be ok through all of this he said the oil price assumption supporting the bank s january forecasts is 20 lower than in october however the canadian benchmark price is just 5 lower reflecting the effects of alberta s mandated production cuts the differential between western canada select and wti has come in from over 40 to about 10 but tough times have room to run in the oilpatch investment in canada s oil sector is projected to weaken further according to the bank s press release with the lack of pipelines firms sentiment has worsened since october and their ability to borrow money or raise capital is tying their hands the canadian economy has been through a crash in oil prices many times before but the boc anticipates the latest woes to be roughly one quarter as bad as the 2014 2016 episode part of this is due to the canadian economy being less dependent on the oil and gas sector oilpatch business investment has gone from about 30 percent to 15 percent of the canadian economy s total capital spending and the share of canadian gross domestic product gdp from oil and gas production is estimated to have fallen from 6 percent in 2014 to 3 5 percent in 2018 furthermore energy firms are now more efficient having gotten used to operating in a low price environment there s less room for the oil sector to adversely affect output because the investment projects have already been cancelled ambler said thus the drop in investment spending won t be as drastic as 2015 weighing on oil prices is slower global demand and greater supply from the united states the boc forecasts global growth to moderate in 2019 to 3 4 percent from 3 7 percent in 2018 the bank sees the slowing of growth limited to the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 as the rest of the canadian economy remains fundamentally strong renewed robust momentum is expected by late 2019 carrying into 2020 the positive drivers are in place having the new nafta cusma and other trade agreements in place supports expanding global demand a lower canadian dollar helps boost exports and federal tax measures are in place to spur investment spending

that news offset both the trade news and a far more dovish interpretation of the discussion at the federal reserve s december policy meeting with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting participants generally judged that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion strong labour market conditions and inflation near 2 per cent over the medium term according to the statement released at 6am aedt with an increase in the target range at this meeting the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer run neutral interest rate and participants expressed that recent developments including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier against this backdrop many participants expressed the view that especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures the committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming earlier overnight four regional fed presidents each expressed

from brandon smith in 2018 a very significant economic change occurred which sealed the fate of the u s economy as well as some other economies around the globe this change was the shift of central bank policy the era of stimulus and artificial support of various markets including stocks is beginning to fade away as the federal reserve pursues policy tightening including higher interest rates and larger cuts to its balance sheet i warned of this change under new chairman jerome powell at the beginning of 2018 in my article new fed chairman will trigger stock market crash in 2018 the crash had a false start in february march as stocks were saved by massive corporate buybacks through the 2nd and 3rd quarters however as interest rates edged higher and trump s tax cut cash ran thin corporate stock buybacks began to dwindle in the final quarter of the year as i predicted in september in my article the everything bubble when will it finally crash the crash accelerated in december as the fed raised interest rates to their neutral rate of inflation and increased balance sheet cuts to 50 billion per month it is important to note that when we speak of a crash in alternative economic circles we are not only talking about stock markets mainstream economists often claim that stocks are a predictive indicator for the future health of the wider economy this is incorrect stocks are actually a trailing indicator they crash long after all other fundamentals have started to decline housing markets have been plunging in terms of sales as well as prices the fed s interest rate hikes are translating to much higher mortgage rates in the wake of overly inflated values and weaker consumer wages corporate buyers in real estate which have been propping up the housing market for years are now unable to continue life support corporate debt across the board is at all time highs not seen since the crash of 2008 and with higher interest rates borrowing cheap capital is no longer an option in november of 2018 home sales posted the steepest decline in over 7 years auto markets another major indicator of economic stability have been plunging in extreme fashion autos saw steep declines throughout the last half of 2018 once again as higher fed interest rates killed easy credit arm style car loans u s credit is also drying up as investors pull capital from volatile markets and interest rates rise liquidity is disappearing which means debt is becoming more expensive or inaccessible to most people and businesses a false narrative is being presented in the mainstream on these circumstances by both the media and central bankers there has been a considerable amount of jawboning by economic authorities and mainstream analysts in an attempt to keep the public distracted from the economic crisis as well as keep the investment world engaged in trading with blinders on with the propaganda going into overdrive we must cut through the fog and mirrors and gauge the most important threats within the system and determine when they might escalate make no mistake as erratic and unstable as 2018 was 2019 will be far worse the federal reserve will continue tightening there is a lie circulating in the media that jerome powell and the fed are heroic for going against past central bank regimes and removing easy money policies this is the exact opposite of what is really happening we have to remember that it was the fed and other central banks that created the initial crash in 2008 through easy money policies they then deliberately created an even bigger bubble the everything bubble through more monetary stimulus a bubble so large that it would collapse the entire u s economy including bond markets and the dollar if it ever burst this circular process of crisis stimulus crisis is one that that the central bank has used for over a century former fed officials like ben bernanke and alan greenspan have openly admitted to central bank culpability for the great depression as well as the crash of 2008 though as they do this they also assert that they were not aware at the time of the greater danger i don t buy that for a second in almost every instance during which the fed created a crash environment banking institutions were able to use the opportunity to snatch up hard assets for pennies on the dollar as well as steal more political and social power during the great depression major banks absorbed thousands of smaller local banks as well as all the assets those banks held in 2008 banks and corporations enjoyed a deluge of easy money paid for by american taxpayers for generations to come while also vacuuming up hard assets like distressed home mortgages an even greater prize for banking elites is global centralization of economic authority which is what i believe their goal is as the next engineered crash runs its course as crisis leads to catastrophe it will be institutions driven by globalism like the imf and bis that step in to save the day as i have noted time and time again jerome powell is well aware of what will happen as the fed tightens he is recorded in the fed minutes of october 2012 discussing the consequences including his hint of an impending crash if the fed shut down stimulus measures raised interest rates and cut the balance sheet we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us yet powell continues tightening all the same indicating that fed actions and the results are quite deliberate recent statements by powell have been wrongly interpreted by the mainstream to indicate that the fed might back off of tightening policies i predict that this will not happen at least not until the crash has already run its course i expect powell to continue balance sheet cuts at around 50 billion per month through the rest of 2019 i also hold to my original prediction last year that the fed will hike interest rates in 2019 at least two more times with a hike in march stock markets will continue the plunge many alternative economists have been pointing out over the years the direct correlation between the fed balance sheet and stock market prices as the fed bought up assets the stock market rose exactly in tandem now as the fed dumps assets stocks are falling with increasing speed and volatility the recent pause in the plunge is most likely due to end of the year investment by corporate pension funds searching desperately for yield in an environment where bonds are no longer viable or safe this pause will end as the fed resumes its asset dumps again this month it is likely that this will produce a monthly cycle of stock purges followed by a moderate bounce each time the fed is not cutting from the balance sheet the fed s comments on market accommodation are in my view completely fraudulent because the central bank has cut stimulus and raised interest rates to the point that corporations can no longer afford massive buyback binges there is nothing left to support stocks except disinformation and blind faith this is a controlled demolition of the economy and markets the fed will jawbone as much as possible to keep the system from imploding too fast because jawboning is the only tool that is left in the meantime powell will keep cutting assets and raising interest rates on schedule this will inevitably translate into lower prices in equities as the system is steam valved down blind faith by investors will only go so far they will be left holding the bag right along with pensions stocks will resume their steep decline through 2019 and will fall well below support levels seen in 2017 if december s decline was any indication as long as the fed continues its current rate of balance sheet cuts i see the dow in the 17 000 to 18 000 point range by the end of march trump will get the blame for the crash trump s incessant propensity for taking credit for the bull rally in stocks makes him a perfect scapegoat for the ongoing crash the acceleration in 2019 will be followed by numerous distractions while trump has blamed the federal reserve for recent stock instability he has at the same time blamed his own trade war trump has attached the success of his presidency to the success of a stock market that he used to call a big bubble created by the fed trump s trade war along with the government shutdown are just two factors that are already being targeted by the mainstream media and globalist commentators as the causes of the december plunge in equities the shutdown might not continue through january if trump starts building the southern border wall making the budget debate rather moot that said i suspect it may continue anyway this time does feel different the timing of the current shutdown makes it such a useful distraction away from central bank actions that i would be surprised if it was ended in the near term also if it remains until february the threat of delays on ebt and government welfare would be a very juicy crisis that could be exploited by banks and those driven by globalism i predict the trade war will continue through 2019 as it has for the past year trump will announce huge progress on negotiations with china at times in order to jawbone stocks up but days or weeks later this progress will once again come into question i realize this is an easy prediction the trade war farce has followed a rather predictable pattern lately trump has been extraordinarily helpful to the banking elites in this regard in fact the trump administration adds a new

the recent gyrations in the stock market and the uncertainties surrounding american trade policies with china and other parts of the world have raised the question of when the next recession will inevitably follow the current economic recovery from the 2008 9 financial crisis in the face of a future economic downturn some economic policy analysts are already making the case for central banks to use negative interest rates to dampen and shorten the impact of any economy wide decline in output and employment that may be ahead not surprisingly much of the speculation concerning the power of government to mitigate if not prevent an economic downturn surrounds the usual debates over the potentials of monetary and fiscal policy harvard university economist kenneth rogoff in a recent article central bankers fiscal constraints january 4 2019 downplays the efficacy of taxing and spending tools and highlights instead the continuing crucial role of monetary policy and interest rate manipulation the limits on implementing fiscal policy with nominal interest rates in the united states and some other places around the world still at historical lows even in the face of recent federal reserve rate increases rogoff points out that many central bankers hope that more direct fiscal policy will carry the weight of countercyclical activities in the face of any serious recession that may come but he points out that in the american system of government there is little immediate flexibility to enable agreement upon and introduction of tax cuts or spending increases that might be effective in holding back the recessionary trends in a timely fashion fiscal changes must work their way through and be passed by congress then signed by the president and finally implemented by various government agencies the entire process normally can take a long time during which a recession could get increasingly worse besides the political and ideological conflicts and controversies among democrats and republicans have become even more divisive in recent years thus rogoff says any agreement about who should benefit from any tax cuts and on what programs increased government spending should be directed would not be easily or quickly resolved all this would prevent fiscal policy from taking the lead in fighting the next recession monetary policy with zero interest rates this means that the primary burden of recession fighting continues to fall on the shoulders of the federal reserve the question is how shall america s central bank do the job when its primary policy tool in the face of an economic downturn the lowering of interest rates through monetary expansion has little room for manipulation because key interest rates are nominally so near to zero already in rogoff s view this calls for new monetary policy strategies in the uncharted waters of negative interest rates central bankers who are serious about preparing for future recessions he states should be looking hard at proposals for how to pay interest on money both positive and negative which is by far the most elegant solution what shall a central bank do when price inflation rates remain low say 2 percent or less and nominal interest rates are at or near zero where is the policy room to lower interest rates in an attempt to stimulate borrowing for investment and other purposes during a recession in a setting in which nominal interest rates are already so low negative real interest rates under inflation and deflation it is common knowledge that the real rate of interest on borrowed money can be negative if the nominal interest rate at which a sum of money has been lent for a year is for instance 3 percent and if during that year price inflation has been say 4 percent then when the loan is repaid 12 months later not only will the lender not have received any real interest gain over their principle but they will not even get back a sum in real buying power equal to the original purchasing power they lent if the lender lent 100 with the promise from the borrower to pay back 103 a year from now and if because of the 4 percent price inflation a basket of goods that cost 100 at the beginning of the year now costs therefore 104 at the end of the year then the lender has not received back a large enough nominal sum 103 even to acquire the same original 100 basket of goods that now costs 104 thus in real purchasing power the lender has earned a negative return on their lending but how do you get anyone to lend if the central bank attempts to push nominal rates into a negative range for instance suppose that federal reserve policy succeeds in lowering nominal interest rates to 1 percent that is if you lend 100 today a year from now you will receive back a nominal sum of 99 even if price inflation is zero and a basket of goods costs 100 both today and in a year you the lender are worse off by 1 you d be better off simply holding the 100 until that year has passed to buy that 100 basket of goods if there are no more profitable ways of utilizing that sum of money over that period of time now of course if it was expected that price deflation was going to occur during the coming year such that a basket of goods that cost 100 in the present would only cost 95 in a year accepting a percent nominal rate of interest would still leave the lender better off since they would receive 99 at the end of the year and thus be able to buy a larger basket of goods than at the start of the year but they would be still better off just holding on to their 100 and experiencing a greater real increase in their buying power than if they only got back 99 at the end of the loan period to buy that basket of goods for 95 the keynesian case for fiscal policy we could imagine a situation in which the federal reserve bought government and other securities in the financial markets and created money in the process as the means by which to purchase these financial assets this would swell the loanable reserves position of commercial banks and the cash balances of individuals who had owned those securities but if in doing so the federal reserve pushed nominal interest rates into the negative range commercial banks and these individuals might very well find it more profitable to hold excess reserves or larger than usual average cash balances respectively rather than to lend any or all of that increase to add to the general supply of money in the economy now if the reason the federal reserve has undertaken such an activist monetary policy is precisely to stimulate borrowing and investment because of a perceived keynesian style deficiency of aggregate demand the impact could be anything between small and none in the postulated situation thus monetary policy would fail to bring the economy out of the recession john maynard keynes called this the liquidity trap in which interest rates are too low for people to find it worthwhile to lend at all and instead they hold any increases in the money supply as idle cash the traditional keynesian answer to this dilemma has been activist fiscal policy if the private sector will not spend and invest enough to ensure full employment then the government will run budget deficits and spend whatever amount it takes to do the job taxing banks and abolishing cash to engage in monetary policy but kenneth rogoff s argument as we saw is that fiscal policy might not be adaptable enough in the current political environment to step in to do that job so his solution is to tax financial institutions or individuals who hold excess reserves or idle cash balances above a certain amount rather than lend or spend those sums of available money this is an argument that he developed in his 2016 book the curse of cash for a summary of rogoff s argument see his article dealing with monetary paralysis at the zero bound how do you get commercial banks to not hold undesired and untimely excess reserves that otherwise they could lend to foster increased investment spending for greater economy wide output and employment with undesired and untimely in this instance being from the central bank s point of view according to rogoff the federal reserve should charge a fee to banks on all central bank defined excess reserves not lent to borrowers on the market that is a tax for not lending in the amounts and ways the central bank authorities consider necessary as for private individuals rogoff proposes for the central bank to withdraw all large denomination bank notes from circulation 100 50 and even 20 bills thus raising the costs of hoarding cash by reducing the only remaining forms to less convenient small denomination bank notes and coins in the limit rogoff would like to abolish all forms of actual cash holdings thus restricting people to using credit or debit cards or checks all money holding would be pushed into the banking system where paper trails could be maintained on virtually every dime and dollar any citizen in the country spent on anything at any time big brother would be able to watch all your transactions with anyone around the clock rogoff sees this as desirable from a different perspective in that it would assist the government in preventing illegal transactions of all sorts the cashless society would serve the ends of a more coerced society in which nothing outside of the approved orbit of government could easily be undertaken but from the perspective of mainstream macroeconomic policy it would place all money within the banking system for the central banking authority to more easily control and plan the use of the medium of exchange as part of its economic policy making in rogoff s world with all money captured within the banking system in this fashion the monetary central planners could decide how much lending should be undertaken and at what nominal rates of interest even negative ones by raising or lowering the fee imposed on the banks for holding more or less than central bank preferred levels of excess reserves thus through this policy tool the flow of loanable funds extended to investors and other borrowers could be more easily micromanaged for the asserted purpose of macroeconomic stabilization the cashless society and the loss of liberty the first observation worth making about rogoff s and similar schemes is that they are designs for reducing the freedom of the individual from the prying and pursuing eyes of the political authority cash transactions provide people with an arena of interaction outside of the controlling and constraining hand of government the usual rationale for restricting the use of cash is that it facilitates criminal activity of various sorts from gambling to prostitution to drug dealing and terrorist plotting the classical liberal or libertarian would respond by observing that many of the activities currently labeled criminal should not be crimes in a freer society and therefore would not be driven into a cash using underworld for the friend of freedom there is a serious underappreciation that vices are not crimes as lysander spooner argued long ago in a tract by that title 1875 but cash is also a way for many an ordinary citizen to implicitly undertake acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the form of protest against the pervasiveness and degree of unwarranted tax burdens placed upon the honest industry and mutually agreed upon exchanges of the members of society by an increasingly leviathan like government especially for the poor and the lower income segments of society cash transactions are a way to retain a larger amount of their hard and honestly earned income from the grasping hands of those in political power any government attempt to restrict or abolish cash transactions along the lines suggested by kenneth rogoff will only serve to strengthen the hand of those who wish to narrow the arena of interpersonal and commercial freedom in society by the government having greater control over everything that anyone earns and spends in the affairs of everyday life as for actual criminal or terrorist activity the idea that controlling the use of cash will succeed in ending such illegal activity ignores the fact that such individuals will merely find alternative ways for facilitating their endeavors the medium of exchange is not a creation of the state it originally arose through the free exchanges of multitudes of people over many hundreds of years to make the gains from trade easier to consummate those who are that determined to follow a criminal path will devise alternative mediums through which to transact their appropriately banned illegal enterprises monetary centralization and nonmarket interest rates but rogoff insists that the real reason for proposing the cashless economy and a tax on bank reserves above those desired by the federal reserve is to have a new set of policy tools to continue the task of monetary central planning in a new environment of low nominal interest rates in his world the idea that interest rates should be set by the market seems to be nonexistent that interest rates are intertemporal prices connecting and coordinating the choices of income earners to save with the decision of potential investors to borrow never appears to enter his mind market based interest rates are meant to reflect the availability of scarce saved resources for time consuming production activities the output from which will only be offered to consumers to buy at some point in the future see my article interest rates need to tell the truth for rogoff interest rates are simply manipulatable policy variables to influence the flow of investment spending for the purpose of influencing the total amount of economy wide output and employment he like too many other modern day macroeconomic and monetary economists fails to appreciate that monetary expansion and the interest rate manipulations that can accompany it not only influence aggregate output and employment but potentially distort the structure of relative prices and wages and the patterns of resource uses including resulting malinvestment of capital and misdirection of labor employment see my articles the myth that central banks assure economic stability and macro aggregates hide the real market processes at work thus are planted the seeds of an inevitable future economic downturn the artificial boom in production investment and jobs that is induced by the monetary expansion and interest rate manipulations will only last for as long as the monetary expansion continues and the wrong interest rates persist in successfully distorting savings investment relationships as well as capital resource and labor allocations among sectors of the economy federal reserve policies bring about recessions thus the activist monetary and interest rate policies that are meant to restore or maintain full employment are the very instruments that bring about the outcome that economists like kenneth rogoff say they want to prevent the occurrence and severities of recessions policies such as those championed by rogoff are the cause of the very problem he wishes to prevent or mitigate interest rate manipulations by central banks through monetary policy are similar to price controls on other goods they prevent a central and crucial market signal from telling the truth for a good part of the last decade the federal reserve used its policy tools to lower and keep a number of key market interest rates nominally near to zero when adjusted for inflation some interest rates were zero or even negative this has meant financial markets have been functioning even more than many other times in the past without a meaningful structure of intertemporal prices connecting and coordinating the nexus of savings and investment in the u s economy what have been reasonable and profit oriented investments during this decade what allocation of capital and labor reflects a proper balancing for them among competing uses in differing time consuming production processes what structure of relative prices and wages would be consistent with underlying real market supplies and demands in a setting uninfluenced by monetary and interest rate distortions the answer we do not know because federal reserve monetary and interest rate policies have prevented markets from fully and effectively functioning and expressing savings and investment choices through a market based intertemporal pricing process and structure without which there are not and cannot be any reasonable judgments about all of this what i would suggest is that it is not unreasonable to say that markets have been out of proper balance and at least partly discoordinated because of the federal reserve over the last 10 years see my article ten years on recession recovery and the regulatory state now along comes kenneth rogoff with his proposal to do away with cash as a policy tool to stop crime and reinforce central bank ability to control and manage money and interest rates in an anticipated future of needed negative nominal interest rates once the federal reserve begins operating below zero along the lines rogoff wants it will be reasonable to say that monetary central planning will have replaced any functioning financial market however imperfect it may be since it will be a sector of the economy totally without a price mechanism and completely commanded by a central authority that is beyond supply and demand
good morning i am pleased to be here to answer your questions about today s interest rate announcement and our monetary policy report mpr before taking your questions let me offer a short summary of governing council s deliberations a lot has happened since our last mpr in october for one thing the us led trade war is beginning to have negative economic consequences global financial markets have reacted bond yields have fallen yield curves have flattened even more and stock markets have repriced significantly here in canada lower oil prices have reached the point where they will have material consequences for our macroeconomic outlook and our housing sector is taking longer than expected to stabilize it is natural to focus on the latest fluctuations in the economic data but governing council also spent a good deal of time reviewing our starting situation to ensure that these new developments are put into appropriate context is the world economy moderating yes this has been in our forecast for some time the us economy has been growing well above potential because of fiscal stimulus our estimates as shown in chart 1 of the mpr show that us private sector economic growth has been slowing since early 2018 and will continue to slow this year china s economy has also been transitioning to a more sustainable pace of growth and recent policy actions are an attempt to counter the effects of its trade conflict with the united states in fact the adverse effects of tariffs on growth are beginning to show up in the world economy as a whole our forecast is for global growth of 3 4 per cent in 2019 the same figure we had in october but this is a material moderation from 3 7 per cent in 2018 is the canadian economy moderating yes 2017 was a very strong year with 3 per cent growth which is well above our potential back in october we were expecting about 2 per cent for 2018 and about the same for 2019 the economy has been operating essentially at its full capacity for about 18 months now and inflation has been running on target the labour market has been performing well not as strong as in 2017 but very solid nonetheless and unemployment is as low as we have ever seen it just last friday we received the december employment report with a rise of 9 000 jobs not an extraordinary number but solid however notice that there were 17 000 jobs lost in alberta alone no doubt due to the recent drop in oil prices this means that the rest of canada saw a net rise of 26 000 jobs in december which is very encouraging despite the strong labour market however we have seen persistent subpar wage growth we have offered a couple of new insights on that in today s mpr quite simply adjustment to the 2014 oil price decline continues to hold back wages in oil producing regions elsewhere the picture is brighter just to illustrate as shown in chart 8 of the mpr the bank s preferred measure of wage growth rose by 1 8 per cent in oil producing provinces in the third quarter in the rest of canada that figure was a more robust 2 6 per cent this trend is likely to continue as we are seeing renewed weakness in global oil prices which are about 25 per cent lower than in october this means that canada is earning less income from the rest of the world of course the biggest impact is in oil producing provinces but those incomes are spent on products produced everywhere in canada so eventually the impact is felt more broadly why are world oil prices falling the supply of oil has been outpacing demand and some two thirds of the increase in global production over the past year has been in the united states us production and the capacity to deliver to market increased by about 2 million barrels per day during 2018 at the global level the job of bringing supply back in line with demand is falling to opec so it remains to be seen if oil prices will remain as weak as they have been here in canada the situation has been made more difficult because western canadian oil prices have been depressed even more than global prices production has been outpacing our ability to deliver oil to foreign markets the announcement of mandated production cuts for 2019 caused an immediate correction in domestic prices this means that even as our prices return to their normal relationship with global prices canada earns less because of lower global prices and because of lower production based on what we know today the impact on our economy is estimated to be about one fourth the size of the 2014 16 episode the price drop is much smaller the oil producing sector is smaller and our oil producers have improved operating efficiency considerably over the past three years the canadian dollar has declined with oil prices helping to buffer the effects all other things equal lower oil prices mean approximately 0 5 per cent less gdp by the end of 2020 according to our models by convention we use current oil prices in our projection but there is considerable uncertainty about future oil prices and their effects governing council also talked a lot about the canadian housing market which is taking longer to stabilize than we expected this may be because of the various municipal or provincial measures that have been taken or it may be that the economy is more sensitive to the combined effects of the new mortgage underwriting guidelines and higher interest rates homebuyers are adapting by seeking smaller lower priced homes home sellers are offering lower prices and home builders are adapting to a growing demand for smaller homes these adjustments are taking time so we need to continue to monitor the situation carefully but we must keep in mind that the markets in toronto and vancouver were exhibiting a degree of froth and it is always difficult to judge where the market will stabilize once froth has been removed taken together the revisions to our outlook point to a downgrade in growth for 2019 to about 1 7 per cent from 2 1 per cent previously this results in a modest reduction in our forecast for inflation for 2019 but we expect to be back at 2 per cent by the end of this year weighing all of these factors governing council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise over time into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target we are fully cognizant of the negative signals being given by financial markets we believe that equity and bond markets are priced for downside risks and acknowledge these risks in our mpr the trade war is already having negative consequences globally and these will continue to grow if the situation is not resolved especially if it escalates however we remain of the view that this risk is two sided while this dispute could escalate it could also be resolved and therefore we must take into account both possibilities in managing the risks faced by the canadian economy as today s decision to keep our key policy interest rate unchanged illustrates we are decidedly data dependent and will adapt our inflation outlook and interest rate profile to developments as they unfold the appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on how the outlook evolves with a particular focus on developments in oil markets the canadian housing market and global trade policy with that i will be happy to take your questions
with reis thebault the ticker washington has been a migraine factory for wall street in recent months but investors aren t adding the government shutdown to their list of worries yet even as it threatens to become the longest on record with no end in sight president trump s nationally televised address on the matter and the democratic response to it don t appear likely to break the stalemate in fact they could have made it worse if the shutdown lasts until saturday it will break the record for the longest ever yet analysts who decode washington for professional investors tell me their clients aren t registering much concern over the latest bout of dysfunction in part that s because they remain preoccupied by a pair of developments from the nation s capital with the potential to do more macroeconomic damage in terms of quantitative impact investors haven t been very focused on it says stephen myrow managing partner of beacon policy advisors they generally are way more focused on the fed and trade advertisement so far the shutdown which is in its 19th day has barely dented broad economic growth the white house estimates the partial closure cuts output by 1 percent every two weeks jpmorgan sees more pain with up to 2 points shaved for every week of the shutdown though the economy should mostly make it up once it s over history suggests the stock market mostly shrugs it off a shutdown over the 20 shutdowns dating back to 1976 the s p 500 has posted a median return of 0 percent according to data from lpl financial research and the market has actually gained ground during each of the past five this time trump officials have taken steps at the margins to limit fallout that could have weighed on consumer spending the white house on monday directed the internal

chamber of commerce writes that it wants the government to reopen because it s hearing every day from businesses across the country the adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing and

and the shutdown has stalled trump s program to bail out farmers hurt by the trade war since the agriculture department office processing the checks has closed according to a new huffington post

uncertainty at airports as tsa workers go unpaid and consideration of the impact on ipos and basic market operations given the sec his take the market can survive a shutdown that lasts days but anxieties begin ratcheting higher when shutdowns are measured in weeks so far investors appear to be betting the standoff will end soonish advertisement it s not the sort of thing wall street cares about if it s short and they believe it will be short says charles gabriel president of capital alpha partners and in fact gabriel said it could prove a positive longer term development for markets if trump now battles his position on the wall to a final settlement one way or another that s because it would limit the number of legislative fights looming later this year packing a more disruptive punch among them are likely struggles over ratifying trump s renegotiated nafta deal lifting budget caps on federal spending hiking the debt ceiling and at least some chatter about possible

addressed a number of nettlesome issues and tried to specify how to ensure china will carry out pledges it made both sides believe they re making enough progress this week for a next round of talks

lower tariffs with nebulous promises and it will be hard to ensure that china sticks to its commitments that could make it a tough sell in washington the trump administration s trade hawks are still pushing for a lot more while even the doves fret that the new promises need effective enforcement to make sure that china follows through many american officials and businesses complain that china has

meaningful progress a position some analysts support trump wants a deal to calm markets bloomberg s jenny leonard and co according to people familiar with the matter trump s willingness to cut a deal

one of the key ideas emanating from the american revolution was that in framing the government which is to be administered by men over men the likes of madison argued that the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself it was thought democracy could only effectively function within a system of checks and balances that would limit the space for policy miscalculation in the modern era a successful democracy is incarnated by one having a decentralized government by one having a strong and independent free press an efficient justice system and independent institutions such as an independent central bank an independent budget office police force etc just to name a few in the case of mauritius power has over the years grown even more concentrated in the hands of a few or in the hands of the leader who surrounded by opportunistic advisers yes men and political appointees runs the show more like an absolute monarch than a wise man what happens when we get a leader who is not so wise but who surrounded by an opportunistic lot of yes men wields immense power over the state and its fate the recent tendency of governments across the political spectrum to hand out pre electoral populist goodies remains a dangerous and unpatriotic gesture that is more driven by self interest than by virtuous motives today the present value of unfunded liabilities of the government basic retirement pension civil service pension etc stand at close to 100 of gross domestic product gdp source bloomberg world bank data which when added to both public debt to gdp and domestic private sector debt to gdp at around 100 see the 2017 world bank mauritius domestic private debt to gdp data all add up to obligations that surpass more than 260 of gdp in present value of future cash flow outlay terms it is plain irresponsible and dangerous to believe that a low tax jurisdiction that does little targeting can sustain such liabilities in the coming decade and even add to it without dire consequences to the economy one of the key challenges that policy makers have faced over the past decade has been the fact that high capital inflows emanating from a booming offshore sector higher tourism receipts and revenues from the gradual opening up of the real estate sector to foreigners has kept the trade weighted real effective exchange rate of the rupee much higher than it should have been given the high current account deficit according to the author power has over the years remained concentrated in the hands of a few or in the hands of the leader who rules more like an absolute monarch with net exports estimated at negative 12 5 of gdp in 2018 the rupee should simply not be as strong as it is today were it not for strong capital inflows à strong rupee when compared to our export competitors over the years coupled with higher wage growth than labour productivity growth allowed has gradually eroded the competitiveness of our export oriented manufacturing base the declining trend in the number of export enterprises and weak export data over the years has rendered the mauritian economy increasingly dependent on its ability to sustain capital inflows to plug the deficit creating a vicious cycle over the years of strong currency weaker export sector and more sops to encourage even more capital inflows to keep the unsustainable party going policy makers have wasted a decade of easy global liquidity by doing precious little to either create new export engines or to save existing ones the mauritian economy may appear to be more diversified today on paper than it was two decades ago but the reality is that from the real estate sector tourism to the offshore sector it has become more vulnerable to exogenous shocks and to capital inflow volatility from say the next global economic slowdown in the cycle what will happen when foreigners try to sell their expensive villas and can t get the price they expected we have put our eggs in different baskets but put all the baskets into the rat s cage as recently highlighted by the former governor of the bank of mauritius the drop in interbank foreign exchange market activity in the later half of 2018 when coupled with peaking levels of international reserves all point to signs that capital inflows are slowing should this trend continue or worsen as the global economy slows especially if more than expected in 2020 the only tool which would stand in the way of a significant devaluation of the mauritian rupee to reflect the reality of an unsustainable current account deficit would be the more than usd 6 2 billion of international reserves if mr basant roi s argument is right about the potential for gdp growth to actually be lower than we think given peaking or falling capital flows what does this mean for our fiscal deficit figures if the gdp estimates are moderately above where they really are then what does that mean for the appropriate stance of monetary policy and fiscal policy into 2019 and 2020 as the risk of a global slowdown increases the combination of higher liabilities fuelled by populism and politics slowing capital inflows and the risk that the allpowerful leader and his appointees miscalculate remains a risk that can only be ignored at our own peril
photo by sean gallup getty images on 3 january apple s share price fell by 9 per cent its largest single drop in five years after the company issued a highly unusual revenue warning a mini crash in currency markets followed an hour later and stock markets soon tumbled around the world the apple flash crash followed a series of warning signs in financial markets the market capitalisation to gdp ratio also known as the warren buffett indicator after the eponymous investor s preferred means of measuring overvaluation in equity markets has soared in the us volatility also rose sharply in 2018 the s p 500 rose and fell by more than 1 per cent 64 times over the course of the year compared to just eight times the previous year these trends are partly due to quantitative easing central banks in the us the uk europe and japan have used newly created money to buy up government bonds pushing investors into higher yielding assets such as equities donald trump s exorbitant tax cuts added to the problem in the us tech stocks in particular have benefited from what to some resembles a government inflated bubble many investors are now ready to cash out at the first sign of trouble apple s revenue warning reflects another of the greatest potential dangers in 2019 a global economic slowdown centred on china in his letter to shareholders apple s chief executive tim cook pinned the blame for lower than expected revenues on slow growth in the world s largest smartphone market this slowdown he argued was both because of lower consumer confidence and the escalating trade war between china and the us some may say it is in cook s interest to blame macroeconomic trends rather than the rising competition apple faces from brands such as china s huawei but the indicators from the world s second largest economy are not promising chinese gdp statistics are to be viewed with scepticism but most experts expect the economy to grow by about 6 per cent in 2019 still high but much lower than the 9 10 per cent a year that typified the post crash period manufacturing output is contracting and export growth has slowed so household consumption and government spending will be more vital

of last resort for much longer meanwhile china is running out of room to increase public spending after implementing a stimulus package around a quarter of the size of the entire chinese economy in 2008 extended again in 2015 if the chinese boom is truly over it is unclear where future global growth will come from household debt is too high and wages too low for the global economy to rely on debt fuelled consumption by british and american consumers the us federal reserve s decision to raise interest rates four times in 2018 has weakened many emerging economies by sparking capital flight growth in europe is woeful partly because of structural problems in the eurozone that have yet to be resolved but perhaps the most important lesson of the flash crash is the extraordinary economic influence now wielded by international corporations such as apple which became the world s first 1trn company last august the behaviour of monopolies such as apple can be linked to many of the economic problems we face today in 2015 cook was paid 9 2m while the average apple employee earned 36 760 meaning that for every 1 earned by the average apple employee the chief executive earned 251 this is even higher than the pay ratio for the largest 350 us companies which rose from 10 1 between 1965 78 to 240 1 between 1978 2016 rising inequality means workers have less to spend on the products business produce suppressing consumer demand such are apple s profits that the company cannot invest all the money it earns cash hoarding by global monopolies is part of the explanation for falling business investment apple is also notorious for tax avoidance which deprives governments of the resources they need to invest history shows that a global economy in which too much power and wealth is stuck at the top is a fragile one and it will be ordinary taxpayers not apple s shareholders and executives who most suffer the consequences related
coming off a roller coaster year of international intrigue 2019 is shaping up to be just as unpredictable mark your calendars for the women deliver conference in vancouver in june number six on our list and more anticipated and overlooked foreign policy events of the next 12 months you are particularly invited to participate in number 10 1 feb 16 nigeria s presidential elections in an election year where a record 79 candidates are vying for the top spot incumbent president muhammadu buhari and opposition leader atiku abubakar have emerged ahead of the pack for the first time since the end of military rule both of the top two candidates are muslim both hail from the north and both are from the same fulani ethnic group that might not seem remarkable to an outsider but nigeria is a country where people often vote along political and ethnic lines and where an unwritten rule swings top presidential candidates between the north and south every eight years even though the two leaders come with very different credentials buhari a career military officer and abubakar a wealthy businessman their shared background has suppressed their ability to run divisive campaigns over religion geography or ethnicity instead core policy issues like food security and the economy are being debated like never before by 2050 nigeria is expected to grow to be the third largest country in the world but pressures over scarce resources are already leading to violence conflict between farmers and herders along the country s middle belt in 2018 claimed more lives than the fight against boko haram along the coast others are raising the alarm that a projected 53 percent drop in fish stocks due to rising sea temperatures could spur further violence this internal strife has forced nigeria to scale back its once substantial un peacekeeping commitments to token levels across the sahel where canadian forces are deployed with the un and local militaries such facts serve as a reminder that the fate of the country will have an impact far beyond its borders we continue to treat this continent as a region that stands alone divorced from global development said judd devermont

have lambasted the deal as vassal state stuff on december 10 may suspended a vote to finalize brexit after it became apparent the deal would not have the support needed to pass in parliament that has

its hybrid warfare ahead of the ukrainian presidential elections on nov 25 russian forces attacked and captured three ukrainian war ships and 23 sailors in the kerch strait by restricting access to the sea of azov experts say russia targeted two strategic goals to strangle ukrainian exports and to make ukrainian president petro poroshenko look weak ahead of the elections it is a risky move poroshenko s reelection campaign has been laced in the language of militarism and faith and he may well benefit from the incursion experts say russia s strategy is not to provoke a wider conflict with nato forces including the roughly 200 canadian soldiers deployed in ukraine but rather to undermine the entire international order if russia succeeds in further destabilizing or fragmenting ukraine it s going to produce things like flows of refugees more deaths which is going to have a wider effect former uk ambassador to ukraine robert brinkley told opencanada this is not rule of law this is rule

percent report fear when going to the polls the highest level of fear ever recorded and a 10 percent uptick from 2017 in what many regarded as a test run for this year s presidential elections last october s parliamentary vote was marred by violence corruption and mismanagement at all levels after widespread speculation the independent election commission announced in late december it would delay the elections three months from april to july to open up negotiating space with the taliban the decision came a little more than a week after the trump administration s surprise announcement to withdraw roughly half of the 14 000 u s troops in afghanistan u s special envoy zalmay khalilzad is expected to restart negotiations with taliban representatives this month following three meetings in

agreement is expected to go into effect on jan 1 2020 for that to happen each country needs to pass new legislation to ratify the deal in canada the new agreement could receive royal assent by late june before parliament breaks for the summer that would mean canada could wrap up its end of the legislative process before the federal election on oct 21 on the mexican side newly inaugurated president andrés manuel lópez obrador recently hinted at his satisfaction with the deal after securing the deletion of a chapter on energy that posed a risk to our sovereignty despite criticism of canada s hardball negotiating tactics from the americans the biggest roadblock to ratification appears to come from the u s side legislation will likely make its way to the house by january when the

can bet the liberals will use the renegotiation of nafta as evidence they should be the party to steward canadian foreign policy on other issues the trudeau government will likely be confronted with tough criticism canada faces stiff competition in its bid to get on the un security council and trudeau s promises to return canada to its peacekeeping glory days are falling well short on climate change the liberals have struggled to negotiate a carbon tax with provincial leaders oil rich provinces have accused the federal government of not doing enough to bring its product to market others have challenged the absurdity of backstopping the construction of a pipeline when its contents sabotage hopes of canada reaching a carbon neutral future and on the integrity of the elections themselves the liberals will have an additional challenge of securing a fair vote free of foreign influence with all this the election will surely be an event to watch for anyone interested in how

pedro antunes is chief economist at the conference board of canada it has been 10 years since the 2008 09 recession and financial crisis which is a long time for any business cycle is it time to start planning for the next recession the answer is yes the conference board of canada expects global economic growth to subside this year and we don t see a recession in the cards for the united states or canada in 2019 still there are many risks that could derail the economic outlook the united states has undergone one of the longest expansions in modern history and some voices are now starting to warn about the imminent arrival of another business cycle to assess where the economy is likely to land in 2019 here are five important issues to follow trade wars and brexit canada is an open economy dependent on trade so trade wars add an important downside risk to the global outlook the world s two largest economies the united states and china are also our top two export destinations and their tit for tat tariffs could significantly boost prices and reduce the purchasing power of our major consumer markets putting the outlook for increased exports at risk the united kingdom is our third largest trading partner accounting for just more than 3 per cent of exports the u k s economic growth is already slipping and a hard brexit would have important repercussions on its economy and on that of the u k s major trading partners in europe germany for example consumer blues canada s phenomenal growth in 2017 was driven largely by consumer spending at that time low interest rates and hot real estate markets in many parts of the country helped entice households to take on more debt and open their purse strings further but households will be much more restrained in their spending government policies implemented over the past few years including foreign buyers taxes tighter mortgage rules and higher interest rates have done what they intended stop rapid home price appreciation households will not feel the urge to spend from rising home values and rising debt charges will take a bite out of spending in 2019 more modest employment and wage growth coupled with a drop in equity markets will also hurt household spending but by how much remains to be seen private investment lagging a big rebound in investment is needed as the latest available data showed that real private investment in machinery and equipment fell sharply in the third quarter of 2018 we expect that an increase in private investment and exports will help pick up the slack from softer household spending growth in 2019 but will it materialize corporations have identified uncertainty about access to the u s market more stringent environmental regulations diminishing tax competitiveness compared with the united states and a lack of skilled labour as important factors hurting investment intentions a new trade agreement with the united states and mexico and the federal government s recent move to accelerate the capital costs allowed for investments in machinery and equipment should help offset some concerns u s disconnect low investment levels mean that some canadian firms don t have the capacity to meet demand for exports despite a favourable exchange rate strong u s growth has not propped up non energy exports adjusted for inflation they have not increased in three years the typically strong relationship between the u s economy and canadian exports is disconnected over the next few years the outlook for exports will be dependent on the ability of canadian firms to increase productive capacity which requires investment regional divergence again over the four years from 2011 to 2014 high oil prices helped alberta saskatchewan and to some extent newfoundland and labrador punch well above their weight in contributing to national income and employment gains the sudden collapse in oil prices in late 2014 drastically reversed the course for those economies looking ahead we expect global oil production to keep expanding keeping u s benchmark prices low and canada s oil patch investment muted alberta s recently announced production cuts will have an effect on the province s oil production in 2019 but the hope is that these cuts will also alleviate transportation bottlenecks and help close the gap between alberta oil prices and u s benchmark prices 2019 will undoubtedly bring other challenges but despite the plan for continuing deficits federally canada s fiscal situation is in better shape that most group of 20 economies moreover the bank of canada has taken steps to normalize monetary policy while rates have not yet risen to the level the central bank is targeting there s at least some room to lower them in the event of another business cycle for now risks of a recession both in canada and globally are relatively low if business investment strengthens and households add to savings in 2019 we will be in better shape at the end of the year to tackle that eventual downturn

with the proposed new minimum wage which is n30 000 82 per month the average nigerian worker earns the worst salary and wage in africa naija247news reports thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe even though nigeria can be referred as africa s largest economy with a population of 200 million many nigerian families and workers live with 58 as a minimum wage chika maduka a civil servant based in fct abuja with a family of five finds it difficult to provide three square meals a day for his family sometimes we eat 101 meal a day meaning breakfast in the morning zero lunch in the afternoon and dinner at night he tells naija247news most times i have to stay hungry all day for my children to be able to eat lunch because proposed new minimum wage of 82 for a month job is not enough for me to pay up my children school fees take care of my wife and also pay bills a times i call my brothers in the united states and europe to assist us because things are not easy and food stuffs are very expensive he said kunle adeola who lives in lagos and works as civil servant in one of the state govt agency says the monthly 58 minimum wage is not enough for him and his family of six i spend most of my salary on my children s education and feeding and for the rest of the month i have to stay hungry and hustle from friends and family members to support my self during the month sometimes my wife does some business of buying and selling to support the family most times me and my wife eat once a day to allow our children to eat enough and be taken care of sensible compromise even if it went through a higher wage would still be modest given that a 25kg bag of rice costs nearly 10 000 naira it is very low considering the cost of living charlie robertson renaissance capital economist and nigeria specialist said but attempting to do more would be unrealistic because nigerian businesses already have high overheads and many workers are unqualified making a pay hike hard to justify he said nigeria s patchy power supply is another factor undermining the competitiveness of businesses and therefore their margin for any wage increase nigeria s difficulty on the minimum wage is that because its electricity literacy are less than most countries its wages must be less too or it will attract no foreign investments robertson said n30 000 is a sensible compromise but still debatable ivory coast for example has a higher minimum wage than nigeria but its good energy network still allows it to stay competitive with its west africa neighbours in contrast electricity is almost non existent in most of nigeria and the literacy level of the adult population is close to 60 a number that falls to less than 50 in the predominantly muslim north also south african recently signed the national wage bill into law bringing the national minimum wage to 3 500 rands or n91 225 per month even though second largest economy in africa as per hourly pay the act fixed the country s minimum wage at 1 45 n527 for every 60 minutes of human labour staggering inequality nevertheless it will be hard to explain to voters that nigeria africa s largest oil exporter producing more than two million barrels per day can neither afford a modest minimum wage for its civil servants nor provide a decent level of education and infrastructure to attract investors several months ago a senator caused a scandal by revealing lawmakers salaries 14 25 million a month with bonuses making it one of the highest salaries of politicians in the world at 30 000 it would take 35 years for a nigerian worker to earn what deputies make in a month and 68 years at the current minimum wage level of 18 000 life expectancy in nigeria is barely above 53 there is hardly a better reflection of the staggering inequality in nigerian society on the eve of a presidential election and after four years of painful recession beginning in 2016 voters are demanding accountability where are you going to find the money to pay the salaries asked gbenga omotoso a columnist in the normally pro government newspaper the nation reduce these outrageous wages force the rich to pay their taxes pursue the corrupt and engage the economy in a real program of diversification politicians lip talk on the campaign trail for re election in february nigeria s president muhammadu buhari may have spoken too soon when he backed an initiative to hike his country s minimum wage by a whopping two thirds buhari who had been advised on the wage by a negotiating committee made up of union representatives the government and the private sector praised the patriotic and professional members the recommendation to hike the minimum wage to 30 000 naira r1179 from 18 000 r707 was realistic fair and implementable and would be studied by the executive within the shortest possible time before being returned to parliament for final approval he said the unspoken agreement was that nigeria s unions which had threatened to paralyse africa s largest economy of more than 180m people with a massive open ended strike would deliver their members vote to buhari in a presidential poll set for february 2019 in return for the pay hike lawmakers fat pockets the average legislators pay is more than 50 times nigeria s gdp per capita in a country where millions live on less than two dollars daily and minimum wage is set at 82 a month the legislator s bumper pay has been described as outrageous the campaign for a cut in the national assembly s funds as a new government comes in is fitting as president buhari to consider if he wants to be remembered as nigeria s democratic legend a report by the economist magazine reveals that nigerian federal legislators are the highest paid in the world with an annual basic salary of 189 500 n30 6 m the report quoting data from the international monetary fund imf considered the salaries of lawmakers around the world and expressed it as a ratio of gross domestic product gdp per capita it reveals that the annual salary of a nigerian federal lawmaker at 189 500 is 166 times the country s gdp per capita estimated at 1 600 however it is a symptom of the massive gap between the rich and poor in nigeria which the figure of 1 600 as nigeria s per capita income conceals the annual income of middle class professionals would range between 15 000 and 30 000 senior middle class professionals up to 60 000 while executives would typically exceed 100 000 a nigerian professor of economics at the ekiti state university abel awe said this is part of the reason why 70 per cent of the nation s budget is allocated to re current expenditure we are using a huge chunk of the nation s resources to service just less than 1 000 people in a country of over 160 million people we are running the costliest democracy in the world we can t develop this way when we spend huge money to service a few people how will you get money for productive activities to expand the economy an average nigerian cannot access good medical care good roads and other basic things of life when the legislators are smiling to the bank this democracy is satanic we have to review this democracy the cost of maintaining the lawmakers is outrageous what they are taking is too much the chairman of the ikeja branch of the nigerian bar association monday ubani suggested it was time for nigerians to take a decision whether the economy should keep supporting two houses and whether legislators should serve on full time or part time basis he said this is a fact already and well known to nigerians and the world it is not a new story what is baffling is that their legislative output is not commensurate to the amount of salaries and allowances they are earning take for instance the ongoing constitution amendment their propositions and submissions on almost all the important clauses are at variance with that of the sovereign nigerians both houses have created a big hole on our national treasury quoting figures it obtained from the revenue mobilization allocation and fiscal commission rmafc the naija247news reports senators receive n35 million a year while members of the

by david milliken london reuters bank of england policymakers will be prudent not passive after britain leaves the european union keeping a close eye on exchange rate moves and other factors affecting inflation governor mark carney said on wednesday britain is due to quit the eu on march 29 though prime minister theresa may is struggling to find parliamentary support for the transition deal she agreed with the bloc in november without which there is a risk of chaos at britain s borders as parliament ressumed debating may s plans on wednesday after a holiday pause carney warned the pound risked a further decline if markets judged economic ties between britain and the eu were being weakened the nature of that partnership is currently the subject of feverish debate in parliament and the prospects for sterling will depend heavily on how brexit actually progresses he said in his first public comments of 2019 the boe and britain s banks are ready for whatever form brexit takes carney said in an online discussion that focused on the future of cash and the boe s views on crypto currencies from a monetary policy perspective the monetary policy committee is well prepared for whichever path the economy takes we have the tools we need we will be prudent not passive he said brexit jitters were visible in a rise in british banks funding costs and a fall in the share prices of companies that were focused on domestic markets in britain he said though broader volatility also reflected global trade concerns the boe has previously said interest rates could move in either direction if britain suffers a disruptive departure from the eu this year though many economists doubt whether the central bank would raise rates in the face of the shock of a chaotic brexit even if sterling tumbles financial markets see only around a 50 percent chance that the boe will raise interest rates this year and economists say the outlook depends heavily on brexit on wednesday carney noted that falls in sterling tended to have a material and lasting upward effect on inflation in britain however sterling moves are not the only factor that would drive interest rate decisions he added separately carney said china s yuan could potentially become a future global reserve currency alongside the u s dollar though this was likely to lag behind the increase in the size of china s economy relative to that of the united states the u s economy overtook britain s in the second half of the 19th century but it took until the 1920s before it became a dominant currency in international trade he said carney made similar comments in 2011 when he headed the bank of canada reporting by david milliken editing by william schomberg mark heinrich

tuesday trading saw the euro eur exchange rates shedding market value following a solid start to the week with the euro to us dollar eurusd exchange rate retreating sharply from the 100 sma daily chart senior market analyst at western union business solutions in washington joe manimbo said the euro had its upturn halted by german data showing the third decline in as many months in a gauge of factory growth another decline in the fourth quarter would signal recession a scenario that would jeopardize an ecb rate hike this year and likely increase headwinds on the single currency euro depreciation was largely driven by growing concerns over a technical recession in germany the eurozone s economic powerhouse with destatis data released early in tuesday s session indicating the downturn in industrial production picked up pace in november printing 1 9 the sharpest monthly drop since 2015 one a yearly timescale industrial production was down by 4 7 the harshest fall since december 2009 in detail the slump in industrial production was spread across all sectors with capital goods production down 1 8 while intermediate goods fell 1 leading the pack consumer goods dropped 4 1 while energy production slumped 3 1 and production in the construction industry contracted by 1 7 the latest printing was in stark contrast to a forecasted rebound of 0 3 from last month s downwardly revised 0 8 with bloomberg analysts commenting that the data underscores the subdued pace of expansion in europe s largest economy during the final quarter of 2018 connor campbell of spreadex commented a troublesome german industrial production figure one that suggests the country could be slipping into a technical recession was the most overt challenge to sentiment after the bell however it only ended up impacting the euro sending the single currency down 0 4 against the dollar and 0 3 against the pound investor concerns over the pace of economic growth in the eurozone have been fuelled in recent months by disappointing economic data coming out of the bloc with this latest release leading some to predict that the german economy was in a technical recession during h2 2018 commenting on the implications of the release ing s chief economist germany carsten brzeski said at face value today s industrial production data has clearly increased the risk of a technical recession in germany in the second half of 2018 while chief analyst jan von gerich of danish nordea bank tweeted the german economy has likely hit a technical recession very weak industrial production data from november do not support hopes of a rebound after the weak q3 defensive in the face of market participant pessimism over the state of the economy german economy minister peter altmaier said the german economy is in a good shape and order books are full adding his expectation for an economic upswing as 2019 progresses he went on to say there are more investments in germany and new jobs are created in an interview with german tv broadcaster ard advertisement above german composite output index gdp course ihs markit commenting on today s data chirs williamson of ihs markit tweeted industrial production in germany is running 1 8 below q3 so far in q4 with manufacturing output down 1 4 bodes ill for q4 gdp and even worse than the disappointing pmi numbers above german factory orders m m also printed below forecast at 1 0 while investor confidence slumped for a fifth consecutive month to 1 5 its lowest level since december 2014 dismal ecostats dampen hopes of 2019 ecb rate hike at their latest policy meeting and rates decision the ecb reiterated their intention for rates key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 while the latest data has dampened investor expectations of a 2019 hike at all commerzbank fx strategist thu lan nguyen commented it s yet more weak data that could end up hindering the ecb s monetary tightening plans adding she doesn t expect any tightening of eu monetary policy until 2020 the silver lining in terms of economic data for the eurozone was a surprise uptick in both german and euro area retail sales with both printing significantly above forecasts at 1 4 and 0 6 respectively above deflated turnover for total retail trade bert colijn senior economist at ing said even though consumer confidence continues to decline circumstances for eurozone consumers have improved oil prices have dropped significantly and wage growth is on the rise making real disposable income growth look pretty good for europeans adding that retail sales could be an important driver of continued growth ing s brzeski also highlighted that while hindsight may show a technical recession for germany during h2 2018 it s nothing to be too worried about it should be technical without any significant marks on the labour market he added that despite recent deflation of new order books are still richly filled and companies still report assured production close to record highs adding the recent pick up in orders in the automotive industry and favourable financing conditions in the entire economy also bode well for at least solid industrial and investment activity in 2019 the euro eur had a sluggish 2018 and 2019 thus far hasn t held any reason to get excited about the single currency in the near term danske bank lay down their forecasts for the euro us dollar eurusd and euro pound sterling eurgbp exchange rates for eur usd fed induced usd strength may be fading for now but risk sentiment and the ecb mean it is still too early for a firm move away from 1 13 as the uk parliament re ignites the brexit deal talks eur gbp is likely to remain boxed in the 0 8800 0 9060 range until further clarification with a prominent risk that the process drags out despite the recent run of disappointing data lloyds bank commercial banking lloyds see the euro appreciating versus the pound sterling by 2020 following a eur slump in h1 2019 considering the political and economic backdrops we expect gbp eur to remain within its 1 10 to 1 16 range in the near term beyond that we believe the currency pair will decline towards 1 07 by june 2020
the congressional budget office has confirmed what most everyone was expecting the federal deficit is running at a pace that will reach more than 1 0 trillion in the current fiscal year the first three months of the fiscal 2019 saw that spending was 317 billion than revenue for the year beginning october 2018 this was 41 percent higher than the same period last year one area of increasing revenues stood out that was in revenues from tariffs these were up by 8 0 billion from one year ago an 83 percent increase the reduced tax rates coming from the december 2017 tax cuts actually resulted in a decline in tax revenues corporate tax receipts dropped 9 0 billion or 15 percent individual tax receipts fell by 17 billion or 4 percent so much for the tax cut paying off the deficit through economic growth and annual economic growth for 2018 is expected to come in around 3 0 percent the highest yearly growth rate in the current recovery i have recently discussed the weakness in the argument that tax cuts can pay off the deficit from the revenues generated from higher future economic growth the theory behind this policy argument is weak and there is little or no empirical evidence that this policy effort actually works i believe that we have seen pretty well the full effect of the december 2017 tax cuts on the economy it seems as if the biggest beneficiary of these cuts went to shareholders and corporations used a lot of the released funds to buy back stock in terms of the economic growth of the country in the near term i have more fully discussed this in my post from earlier this week i find one of the most convincing projection for economic growth in the us over this time period produced by the federal reserve system federal reserve officials are projecting a rate of growth in the us economy in 2019 to be around 2 3 percent for 2020 the forecast is for 2 0 percent annual growth dropping to 1 8 percent the following year the basic reason for this slower growth is that the supply side of the economy is dominating all other factors including demand factors unemployment is at a level economists call â full employmentâ and at the lowest level seen for fifty years any higher growth rates would require a substantial increase in the labor force participation rate or a turnaround is the falling rate of growth of labor productivity major increases in these measures are not expected a further drain on the governmentâ s budget is that interest costs are rising for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 interest costs on the debt increased by 16 0 billion a 19 0 percent rise just in december alone interest costs were up by 47 0 percent from december 2017 these are not good signs and are expected to get much worse as the deficits increase and or if interest rates were to rise it appears as if things will become a lot worse before they get better debt can always come back to hurt you especially if you donâ t have an inflationary environment to bail you out for most of the latter part of the twentieth century 1970 on issuers of debt experienced an extended period of credit inflation with bailed out many many debt issuers especially those working in the real estate area oh there were periods when some particularly excessive users of debt got caught but by and large credit inflation set the tone for the economy we seem to be caught in a different position now inflationary expectations seem to have become deflated over the past several months apparently tied to some degree to the declines in the price of oil toward the end of the year as i have written many times recently that the inflationary expectations built into the bond markets have dropped into the 1 70 percent to 1 80 percent range for the 10 year time horizon not long ago these inflationary expectations were around 2 10 percent or slightly above and the current numbers are even below the target level of inflation of 2 0 percent that the federal reserve is using if inflation does remain at these levels the government debt burden is only going to grow but as some have suggested the future debt problems will be someone else s concern or not that is the concern this summer the economic recovery will become the longest in post world war ii united states history the recovery may continue for another year or so but it is still one of the weakest recoveries experienced there are two immediate policy concerns one if the federal deficit is increasing at this time how can the government create even greater deficits if the economy does slow down or tank second the federal reserve has been raising short term interest rates but they are still relatively low historically and the fedâ s securities portfolio is huge how much ammunition does the fed have to work against an economic slowdownâ or worse finally world economic growth seems to be slowing and this too can impact the us economy in a big way for example this morning we read about how germany s slowdown raises eurozone fears further slowing in the global economy is not going to help the us carry its debt load my experience as a banker and financial consultant is that the undisciplined use of debt more often than not comes back to haunt you especially if you donâ t have an inflationary environment to bail you out this seems to me to be the condition that now exists in the united states
laos ethiopia georgia or panama in a context marked by economic downturn uncertainty and trade war these will be some of the economic growth mines in the following twelve months according to the last international monetary fund s imf forecasts these territories will continue to accelerate this year defeating all their neighbours in the region the imf lowered in october last year two tenths their growth forecast for global economy placing it in 3 7 for 2018 and 2019 this downward revision coincided with the reports from other international organisms like the oecd which alerted the global economic growth has touched the ceiling what is the main reason moderation in the rise of emerging and global trade the two economic motors in the last decades the commerce will go from growing 5 2 in

sub saharan africa ethiopia is the market with the best growing forecasts for this year with a peak of 8 5 according to the imf the rise more than duplicates the forecasted for the whole region where a growth of 3 5 is contemplated in the last year ethiopia submitted a bid to become a new supply centre for fashion industry and operators like h m already carry out some productions in the country the ethiopian market has kept since 2006 a growing rate greater than the average in its region with double digit increases until 2012 in 2017 it was the second country that grew the most in the world just after libya with a rise of 10 9 ethiopia is the second most populated country in africa but its pib per capita is low and 30 of their inhabitants live beneath the poverty threshold which prevented for now to be positioned as an attractive consumer market north africa libya will go back to position in 2019 with one of the countries that grow the most a quota that already reached in 2017 when its gdp was shot up 64 due to the escalation in oil prices for 2019 imf estimates a rise of 10 8 even though it will be significantly moderated in 2020 and 2021 with an increase of almost 1 4 during both years such rise is motivated mainly by the increase of oil production on which libyan economy almost entirely depends what compensates according to the imf the little public investment political instability the insecurity and the lack of trust of consumers in the bank system which results in a lack of liquidity according to cia world factbook that places the country still quite far away from becoming a possible consumption destiny europe georgia and america will share in 2019 the gold of the fastest growing economies for both of them imf anticipates a growth of 4 8 even though the rate presents a downturn facing the projections for 2019 which stood in 5 5 in case of georgia and 6 in case of armenia in short term forecasts are better for georgia where a rise of 5 3 is estimated for 2023 while armenia s rate will remain in 4 5 armenian economy is affected by its geographical isolation and a scarce export base as well as some sectors monopolies that have harmed the economic dynamism the former soviet socialist republic is very dependent of the russian evolution and its governmental and commercial support as the country controls key infrastructures in the country such as energy armenian consignments generate around 12 and 14 of the country s gdp according the imf in this context armenia is searching for new allies outside its borders especially from the european union with which signed a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement in 2017 after the free trade agreement they planned to sign in 2013 was unsuccessful due to russian pressures in georgia economy is still trying to completely recover after 2009 crisis after a conflict with russia in 2008 the country with a liberal government that has been maintaining low regulation policies

after the advancement of 3 4 in 2017 the imf forecasts a growth acceleration for the following years with an expected rise of 3 9 for 2018 and 4 1 for 2019 in the medium term slovakia will continue

all the population panama is the second country with the highest rate in inequality of all latin america and one fourth of their inhabitants live in poverty with all this the strong purchasing power upper classes have made up of both locals and foreigners that work in the country and their opening to commerce have placed it as an interesting consumer market inside latin american territory asia given the lack of end of the year data india will beat china as the economy that grows the most in asia according to imf forecasts and it will also keep the gold this year the entity will estimate a

the communist countries with an only party but since the end of the 80s it started to decentralize the power and drive the private company the country maintained a growth of 6 per year between 1988 and 2008 and in the last decade it became one of the better developing markets in asia with annual rates of 7 with all the scares infrastructure the small sized domestic market and the corruption remain as some of the barriers to foreign investment in the country after laos the two economies that will grow the most in south east asia are myanmar and cambodia two key centres for fashion supply for which the imf forecasts an increase of 6 8 this year however its position of production hub could change this year since brussels is studying to eliminate myanmar s zero tariff due to the rohingya

the january edition of the 2019 global economic prospects gep was released yesterday in washington key message for africa is that regional growth is expected to accelerate to 3 4 percent in 2019 predicated on diminished policy uncertainty and improved investment in large economies together with continued robust growth in non resource intensive countries per capita growth is forecast to remain well below the long term average in many countries yielding little progress in poverty reduction sub saharan africa overview recent developments the recovery in sub saharan africa continues albeit at a softer pace growth in the region is estimated to have increased from 2 6 percent in 2017 to 2 7 percent in 2018 slower than expected partly due to weaknesses in nigeria south africa and angola the region faced a tougher external environment in the year just ended due to moderating global trade tighter financial conditions and a stronger u s dollar growth in nigeria picked up to 1 9 percent but oil production fell mid year and non oil activity was dampened by lackluster consumer demand and disputes that disrupted crop production in angola the regionâ s second largest oil exporter the economy contracted by 1 8 percent as oil production shrank south africaâ s economy grew by 0 9 percent in 2018 as it emerged from a technical recession in the second of the year in part due to improved activity in agriculture and manufacturing however growth remained subdued as challenges in the mining sector and weak construction activity were compounded by policy uncertainty and low business confidence economies of the central african economic and monetary community benefitted from an increase in oil production and oil prices that were higher in most of 2018 economic activity in non

grew at 6 percent or more including benin burkina faso cã te dâ ivoire and senegal across the region balance of payments financing became more difficult against the backdrop of rising external

in 2019 assuming that oil production will recover and a slow improvement in private demand will constrain growth in the non oil industrial sector angola is forecast to grow 2 9 percent in 2019 as the oil sector recovers as new oil fields come on stream and as reforms bolster the business environment south africa is projected to accelerate modestly to a 1 3 percent pace amid constraints on domestic demand and limited government spending economic activity in the cemac countries is expected accelerate to 3 percent benefitting from higher oil production and an increase in domestic demand as fiscal tightening eases growth among metals exporters is expected to rise moderately supported in part by stronger mining activity among non resource intensive countries economic activity is expected to

president trump should use the occasion of his upcoming state of the union address to call for legislation reforming the federal reserve system and for examining alternative ways to conduct monetary policy a bill along those lines passed the house of representatives in 2015 but it died in the senate the president should push for a renewed effort the fact that the house is now controlled by the democrats is by no means an obstacle but rather presents an opportunity for a bipartisan undertaking noteworthy in the original bill would have been the establishment of a monetary commission a study group charged with the ambitious task of examining the performance of u s monetary policy since the fed was created in 1913 the draft text envisioned it consisting of twelve members six appointed by the speaker of the house and six by the president pro tempore of the senate there would also be two non voting members one appointed by the secretary of treasury and the other selected from among the fed s governors with nancy pelosi now speaker of the house another run at reviving such a bill would put an equal number of democrats and republicans on the commission an outcome that would not have been in the cards in 2015 the study group would submit its findings to congress with recommendations for new legislation and for making non legislative changes in the fed s operating practices one task would be to evaluate various monetary policy frameworks such as targeting the rate of inflation or price levels or gdp growth the draft text specifically singled out the gold standard as one of the monetary approaches to be examined renewed interest in a gold standard is the subject of a pbs documentary in money we trust now being aired on television stations around the country authors steve forbes and elizabeth ames take us on a 57 minute tour of the monetary history of the u s with stops along the way on the global history of money and gold the documentary s thesis is that an unstable currency is not merely a hindrance to economic advance it underlies a general breakdown in trust in a nation s institutions note the question mark in the documentary s title gold has historically been the preferred means for stabilizing a nation s currency and as the documentary points out there has been no close competitor the 19th century was the era of the so called classical gold standard which forbes tells us was a period of one of the greatest booms in the history of human kind because you had stable money in addition to the classical model another type of gold standard might be a gold price mechanism associated with the late jude wanniski and others how it would work is summarized at american thinker here and here a move to reintroduce gold in its monetary role would have many implications two of them bear mentioning for one thing a gold standard would get the fed out of the businesses of setting interest rates and would substitute in its place a rule based approach to monetary policy today we have a situation where every six weeks or so the federal reserve s open market committee meets behind closed doors and after poring over the latest economic reports votes on a target range for short term interest rates a sub industry of fed watchers has sprung up speculating as to the fed s intentions thus every six weeks or so the scene on the floor of the new york stock exchange is the same grown men stand with eyes fixed on overhead television screens looking for the news flash about the latest fed decision even as supplicants in ancient greece stood before the temple of apollo awaiting an utterance from the oracle a gold standard would do away with the fed s obscurantist deliberations and its priestly care of interest rates another implication is that other nations would emulate the u s and seek to define their own currencies in terms of gold this would entail a move toward re establishing a global regime of fixed exchange rates replacing the floating exchange rate system now in place if countries a b and c all define their currencies in terms of a fixed amount to gold then their cross rates must be fixed against each other because things equal to the same thing are equal to each other national currencies so defined would introduce a stabilized global unit of account which in turn would usher in an explosion of international trade and investment it seems strange today that voices that are often raised in defense of free trade with its emphasis on outsourcing and supply chaining are silent on the need for creating a mechanism to stabilize the fluctuations of national currencies as economist george gilder notes in the documentary as much as 5 trillion a day moves around the world in the form of currency trading capital that could be put to more productive use a gold standard would wring such distortions out of the system enabling prices to communicate the true value of goods and services around the world monetary reform is not a grassroots issue the average person is not seized with disputing the finer points of interest rate targeting or interpreting inverted yield curves an economist can tell us why inflation acts like an invisible tax on income but while the average person may not be able to give the classroom explanation he knows what it feels like when he works harder but is not able to get ahead or when a dollar does not buy as much today as it did a short time ago the public senses that something is not quite right with the value of money something needs to be fixed this is where president trump comes in the president has a flair for breaking with convention and for taking on the settled opinions of our governing elites he should push for reforming the fed and for discussing alternative ways to conduct monetary policy he should put a gold standard on washington s agenda it is in america s interest that this conversation take place a move toward a gold standard would open up a space where democrat can meet republican and where an america first slant on the national interest coincides with a needed reform of the global economic order james soriano is a retired foreign service officer

construction and land costs excluding 1 housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges as applicable recorded during a given period and 2 amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations by housing revenues the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is housing gross profit margin the company believes adjusted housing

delivered during a given period this non gaap financial measure isolates the impact that housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges and the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations have on housing gross profit margins and allows investors to make comparisons with the company s competitors that adjust housing gross profit margins in a similar manner the company also believes investors will find adjusted housing gross profit margin relevant and useful because it represents a profitability measure that may be compared to

heartbreaking the worst fox news host you know just made a great point photo fox news america s capitalists and social conservatives haven t always been friends in the 1760s evangelical christians led one of america s first movements for progressive taxation debt relief and curbing the power of private finance a little over a century later rural dwelling bible thumpers powered william jennings bryan s crusade against wall street perfidy some decades after that they played a part in brokering the new deal in other words the marriage between america s cultural traditionalists and its reactionary plutocrats is a relatively young one and if fox news prime time programming is any guide the former are contemplating a trial separation last week in a much discussed opening monologue tucker carlson informed the gop base that congressional republicans consider it their duty to make the world safe for banking by sending your sons to die in needless wars that thanks to supply side economics an american who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate as someone who s living off inherited money and that human beings do not exist to serve markets markets exist to serve human beings this being fox news carlson seasoned his pseudo social democratic sentiments with jabs at identity politics affirmative action feminists immigrants and millennial stoners but free market capitalism was the true target of carlson s indictment all those manifestations of social liberalism were mere charges on the former s rap sheet in carlson s telling the reagan revolution devoured its own children the heart of his case is worth quoting at length thirty years ago conservatives looked at detroit or newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods the majority of children were born out of wedlock single mothers were the rule crime and drugs and disorder became universal what caused this nightmare liberals didn t even want to acknowledge the question they were benefiting from the disaster in the form of reliable votes conservatives though had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction and it made sense big government there was truth in this but it wasn t the whole story how do we know because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population in many ways rural america now looks a lot like detroit here s a big part of the answer male wages declined manufacturing a male dominated industry all but disappeared over the course of a generation all that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals both traditional employers of women in many places women suddenly made more than men now before you applaud this as a victory for feminism consider the effects study after study has shown that when men make less than women women generally don t want to marry them maybe they should want to marry them but they don t over big populations this causes a drop in marriage a spike in out of wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow more drug and alcohol abuse higher incarceration rates fewer families formed in the next generation carlson s story is replete with demagogic lies but it also contains a few important truths or half truths anyway tellingly conservative criticism of the host s monologue has largely elided the latter in the new york times brett stephens observed that neoliberal capitalism has been kind to people like tucker carlson a point wholly compatible with the carlson s argument in the atlantic conor friedersdorf argued that carlson is a mendacious demagogue whose monologue misled viewers about the prevalence of marijuana abuse in contemporary america this is true but it s also irrelevant to carlson s central claim which was that republican economic orthodoxy is undermining conservative social values to his credit the national review s david french took square aim at carlson s thesis to his discredit this was the entirety of his rebuttal says increasingly marriage is a luxury only the affluent in america can afford yet a healthy faithful marriage is often the gateway to affluence affluence is not a prerequisite for marriage in fact it is still true that your choices are far more important to your success than any government program or the actions of any nefarious banker or any malicious feminist while there is much talk of a shrinking middle class a large part of that shrinkage is in fact due to the fact that so many americans are moving up in other words the upper class isn t a set population of exploiters and elitists it s a growing population of workers and strivers this is an assertion of faith not a substantiated argument and to the extent that it s true it s only trivially so the fact that it is possible for a given individual to achieve economic security by making sound personal choices does not mean that all individuals can do the same our economic system would collapse if everyone did as french advises american capitalism can t support an entire nation of ladder climbing strivers it requires tens of millions of low skill workers in the coming years we re going to need increasingly large numbers of workers to look after the elderly and lift boxes in warehouses if public policy fails to ensure that the people who perform such tasks earn living wages then they will never be affluent no matter how healthy their marriages are further as carlson suggests workers who lack savings job security and access to affordable child care will find it more difficult to form and sustain healthy marriages french is earnest but fallacious an individual s decisions might well be the proximate cause of her success or failure in economic and marital life but that assertion tells us nothing about whether public policies or nefarious bankers have created an economic system that selects for bad decision making or even one that requires many individuals to make the wrong choices in order for it to function the conservative movement s apologies for free market capitalism have always rested on such sophistry what s new is the willingness of leading conservative commentators to say that the meritocracy has no clothes in the days since carlson s monologue went viral right wing pundits like j d vance and institutions like the national marriage project rallied to the host s defense meanwhile ann coulter never to be outdone announced her support for a 70 percent tax on concentrated wealth all of which prompts the question why has a class war broken out at the heart of the murdoch empire the alliance between family values conservatives and free market capitalists has always been a marriage of convenience to understand why social conservatives are turning on their fiscally libertarian co partisans one must remember why they partnered in the first place the businessmen whose fortunes built the literal and figurative foundations of the conservative movement saw the new deal state as its primary enemy but the traditionalist whites i e the overlapping constituencies of evangelical christians culturally conservative white ethnics and southern segregationists whose votes put that movement into power never did when the welfare state appeared compatible with the patriarchal family traditional social values and white racial privilege they happily supported it only when the great society began undermining those institutions did such voters sour on big government as the political scientist melinda cooper argues in family values between neoliberalism and the new social conservatism the new deal bargain was compatible with social traditionalism in many respects male workers secured social insurance largely through private employment and thus women secured such insurance largely through their husbands meanwhile by inflating blue collar wages strong unions made the conservative family model a sole male breadwinner and stay at home wife attainable for a much larger share of american households and the racially exclusive eligibility requirements of many new deal programs ensured that the median white family enjoyed access to more comprehensive public subsidies and private benefits than the median black one but by the 1960s it became apparent that big government could also foster anti normative behavior and challenges to the social order as tuition free colleges proliferated young adults became less financially dependent on their parents and thus more willing to question inherited values as welfare programs grew more generous women became less financially dependent on the fathers of their children and thus more capable of choosing single motherhood over an unsatisfying or abusive relationship and as african americans migrated north the welfare state became more racially inclusive these developments among others made social conservatives amenable to arguments that framed the great society as an enemy of the traditional american family and in some regions the traditional american racial order and right wing economists were happy to provide some in fact libertarian thinkers like milton friedman earnestly shared evangelical christians concerns about the decline of the traditional family because they saw the family unit as an indispensable substitute for the welfare state that they wished to destroy as cooper explains writing at the end of the 1970s the chicago school neoliberal gary becker remarked that the family in the western world has been radically altered some claim almost destroyed by events of the last three decades becker believed that such dramatic changes in the structure of the family had more to do with the expansion of the welfare state in the post war era than with feminism per se which could be considered a consequence rather than an instigator of these dynamics becker s abiding concern with the destructive effects of public spending on the family represents a key element of his microeconomics but one that is consistently overlooked by the critical literature indeed at different times and in different contexts each of the key figures of american neoliberalism can be found invoking the idea that the natural obligations of family should serve as a substitute for the welfare state that the altruism of the family represents a kind of primitive mutual insurance contract and serves as a necessary counterweight to market freedoms thus the bedrock logic of the alliance between social conservatives and reactionary capitalists was this one valued small government because it supposedly enabled the patriarchal family and or racial hierarchy while the other valued the family because it enabled small government social conservatives have paid a price for hopping into bed with the worshippers of mammon but social conservatives were always the junior partners in the gop coalition and when the dual objectives of rolling back the new deal bargain and reviving cultural traditionalism came into conflict the former took priority as a result the logic of social conservatives alliance with capital has fallen apart in his monologue carlson correctly observed that free market capitalism is deeply implicated in the social decay of white rural america and that in hindsight it was also implicated in the social decay of detroit and newark which is to say in the very species of social disorder that led many fans of the patriarchal family to embrace libertarian arguments in the first place these aren t new truths but contemporary conditions have made them harder for red america to ignore thanks to a combination of global supply chains corporate consolidation and network effects capital has been fleeing rural counties and concentrating in big cities taking many conservatives kids along with it america s most paranoid reactionaries long feared that big government liberals had a secret plan to coerce urbanization market forces and robert bork s jurisprudence have achieved much of what agenda 21 never could and as they ve done so the rural working class has found the normative family structure harder to maintain carlson s suggestion that feminism which is to say efforts to grant women reproductive and economic autonomy inevitably condemned countless men to empty lonely lives is dangerous and false but there is real sociological evidence behind the claim that women who enjoy such autonomy often prefer single motherhood to marrying men who struggle to support themselves financially reactionaries have tried to direct the backlash to this development exclusively at feminists as though the plight of underemployed men would be more justly rectified by lowering women s social status than by raising men s wages but even carlson can t help notice that it wasn t feminists who killed off the unionized jobs that once provided blue collar men in small towns with remunerative employment markets did that meanwhile capital has paired its literal abandonment of culturally conservative areas and concomitant undermining of family formation in such places with more superficial slights as upper middle class millenials have become an immensely valuable consumer block corporate brands have begun advertising their wokeness television commercials now regularly sing the praises of social liberalism feminism and ethnic diversity in today s america young urban liberals enjoy disproportionate influence over corporate culture while old rural conservatives enjoy disproportionate power over the state in this context the idea that social conservatives should fear big government and celebrate big business has become less persuasive to social conservatives and that argument has been further undermined by the opioid epidemic simply put it is hard to blame moral dissipation on the free market s enemies when your hometown is suffering from a drug crisis wrought by pharmaceutical companies and lax regulation finally and most obviously as rapid demographic change has increased the salience of nativism in conservative politics the fact that corporate america supports expansionary immigration has become harder for social conservatives of a certain stripe to miss or forgive the more the gop s economic discourse changes the more its economic policies stay the same the is no inherent connection between the ideas that life begins at conception and that capital gains should be lightly taxed or that traditional gender roles foster happier families and that payday lenders should be lightly regulated or that unassimilated immigrants are destroying america s social fabric and that the irs should target the working poor instead of the indolent rich or that african americans shouldn t have a leg up in college admissions and that coal companies should be allowed to dump mining waste in streams and yet for the past four decades the gop has managed to translate the relative popularity of conservative social values and racial attitudes into a mandate for maximizing the profits of the party s plutocratic benefactors whether it can sustain this gambit in the years to come is unclear the economic populism of donald trump s primary campaign and tucker carlson s prime time show along with reams of polling data have demonstrated that much of the gop base has no great fondness for reaganomics and since this aversion to conservative economic orthodoxy is rooted in increasingly conspicuous material realities it is unlikely to be a passing mood thus it s quite likely that more conservative pundits and politicians will echo carlson s heresies in the coming years but it s also quite plausible that this shift will remain more rhetorical than substantive to change a movement s rhetoric all you need is a demagogue with a nose for unspoken resentments but to change a party s governing agenda you need a well organized opposition the red state teachers strikes offered a hint of what such an opposition might look like but teachers unions are never going to wield more clout over intra gop politics than the koch network does and for now there is no other organized interest group in the republican coalition that could mount a plausible challenge to its economic orthodoxy the money lenders own the evangelical temples the nativist groups will make some anti corporate noises but only in service of a politics that directs white class resentments downward the republican rank and

lawrence h summers you might say a person is fundamentally healthy so long as you cannot yet say what will cause his death likewise an economic recovery is healthy if it is not clear what will cause the next recession by this standard the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis although disappointingly slow has been healthy for most of the past decade this is now in serious doubt paul samuelson s famous quip that the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions cautions against overreacting to recent market moves but credit spreads have widened considerably commodity prices have softened and investors have started demanding higher yields for short term us bonds than for those with longer terms unlike equity markets such yield curve inversions have not historically tended to produce false recession predictions the overall judgment of financial markets is that a recession is significantly more likely than not in the next two years real economic indicators for the world s largest economies china and the united states also suggest cause for concern almost every chinese indicator in the past few months has come in below expectations beijing now sees the need for stimulus measures if it is to credibly report the attainment of growth targets revisions of economic forecasts tend to run in the same direction for protracted periods as forecasters adjust to emerging realities this tendency is especially pronounced in china given the extreme political sensitivity of economic statistics in the us inflation is again running below the federal reserve s 2 per cent target and comparisons of the yields on ordinary and inflation adjusted bonds suggest investors expect this to continue for the next decade while jobs growth remains strong employment is usually a lagging statistic forward looking indicators of business and consumer sentiment suggest that growth is likely to slow perhaps the us economy will enjoy a soft landing jobs growth would slow towards long run sustainable levels and productivity growth would accelerate enough to allow continued gross domestic product growth of 2 per cent and increased wage growth without accelerating inflation but this would require both policy skill and great luck given that we are starting from very high debt levels and low unemployment a recession is the more likely outcome it is almost inconceivable that the global economy will remain healthy in the face of serious economic problems in both china and the united states even leaving aside their conflicts over trade and technology europe lacks economic energy and the uncertainties associated with brexit french protests german political transition and italian populism mean the continent is more likely to be a source of problems than a solution like generals fighting the last war too many policymakers are focused on yesterday s problems the global economy is much more likely to suffer from a downturn than from overheating in the next two years there is more likely to be too little credit flow than too much asset price deflation is more probable than a bubble and excess austerity is a bigger risk than profligacy the critical challenge for monetary and fiscal policy will be to maintain sufficient demand amid immense geopolitical uncertainty increasing protectionism high accumulated debt levels and structural and demographic factors leading to increased private saving and reduced private investment the fed should signal that it is determined to avoid a downturn which would assure another decade of below target inflation the people s bank of china and other central banks should also make clear that they recognise that avoiding another recession is the most important thing they can contribute to financial stability fiscal policymakers should also realise the very low real yield on government bonds is a signal that more debt can be absorbed it is not too soon to begin plans to launch large scale infrastructure projects if a downturn comes the largest economies should try to limit trade frictions and signal that they are committed to co operating to support global growth by assuring adequate capital flows to emerging markets and avoiding a cycle of protectionism even if my recession fears are excessive a shift towards emphasising growth will contribute to bringing inflation up to target levels and can be reversed if i am proved right the costs of delay in the policy response could be catastrophic it is the irony of our moment that prudence requires the rejection of austerity lawrence h summers is a professor at and past president of harvard university he was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to president barack obama from 2009 through 2010

think of human development as a long journey at the beginning we live at the mercy of nature dependent on its bounty we pray for rains and freedom from natural disasters and plagues at the end of the journey nature lives at our mercy we use science and technology to release new wealth and remake the planet today as humans implant themselves with microchips install artificial organs and plan mars colonies we even aim for a singularity that will lift us out of nature once and for all economists began to compose the narrative of this odyssey from subjection to dominion in the 1700s once it became apparent that europe had broken with millennia of stasis to begin a long period of rising growth the same through which we are still living political economists abandoned philosophical reflection to draft roadmaps to development two broad types emerged one approach described the walk the other the walker the first presumed that the context in which we made the journey the natural environment the institutions the culture the legal and political systems determined the direction of the path in this model the government bore responsibility to build the path so that it could accommodate as many people as possible progressive taxation was simply an investment in social prosperity key to maintaining an ascendant society and a reasonable return payment from those who had most benefitted the second approach took a more individualist perspective it presumed that the walker determined his or her own success in the journey it concentrated on the moral intellectual and physical attributes it believed an individual needed to advance in this model the task of the government was to sweep aside obstacles impeding the gifted few from embarking on their personal journeys restraints that ranged from restrictions on labour mobility to usury laws thus liberated gifted individuals would beat the path to prosperity progressive taxation on those who had completed the journey would only reduce incentives to make it ultimately hampering the economic growth of society the secret to success lay in a minimalist state presuming that nature selected some to lead and others to follow this roadmap was essentially aristocratic although given aristocracy s association with feudalism sociologists later coined the term meritocracy to describe this principle of radical individualism meritocracy loomed large over victorian capitalism however in the course of the 19th century the free market largely failed to deliver the developmental goods proving itself to be more adept at generating than distributing wealth and so in the early decades of the 20th century stirred by both political and intellectual developments the growing appeal of communism to a working class that had tasted comparatively few of the market s fruits and the consequent rise of economic schools that aimed to renew capitalism such as keynesianism and the german social market the state gradually took on a much more active role in both society and the economy immediately after the second world war with europe in ruins the communist threat seemed to reach its peak to spearhead reconstruction western states created institutions such as the world bank to assist governments in their work and private charities arose to join this crusade oxfam 1942 care international 1945 and unicef a joint private united nations charity created in 1946 all came into being to provide famine relief to war torn europe thus a tremendously successful initiative that would come to be known as the development industry was born by 1948 western economies had emerged from crisis beginning a decades long period of rising growth and prosperity rather than pack up and go home the development industry now turned its attention to a new frontier with europe s overseas empires breaking up dozens of new nation states were coming into being each of them eager to catch up with its erstwhile colonial master amid this exciting atmosphere the development industry could use its expertise to play a clear and prominent role one captured in the subtitle to the then bible of development walt rostow s stages of economic growth 1960 a non communist manifesto by now statist economics was enshrined in theory and sanctified by practice turkey had successfully pioneered a mixed economy in the 1920s and latin american governments had used protectionist policies to build their industrial sectors to substitute for the loss of imports during the great depression thus the conventional model for rapidly moving countries through the stages of which rostow spoke was for the state to marshal resources and then spur private activity with the development industry playing a supportive role in this essentially liberal optimistic crusade but when growth slowed in the 1970s governments began to turn away from state led approaches and to free up the market leaders such as ronald reagan in the us and margaret thatcher in the uk early proponents of this new libertarian approach harkened back to the unbridled individualism of the victorian age reagan told a 1981 development summit in cancun that third world countries ought to follow the model set by the us whose economy in this telling had been built by self sufficient independent farmers reagan elided the roles of slavery and industrialisation behind post civil war tariff walls major chapters in us history impossible to square with the libertarian ideal but with a bit of editing of the historical record the neoliberals took a decidedly dim view of the government they tended to think that those who can do while those who can t administer looking for ways to frustrate society s makers the less government more growth approach became orthodoxy but it brought back with a vengeance the challenges of distribution by the end of the 20th century social indicators in developing countries were going backwards just as the tide was turning against conservative politics in the west unlike what happened after the second world war though the pendulum this time did not swing back toward the more social roadmap to development instead the development industry asserted its autonomy from government and assumed a new role rather than have the state build the bridge between accumulation and distribution we now learned that philanthrocapitalism a radically new approach to development would offer a whole new way of doing things as the state withdrew behind the curtains the development industry took centre stage reagan and thatcher and other exponents of free market economics had been social conservatives by the 1990s a new generation had come along represented by leaders such as bill clinton in the us and tony blair in the uk who mixed conservative economics with social liberalism as much as possible they preferred a progressive politics that channelled private initiative and the logic of philanthrocapitalism was pleasingly straightforward since the rich were getting richer they had more money to throw around the lure of yet more lucre could now be used to steer them into sinking some of this new wealth into the poorest communities something touted by clinton late in his presidency when he went on a four day new markets tour of deprived american neighbourhoods urging the super rich to do some good with a portion of their rapidly growing prosperity clinton told them that a better world would make them richer yet every time we hire a young person off the street in watts and give him or her a better future he said we are helping people who live in the ritziest suburb in america to continue to enjoy a rising stock market in fact in the two decades after clinton took office the number of charitable foundations doubled a new problem arose though due to the worsening inequality produced by free market policies this growing number of foundations and ngos found themselves relying on a diminishing pool of wealthy donors inevitably that forced them to cultivate the plutocrats and reflect their views however even this supposed vice could be turned into a virtue if the free market had in fact sorted the best from the rest and enabled them to use their ingenuity to enrich themselves it followed that this same ingenuity could subsequently be applied to the solution of social problems as the state withdrew behind the curtains the development industry thus moved beyond its traditional supporting role in tackling social problems to take centre stage if rostow s stages of economic growth had articulated the ideals of a liberal age matthew bishop and michael green s philanthrocapitalism 2008 did it for a neoliberal one as rostow s subtitle had done theirs offered a pithy summation of the doctrine how the rich can save the world meanwhile the 1990s offered no shortage of laboratories in which to test this new doctrine of development the biggest prize of all was russia the country that had just chucked the most extensive state ever to build a market economy after mikhail gorbachev s attempt to reform the communist state and economy finished with the soviet union s collapse boris yeltsin took the reins of the newly independent russia deciding that the only way to revive the economy was to start from scratch yeltsin oversaw a programme of shock therapy it aimed to release the phoenix of capitalism from the ashes of state communism western advisors flooded into moscow with the harvard boys led by the wunderkind economist jeffrey sachs playing a central role coupled to crash privatisation was to be an efflorescence of civil society non state actors would now assume the functions previously performed by a totalitarian state private foundations such as ford macarthur and soros pumped tens of millions of dollars into civil society construction helping to build political parties independent media and ngos state actors including the us government supplemented the efforts russia was merely the most ambitious instance of a trend then spreading globally in one country after another governments were withdrawing from the economy and liberalising the environment in which ngos and private charities worked western governments helped to fund the activism at about the same time that yeltsin was opting for shock therapy the indian finance minister was preparing to dismantle much of indian dirigisme abandoning the mixed model that had defined the indian state since its independence in 1947 india s civil society however was far more vibrant and autonomous than russia s had ever been it proved able to step some way into filling the new gap in social welfare the indian government had never before encouraged ngos having previously seen them as something of a threat to its authority but it too adapted and opted to give them more freedom to manoeuvre and operate in beijing the communist leadership watched what was going on in russia and india with real interest like the russians the chinese took the advice of us based economists some of them chinese but they also looked elsewhere a broad debate about china s future direction took place within the leadership some called for china to do like russia and plunge into a more westernised future others insisted that the state needed to tighten its political control in order to provide the stability necessary to absorb the profound economic changes about to occur the statists looked for insight less to the west than to china s own neighbourhood to south korea taiwan and singapore in these east asian tigers the market economy was developing under strong state guidance in the end the chinese leadership opted to go with a hybrid more political control and less democracy than in the tigers but much less state than with either maoism or soviet central planning at the time many assumed that the chinese developmental state approach was doomed to failure political science then took as axiomatic that an expanding class of independent businesspeople would demand the same liberties in the political sphere that they enjoyed in the market it s true that there was a debate about which came first democracy or development but it was in a sense a chicken and egg debate for few scholars saw economic development and political democracy as separable in the long run the echoes of the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 were still sounding most analysts had seen tiananmen as china s instalment in the 1989 democracy movement they were confident that in one form or another such protests would recur and recur and china would eventually democratise the story that philanthrocapitalists told was a great one history marching forward heroes and villains and a hollywood ending history has a way of surprising us however and most of the script ended up on the cutting room floor the actors left to ad lib parts they weren t expecting to play russia s shock therapy didn t beget a flourishing capitalist democracy chinese autocracy didn t collapse under the weight of its contradictions in fact scholars today wonder if china gives the lie to the long cherished rule that economic dynamism demands a lean state as for the rich people who were meant to save the world almost to a man they chucked the script in the bin for every billionaire funding a progressive cause there would be dozens who used their wealth to support conservative campaigns to further roll back the state s social provisions most importantly the newly liberated development industry failed to resolve the tension at the heart of free markets in short they produced growth more effectively than development while the ascent of the developing world has reduced global inequality over the past quarter century within countries it has generally worsened as a global plutocracy emerges to dominate the world s economy and politics a wave of popular anger against disconnected elites has resulted which authoritarian populists have skilfully exploited to launch crackdowns on the development industry whether it be the orthodox chauvinism of russia s vladimir putin the hindu nationalism of india s narendra modi or the muslim fundamentalism of turkey s recep tayyip erdoğan they are tapping into disillusionment with the old model to repress globalist elites as they decry ngos for their lack of patriotism these governments are pushing them to fall into line behind government or to leave the field altogether as hungary for instance has done with its notorious stop soros law although the liberal reflex has been to defend civil society the populists are addressing a real discontent take for example russia the one time poster child for philanthrocapitalism putin s repression of activists journalists ngos and all critics apparently enjoys substantial support in part because the ngos of the 1990s had often been considered elitist many russians saw them as closer to global civil society than to ordinary russians more loyal to their donors than to their supposed constituents and too little preoccupied with the day to day struggle that was the lot of most russians in that lost decade in fact the model of civil society emerging in today s russia has converged somewhat with india s changing approach there the hiatus in the uneasy relationship between the government and civil society proved short lived modi s government has turned to tightly regulating ngos regarding them as political opponents and subjecting organisations that dissent too loudly to harassment and repression and as disturbing as their conspiracy theories of globalist or metropolitan elites can sound the populists might be on to something in 2011 the swiss federal institute of technology conducted a network analysis of the global corporate elite what they found was a small web made up of a few hundred tightly networked and extraordinarily wealthy individuals dominated by bankers and commanding vast pools of capital if this was davos man then meritocracy was arguably its governing ethos its mission to replace the narrow limiting confines of the old nation state through compulsion and cajoling much of the development industry got drawn into an alliance with this new global elite the idea that the rich should be left to solve the world s problems ignores the science behind success it might be that the industry suffered more harm than good from this alliance human rights ngos in particular which won hard fought gains advancing transnational laws and norms are now being forced to defend the advances they made against the new authoritarians but rather than just stick up unconditionally for the development industry liberals could benefit from returning their focus at least in part to the old model of ngos aligning themselves more with national than global goals because while the development industry can point to considerable progress it can t claim all that much of the credit over the past 30 years poverty and hunger across the planet have fallen dramatically exponents of the free market model like to remind us that this happens to be the era in which neoliberal governments dismantled much of the social state but such a correlation holds up only at the most aggregate level once you look at what was happening on the ground the picture turns around china is thriving under an autocratic state russia floundered under a minimalist one in the 1990s india is doing relatively well at market reform while pressing civil society to line up behind national rather than transnational goals all told the supposedly deadweight state doesn t look so dispensable after all but then we ve known that for a long time on the face of it it seems puzzling that philanthrocapitalism ever got much of a hearing because history had surely shown it would never work if the rapid but unequal economic growth of the victorian age failed to produce commensurate social development what made anyone think that the rapid but unequal growth of the contemporary period would do any different moreover the idea that the rich should be left to use their wealth to solve the world s problems because they have proved their merit in the market ignores the science behind success does anyone really believe that if steve jobs had been born into a bengali peasant family he would have still created apple in fact economists who ve actually worked out scientifically what contribution our own initiative plays in our success have found it to occupy an infinitesimally small share the vast majority of what makes us rich or not comes down to pure dumb luck and in particular being born in the right place and at the right time at heart philanthrocapitalism offered not a new science of development but an old fashioned moral tale one in which a hero who would reveal himself by some magnificent achievement would come along to save us from some peril there is no shame in weaving moral tales economics has always given us moral narratives by which to live our lives in fact that s arguably its primary reason for being but if it is to enter our canon a story needs an audience that finds it rings sufficiently true to then retell it philanthrocapitalism failed that test it will probably end up in history s remainder bin as a result while storytellers devote themselves to crafting more compelling narratives
luke parsnow new york state by new yorkâ s presidential primaries on tuesday were largely uneventful since joe biden and donald trump already secured the required number of delegates to be their respective partiesâ presumptive nominees however the state was the latest in a trend of voting patterns that could outline potential weaknesses for both candidates heading into the general election in november according to the associated press with 93 of the vote counted as of wednesday afternoon biden received 92 of the democratic vote also on the democratic party ballot was minnesota rep dean phillips who suspended his campaign and author mariane williamson who exited the race but recently re entered williamson received 5 of the vote while phillips got 4 out of more than 294 000 total votes counted at so far that adds up to more than 25 000 votes for candidates other than biden
financial markets have been behaving in a very turbulent manner in the last couple of months the issue as i see it is that the world economy is gradually changing from a growth mode to a mode of shrinkage this is something like a ship changing course from going in one direction to going in reverse the system acts as if the brakes are being very forcefully applied and reaction of the economy is to almost shake what seems to be happening is that the world economy is reaching limits to growth as predicted in the computer simulations modeled in the 1972 book the limits to growth in fact the base model of that set of simulations indicated that peak industrial output per capita might be reached right about now peak food per capita might be reached about the same time i have added a dotted line to the forecast from this model indicating where the economy seems to be in 2019 relative to the base model 1 the economy is a self organizing structure that operates under the laws of physics many people have thought that when the world economy reaches limits the limits would be of the form of high prices and running out of oil this represents an overly simple understanding of how the system works what we should really expect and in fact what we are now beginning to see is production cuts in finished goods made by the industrial system such as cell phones and automobiles because of affordability issues indirectly these affordability issues lead to low commodity prices and low profitability for commodity producers for example the sale of chinese private passenger vehicles for the year of 2018 through november is down by 2 8 with november sales off by 16 1 most analysts are forecasting this trend of contracting sales to continue into 2019 lower sales seem to reflect affordability issues saudi arabia plans to cut oil production by 800 000 barrels per day from the november 2018 level to try to raise oil prices profits are too low at current prices coal is reported not to have an economic future in australia partly because of competition from subsidized renewables and partly because china and india want to prop up the prices of coal from their own coal mines the significance of trump s tariffs if a person looks at history it becomes clear that tariffs are a standard response to a problem of shrinking food or industrial output per capita tariffs were put in place in the 1920s in the time leading up to the great depression and were investigated after the panic of 1857 which seems to have indirectly led to the us civil war whenever an economy produces less industrial or food output per capita there is an allocation problem who gets cut off from buying output similar to the amount that they previously purchased tariffs are a standard way that a relatively strong economy tries to gain an advantage over weaker economies tariffs are intended to help the citizens of the strong economy maintain their previous quantity of goods and services even as other economies are forced to get along with less i see trump s trade policies primarily as evidence of an underlying problem namely the falling affordability of goods and services for a major segment of the population thus trump s tariffs are one of the pieces of evidence that lead me to believe that the world economy is reaching limits to growth the nature of world economic growth economic growth seems to require growth in three dimensions a complexity b debt bubble and c use of resources today the world economy seems to be reaching limits in all three of these dimensions figure 2 complexity involves adding more technology more international trade and more specialization its downside is that it indirectly tends to reduce affordability of finished end products because of growing wage disparity many non elite workers have wages that are too low to afford very much of the output of the economy as more complexity is added wage disparity tends to increase international wage competition makes the situation worse a growing debt bubble can help keep commodity prices up because a rising amount of debt can indirectly provide more demand for goods and services for example if there is growing debt it can be used to buy homes cars and vacation travel all of which require oil and other energy consumption if debt levels become too high or if regulators decide to raise short term interest rates as a method of slowing the economy the debt bubble is in danger of collapsing a collapsing debt bubble tends to lead to recession and falling commodity prices commodity prices fell dramatically in the second half of 2008 prices now seem to be headed downward again starting in october 2018 even the relatively slow recent rise in short term interest rates figure 4 seems to be producing a decrease in oil prices figure 3 in a way that a person might expect from a debt bubble collapse the sale of us quantitative easing assets at the same time that interest rates have been rising no doubt adds to the problem of falling oil prices and volatile stock markets the gray bars in figure 4 indicate recessions growing use of resources becomes increasingly problematic for two reasons one is population growth as population rises the economy needs more food to feed the growing population this leads to the need for more complexity irrigation better seed fertilizer world trade to feed the growing world population the other problem with growing use of resources is diminishing returns leading to the rising cost of extracting commodities over time diminishing returns occur because producers tend to extract the cheapest to extract commodities first leaving in place the commodities requiring deeper wells or more processing even water has this difficulty at times desalination at very high cost is needed to obtain sufficient fresh water for a growing population why inadequate energy supplies lead to low oil prices rather than high in the last section i discussed the cost of producing commodities of many kinds rising because of diminishing returns higher costs should lead to higher prices shouldn t they strangely enough higher costs translate to higher prices only sometimes when energy consumption per capita is rising rapidly peaks of red areas on figure 5 rising costs do seem to translate to rising prices spiking oil prices were experienced several times 1917 to 1920 1974 to 1982 2004 to mid 2008 and 2011 to 2014 all of these high oil prices occurred toward the end of the red peaks on figure 5 in fact these high oil prices as well as other high commodity prices that tend to rise at the same time as oil prices are likely what brought growth in energy consumption down the prices of goods and services made with these commodities became unaffordable for lower wage workers indirectly decreasing the growth rate in energy products consumed the red peaks represented periods of very rapid growth fed by growing supplies of very cheap energy coal and hydroelectricity in the electrification and early mechanization period oil in the postwar boom and coal in the china period with low energy prices many countries were able to expand their economies simultaneously keeping demand high the postwar boom also reflected the addition of many women to the labor force increasing the ability of families to afford second cars and nicer homes rapidly growing energy consumption allowed per capita output of both food with meat protein given a higher count than carbohydrates and industrial products to grow rapidly during these peaks the reason that output of these products could grow is because the laws of physics require energy consumption for heat transportation refrigeration and other processes required by industrialization and farming in these boom periods higher energy costs were easy to pass on eventually the higher energy costs caught up with the economy and pushed growth in energy consumption per capita down putting an end to the peaks figure 6 shows figure 5 with the valleys labeled instead of the peaks when i say that the world economy is reaching peak industrial output per capita and peak food per capita this represents the opposite of a rapidly growing economy in fact if the world is reaching limits to growth the situation is even worse than all of the labeled valleys on figure 6 in such a case energy consumption growth is likely to shrink so low that even the blue area population growth turns negative in such a situation the big problem is not enough to go around while cost increases due to diminishing returns could easily be passed along when growth in industrial and food output per capita were rapidly rising the figure 5 situation this ability seems to disappear when the economy is near limits part of the problem is that the lower growth in per capita energy affects the kinds of jobs that are available with low energy consumption growth many of the jobs that are available are service jobs that do not pay well wage disparity becomes an increasing problem when wage disparity grows the share of low wage workers rises if businesses try to pass along their higher costs of production they encounter market resistance because lower wage workers cannot afford the finished goods made with high cost energy products for example auto and iphone sales in china decline the lack of chinese demand tends to lead to a drop in demand for the many commodities used in manufacturing these goods including both energy products and metals because there is very little storage capacity for commodities a small decline in demand tends to lead to quite a large decline in prices even a small decline in china s demand for energy products can lead to a big decline in oil prices strange as it may seem the economy ends up with low oil prices rather than high oil prices being the problem other commodity prices tend to be low as well what is ahead if we are reaching economic growth limits 1 figure 1 at the top of this post seems to give an indication of what is ahead after 2019 but this forecast cannot be relied on a major issue is that the limited model used at that time did not include the financial system or debt even if the model seems to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of when limits will hit it won t necessarily give a correct view of what the impact of limits will be on the rest of the economy after limits hit the authors in fact have said that the model should not be expected to provide reliable indications regarding how the economy will behave after limits have started to have an impact on economic output 2 as indicated in the title of this post considerable financial volatility can be expected in 2019 if the economy is trying to slow itself stock prices will be erratic interest rates will be erratic currency relativities will tend to bounce around the likelihood that derivatives will cause major problems for banks will rise because derivatives tend to assume more stability in values than now seems to be the case increasing problems with derivatives raises the risk of bank failure 3 the world economy doesn t necessarily fail all at once instead pieces that are in some sense less efficient users of energy may shrink back during the great recession of 2008 2009 the countries that seemed to be most affected were countries such as greece spain and italy that depend on oil for a disproportionately large share of their total energy consumption china and india with energy mixes dominated by coal were much less affected in the 2002 2008 period oil prices were rising faster than prices of other fossil fuels this tended to make countries using a high share of oil in their energy mix less competitive in the world market the low labor costs of china and india gave these countries another advantage by the end of 2007 china s energy consumption per capita had risen to a point where it almost matched the now lower energy consumption of the european countries shown china with its low energy costs seems to have eaten the lunch of some of its european competitors in 2019 and the years that follow some countries may fare at least somewhat better than others the united states for now seems to be faring better than many other parts of the world 4 while we have been depending upon china to be a leader in economic growth china s growth is already faltering and may turn to contraction in the near future one reason is an energy problem china s coal production has fallen because many of its coal mines have been closed due to lack of profitability as a result china s need for imported energy difference between black line and top of energy production stack has been growing rapidly china is now the largest importer of oil coal and natural gas in the world it is very vulnerable to tariffs and to lack of available supplies for import a second issue is that demographics are working against china its working age population already seems to be shrinking a third reason why china is vulnerable to economic difficulties is because of its growing debt level debt becomes difficult to repay with interest if the economy slows 5 oil exporters such as venezuela saudi arabia and nigeria have become vulnerable to government overthrow or collapse because of low world oil prices since 2014 if the central government of one or more of these exporters disappears it is possible that the pieces of the country will struggle along producing a lower amount of oil as libya has done in recent years it is also possible that another larger country will attempt to take over the failing production of the country and secure the output for itself 6 epidemics become increasingly likely especially in countries with serious financial problems such as yemen syria and venezuela historically much of the decrease in population in countries with collapsing economies has come from epidemics of course epidemics can spread across national boundaries exporting the problems elsewhere 7 resource wars become increasingly likely these can be local wars perhaps over the availability of water they can also be large international wars the timing of world war i and world war ii make it seem likely that these wars were both resource wars 8 collapsing intergovernmental agencies such as the european union the world trade organization and the international monetary fund seem likely the united kingdom s planned exit from the european union in 2019 is a step toward dissolving the european union 9 privately funded pension funds will increasingly be subject to default because of continued low interest rates some governments may choose to cut back the amounts they provide to pensioners because governments cannot collect adequate tax revenue for this purpose some countries may purposely shut down parts of their governments in an attempt to hold down government spending 10 a far worse and more permanent recession than that of the great recession seems likely because of the difficulty in repaying debt with interest in a shrinking economy it is not clear when such a recession will start it could start later in 2019 or perhaps it may wait until 2020 as with the great recession some countries will be affected more than others eventually because of the interconnected nature of financial systems all countries are likely to be drawn in summary it is not entirely clear exactly what is ahead if we are reaching limits to growth perhaps that is for the best if we cannot do anything about it worrying about the many details of what is ahead is not the best for anyone s mental health while it is possible that this is an end point for the human race this is not certain by any means there have been many amazing coincidences over the past 4 billion years that have allowed life to continue to evolve on this planet more of these coincidences may be ahead we also know that humans lived through past ice ages they likely can live through other kinds of adversity including worldwide economic collapse note note that where the dotted line for 2019 is placed is based on where i see the 2019 economy relative to the downturn in industrial output per capita based on a number of kinds of evidence not all of which is cited in this article the 1972 base model would give a slightly different timing of the downturn a few years earlier also note that while the original the limits to growth book is no longer in print limits to growth the 30 year update by the same authors is

ray dalio is powerful in part because he founded bridgewater associates which with about 160 billion under management is thought to be the world s largest hedge fund but as dalio steps away from daily management of the firm his power increasingly manifests itself through the vigor of his ideas and his passion for communicating them last year he released principles life and work a sort of intellectual autobiography that became a number one new york times bestseller now to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis he has put out another book this one with the less poetic but entirely accurate title a template for understanding big debt crises worth spoke with dalio about what we ve learned and what we haven t from the last financial crisis and why he loves letting go let s talk first about principles the massive book you released last year that detailed your mantras for life and business and particularly those goals of radical transparency and an idea meritocracy did principles achieve what you hoped it would way beyond it s sort of gone viral a year later is the country more or less close to becoming an idea meritocracy the response to the book has been terrific but the size of that has been small in comparison to the general trend of our society i would say there s a trend away from thoughtful disagreement and idea meritocratic decision making is that frustrating for you i m just trying to pass along things that helped me and leave it to others if people are writing down their principles being clear on them whatever they are that s progress they don t have to be my principles but i do think there s a wave taking place now particularly in cutting edge organizations like next generation entrepreneurial organizations to make their organizations run more in this way i just don t think it s changed the society as a whole in june of this year you changed the management structure at bridgewater and instituted a new partnership structure is the new structure working for you yes yes yes yes it s wonderful i m in a transition phase in my life and my goal is to help others be successful without me that was an important step in my direction what it s meant for me is the satisfaction of seeing people step up and continue that culture of meaningful work and meaningful relationships through truthful transparency partner insights ai and the competitive edge exploring sector specific opportunities with kpmg at sxsw ray when we first spoke a year ago you stood in front of a whiteboard and talked about this issue of debt crises what is it intellectually about this issue that has prompted you to focus on it understanding debt cycles is integral to understanding everything that happens in finance and economics everything that affects our lives our incomes because our buying power comes largely through credit and credit cycles and they re not understood but when you see the patterns and you understand the cause and effect relationships one can understand those things so on the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis i wanted to pass along the template that has worked well for me in anticipating these crises did very well in the 2008 financial crisis and in most debt crises by understanding that template it s like a disease i want to convey the cycle and what the disease is so that everybody understands it so that we reduce the chances of a bad crisis and so that we have individuals and policy makers knowing how to navigate the next one that will come along they will always come along obviously this isn t your first priority but if you reduce the chances of a debt crisis aren t you also reducing bridgewater s chances of profiting from these cycles what we aren t doing is conveying in there my algorithms the exact timing or anything along those lines there s nothing in there where we ll lose our edge it will mean i hope that debt cycles will be less severe and that policy makers will handle them better what s your thinking on how policy makers handled the last debt crisis which led to the great recession policy makers didn t anticipate it there are things that they could have done we remember the last crisis and that s not good enough you have to remember the patterns see the complete 2018 worth power 100 list here what went wrong the central bank is responsible for all debt creation and they tend to focus on inflation and growth and don t follow enough the debt creation that goes for the purchase of investment assets as a result you get bubbles so i think that they should pay more attention to whether the debts that are being created will be systemically threatening by doing stress tests and pro forma financial projections the way we do i think that they will help to anticipate them and curtail bubbles how can the fed not already know how to anticipate economic bubbles they are very difficult for a lot of people to anticipate most bubbles don t have an inflation problem they just look like a boom and are worried about shutting off a boom they don t understand the difference between a boom and a bubble so what did you think of the federal reaction when the housing bubble did pop in 2008 when it started to happen they moved very quickly the combination of people that they had ben bernanke who had studied depressions understood quantitative easing hank paulson a ceo type bernanke is more introverted less aggressive paulson more aggressive more extroverted and also will run to the fire and tim geithner understands markets well and is a very balanced diplomat those three worked together bringing different skills and personalities on the one mission to rectify it and if you consider how fast things were happening how chaotic things were and how those three then responded you have to say we were very lucky particularly in a politically challenged environment lifestyle three celebrated scottish distilleries gain new life master distiller rachel barrie puts a sense of place in every bottle of scotch she produces do you have confidence that there s an equally skilled team in place now should there be a similar crisis i really don t want to get into that kind of evaluation but the next time around i worry that the political fragmentation is great we will have a debt crisis again and when we have that debt crisis i worry whether the parties will have the leeway to do the right thing you re concerned that some of the postrecession measures are too restrictive generally speaking they put into place a number of protections that reduce the chances of a debt crisis happening but reduce the leeway that they have in dealing with it and every debt crisis happens in a somewhat different way to a different segment the banking system has regulations and guarantees but there s always the development of a shadow banking system that s outside of regulation and guarantees that happens because if you re not regulated you can make more money so because of that it s very important to realize that there has to be leeway to make decisions for vehicles that were never expected to have problems that leeway is reduced by and that s what concerns me i think that there should be an economic emergency powers act like the war powers act that if the president of the united states the head of the federal reserve and representatives of the two branches of congress all agree that there is a crisis beyond the existing regulatory structure and agree on what should be done there should be the power to do that what could cause the next downturn the lesser effectiveness of monetary policy and economic polarization and populism on monetary policy while i don t think that the debt situation that we have is like the 2008 financial crisis i do think that when we have the next downturn central bank policy will not be as effective the period that we re in is very much like the late 1930s the 1929 to 1932 debt crisis when interest rates hit zero was very similar to the 2007 to 2009 debt crisis when interest rates hit zero and in both of those cases the central banks had to print money and buy financial assets and that causes asset prices to rise and contributed to wealth gaps that s led to populism because the wealth gap today is like 1935 to 1940 populism means that if you have a big gap in wealth and you share a budget so you have to decide how to carve up the pie as you have an economic downturn you have conflict climate watch techonomy climate 2024 years of technological business and funding efforts may still fall far short of arresting greenhouse emissions especially as we sail past 1 5 c global warming top visionaries discuss the new reality at the techonomy climate west 2024 where innovation meets urgency do you see another crisis looming i don t see the type of debt crisis that i saw in 2007 it s not imminent this expansion might have two or three years left in it but i do see problem areas i see a lot of foreign borrowers of u s dollars who have their income in local currencies i think that s a problem in turkey argentina brazil and to some extent india and i see some minor areas commercial real estate but i don t see that as systemically threatening have we learned anything from the great recession the things we ve learned are a bit helpful but those memories are going to fade we ve developed a healthy fear of overindebtedness we ve made some important structural changes that limit the amount of leverage that can take place i don t think we ve learned much about how debt cycles work which is why i wrote the book we remember the last crisis and that s not good enough you have to remember the patterns a template for understanding big debt crises is available for free download on principles com or 14 99 for

four current fed presidents have advised moderation and caution in the central bank s rate policy this year in an unusual run of commentary and opinion raphael bostic of the atlanta fed charles evans of chicago james bullard of st louis and eric rosengren of boston warned against assuming the economy warrants further rate increases atlanta fed president raphael bostic speaking in chattanooga tennessee on wednesday said that he thinks rates are about where they need to be a patient approach to monetary policy adjustments in the coming year is fully warranted in light of the uncertainties about the state of the economy and about what level of policy rates is consistent with a neutral stance mr bostic s prepared remarks hit the market early in the new york session driving the euro about 60 points higher against the dollar and dropping the us currency 70 points versus the yen both currency pairs haveretained their new levels mr bostic does not vote this year in the fomc rotation in 2018 he supported the tightening policy and was part of the unanimous approval of the december 0 25 increase monetary policy has likely come close to achieving a neutral policy stance one that is neither providing accommodation nor is being restrictive and attempting to actively slow the economy he said he sees little need to push the federal funds rate above the neutral stance mr bostic expects economic growth to moderate in 2018 as the stimulus from the 2017 tax bill begins to fade and that inflation will be near 2 he also warned about the specific risk to consumers from a broadening us china trade dispute he sees firms exercising caution in their expansion plans in light of economic uncertainties james bullard the leader of the st louis fed and a long time opponent of the bank s rate normalization policy said in a wall street journal interview on tuesday we ve got a good level of the policy rate today there isn t any pressing need to go higher mr bullard who will be voting in fomc this year but did not in 2018 said he isn t expecting the fed to reduce rates but i wouldn t rule that out depending on how the economy develops if the economy slowed down more than we thought or the inflation outlook deteriorated more than i m suggesting here there might be grounds for a little bit lower rate in that scenario he expects the us economy to grow between 2 25 to 2 5 in 2019 with unemployment remaining about where it is now he also remarked that the market s view of likely rate policy is a good deal easier that the fed s in the last decade the market has been far more accurate than the committee itself in saying how policy was going to evolve going forward the generic us 10 year treasury yield peaked at 3 24 on november 7th and fell for the next two months closing at 2 56 on january 3rd on december 19th the day the fed increased the fed funds rate to 2 5 the 10 year closed at 2 75 almost 50 points below its peak chart reuters the credit market has accurately anticipated the moderation in fed policy at the december meeting and subsequently eric rosengren president of the boston fed and a voter this year on the fomc but not last added his views in a speech to the boston economic club there should be no particular bias toward raising or lowering rates until the data more clearly indicate the path for domestic and international economic growth i believe we can wait for greater clarity before adjusting policy rosengren said he expects consumers to fuel solid growth this year that financial markets are probably unduly pessimistic and he does not expect a recession this year and finally chicago fed president charles evans another incoming fomc voter posited in a speech in riverwoods illinois on wednesday that since inflation is not a threat the bank can be patient because inflation is not showing any meaningful sign of heading above 2 in a way that would be inconsistent with our symmetric inflation objective i feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments he said incoming data on economic activity generally continue to be strong witness the december jobs report he noted moreover the most recent reports from my business contacts support these data mr evans view on the neutral rate is a bit more aggressive than his colleagues if the downside risks dissipate and the fundamentals continue to be strong i expect that the fed funds rate will eventually rise a touch above its neutral level to 3 to 3 25 all four presidents echo similar comments from chairman jerome powell last week who cited restrained inflation as a reason for the central bank to be patient with rate increases especially in light of the three month slide in equities and the fading prospects for global economic growth in december the fed reduced its fed funds and economic projections for the first time in two years its end of year estimate for the base rate dropped to 2 9 from 3 1 in the previous september materials that 0 2 was the difference between three hikes this year and two above the current 2 5 the bank reduced it gdp projections for 2018 to 3 0 from 3 1 and for next year to 2 3 from 2 5 that three incoming voters on the fomc and one prior supporter of rate hikes are advising caution on rate policy may not bring the market view of 2019 rate hikes to neutral but it does diminish the odds for a first half increase dramatically more likely than not the fomc will wait until mid year before awakening rate hike prospects again

blank rome s annual estate and tax planning newsletter addresses estate planning concepts and techniques that should be considered in 2019 by our clients and friends 1 transfer taxes the major changes made in 2010 in the law regarding gift estate and generation skipping transfer gst taxes collectively transfer taxes are now permanent although the new congress could amend them but the big news for 2018 was public law no 115 97 tax reform act which provided for an increase in the transfer tax exemption from 5 000 000 to 10 000 000 indexed for inflation1 until after 2025 2 gift tax the tax free annual exclusion amount increased to 15 000 in 2018 and will remain at those levels for several years the cumulative lifetime exemption increased to 11 400 000 in 2019 until 2026 indexed for inflation the tax rate on gifts in excess of 11 400 000 remains at 40 percent estate tax the estate tax exemption reduced by certain lifetime gifts also increased to 11 400 000 in 2019 until 2026 indexed for inflation and the tax rate on the excess value of an estate also remains at 40 percent all of a decedent s assets other than income in respect of a decedent such as iras and retirement plan benefits as well as a surviving spouse s half of any community property assets still will have an income tax basis equal to the fair market value of those assets at the date of death in this regard securities brokers still are required to retain basis records and report the income tax basis of securities to the irs accordingly be sure to advise your broker of your basis in securities received by gift or inheritance in addition executors must report the basis of inherited assets as shown on the federal estate tax return to the irs and to the beneficiary of the asset gst tax for 2019 the gst tax rate also remains at 40 percent and the lifetime exemption also has increased to 11 400 000 in 2019 until 2026 indexed for inflation section 5 includes more information about the gst tax portability of estate tax exemption the portability rules provide for the transfer of a deceased spouse s unused estate tax exemption deceased spousal unused exclusion amount or dsuea to a surviving spouse without inflation adjustments thus if a 2019 decedent s taxable estate is not more than 11 400 000 the dsuea can be used by the surviving spouse with respect to both gift taxes and estate taxes but not gst taxes portability is not available if either spouse is a nonresident alien portability will allow some couples to forgo a more complex estate plan while still taking advantage of both spouses transfer tax exemptions portability must be irrevocably elected on a timely filed including extensions estate tax return even if a return is not otherwise required to be filed a typical estate plan for a married couple generally has provided for the establishment of two or three trusts at the death of the first spouse a survivor s trust a residual or exemption or bypass or credit shelter trust and possibly a marital trust one of the reasons for the residual trust is to use the deceased spouse s estate tax exemption to the fullest extent possible under the portability law however if one spouse dies and leaves assets to persons other than the surviving spouse and charity in an aggregate amount less than the basic exclusion amount 11 400 000 in 2019 the surviving spouse may be able to use the dsuea as well as the surviving spouse s own exemption this portability provision may eliminate the need to create a residual trust at the first spouse s death for example if this year the first spouse to die leaves all of his or her assets to the surviving spouse no part of the deceased spouse s exemption is used because of the marital deduction available for assets passing to a surviving spouse at the first spouse s death unless the surviving spouse remarries and survives his or her new spouse he or she will have an aggregate exemption of i 11 400 000 dsuea and ii his or her own inflation adjusted 11 400 000 exemption 22 800 000 total in 2019 similarly if in 2019 the first spouse to die leaves 1 000 000 to his or her children the surviving spouse will have an aggregate exemption of 21 800 000 use of the remaining 10 400 000 dsuea in addition to his or her own inflation adjusted 11 400 000 exemption in many cases however we will advise our clients to continue to use a residual trust as part of their estate plans for both tax and non tax reasons tax reasons include the following i the dsuea is not indexed for inflation ii eliminating estate tax on any appreciation of residual trust assets at the surviving spouse s death regardless of the value of the surviving spouse s assets iii allowing for an allocation of the deceased spouse s gst exemption to the residual trust iv the surviving spouse could remarry and be limited to using the unused exemption of his or her second predeceased spouse if any a dsuea thus may inhibit remarriage v allowing for use of the deceased spouse s property tax exemptions and vi an estate tax return must be filed timely to qualify for portability non tax reasons include the following i limiting or eliminating the ability of the surviving spouse to direct the disposition of the deceased spouse s assets on the surviving spouse s death ii restricting the surviving spouse s right to use principal perhaps only for health support and maintenance iii providing creditor protection creditors generally cannot reach the assets in an irrevocable trust established by another person and iv providing professional management if desired residual trust disadvantages include the following i annual costs for the preparation of residual trust income tax returns for the residual trust ii the possible loss of a further stepped up basis on the surviving spouse s death iii lack of surviving spouse ability to change the estate plan to adapt to changed circumstances unless as is often the case the surviving spouse has a limited power to change the residual trust distribution provisions iv lack of ability to offset capital gains and losses realized by the surviving spouse and the residual trust4 v residual trust assets generally cannot be used to implement further estate planning techniques and vi the surviving spouse cannot use the 250 000 exclusion from capital gain upon the sale of a residence held in the residual trust 4 three planning tips if the reasons for establishing a residual trust are not significant but you nevertheless want to provide for the possible establishment of a residual trust in case your spouse later decides that it is advisable to do so your estate plan can provide for distribution of your estate to your spouse but include a provision that would allow your surviving spouse to disclaim all or a portion of his or her inheritance and arrange for the disclaimed assets to be allocated to a residual trust disclaimer trust the surviving spouse could make his or her decision to disclaim during the nine month period following the first spouse s death the only difference between a disclaimer trust and a residual trust established by the first spouse is that the surviving spouse could not have a power to provide for distribution of the assets of a disclaimer trust in a manner different from the first spouse s distribution plan a qualified marital trust qtip trust enables a deceased spouse to maintain control over the distribution of the trust assets upon the death of the surviving spouse can preserve the deceased spouse s unused gst exemption through a reverse qtip election and provides a greater degree of creditor protection than would be afforded by an outright bequest to a surviving spouse using a marital trust to accomplish these objectives rather than a residual trust will allow the marital trust assets to receive a step up in basis upon the death of the surviving spouse and in some cases may postpone payment of state level estate taxes until the death of the surviving spouse in addition the surviving spouse may wish to elect portability and subsequently use the deceased spouse s remaining estate tax exemption dsuea to make lifetime gifts tax free if a surviving spouse benefits from an existing bypass trust and the total of the surviving spouse s assets and the residual or bypass trust assets is likely to be less than the surviving spouse s estate tax exemption it might be advantageous to petition the probate court for authority to terminate the residual trust if the residual trust was created solely for tax planning and that planning is no longer needed the court is likely to grant this authority especially if the surviving spouse has the ability to change the ultimate disposition of the residual trust assets by exercising a power of appointment on the other hand if there is a blended family and the ultimate beneficiaries of the residual trust are different from the surviving spouse s beneficiaries e g children from a prior marriage the court may not grant the authority to terminate especially if the step children file objections to the petition alternatively california recently enacted a decanting statue which allows a trustee to transfer assets from one irrevocable trust to another subject to certain conditions thus it may be possible to transfer the residual trust assets to a grantor trust that will allow for a stepped up basis at the surviving spouse s death again there are other reasons to retain a residual trust including creditor protection and the use of the gst tax exemption income taxes the following is a brief summary of some of the recent changes to federal income tax provisions relating to individual taxpayers the highest tax rate 37 percent reduced in 2018 from 39 6 percent is imposed on incomes in excess of 612 350 was 600 000 joint return 510 300 was 500 000 head of household and 510 300 was 500 000 single these brackets will continue to be adjusted for inflation annually the alternative minimum tax amt exemption amounts are increased to 111 700 was 109 400 joint return and 71 700 was 70 300 single and phase out thresholds are increased to 1 020 600 joint return and 510 300 other than for estates and trusts which is 83 500 in 2018 the standard deduction for a single individual was 12 000 and the standard deduction for joint filers was 24 000 for 2019 the standard deduction for single individuals has increased to 12 200 and to 24 400 for joint filers an additional 1 300 deduction is allowed for blind and over age 65 taxpayers the tax reform act repealed the individual mandate to buy health insurance effective january 1 2019 and changed the income tax rules for alimony for divorce or separation agreements executed after december 31 2018 no deduction is allowed for alimony payments and no taxable income is recognized when alimony is received agreements effective before 2019 are not affected the tax reform act allows investors to defer capital gains recognized before 2027 by investing in a designated qualified opportunity zone a low income community the sale proceeds must be invested in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days from the sale in the amount of the gain to be deferred the deferred gain is taxed upon the later of a the sale of the investment or b december 31 2026 but if the qualified opportunity zone investment is held for 10 years no further gain is recognized upon sale of the investment effective for tax years beginning in 2018 partnerships will be audited by the irs under an entirely new regime under the new regime tax adjustments resulting from partnership audits will generally be assessed at the partnership level this enables the irs to collect tax due on partnership adjustments at the entity level thereby effectively imposing an entity level tax on partnerships although it may be possible for a partnership to push out this obligation to its partners this election will result in a higher rate of underpayment interest the new regime applies to all partnerships regardless of size or number of partners unless the partnership is eligible to elect out and does so in a timely manner typically partnerships eligible to opt out must have 100 or fewer partners and all partners must be individuals c corporations foreign entities that would be treated as a c corporation if domestic s corporations although each shareholder is counted as a separate partner for the 100 or fewer requirement or an estate of a deceased partner importantly partnerships with partners that include other partnerships single member llcs grantor trusts including revocable trusts or nominee partners will prevent a partnership from opting out of the new rules regardless of the number of partners this new irs audit regime has created a number of unanswered questions and significant concern over the manner in which partnerships will be audited and potentially subjected to imputed underpayment obligations given these concerns it is very important that all partnership llc members discuss with their professional tax advisors changes that will probably need to be made to the entity s governing documents the most significant of these changes will be the determination and identification of a designated partnership representative pr unlike the tax matters partner under the formally applicable unified audit procedures the pr will have increased decision making power and authority that will have significant impact on all owners and the entity in the event of an examination in addition to the pr designation there will be several matters the owners will want to consider with respect to various elections allocations and the payment of irs assessments in july 2018 the irs announced a campaign focused on cryptocurrency transactions accordingly taxpayers with unreported virtual currency transactions should consider complying with the tax reporting requirements relating thereto although no special voluntary disclosure program exists in some cases the irs will discount the penalties for taxpayers who voluntarily amend their prior years tax returns and in january 2018 the irs issued a notice to alert delinquent taxpayers who owe at least 50 000 51 000 in 2019 that it will begin implementing its right to advise the state department to revoke their passports 2 revocable trust the revocable trust is a valuable estate planning technique for both single and married clients used primarily to avoid the inconvenience and extra costs of a probate administration of an estate upon death multiple probate administrations would be required if you own property in other states the same estate tax savings techniques available by will can be employed via a revocable trust many of the post death income tax advantages previously available to probate estates but not to revocable trusts have been eliminated thus making the revocable trust even more attractive for wealthier clients we usually suggest that our california clients use revocable trusts rather than wills as their primary estate planning vehicles an israeli income tax may apply to a revocable trust including those created prior to 2019 of which at least one beneficiary is an israeli resident even if there are no assets in israel no trustee in israel and the trustor is not an israeli resident 3 annual gift program a lifetime gift giving program could reduce overall transfer tax costs considerably by receiving lifetime gifts donees will benefit from all future appreciation of and income generated by the transferred property free of transfer taxes this year every individual may transfer cash or other property worth 15 000 or 30 000 for married couples to each of as many donees as the donor selects without incurring any gift or later estate tax an inflation adjustment applies when that adjustment would increase the annual exclusion amount by 1 000 e g to 15 000 in 2018 donors may make these gifts known as annual exclusion gifts outright or via custodianships or trusts although careful planning is needed if trusts are to be used for example it is very important to ensure that any trust for a grandchild contains special provisions so that gifts made to that trust are exempt from the gst tax discussed in section 5 below in addition no gift taxes are imposed if you pay a donee s tuition or medical expenses payments must be made directly to the school or healthcare provider and you may prepay tuition under certain circumstances even if a gift is not tax free as described above if your aggregate gifts do not exceed the 11 400 000 lifetime gift tax exemption amount or 22 800 000 for married couples no gift tax will be payable at the time of the gift taxable gifts in excess of the 11 400 000 lifetime exemption will accelerate transfer tax payment but an overall tax savings may result because your gift tax dollars generally will not be subject to estate taxes at death use of the increased exemptions before they expire or are modified by a new administration in 2021 should be considered certain valuation advantages such as minority discounts that might be unavailable at death often are possible under current law in connection with lifetime gifts e g see section 13 finally although interest rates rose somewhat in 2018 the relatively low interest rates still in effect make this a very good time to loan funds to younger generations and may make certain types of gifts via trust particularly attractive as described in our low interest rate gift planning memorandum a copy of which is attached many people expect rates for short term and mid term loans to rise in 2019 4 life insurance life insurance proceeds are generally exempt from income tax in addition all estate tax on life insurance proceeds may be avoided on the death of the insured through proper planning insurance proceeds can be available free of estate tax to the surviving spouse but by designating other family members or a trust for their benefit as owners and beneficiaries estate taxes can be avoided in both spouses estates joint life or survivorship or second to die policies make life insurance planning affordable for many more people you should consider the ownership and beneficiary designations for any newly acquired life insurance carefully before the policy is purchased you also should review the ownership and beneficiary designations of your existing policies your revocable living trust or will does not generally control distribution of life insurance proceeds split dollar life insurance plans now are subject to much more stringent rules we suggest that you review with an insurance professional or with us any split dollar life insurance programs in which you currently participate or in which you contemplate participating finally recent economic activity may have caused your life insurance policies to experience financial problems you may wish to contact your insurance professional to discuss the current status of your policies 5 gst tax the gst tax generally imposes an additional transfer tax at the 40 percent estate tax rate on property transferred to grandchildren and other younger beneficiaries by lifetime gift or at death and whether outright or via trust certain techniques are available to avoid or substantially reduce this gst tax one technique involves making tax free gifts as described in section 3 via an annual exclusion gift program to grandchildren either outright or via trust and by paying a grandchild s tuition and medical expenses remember direct payments to the school or healthcare provider are required another technique involves use of your lifetime gst exemption to establish a dynasty trust which can invest in life insurance policies or other property to enable a substantial amount of property to pass to grandchildren great grandchildren and later generations free of any estate or gst tax the gst exemption for 2019 is the same as the unified 11 400 000 estate and gift tax exemptions whereas use of the gift and estate tax exemptions is automatic use of the gst exemption is elective in view of the voluntary gst exemption allocation rules we generally recommend that clients who make gifts to trusts from which a grandchild or other younger beneficiary may receive distributions file gift tax returns even if not required in order to specifically elect whether to allocate or not allocate gst exemption to those trusts 6 marital deduction noncitizen spouse the vast majority of married couples combine the estate tax exemption granted to each person with the unlimited marital deduction to ensure that no estate taxes are payable until the death of the surviving spouse the unlimited marital deduction generally is available for gifts and bequests to spouses those gifts and bequests can be outright transfers or can be made via trusts although not all types of trusts will qualify for the marital deduction severe restrictions however are imposed on the ability to defer estate taxes if the surviving spouse is not a united states citizen the surviving spouse s residence is not a factor under these rules property passing to a noncitizen surviving spouse must be held in a special type of trust a qualified domestic trust in order to qualify for the marital deduction in addition although gift taxes on gifts to noncitizen spouses generally cannot be deferred via the marital deduction in 2019 you may make annual exclusion gifts discussed in section 3 of a maximum of 155 000 rather than 15 000 to your noncitizen spouse subject to annual inflation adjustments as discussed in section 1 d portability is not available if either spouse is a nonresident alien nra a noncitizen who is not a u s resident you should review your estate plan now if either spouse is not a u s citizen 7 estate planning for nonresident aliens the estate of an nra has only a 60 000 not 11 400 000 estate tax exemption available and no gift tax exemption u s donees of gifts from nras or foreign estates in excess of 100 000 must report these gifts to the irs on form 3520 several interesting planning opportunities may exist for an nra an nra may avoid transfer taxes completely by structuring his or her holdings so that no u s situs assets are owned directly for example u s situs assets may be held by a wholly owned foreign corporation although u s real estate presents special income tax issues if your spouse is not a u s citizen you may wish to defer estate taxes by use of a qualified domestic trust discussed in section 6 lifetime gifts by an nra of u s situs intangible personal property such as securities or partnership interests are not subject to u s gift taxes even though these items would be subject to u s estate taxes if owned by the nra at death an nra also may wish to establish a trust to hold property for u s resident children or other family members to provide them with tax free income and arrange for the trust property to pass to other family members free of transfer taxes a u s taxpayer who expatriates covered expatriate can be subject to severe tax penalties unless that taxpayer has a net worth of less than 2 000 000 and average annual income of not more than 168 000 subject to annual inflation adjustments the tax penalties can be deferred on an asset by asset basis if an election is made interest and security are required in addition a 40 percent transfer tax is imposed on the receipt by u s taxpayers of any amounts in excess of 15 000 adjusted for inflation from a covered expatriate the irs issued proposed regulations in september 2015 concerning the donee s duty to report receipts from a covered expatriate on new irs form 708 expected to be released in may 8 community property v joint tenancy for income tax purposes both halves of appreciated community property receive a step up in basis upon the death of either spouse because only one half of the basis of property held in joint tenancy receives a basis step up at the death of the first spouse we generally recommend that legal title to appreciated assets owned jointly by spouses and not held in a revocable living trust be held as community property rather than as joint tenants california now recognizes community property with right of survivorship as a form of legal title for real estate 9 charitable tax planning there are several techniques available to transfer significant wealth to intended beneficiaries in a tax favored manner and at the same time benefit charity this is particularly true in connection with a sale of highly appreciated assets a charitable remainder trust can be used to advantage in these circumstances you also may be able to arrange to receive a lifetime annuity in exchange for cash or appreciated property or even for agreeing to transfer your residence to a charity at your death or at the death of the surviving spouse you also may be able to transfer property to your descendants without or with reduced transfer taxes by establishing a charitable lead trust these are particularly advantageous in a low interest rate environment as currently exists as discussed in our attached low interest rate gift planning memorandum the income tax benefits of donating partial interests in tangible personal property items such as works of art are currently restricted the popular charitable ira rollover rules were made permanent in 2015 these rules are discussed in section 11 wealthier taxpayers may be interested in a private foundation or a donor advised fund established at a public charity such as a community foundation the irs has developed two web pages that may be of interest to these taxpayers life cycle of a private foundation deals with private foundations and life cycle of a public charity deals with public charities 10 buy sell agreements options a buy sell or option agreement whereby a family member or business associate has the obligation or option to acquire assets at an established price can be used to advantage in connection with business succession planning to restrict ownership of a business to establish the value of an asset for estate tax purposes and to provide a market for the asset to allow owners to plan for liquidity this estate planning device is subject to restrictions but some of these restrictions do not apply to agreements made before october 9 1990 you therefore should be very careful if you wish to modify buy sell or option agreements made prior to october 9 1990 employer owned life insurance generally now is subjected to income taxation although insurance used to fund a buy sell agreement is exempt from income taxation provided that certain written notice and consent requirements are met in advance 11 employee benefit plans and iras assets in pension and profit sharing plans iras and other retirement plans other than roth plans can be subject to severe taxes at death you should review your plan benefits to determine whether you can avoid or postpone these taxes and whether your plan benefits are coordinated with your estate plan your revocable living trust or will generally does not control disposition of these benefits plan proceeds still can be the most advantageous to use for charitable gifts at death including transfers to charitable remainder trusts and to establish charitable gift annuities the charitable ira rollover provisions were made permanent in 2015 so taxpayers who attain age 70½ can direct a maximum of 100 000 to charity from an ira only the payment will not be included in the taxpayer s income for the year but it nevertheless will count against the taxpayer s minimum required distribution for the year no charitable contribution deduction will be allowed but most taxpayers nevertheless would benefit by using this technique as opposed to withdrawing funds from an ira taxable and contributing those funds to charity deductible but subject to certain limitations 12 subchapter s corporations the use of subchapter s corporations has become somewhat less popular because of the increased use of limited liability companies llcs care must be taken however with respect to existing subchapter s corporations for example upon the death of a subchapter s corporation shareholder subchapter s corporation status can be lost unless the decedent s shares pass to a qualified shareholder in a timely manner all subchapter s corporation shareholders therefore should ensure that their estate plans allow for the continuation of subchapter s corporation status subchapter s corporations also might be used to reduce payroll taxes imposed on their owner employees 13 family limited partnerships and limited liability companies a family limited partnership flp or family limited liability company fllc can be an excellent estate planning vehicle for clients who own valuable assets a flp or fllc can be advantageous if a family member encounters creditor problems in the future gifts of flp or fllc membership interests to your beneficiaries or to trusts for their benefit can qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion discussed in section 3 if properly drafted and the value of those gifts can reflect the discounts available for minority and nonmarketable interests discounted values also can be used in connection with sales to desired limited partners or llc members including family members or trusts for their benefit some recent irs challenges to these entities have been successful however so all administrative and operational details must be respected some recent court decisions have focused on the actual organizational and operational aspects of the family entities the tax benefits anticipated at the time of the formation of the entity should be available at the donor s death if the entity is organized for a significant non tax business purpose and operated strictly in accordance with the provisions of the governing instrument and applicable state law the donor has retained enough assets outside the entity to satisfy the donor s personal financial needs and the donor is not a general partner or llc manager 14 durable powers it has become more important to plan for the risk of lifetime incapacity a durable power of attorney can provide for lifetime asset management especially if your estate plan does not include a revocable living trust an advance healthcare directive permits you to designate someone to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you become unable to do so and also can be used to make known your desires that artificial life prolonging measures be or not be employed on your behalf appropriate healthcare documents for your children both minors and adults also should be completed a durable power of attorney for healthcare signed prior to 1992 in california probably is ineffective today the california secretary of state has established an advance healthcare directive registry and will issue an identification card to each registered person and respond to inquiries by healthcare providers in addition you should consider executing an appropriate authorization for use and disclosure of health information that otherwise would be protected and thus unavailable under the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 15 estate planning review this might be a good time to review estate planning documents to see if they still accomplish your goals changes in circumstances such as a marriage or divorce a change in financial situation or liquidity retirement and births and deaths might necessitate revisions to an estate plan life insurance needs also might have changed old estate plans that make gifts based on formulas tied to an exemption amount that has changed such as gifts to grandchildren children from a prior marriage charity or others might require revision because the amount of those gifts may be drastically different under current law from what was envisioned beneficiary designations of retirement accounts and life insurance policies should be reviewed to determine whether they need to be changed assets should be titled in the names of living trusts also for married couples how title is held i e joint tenancy or community property may affect the basis adjustment on the death of the first spouse as discussed in section 8 gifts to certain irrevocable trusts particularly life insurance trusts might trigger withdrawal rights for its beneficiaries notice of those rights must be documented in writing crummey notices failure to send these notices may result in adverse tax consequences designations of individuals named as fiduciaries e g the guardians for minor children trustees executors financial agents under durable powers of attorney and health care agents should be reviewed to ensure that they still are appropriate 16 same sex marriages registered domestic partnerships the united states supreme court has held that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry this decision may significantly impact an estate plan and may have important tax as well as marital dissolution and property settlement consequences below is a list of some of those consequences many of which may be retroactive same sex married couples may amend previously filed income and transfer tax returns for tax years for which the statute of limitations has not run the availability of the marital deduction for both gift and estate taxes including the ability to transmute separate property of one spouse to community property or vice versa without negative gift tax consequences the treatment of retirement benefits and the availability of the spousal rollover ira the opportunity to file one joint income tax return or two separate returns as married filing separately both spouses may use the gift estate and gst tax exemptions tax advantages of split gifts for gift tax purposes and the ability to use portability increased healthcare access and rights increased opportunities for international estate planning and citizenship california s domestic partners rights and obligations act of 2003 applies to all unmarried same sex couples and to unmarried opposite sex couples if at least one opposite sex partner is at least 62 years old an expanded version of the law in 2005 extended the rights of a registered domestic partner rdp in areas ranging from healthcare coverage and parental status to property ownership legal obligations and funeral arrangements a transfer of california realty between the rdps during life or at death does not constitute a change of ownership for california property tax reassessment purposes rdps are treated as having community property after the date of registration retroactive for rdps registering prior to january 1 2005 the irs recognizes community property laws as they apply to rdps but rdps still are not married for federal tax purposes all rdps must file california income tax returns on the same basis as married persons joint or married filing separately but same sex rdps must continue to file their federal tax returns as unmarried individuals thereby greatly complicating their tax return preparation rdbs who prefer not to undertake all of the commitments can terminate their registrations the procedure for terminating an rdp is the same as the procedure for obtaining a divorce with a limited exception it may be advisable to execute a written preregistration agreement similar to a prenuptial agreement before registering as domestic partners 17 digital assets this is an often overlooked category of assets that you should consider when creating an estate plan many people have many digital accounts and those accounts may be inaccessible when the person becomes incapacitated or dies automatic payments from bank accounts would continue until the bank is notified california adopted the revised fiduciary access to digital assets act effective january 1 2017 which will determine who if anyone can access your digital assets you may use an online tool such as google s inactive account manager or you may provide for your digital assets in your estate planning documents or the terms of service agreement will govern the disposition of your digital assets 18 deposit insurance the fdic bank deposit insurance limit is 250 000 per account generally all retirement accounts of a single participant at a particular bank are insured up to 250 000 all accounts held by a revocable trust are insured on a per settlor per beneficiary basis for example a single revocable trust established by a married couple that provides that on the death of the first spouse the assets will remain in the trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse for life and that on the death of the surviving spouse the assets will be divided into equal shares for their three children will be insured while both spouses are living for 1 500 000 at each bank in which the trust maintains accounts husband is treated as having three 250 000 beneficiaries and wife is treated as having three 250 000 beneficiaries this rule will apply regardless of the relationship between the trust creators and the beneficiaries previous law provided for this protection only to certain close family members 19 foreign asset reporting the treasury department is actively pursuing taxpayers who fail to report their foreign assets including foreign bank and securities accounts and foreign fund accounts maintained outside the u s on irs form 8938 as required by the foreign account tax compliance act fatca filing this form 8938 does not relieve u s taxpayers including nonresident u s citizens and dual

compliance procedures a program designed for taxpayers whose failures to report their foreign accounts were negligent or not willful the irs is has begun auditing taxpayers in a new campaign that focuses on people who withdrew or were denied entry into the agency s recently closed offshore voluntary disclosure program the irs recently released a new memorandum outlining new voluntary

by simon black i ve spent the last several days in this quaint colombian city near the venezuelan border though i m presently at the airport en route to chile for a board meeting as i ve discussed several times in the past colombia is great it s naturally gorgeous incredibly cheap and full of interesting opportunities the country has recently emerged from decades of civil war and the rebuilding efforts will have a profound impact on the economy most notably with the national infrastructure colombia s highways are pitiful the distance from here to bogota is barely 400 kilometers it shouldn t be more than a 3 4 hour drive but it takes almost nine hours thanks to the terrible highways railways ports even digital infrastructure are all lacking in colombia in large part because of the decades long war against the farc for years the government didn t want to build more railways if the guerrillas were just going to destroy them with the war over they re dumping an enormous amount of money into modernizing the country which invariably brings interesting opportunities colombia is still cheap today i spent the weekend in the mountains outside of bucaramanga looking at real estate projects where for example a plush family home on more than an acre lot in an upscale community ran less than usd 70 000 that s cheap my rule of thumb is that anything less than 1 000 per square meter for good quality residential housing about 92 per square foot is a great deal i also saw a huge stately home with a grand spanish colonial interior courtyard plus several acres of land for less than 200 000 that s a hell of a bargain for a country with such a bright future one of the most noticeable things about this town though is the presence of so many venezuelan refugees bucaramanga is very close to the border so it s a natural migration point for venezuelans fleeing their country they re everywhere talking to these people it s apparent that the conditions are far worse than generally reported in the media i ve been to venezuela several times myself and i ve seen firsthand the lack of food medicine etc it s incredible that a country like venezuela that s rich in so many resources is in such a desperate situation venezuela is legendary for its world class oil and mineral deposits but more than that venezuela boasts incredibly talented entrepreneurs and skilled labor plus plenty of port facilities arable land etc this place should be an economic powerhouse and decades ago it used to be but today venezuela is one of the world s most impoverished nations how did it all go wrong we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it s all due to the rise of corrupt socialism you know the story about 20 years ago hugo chavez took control of venezuela and engaged in radical economic and political reforms that awarded supreme power to the government specifically to chavez while doling out crippling socialist programs that the country couldn t afford when the price of oil was at an all time high they were able to limp along but when oil prices fell venezuela s government went broke they tried to make up for it by nationalizing and expropriating everything that wasn t nailed down businesses private land etc but that made matters worse they also borrowed heavily burned through their international reserves and printed an unbelievable amount of money the currency quickly went into free fall when i first went to caracas several years ago the exchange rate was about 8 bolivares per us dollar a few months later when i returned it was 50 my next trip was 500 soon a single us 100 bill would buy me literally stacks of venezuelan bolivares and by the time they finally capitulated and took the money out of circulation it took over 4 million bolivares to buy a single us dollar since august 2018 the venezuelan government started issuing new currency which is basically the old currency minus a few zeros all of this began with a premise that the government could centrally plan prosperity that a tiny political elite could engineer wealth and efficient productivity while simultaneously providing an endless supply of free benefits to the constituents who keep them in power this experiment in central planning has notoriously failed throughout history and it bankrupted venezuela in less than two decades yet we invariably see it rear its ugly head over and over again despite its dismal track record especially in times when wealth and income inequality rise every time people feel like they re getting screwed by the system every time they feel like someone else has an unfair advantage there are cries to seize assets confiscate wealth and centrally plan prosperity we re starting to see those calls rise again in the land of the free where a whole spate of socialist leaning candidates are coming out of the woodwork including some presidential contenders there are now 40 socialists in congress including the infamous 29 year old alexandria ocasio cortez who think it s a great idea to centrally plan the economy jack up tax rates to confiscatory levels and even nationalize certain private industries their desires are echoed by nobel laureate paul krugman who believes that 70 would be the best tax rate for maximum economic efficiency it s even more interesting to note that according to a recent gallup poll more younger americans 18 29 now identify with socialism than capitalism 51 vs 45 that s a 12 point decline in a positive view toward capitalism in just the past two years back in 2010 68 of young americans viewed capitalism favorably to borrow from isaac newton they seem to be standing on the shoulders of morons and yet membership in the democratic socialists of america has swelled 7x just in the last two years this is all really alarming i m not saying the us is going to become venezuela in 20 years but the land of the free is rapidly going down the same destructive path

by patricia healy cfa has the municipal credit cycle plateaued many positive indicators suggest that the municipal credit cycle has yet to plateau upgrades continue to outpace downgrades the us economy is still growing federal tax reform boosted revenues in fiscal 2018 and rainy day funds or reserve levels in many localities are strong however pressures continue to confront municipalities pension burdens and retiree healthcare costs continue to rise while infrastructure underinvestment and affordability of living in cities along with rapidly changing technology are among the other challenges these and other factors are discussed in our nov 19th commentary is the municipal market sleepy pension doomsday see here more recently the limit on deductibility of state and local taxes along with higher mortgage rates seems to have driven down or slowed home price appreciation in some areas and that trend could reduce property tax growth in the future john mousseau mentions this in his recent commentary here stable may be the catchword for municipal credit over the near to mid term which could indicate a plateau moody s recently released outlooks for state dec 5 and local government credit dec 6 over the next 12 18 months and considers them stable moody s projects that states will see tax revenue increases of 3 5 to 4 5 in 2019 reflecting continued but slowing growth moody s notes that this projection if realized would represent the tenth consecutive annual tax revenue increase the outlook factors in continued spending pressure to fund pensions and retiree healthcare costs as well as anticipated pressure to increase education and medicaid spending the outlook anticipates as a result of improved investment returns a reduction in increases in the funded status of pension plans a projection that may not materialize unless the market recovers see david kotok s stock market and tariff truce here with regard to federal funding moody s outlook does not foresee large changes in spending for education and medicaid however medicaid at 29 7 of state spending according to the national association of state budget officers 2018 state expenditure report is the largest and fastest growing segment of state spending at 7 3 the stable outlook takes into consideration the buildup of adequate reserves by most states which could provide a cushion and flexibility to manage through an economic downturn or changes in federal spending the december 14th ruling by the us district court in fort worth texas held that the affordable care act aca is unconstitutional because of the individual mandate however the decision is expected to be appealed and the case is ultimately expected to head to the us supreme court while the law would remain in effect during the process thus moody s anticipates that the decision will not have immediate credit implications for states hospitals or health insurers full repeal of the aca would mean reduced federal spending on medicaid and subsidies to individuals those states that expanded medicaid would be most affected alternatively there could be a partial repeal of the aca or no repeal at all moody s stable outlook for local governments projects modest growth of 2 3 in property tax revenue and a 3 increase in total revenue including sales and use taxes and state funding in 2019 property tax revenues grew 3 7 in 2017 because many people paid their 2018 taxes early spending pressure is expected mostly from increases in the personnel costs necessary for the management of pension and healthcare issues as well as a need to have competitive salaries and benefits moody s notes that most cities counties and school districts hold healthy reserves to manage through a downturn of course there are some states such as illinois new jersey and connecticut and some cities that have outsized burdens and management and budgeting issues their lower ratings reflect those challenges state ratings following two quarters of high activity see our q3 commentary the only state rating actions this quarter were the downgrade of the state of vermont by moody s from aaa to aa1 and the revision of two state outlooks by moody s the state of vermont s downgrade reflects low growth prospects from an aging population coupled with relatively high debt as compared with gdp and with shortfalls in funding for post employment benefits however the still high rating reflects a solid financial position and strong management s p has rated vermont aa since 2000 moody s revised the state of north dakota s outlook to stable from negative as a result of progress towards structural balance coupled with rapid restoration of reserves as the economy and revenues continue to recover from the 2016 energy recession recent declines in oil prices will likely result in some economic and revenue volatility however the state s energy economy and financial reserves are well positioned to weather some short term disruptions at this time also moody s revised the outlook for mississippi to stable from negative to reflect stabilization of revenue and economic trends and a resumption of deposits to the rainy day fund the outlook also incorporates the expected continuance of conservative fiscal management which will help manage elevated debt levels and potential future revenue weakness midterm elections included numerous ballot initiatives in midterm elections the quick muni note nov 7th see here john mousseau discusses the bond related advantages of a divided congress here we recap ballot initiatives medicaid expansion three states idaho nebraska and utah voted to expand medicaid while montana voters by not approving a rise in tobacco taxes struck down a measure to continue funding medicaid expansion beyond the june 30th sunset date depending on the legislature s actions montana could be the first state to end medicaid expansion after having accepted it moody s notes that 36 states encompassing two thirds of the us population have approved medicaid expansion this broad implementation may make it more difficult to repeal or make changes to the aca infrastructure spending many state and local bond measures were passed supporting housing hospitals education transportation and other infrastructure in california numerous proposals for statewide bond issues funding housing and children s hospitals were approved including a vote not to repeal an increase in fuel taxes that was due to expire and helps fund transportation spending however voters in the golden state turned down a 9 billion water infrastructure initiative further detracting from the spending trend voters in colorado missouri and utah voted down increases in taxes for roads and schools restrictions in state flexibility six of ten ballot initiatives were passed that reduce legislative or executive flexibility to raise or manage revenue an outcome that is generally credit negative for example a two thirds majority in the florida legislature will now be required to raise statewide taxes and fees while arizona now prohibits taxes on services and north carolina has voted to place limits on state income taxes there were numerous local bond and fee initiatives that passed as well the results of the initiative process can affect credit quality and issuer flexibility so it is important to watch how implementation evolves trend to fewer ratings the number of issuers seeking multiple ratings has declined since the financial crisis until the crisis issuers often had debt ratings from two or more rating agencies according to data collected by municipal market advisors mma issuers that were triple rated by moody s s p and fitch data on kroll is not able to be queried yet declined steadily from 55 in 2007 to 34 through 2017 viewed another way by the end of q3 2018 there were 1 91 ratings assigned per dollar par issued down from 2 29 ratings assigned per dollar par issued in 2007 the par value of bonds that are rated by just one rating agency has grown to 25 from 21 in 2007 the trend is likely a function of municipalities looking to reduce costs additionally in the recent low interest rate environment with narrow credit spreads fewer ratings on bonds have been sufficient to gain market acceptance especially as investors chase yield if credit spreads were to widen a differentiation in yield might become visible among bonds with just one rating compared to those with two or more ratings and this development could reverse the trend the trend to fewer ratings is a negative for investors there could be rating shopping going on the criteria or areas of emphasis applied by the rating agencies are different and an issuer can choose the rating agency that it thinks will give its debt a higher rating having only one rating means there are fewer eyes on the credit and less frequent reviews a bond with one rating is also subject to changes in the rating agency s criteria which could cause an abrupt change in the rating up or down with two or more ratings there is more stability this falloff in the number of ratings makes the case for active bond management and investment in higher quality bonds which is the strategy that cumberland advisors employs editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
as the new year begins imagine that this is how your 2018 ended you work at a company where the ceo and the management team are notoriously corrupt they began the year by taking on a 150 million in new debt for the purpose of rewarding themselves and their shareholders with a massive stock buyback but as the holidays approached the big boss declares about a third of all the workers will be furloughed or required to work without pay then just in time for christmas the ceo announces the 2 percent raise planned for 2019 will be cancelled the company he complains can t afford the 25 million dollar cost as it turns out that hypothetical is actually real just multiply the dollar figures by 1 000 and replace ceo with president donald trump the result is the happy holidays experienced by the 2 2 million employees of the federal government of course this was no surprise attack on the americans who do the work of the people s government the republican war on the 22 3 million public sector employees of federal state and local governments has been underway for years and the twin goals of that gop assault to demonize government itself while fatally wounding the last bastion of american union power have never changed the context for the current gop punishment of public sector workers is trump s unnecessary government shutdown unnecessary that is because the senate passed a bill featuring 1 3 billion in border security funding with trump s blessing on the wednesday before christmas only to have trump change his mind within 24 hours and a year ago trump and democratic minority leader chuck schumer agreed to a deal funding the president s border wall in exchange for a resolution of the fate of the 800 000 dreamers chief of staff john kelly then blew up the deal of the nation s 2 2 million civilian workers excluding 600 000 in the postal service some 340 000 federal employees have now been furloughed while an additional 500 000 are now working without pay the gop s best and brightest greeted those numbers by essentially telling america s public servants to drop dead credit fred st louis fed when a reporter asked about transportation security administration and border patrol agents who would be required to continue working on christmas without getting a paycheck rep mark meadows r nc responded it s actually part of what you do when you sign up for any public service position congressman scott perry r pa took the derision up a notch sneering who s living that they re not going to make it to the next paycheck as it turns out a lot of federal employees like the rest of the american workforce live paycheck to paychecks just weeks after being warned not to discuss trump resistance at work many federal employees began sharing their shutdownstories of the hardships they now endure many declined to identify themselves publicly so their stories could not be confirmed yet their tales of hardship spread widely one man said he became homeless he broke his lease in anticipation of moving to another state to train for a new federal job and the training was canceled another described having to terminate a family member s caregiver as funds dwindled several talked of forgoing or returning christmas gifts that talk isn t merely anecdotal a survey of 1 500 union members in december found that about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income unable to dispatch billions of dollars to build the border wall his base demands donald trump instead dispatched a flurry of baseless talking points on christmas day the occupant of the oval office addressed those hundreds of thousands of federal employees going without pay many of those workers have said to me communicated stay out until you get the funding for the wall two days after providing no evidence for that bogus claim president trump took to twitter to deliver another one do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats as usual trump was wrong it s not just that washington dc maryland and northern virginia do not account for all federal workers hundreds of thousands roughly 80 percent are distributed around the country and not just in the biggest states like california texas and new york as a percentage of their state workforces some of the reddest states have the highest shares of uncle sam s employees just as important many of the metro areas in which federal salaries make up the biggest slices of all civilian employee earnings are in places like new bern north carolina warner robbins georgia and huntsville alabama but just as important as virginia democratic senator mark warner s larger point that federal employees don t go to work wearing red or blue jerseys they re public servants is this the workers themselves debunked trump s ridiculous sound bite as government executive reported on december 27 in a 2016 government executive survey 28 percent of federal employees identified themselves as democrats and 26 percent said they were republicans but an even greater percentage 35 percent identified as independents and of those in the last category 42 percent said they leaned republican while only 31 percent said they leaned democratic on new year s eve a new survey from government exec found that federal employees overwhelmingly oppose shutdown only 30 percent support wall about 71 percent of federal workers oppose the shutdown which crawled into its 10th day on monday according to a new survey by government business council and govexec com while 22 percent support it nine in 10 of those supporting the shutdown do so because they support trump s fight for wall funding though a small handful feel so opposed to the wall that they want agencies to close in order to block the wall from being built with even 35 percent of those federal workers who support building the southern border wall opposing the shutdown as a tactic to secure it it s no wonder one of the largest federal employee unions filed a lawsuit to halt the trump administration s work without pay policy the president of the american federation of government employees which represents border patrol and tsa agents among other workers explained our members put their lives on the line to keep our country safe requiring them to work without pay is nothing short of inhumane but trump s message never had anything to do with his fidelity to the truth but to his hardline supporters and by marking federal employees as democrats the president of the united states was signaling the maga crowd that public servants like immigrants minorities and muslims were a target for their scorn consider the juxtaposition of donald trump s statements to military and civilian workers just days apart on december 26 trump lied to cheering american servicemen and women in iraq about the supposedly massive 10 percent pay raise he had secured for them you just got one of the biggest pay raises you ve ever received you haven t gotten one in more than 10 years more than 10 years and we got you a big one i got you a big one i got you a big one but while 1 3 million military personnel did receive a 2 6 percent pay raise on december 29 informed civilian workers they would be getting none at all for the third time since 2010 the executive order confirmed trump s warnings from february and august 2018 that he would oppose the planned 2 1 percent increase and 25 billion in adjustments for locality pay when the white house is boasting of rising wages and claiming wrongly that we have the best economy we ve ever had in the history of our country just why would donald trump feel this move is necessary we must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases the cost of employing the federal workforce is significant in light of our nation s fiscal situation federal employee pay must be performance based and aligned strategically toward recruiting retaining and rewarding high performing federal employees and those with critical skill sets across the board pay increases and locality pay increases in particular have long term fixed costs yet fail to address existing pay disparities or target mission critical recruitment and retention goals as president richard thissen of national active and retired federal employees association narfe put it last year this budget singles out federal workers by implementing a pay freeze which is perplexing given the president s continual praise of the strong economy and rising wage growth denying a modest pay raise during a time of economic prosperity demonstrates disdain for federal workers and needlessly punishes middle class households disdain indeed after all the congressional budget office cbo reported that in fiscal year 2016 federal spending on total civilian employee compensation was 215 billion even if that figure was now say 250 billion a two percent increase would only add 5 billion to uncle sam s 4 4 trillion budget adding in the estimated 25 billion for regional locality adjustments for higher cost of living areas around the country and the total tab is additional spending is around 30 billion and that s a drop in the bucket compared to the gop s tax cuts and job act which starting in 2018 will drain an estimated 1 5 trillion from the united states treasury over the next decade and that tax cut windfall for the wealthy will deliver the vast majority of its benefits to the most affluent people in the united states and to be sure federal employees are not among those most affluent people last april the federal salary council found federal employee salaries on average lag behind those of similar private sector workers by just under 32 percent as the washington post explained the council consisting of unions representing federal employees and nongovernmental pay experts oversees the pay system for most white collar employees below the executive level the general schedule under a 1990 law its findings are passed to a higher level body of administration officials who in turn make recommendations to the white house for specific raises for 44 city zones and a single figure for all areas outside those zones now these conclusions are hotly contested in its 2017 analysis the post noted t congressional budget office concluded that federal employees overall earn 3 percent more on average but that there are large differences by educational level from a 34 percent advantage for federal workers with a high school education or less to a 24 percent shortfall for those with a professional degree or doctorate these comparisons include total compensation combining both salary and benefits unsurprisingly conservative groups find the reverse of the federal salary council and then claim government workers far out earn their private sector counterparts credit hamilton project and that s no surprise because republicans have been trying to crush federal employees and their unions for years consider the run up to the 2012 presidential election in the fall of 2010 jonathan cohn explained in the new republic why public employees are the new welfare queens rush limbaugh claimed that public sector employees are freeloaders and then indiana governor and gop white house hopeful mitch daniels lamented that they are a new privileged class in america by early 2011 sarah palin was denouncing unionized public employees are making more money receiving more generous benefits and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever higher taxes deficits and debt minnesota governor and soon to be failed republican presidential candidate tim pawlenty wrote a wall street journal op ed titled government unions vs taxpayers in which he claimed the rise of government unions has been like a silent coup an inside job engineered by self interested politicians and fueled by campaign contributions you have public employees making more than their private sector counterparts pawlenty charged on fox news they used to be under benefited and underpaid now they re both over benefited and overpaid it needs to stop now none of this was true while there may have been some dispute about the extent of the gap between federal workers and their private sector counterparts the data on state and local government was overwhelming public employees especially in the south were under compensated relative to their private sector analogs at every level of income and educational attainment nevertheless the republican war on government workers and their unions took on other forms consider for example the 2 to 1 federal employee advantage sound bite then dominating the u s media the average federal employee makes 120 000 a year the average private employee makes 60 000 a year rand paul it s gotten to a point where the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker john boehner federal employees receive an average of 123 049 annually in pay and benefits twice the average of the private sector tim pawlenty but as with state and local governments this line of attack is an apples to oranges comparison at best and an outright deception at worst as factcheck pointed out the analysis is based on data from the bureau of economic analysis and crudely done by dividing total compensation salary and benefits by the number of current federal civilian employees comparing such averages is quite misleading for two reasons first bea says the figure is inflated by including compensation that is actually paid to benefit retirees not just for current workers the figure is at least several thousand dollars too high by our calculations second the average federal civilian worker is better educated more experienced and more likely to have management or professional responsibilities than the average private worker mitt romney the eventual 2012 gop nominee got into the act as well regurgitating talking points from the right wing heritage foundation and the cato institute romney declared that average government workers are now making 30 000 a year more than the average private sector worker and in the plan to cut federal spending he unveiled last week romney took aim at uncle sam s workforce align federal employee compensation with the private sector savings 47 billion federal compensation exceeds private sector levels by as much as 30 to 40 percent when benefits are taken into account this must be corrected in september 2011 romney proclaimed himself a both a champion and a member of the middle class when he said he sought to help the great middle class the 80 to 90 percent of us in this country that november just days after the bureau of labor statistics found that federal employees made 26 percent less than those comparable workers in the private sector the 250 million man protested the taxpayers shouldn t have to have money taken out of their pay checks to pay people in government who are our servants who are making a lot more money than we are of course it wasn t true then and it s not true now but what is true is that the federal civilian employees have received pay hikes less than or equal to american military personnel every year this century thanks to congressional republicans general schedule workers got no raises for 2011 2012 and 2013 since 2010 federal pay increases exceeded the inflation rate in only three years credit bloomberg but what is true is that while private sector union membership and political power has plummeted public sector unions like afscme seiu nea and others combined still represent 34 4 percent of government workers it is their remaining political power usually deployed on behalf of democratic candidates and progressive causes that republicans like donald trump scott walker and john kasich have sought to crush in executive orders legislatures state ballot measures and in state and federal courthouses the gop has worked without let up to limit the ability of public sector unions to retain members and collect dues the goal is to leave the last redoubt of union power broken and broke no match for the unlimited resources for corporate power for their part democrats are hoping to restore raises for federal workers in 2019 as part of their proposal to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year while the house did not address the issue of the recommended 2 percent hike last year the senate agreed to a 1 9 percent boost though it never came to the floor for a vote but with his announce freezes on federal hiring and pay donald trump wants to kick two million federal workers while they are down or more accurately shut down for his 150 000 members across 33 federal agencies and departments tony reardon of the national treasury employees union said trump s freeze is a slap in the face it s actually much worse than that trump and his republican allies want it to be another nail in the coffin for unions this article previously appeared at daily kos
