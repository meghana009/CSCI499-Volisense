official website of the conference africa 2017 was held under the auspices of president abdel fattah el sisi from 7 to 9 december 2017 the ministry of investment and international cooperation and the comesa regional investment agency were responsible for organising the event the 2017 africa conference was based on the resounding success of the 2016 africa conference which witnessed the participation of six presidents and more than 1 000 representatives from 45 countries this year s conference was characterised by exclusive presidential dialogue sessions between african presidents and the executive chairman of the conference as well as organising the young entrepreneurs day the 2017 africa conference continues to be the leading business platform for developing new partnerships meeting investors and achieving business and trade goals in africa the 2017 africa conference welcomed 1500 eminent businessmen and leading entrepreneurs to discuss and explore investment opportunities in new projects also in attendance were companies that have achieved high growth rates in africa s private sector and government projects that require foreign direct investments fdis the conference highlighted what is happening in large scale regional projects as well as political reforms that stimulate regional private sector and cross border trade the 2017 africa conference provided insight into new business opportunities for funds banks and investors looking to expand their investment portfolios in africa the conference was therefore a unique platform that offered an irreplaceable opportunity for companies engaged in business transactions and services strategic partners and service providers had an unprecedented advantage sitting at the same table with decision makers discussing key transactions and business opportunities as they are disclosed this year s conference featured a day dedicated to leading start ups and entrepreneurs the day was full of business dialogues and presentations hoping to attract funding and partnerships for some of the most innovative projects turning the event into a leading business platform for network building and setting up deals those in attendance were able to listen directly to the heads of african states and the continent s most important corporate executives watch presentations from executives looking for global partners and finance and meet more than 1 000 leading figures in finance industry policy making from africa and the world furthermore they could gain experience and insight into current and future developments in egypt and africa to identify new business opportunities and partnerships and encounter consultants startups managements investors and financing funds it also allowed smes to grab the opportunity to present their projects through the promotion sessions for startups and build a business network at the reception on young entrepreneurs day if we consider youth conferences to be a marketing tool for the economy and tourism in egypt then the africa conference had the impact of multiple youth conferences in terms of development tourism investment trade and the economy this is clear for the following reasons for the first time in egypt we saw president abdel fattah el sisi on air in an open dialogue for two and a half hours along with african statesmen executive managers and investors from across africa figures from prominent media platforms such nozipho mbanjwa of cnbc and lukwesa burak of the bbc were there to offer professional coverage and presentation furthermore the conference assembled a selection of the top international economic figures such as mukhisa kituyi the secretary general of the united nations conference on trade and development unctad roberto azevedo the director general of the world trade organisation jim yong kim the president of the world bank li yong the director of the united nations industrial development organisation unido bandar hajjar the president of the islamic development bank benedict oramah the president of the african export and import bank and jose angel gurria the secretary general of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd the most prominent speakers were the egyptian president the nigerian president the ivorian president the rwandan president the egyptian prime minister the mozambican prime minister the prime minister of ethiopia the egyptian minister of investment the secretary general of comesa the chief executive officer of egyptian steel the founder of the business incubator flat 6 labs the chief executive officer of the investment bank hermes the chief executive of citadel the director of uber s middle east and africa department the chief executive officer of carbon holdings the chairman of the south african investment authority the chief executive officer of commercial international bank the chief executive officer of first bank of nigeria the director of the department of africa in citibank banking group the director of north africa at nissan the president of the european bank for reconstruction and development the president of the waffa commercial bank of morocco the co chairman of abraaj capital investment the founder and president of jomia com and the founder of rise up summit for entrepreneurship investment opportunities in africa agriculture africa has 60 of the world s uncultivated land however the continent contributes to only 10 of the world s agricultural production therefore agriculture is considered as one of the most important investment opportunities in africa that is not fully exploited and could be one of the most important sectors that may drive a rapid growth in african countries beyond the mining and mineral sectors it should be noted that southeast asia has become an expensive destination for agricultural investments in light of which the african continent has a great opportunity and the value added potential to earn from this situation ethiopia which has the world s most fertile lands spends 25 of its budget on agriculture as it represents the main sector of its national income accounting for 50 of ethiopian gdp and 85 of export earnings and employment uganda exports its agricultural products as raw materials coffee and tobacco without any serious attempts to introduce the value added chain within this sector to earn greater benefits and diversify its economy and income resources accordingly african countries desperately need to maximise benefits from its current raw resources through a transfer of industrialisation to agriculture and localisation of technology to maximise its revenues within this important sector as an example of the success of technology within africa kenya the leading african country in this sector has established an electronic platform to showcase more than 1 400 agricultural crops for sale within and outside the country farmers have gained more and traders have saved the cost of troublesome visits to the farms this was one of the most impressive applications of technology within the african agriculture sector energy the problem of energy scarcity is one of the major obstacles to growth and development on the african continent a report by the south african rand merchant bank on the continent s 2016 energy sector stated that 55 of nigerians lack a stable and constant energy source and compensate for this by using generators on the other hand nearly 80 of the east african region is completely without electricity whilst 90 of liberians do not have basic electricity in their homes as liberia has 6 rivers there is a clear opportunity to invest in the hydroelectric power generation sector accordingly investment in the continent s energy sector represents not only an opportunity but also a challenge with great value and returns for investors in this unique and untapped sector infrastructure mauritius the seychelles namibia morocco and south africa are the african countries with the best infrastructure on the other hand libya angola and guinea are the continent s poorest countries in this sector a lack of facilities services and poor quality negatively affect the prospects for growth and the future of the continent s countries although africa exceeded asia in the establishment of power plants and new landlines between 1990 and 2000 since the beginning of the millennium there has been a huge and frightening recession in investments within this sector in africa egypt has turned its attention towards this sector and has focused on development and modernisation of its facilities and infrastructure taking advantage of the current investments within real estate tourism and construction along with the huge road project connecting cairo with johannesburg passing through sudan south sudan ethiopia kenya malawi mozambique zambia and zimbabwe with a length of 8 000 kilometres retail trade retail is the fastest growing sector within africa with amazing annual growth rates and a steady contribution to the rise in the national income of the continent yet consumer behaviours differ from one state to another accordingly investors should study each country separately in terms of population size consumer culture economic growth rates challenges absorptive capacity market demand and supply nigeria ethiopia and congo are the fastest growing emerging markets in this sector likewise the pace of urbanisation is very high in burundi uganda niger burkina faso and malawi showing that profit opportunities in the retail sector are very high due to the rapid growth within these countries in a report by kpmg and dewitt consulting which focused on five countries with huge opportunities within this sector the opportunities are as follows 1 algeria is characterised by high per capita income high urbanisation movement and concentration of wealth in urban areas 2 ghana has a favourable business environment and a popular culture that promotes the idea of shopping and buying 3 kenya is characterised by a very high population growth rate as well as a rise of a middle class population and private sector growth 4 morocco s population growth as well has a wider middle class population as well as an increase in urbanisation 5 nigeria is characterised by several factors the first of which is the large size of the market 190 million people the largest african nation in population the second is the current large privatisation movement occurring now and the high percentage of young people in the population communications companies that took the courageous decision to penetrate the african market have for several years now made huge earnings from this sector for example india s bharti airtel invested in this sector in 15 african countries they invested 1 billion in their operations within the african continent and announced a profit of 13 billion in the fiscal year 2010 2011 the telecom sector still offers huge returns on investments with an increased demand low supply and a steady population growth in conclusion the 2017 africa conference was an important platform for attracting investment presenting the bright image of the continent to the world highlighting the positive opportunities within the continent and presenting the various trade and investment potential of africa it was an important opportunity to exploit this great international gathering to the benefit of the african people investment in egypt and potential competition rand merchant is a south african bank headquartered in johannesburg it has four branches outside africa in britain india dubai and china as well as ten branches in african countries mostly in sub saharan africa the bank publishes an annual report called where to invest in africa to measure the investment environment and volume of cash flow attracted by the african countries and accordingly ranking countries on this criteria along with other criteria the first report was issued in 2011 and since then the research and studies unit of the bank had continued to follow up on the progress of investments in africa and its developments until the 2017 report was issued last september report 2017 in this report it was announced that for the first time in seven years egypt has topped the continent s charts in terms of attracting foreign cash flows in africa the report has received wide international coverage most notably shown by bloomberg s attention to the data and indications of the report and the continent s new ranking the implications of the 2017 report for the first time since the publication of the report egypt has topped the rankings which was occupied by south africa for years also for the first time since the report was released nigeria fell out of the top ten whilst morocco maintained its third place for the third year in a row surprisingly ethiopia was fourth replacing kenya due to its rapid growth of 7 ghana fell to fifth place due to corruption and weak economic freedom in the country followed by kenya and tanzania in the sixth and seventh rwanda which remains in the list of top ten countries for the second year in a row ranked eighth thanks to progress of its economic reforms which is regarded as the fastest in the world in diversifying its economy on the other hand tunisia ranked ninth followed by côte d ivoire as for algeria the country moved from the tenth to the 15th the united states and the united kingdom are the most frequent countries to inflate investments in the continent being the first report to be issued after the liberalisation of the exchange rate in egypt bearing in mind that the report evaluates the investments in us dollars and not in the local currency of the country it reflects a major success of the economic reforms and the overall attractiveness of the egyptian market for investors why did south africa descend the most important components of the south african economy are the metal industries that account for 60 of south africa s export earnings contributing to about 10 of the country s gross national product and providing more than half a million jobs furthermore south africa was classified as the world s largest producer of plutonium in 2011 accounting for 80 of the world s reserves on top of owning 50 of the world s gold reserves the story of deterioration started in 2011 2012 with the miners strike followed by a global decline in commodities prices the country was also subjected to a severe drought the worst in a century that led to a decline in agricultural production signs of a political crisis came in december 2015 with an economic crisis where president jacob zuma dismissed the minister of finance nhlanhla nene and temporarily replaced him with his deputy yet the instability led to a deterioration of currency and many investors withdrew their money from banks for fear of a greater loss amid uncertainty about the future there were strong opposition voices against the dismissal of the minister of finance they called for nene to return to his job in response to the desire of the market and parties including the ruling party and to calm and reassure investors four days later the president dismissed the newly appointed minister and appointed pravin gordhan who was in the same position from 2009 to 2014 accordingly the minister of finance in south africa changed 3 times in 7 days according to mohammed nalla director of research at nedbank investment the dismissal of a finance minister after two days of service does not help south africa s reputation international investors may think why did the president not make a deliberate decision first on the other hand democratic alliance leader and head of the opposition mmusi maimane said that this was a foolish act by president zuma and that he played russian roulette with the south african economy the country s unemployment exceeded 25 and a significant economic downturn the first since 2009 led to a deterioration of the exchange rate by almost 100 the government did not liberalise the exchange rate with its free will to attract investment and encourage industrialisation and exports but currency deterioration came as a natural result to the country s instability consequently the cost of borrowing has sharply increased with the country s credit rating down in february 2016 pravin gordhan said we cannot spend money we do not have we cannot borrow beyond our ability to repay until we can ignite growth and generate more revenue we have to be tough on ourselves all of the aforementioned events have led to the current decline of south africa s economy nigeria is suffering we must recognise the following before evaluating the nigerian experience nigeria is the 12th country in the world s list of oil producers and 11th in the list of holding the largest oil reserves as well as the 6th in the list of oil exporters its annual oil revenues amount to 27 billion annually 2016 and it has cash reserves of 31 billion in spite of this growth rate of the economy recorded a reduction of 1 5 in 2016 the cause of nigeria s economic contraction was due to the collapse of oil prices that started in 2014 in an economy that depends 90 of its revenues on this resource nigeria has certainly suffered a negative impact due to its non diversified income resources and sole dependence on oil and as a result fell out of the top ten the dimensions of competition between egypt and nigeria at the top of the continent egypt has liberalised the exchange rate completely at the same time nigeria has been hesitant about the same decision the flow of foreign investments into the nigerian market has declined with nigeria falling the 15th from sixth position last year at the same time foreign direct investments have increased in the egyptian market by 26 and governmental investment of debt instruments have increased by 13 in light of this and as bloomberg announced in one of its reports the egyptian reserves of 36 billion exceeded nigeria s reserves 31 billion for the first time since 2011 the size of the egyptian economy with its purchasing power exceeded its nigerian counterpart rich in oil for the first time in the history of the continent according to the international monetary fund statistics egypt has a gross domestic product of 1 197 billion while nigeria s gdp stands at 1 124 billion furthermore egypt s growth rate reached 5 for the first time in 7 years while nigeria s growth rate was half a percentage point nigeria fell into recession for a full year in 2016 for the first time in 25 years the world bank s annual world development report has forecasted that egypt will be the fastest growing economy in the middle east and north africa region by 2018 2019 while its outlook for the nigerian economy was negative due to its correlation with oil prices expecting 2 4 and 2 5 gdp changes in 2018 and 2019 respectively as the egyptian market enjoys diversity the international institutions have been able to bet on its achievement of a 4 9 gdp growth rate in the last quarter of the fiscal year with positive expectations in the years ahead based on the above it was natural to see the regression of the nigerian economy in front of the progress and achievements made by the egyptian economy there are clearly expected benefits for egyptians in the coming period assuming stability of all factors within the reform equation what are the expected benefits acceleration of gas production according to plans of companies and government the recovery of tourism revenues by continuing political and security stability the growth of foreign inflows with the adoption of the new investment law inflation falling below 20 during the current fiscal year the return of interest rates to their investment stimulating rates down 14 in 18 months the budget deficit falling below 10 in the current fiscal year currently 10 9 public debt falling below 85 in the current fiscal year currently 91 1 offering state owned companies in the stock market reform of the administrative apparatus of the state over the next 18 months continuation of trade balance recovery what other factors are supposed to be stable political and economic policies quality of security services relations with important trading partners gulf europe and china in libya stability of the security situation so that it may not escalate to what is beyond the current situation success of the palestinian reconciliation and its positive impact on border security continued commitment of the government in implementing the required economic reforms continued anti corruption monopoly and inefficient bureaucracy measures taken by the government it is also noteworthy that ethiopia was ranked fourth in the investment report for the current year and recorded the highest growth rates in the world from 2011 to now 7 to 13 therefore we must be aware of the significance and indication of these figures and link them to the international political and diplomatic move of the ethiopian government regarding the renaissance dam it is necessary to recognise the fact that ethiopia is a rising country with a huge market of 100 million consumers the second largest population on the continent after nigeria and has a great capacity for growth and development and there is a strong government and popular desire to do so and this explains much of the actions and policies pursued towards egypt by the government of addis ababa

periodic reassessments of the selected erp and accompanying risk free rate based upon market conditions as of december 31 2018 duff phelps increased its u s equity risk premium recommendation from 5 0 to 5 5 the 5 5 erp guidance is to be used in conjunction with a normalized risk free rate of 3 5 when developing discount rates as of december 31 2018 and thereafter until further guidance is issued in summary equity risk premium increased from 5 0 to 5 5 risk free rate reaffirmed at 3 5 normalized base u s cost of equity capital 9 0 5 5 3 5 the duff phelps recommended u s erp as of december 31 2018 was developed in relation to and should be used in conjunction with a 3 5 normalized risk free rate some valuation professionals may prefer to use a spot current market risk free rate but the end result is that the base cost of equity capital should be approximately the same therefore were one to use the spot yield to maturity on 20 year u s treasuries as of december 31 2018 instead of a normalized 3 5 one would have to increase the erp assumption accordingly background the erp is a key input used to calculate the cost of capital within the context of the capital asset pricing model capm and other models duff phelps regularly reviews fluctuations in global economic and financial market conditions that warrant a periodic reassessment of the erp 1 based on market conditions as of december 31 2018 duff phelps increased its recommended u s erp from 5 0 to 5 5 when developing discount rates as of december 31 2018 and thereafter until there is evidence indicating equity risk in financial markets has materially changed and new guidance is issued duff phelps last changed its u s erp recommendation on september 5 2017 2 on that date our recommendation was decreased to 5 0 from 5 5 in response to evidence in early and mid 2017 that suggested a subdued level of risk in financial markets back then strong earnings growth still accommodative monetary policies and benign global macroeconomic trends buoyed u s stocks corporate earnings had surpassed expectations fueling hopes for even higher dividend payouts and stock buybacks investors perception of negligible levels of risk was manifested through record low levels of equity volatility and a sharp narrowing of corporate credit spreads the optimism in equity markets persisted into late 2017 and early 2018 after the passage into law of the largest u s corporate tax reform in over 30 years 3 the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 cut both personal income tax rates temporarily through 2025 and the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 permanently among many other provisions while not all industries were anticipated to be net beneficiaries from the u s tax reform investors appeared to be expecting on average a substantial increase in after tax corporate earnings which spurred further stock market records the combination of these upbeat economic and financial market conditions led duff phelps to reaffirm its u s erp recommendation of 5 0 as of december 31 2017 to be used in conjunction with a normalized risk free rate of 3 5 4 february 2018 saw a spike in volatility partly fed by concerns that a rise in inflation could lead to an acceleration in interest rate hikes however this proved to be temporary with u s equity markets quickly bouncing back and reaching new record highs in september 2018 from october through december 2018 the picture that emerged was very different u s stock prices suffered significant losses with an accompanying surge in equity volatility and a widening of corporate credit spreads broad u s stock market indices ended 2018 with negative total returns this was the worst negative performance since 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis the deterioration in economic indicators and financial market conditions led us to revisit our u s erp recommendation overview of the duff phelps erp methodology a two dimensional process there is no single universally accepted methodology for estimating the erp consequently there is wide diversity in practice among academics and financial advisors regarding erp estimates for this reason duff phelps employs a two dimensional process that considers a broad range of economic information and multiple erp estimation methodologies to arrive at its recommendation first a reasonable range of normal or unconditional erp is established second based on current economic conditions we estimate where in the range the true erp likely lies top bottom or middle long term research indicates that the erp is cyclical 5 we use the term normal or unconditional erp to mean the long term average erp without regard to current market conditions this concept differs from the conditional erp which reflects current economic conditions 6 the unconditional erp range versus a conditional erp is further distinguished as follows what is the range unconditional erp range the objective is to establish a reasonable range for a normal or unconditional erp that can be expected over an entire business cycle based on an analysis of academic and financial literature and various empirical studies we have concluded that a reasonable long term estimate of the normal or unconditional erp for the u s is in the range of 3 5 to 6 0 7 where are we in the range conditional erp the objective is to determine where within the unconditional erp range the conditional erp should be based on current economic conditions research has shown that erp fluctuates during the business cycle when the economy is near or in a recession the conditional erp is at the higher end of the normal or unconditional erp range as the economy improves the conditional erp moves back toward the middle of the range and at the peak of an economic expansion the conditional erp approaches the lower end of the range basis for estimating the u s equity risk premium as of december 31 2018 conditional equity risk premium in estimating the conditional erp valuation analysts cannot simply use the long term historical erp without further analysis there is ample academic evidence that equity risk premia are not constant over time professor john cochrane senior fellow at the hoover institution at stanford university has summarized the changes in our knowledge of estimating rates of return for equity over the last 40 years while emphasizing the need to adjust our valuation procedures and methodologies accordingly 8 discount rates vary a lot more than we thought most of the puzzles and anomalies that we face amount to discount rate variation we do not understand our theoretical controversies are about how discount rates are formed we need to recognize and incorporate discount rate variation in applied procedures duff phelps goes beyond historical measures of erp by examining approaches that are sensitive to the current economic and financial market conditions in exhibit 1 we list the primary factors considered when arriving at the duff phelps recommended u s erp we document the evolution of these factors from december 31 2017 through december 31 2018 along with the corresponding relative impact on erp indications exhibit 1 factors considered in the u s erp recommendation relative change from december 2017 to december 2018 academic research shows that the equity risk premium varies across business cycles history alone may not capture risks faced by investors in the current environment current economic conditions macroeconomic conditions provide the foundation for financial market performance with economic growth influencing the level of interest rates inflation corporate earnings and other factors that impact financial asset returns global economic prospects improved markedly in late 2016 and during 2017 according to the international monetary fund imf 2017 saw the broadest synchronized global growth upsurge since 2010 9 however the geographic contribution to global growth was notably different in 2018 with the u s leading the pack while other regions started seeing varying degrees of economic slowdown united states almost 10 years have elapsed since the u s economy began its recovery from the global financial crisis of 2008 the financial crisis the 2008 2009 u s recession was declared officially over in june 2009 and was of greater duration than those of 1973 1975 and 1981 1982 the current business cycle expansion is now the second longest in u s history 10 however the recent recovery has fallen short of the rebound observed in other post world war ii recessions real gdp growth in the year following the recessions of 1957 58 1973 75 and 1981 82 was on average 5 6 in contrast real gdp expanded by 2 6 during 2010 and by an average of 2 2 over the 2010 2017 period most economists believe that the long term u s real gdp growth potential is now below the long term historical trend of around 3 0 see exhibit 2 11 exhibit 2 u s real gdp growth 2007 2018 and long term forecasts at year end 2018 approx however a spending boost fueled by individual and corporate tax cuts introduced in late 2017 by the tax cuts and jobs act combined with a strong employment situation restored optimism for 2018 as illustrated in exhibit 2 u s real gdp is forecasted to have grown by a robust 2 9 in 2018 well above its projected long term average 2 1 nevertheless consensus among economists and professional forecasters point to a deceleration in economic activity in 2019 and beyond as the effect of the fiscal stimulus gradually fades moreover as discussed in more detail in the next section a projected slowdown in global economic growth has the potential for negative spillover effects into the u s economy a risk that worried investors in the fourth quarter of 2018 the labor market had its best year in decades in 2018 the annual unemployment rate averaged 3 9 the lowest level since 1969 during the second half of the year the monthly unemployment rate oscillated between 3 7 and 3 9 the former being the lowest monthly rate since 1969 while the latter had been last observed back in 2000 during the dot com bubble 12 the economic theory underpinning the phillips curve suggests that a tight labor market and rapid economic growth can create upward pressure on wages and prices leading to higher inflation economic theory would suggest that a tight labor market and rapid economic growth would create upward pressure on wages and prices ultimately leading to an increase in inflation this relationship is often dubbed the phillips curve 13 however a significant increase in inflation has yet to be observed in the current u s economic recovery which may imply that either the theory underlying the phillips curve no longer holds or that there is still some slack i e unused capacity in the u s economy not fully captured by the traditional unemployment rate measure among other possible explanations 14 15 the federal reserve s fed preferred measures of inflation the trailing 12 month personal consumption expenditures price index pce and the core pce which excludes food and energy prices have remained below the u s central bank s target rate of 2 0 until relatively recently the first half of 2018 saw readings consistently near or exceeding 2 0 which together with a strong labor market and robust real gdp growth provided the fed some comfort to continue to raise the target range of its benchmark short term interest rate the federal funds rate however by december 2018 the trailing 12 month pce dipped again to 1 8 while the core pce ended the year at 2 0 january 2019 saw further declines in both of these inflation measures 16 the trailing 12 month headline consumer price index cpi and the core cpi i e excluding food and energy ended the year 2018 on a similar note the headline cpi rose by 1 9 and the core cpi rose by 2 2 at the end of 2018 on a trailing 12 month basis 17 as discussed later in this document the fed s monetary policy decisions during 2018 were a contributor to a tightening in financial market conditions and an increase in risk aversion in the last quarter of the year global economic conditions at the beginning of 2018 the expectations were for global economic growth to continue at similar levels to 2017 however during the year the rise of trade tensions particularly between the u s and china and the softening of the economic situation in china and europe began to create uncertainty among companies and investors throughout the year economic forecasts were progressively downgraded by major institutions and market participants for instance in the march and may 2018 updates to its economic outlook the organization for economic co operation and development oecd reported that global economic expansion was strengthening 18 19 by september however the oecd warned that global growth was hitting a plateau and that risks from trade restrictions and tighter financial conditions had started to materialize in some countries 20 by november the oecd concluded that while strong global gdp growth had already peaked and that the 2019 growth forecasts had been lowered for most of the world s major economies 21 based on data observed in late 2018 the oecd became even more negative about the economic outlook having revised its growth projections downward for most of the g 20 economies 22 23 similarly the imf began 2018 on an optimistic note but as the year progressed its global economic projections became bleaker in april 2018 the imf was still quite upbeat citing supportive financial conditions as the reason to upgrade its 2018 and 2019 global growth rates to a level even higher than 2017 additionally the imf stated that growth that strong and broad based had not been seen since 2010 when the initial rebound from the financial crisis was observed 24 in july 2018 the imf maintained its 2018 and 2019 projected global growth rates but warned that the economic expansion was becoming less even and that risks to the outlook were rising 25 the imf conjectured that the rate of expansion had peaked in some major economies and growth had become less synchronized in october 2018 shortly after the tenth anniversary of the lehman brothers collapse the imf portrayed a more unbalanced outlook 26 while growth in the u s remained remarkably robust near term prospects for the eurozone the united kingdom and china had deteriorated threats of retaliatory trade policies by the u s possible failure of brexit negotiations and tightening financial conditions for emerging markets as these economies tried to adjust to the fed s progressive rate hikes were cited as factors adding to the uncertainty after analyzing economic and financial market conditions prevailing in late 2018 the imf released reports in early 2019 that showed a worsening trend in global economic conditions 27 the world bank summarized the situation succinctly in its january 2019 global economic outlook 28 the outlook for the global economy has darkened global financing conditions have tightened industrial production has moderated trade tensions have intensified and some large emerging market and developing economies have experienced significant financial market stress faced with these headwinds the recovery in emerging market and developing economies has lost momentum downside risks have become more acute and include the possibility of disorderly financial market movements and an escalation of trade disputes quantitative easing thus far the global economic recovery has been supported by unprecedented monetary policies introduced after the financial crisis began since the onset of the crisis the fed and other major central banks including the european central bank ecb the bank of england boe and the bank of japan boj have i lowered their benchmark interest rates near or below 0 0 zero and ii implemented several rounds of unconventional quantitative easing qe measures the resulting sizable increases in these central banks balance sheets along with various flight to quality episodes have continued to exert a downward pressure on global long term interest rates see exhibit 3 29 the outlook for the global economy has darkened downside risks have become more acute and include the possibility of disorderly financial market movements source world bank exhibit 3 yields on 10 year government bonds issued by the u s u k germany and japan december 2007 december 2018 in the united states the fed kept a zero interest rate policy dubbed zirp in the financial press for seven years from december 2008 until december 2015 in addition the fed purchased large quantities of long term u s government securities agency debt and mortgage backed securities mbs the fed took both these actions with the objective of reducing long term yields and boosting economic activity these qe measures quickly expanded the fed s balance sheet from approximately 900 billion in early september 2008 to 4 5 trillion by september 2014 30 various academic studies have suggested that the fed s qe policies significantly depressed the yields of long term u s treasury securities thereby compressing the term premium for example in a recently released academic study march 2018 the authors estimated that the cumulative effect of the fed s qe programs resulted in a reduction in the 10 year u s treasury yield term premium of about 100 basis points b p 31 for practical purposes this is what this estimate would translate into in absence of qe actions by the fed the 10 year yield of 2 69 as of december 31 2018 would have potentially been around 3 69 instead the authors also constructed a 90 confidence interval around their model estimates and indicated that the effect on the term premium could have been as small as 56 b p or as large as 140 b p 32 quantitative tightening in december 2015 after a nearly 10 year period without interest rate hikes the fed finally embarked on a path of monetary policy normalization 33 as shown in exhibit 4 the process started slowly with the fed raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 b p in december 2015 and again in december 2016 the pace accelerated in 2017 with three 25 b p rate increases during the year robust real economic growth a strong job market and inflation readings closer to its 2 0 target reinforced the case for the fed to keep increasing interest rates in 2018 by the end of december 2018 the target range for the fed s benchmark rate had reached 2 25 to 2 50 which was still relatively low by historical standards but no longer considered unusual exhibit 4 federal open market committee fomc interest rate hikes since 2008 to target federal funds rate 34 the impact of qe on interest rates is expected to diminish over time as the fed unwinds its portfolio of u s treasuries mbs and agency debt in its june 2017 meeting the fed revealed some details of its strategy to reduce its 4 5 trillion balance sheet this gradual unwinding process known as quantitative tightening or qt began in october 2017 exhibit 5 shows the schedule of securities held by the fed that were allowed to expire i e mature each month under that new plan in other words the maximum monthly amount allowed to be removed from the fed s balance sheet under the plan the fed established two separate monthly caps one for expiring u s treasuries and another for expiring mbs and agency debt to the extent that the principal in dollar amount of the maturing securities u s treasuries mbs agency debt is greater than the monthly cap the excess is reinvested by the fed in contrast if the principal of the maturing securities is less than the monthly cap the fed s balance sheet goes down by the lower expired principal amounts exhibit 5 monthly caps and actual quarterly reduction in federal reserve s security holdings at december 2018 for example during the calendar quarter of october through december 2017 see the top row of exhibit 5 the monthly cap of maturing u s treasury securities was 6 billion while the combined cap of mbs and agency debt was 4 billion for an aggregate amount of 10 billion per month or a 30 billion cap 3 months x 10 billion for the whole quarter however the actual amount of u s treasury securities mbs and agency debt that matured during the quarter was only 17 billion 13 billion short of the maximum 30 billion cap for the quarter and so the fed s balance of these securities declined 17 billion at the end of 2018 the size of the fed s balance sheet had declined to 4 1 trillion based on the plan outlined in exhibit 5 and the pattern of balance sheet reductions seen thus far it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the impact of qt would create only gradual and arguably muted upward pressure on interest rates james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis stated as much in remarks delivered on february 22 2019 at the 2019 u s monetary policy forum in new york 36 to summarize my argument the financial and macroeconomic impact of the fomc s balance sheet policy may well be asymmetric that is the size of the balance sheet may have mattered while it was increasing but not while it has been decreasing with the policy rate near zero the effects of qe may have been substantial due to signaling effects now with the policy rate well above zero any signaling effects from balance sheet changes have dissipated this means that balance sheet shrinkage or qt does not have equal and opposite effects from qe indeed one may view the effects of unwinding the balance sheet as relatively minor despite the upbeat tone by the fed in supporting interest rate hikes and the normalization of its balance sheet investors became concerned that further rate rises would choke economic growth and corporate profits especially given the strong signs of a global economic slowdown on november 28 2018 fed chairman jerome powell delivered a speech in which he discussed the outlook for the economy and the fed s monetary policy his stance was that interest rates were still at historical lows and that they remained below the level that was considered neutral for the economy he defined neutral as the level of interest rates that neither speeds up nor slows down the growth in the economy 37 markets translated his comments as a clear indication that the fed was determined to keep increasing rates further into 2019 investors feared that such an interest rate path could potentially lead to a u s economic recession in exhibit 6 we show how the 20 year u s treasury yield a typical proxy for the risk free rate in u s dollars and its 10 year trailing moving average have evolved from december 2007 through december 2018 from the beginning of the year until september 2018 with the economy growing at a fast pace long term government yields kept rising in tandem with the fed s increase in its benchmark short term rate during this period the 20 year yield surpassed its trailing moving average for the first time in september 2018 a sign that perhaps long term interest rates were finally moving upwards to historical levels however shortly after equity markets peaked the 20 year yield started to decline again ending the year at 2 9 below its 10 year moving average of approximately 3 1 with the fed s continued rise of its benchmark rate and consequent upward pressure on short term rates the spread between short and long term rates started to compress this flattening of the yield curve stoked renewed fears that it could potentially be a signal or precursor to a u s recession exhibit 6 spot and 10 year moving average of yields on 20 year u s government december 2007 december 2018 the speed of normalization of monetary policy in the u s and other advanced economies mainly the eurozone and japan was a major concern for markets because of the impact it has on currencies and interest rates in june 2018 the ecb confirmed that the central bank would continue with the the same level of net monthly asset purchases until the end of september 2018 however in that same meeting the ecb announced that it would cut in half the pace of net monthly asset purchases made between october to december 2018 at which point it would stop expanding its balance sheet 38 similarly in april 2018 haruhiko kuroda the boj s governor mentioned that internal central bank discussions had begun regarding options for exiting the bank s massive quantitative and qualitative monetary easing qqe with yield curve control program however mr kuroda told the japanese parliament that it was too early to give any details about the plan furthermore in july 2018 concerns that the boj might scale back its monetary policy shook global bond markets the boj was forced to intervene multiple times to calm markets governor kuroda indicated in a press conference that the boj would not be diverted from its stimulus program even as other major central banks including the fed the ecb and even the boe reversed their own qe programs 39 the imf expressed concerns about the speed of normalization especially in the current environment and warned that these normalizations should consider the new realities on the ground there are major concerns about the state of the economy in china the second economy in the world that could be aggravated by a prolonged trade tension with the u s on the european front brexit uncertainty german economic slowdown french street riots against proposed economic reforms and the turmoil in italian politics are other major events that could throw the regional european economy in serious danger and cause a slowdown in the overall global growth 40 monetary policy in advanced economies should continue to normalize carefully the major central banks are keenly aware of the slowing momentum and we expect they will calibrate their next steps in line with these developments macroprudential tools should be used where financial vulnerabilities are building up across all economies measures to boost potential output growth and enhance inclusiveness are imperatives consumer and business confidence a strong labor market and continued economic expansion helped consumers remain confident about the u s economy as measured by the university of michigan consumer sentiment index in december 2018 consumer confidence was slightly above the level observed at the end of 2017 and it was well above its long term average however the fear of a global economic slowdown and an increase in borrowing costs eroded businesses confidence in the future the business confidence index bci published by the oecd provides a survey based indicator that compiles business leaders opinions in the industry sector and predicts turning points in economic activity index numbers above 100 suggest an increased confidence in near future business performance whereas numbers below 100 indicate pessimism towards future performance as illustrated in exhibit 7 the bci was trending upward all of 2017 and beginning of 2018 however it peaked in september 2018 about the same time that equity markets peaked and started to head down towards the 100 level this implied that as of december 2018 businesses were expecting some softness in the economy exhibit 7 oecd business confidence indicator bci united states december 31 2007 december 31 2018 current financial market conditions the last time duff phelps changed its u s erp recommendation was on september 5 2017 from 5 5 to 5 0 and it was reaffirmed on december 31 2017 since then aggregate risks in u s markets appear to have increased u s equity markets 2018 marked the tenth anniversary of the financial crisis and the longest bull market in history by the end of the third quarter equity markets registered their highest record yet the nasdaq composite index set an all time high of 8 109 69 on august 29 2018 the s p 500 index reached a record high on september 20 by closing at 2 930 75 and the dow jones industrial average closed at its highest level ever on october 3 at 26 828 39 with the beginning of the fourth quarter the trend started to falter and market performance started to turn negative the month of october saw the s p 500 lose 6 94 of its index value in price terms whereas the dow and nasdaq lost 5 07 and 9 2 respectively while major market indices saw negative returns in the month of october performance was even more dismal in december 2018 as a result 2018 marked the worst annual performance for u s equity markets since the financial crisis overall the dow jones industrial average declined 5 6 in price terms whereas the s p 500 and the nasdaq lost 6 2 and 3 9 of their respective index values as illustrated in exhibit 8 the s p 500 index gained 9 6 since december 31 2017 until september 20 2018 when it reached a record high shortly after the fed s meeting decision on september 26 to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 b p while also showing no intent to slow its path towards normalization markets reversed their ascent losses continued after the fed s december 19th meeting decision of yet another 25 b p hike between the record high achieved on september 20 and december 24 the lowest level for the index reached during 2018 the s p 500 index declined by 19 8 some financial market commentators argued that u s major equity indices had reached a bear market 41 exhibit 8 s p 500 index performance december 31 2017 december 31 2018 the rout in equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2018 was not confined to the united states most global equity markets were down during this period global investors were concerned by some of the same factors as those cited by u s investors including trade tensions between the u s and its major partners especially with china a tightening in monetary policy by major central banks faltering global economic growth especially in china germany and japan with its corresponding impact on corporate earnings growth brexit uncertainty and political turmoil in italy and other markets the msci all country world index acwi an index covering stocks across 23 developed markets and 24 emerging market countries declined by 13 1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 similarly the msci eafe an index of stocks in 21 developed markets that excludes the u s and canada dropped by 12 9 over the same period 42 implied equity volatility implied equity volatility as measured by the chicago board options exchange cboe vix index has been termed a fear index as it can be a gauge of investor apprehension volatility in the u s equities market declined sharply in late 2016 and during 2017 the beginning of 2018 saw a spike in volatility that lasted two months however strong corporate earnings and the high consumer confidence calmed investors fears and pushed markets higher the volatility came back by the end of 2018 as investors appeared much more nervous about financial markets than earlier in the year the average daily vix during the last quarter of 2018 21 1 was practically double the average vix during all of 2017 11 1 as shown in exhibit 9 during 2018 the vix index peaked on december 24 2018 the same day that the s p 500 reached its lowest level for the year exhibit 9 chicago board options exchange cboe vix index december 2013 december 2018 exhibit 10 spread of u s high yield corporate bond yields over u s investment grade corporate bond yields december 2013 december 2018 corporate credit spreads relative to december 2017 u s corporate credit spreads have widened substantially by year end 2018 see exhibit 10 however the surge in borrowing costs for non investment grade i e high yield corporate borrowers did not start until the fourth quarter of 2018 in fact on october 3 2018 shortly after equity markets reached a new record high the credit spread of u s high yield over investment grade corporate bonds reached its lowest level since july 2007 prior to the onset of the financial crisis since the onset of the financial crisis fixed income markets have been significant beneficiaries of the qe policies implemented by major central banks across the globe large asset purchases by central banks have created an environment of ultra low interest rates encouraging new corporate debt issuance on a global basis in addition qe programs in the eurozone united kingdom and japan include investment grade corporate debt securities thereby decreasing borrowing costs for those corporations even further as mentioned earlier a variety of factors including fed s continued path towards monetary policy tightening u s trade policy uncertainties especially with china signs of a global economic slowdown and concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings all contributed to a deterioration in risk sentiment early in the fourth quarter of 2018 during this time corporate bond spreads widened notably particularly in december in fact in december 2018 the volume of high yield bonds issued by nonfinancial firms dropped to zero the first time that happened since 2008 according to data provider dealogic 43 additional indicators supporting the erp change quantitative models in addition to the general economic factors and financial market conditions described above duff phelps monitors other indicators that may provide a more quantitative view of where we are within the range of reasonable long term estimates for the u s erp duff phelps currently uses several models as corroborating evidence we reviewed the following indicators at the end of december 2018 damodaran implied erp model new york university professor aswath damodaran calculates implied erp estimates for the s p 500 and publishes his estimates on his website prof damodaran estimates an implied erp by first solving for the discount rate that equates the current s p 500 index level with his estimates of cash distributions dividends and stock buybacks in future years he then subtracts the current yield on 10 year u s government bonds to arrive at an implied erp prof damodaran allows the user to select a variety of methods to project cash flow yields as well as several expected growth rate choices for the terminal year in the valuation duff phelps converts prof damodaran s implied erp estimates to an arithmetic average equivalent measured against the 20 year u s government bond yield relying primarily on two measures of projected cash flows i the trailing 12 month cash flow yield dividends plus buybacks of s p 500 constituents and ii the trailing 10 year average cash flow yield dividends plus buybacks of s p 500 constituents 44 based on prof damodaran s estimates of the trailing 12 month cash flow yield the implied erp converted into an arithmetic average equivalent was approximately 7 20 at end of december 2018 when measured against an abnormally low 20 year u s government bond yield 2 87 45 the equivalent normalized implied erp estimate was 6 57 measured against a normalized 20 year u s government bond yield of 3 5 this normalized implied erp estimates represent an increase of 118 b p relative to the december 2017 estimate 5 38 the normalized implied erp indications were even higher in october and november 2018 using the same methodology the equivalent normalized implied erp estimate was 6 57 measured against a normalized 20 year u s government bond yield of 3 5 this normalized implied erp estimates represent an increase of 118 b p relative to the december 2017 estimate 5 38 the normalized implied erp indications were even higher in october and november 2018 using the same methodology default spread model dsm the default spread model is based on the premise that the long term average erp the unconditional erp is constant and deviations from that average over an economic cycle can be measured by reference to deviations from the long term average of the default spread between corporate bonds rated in the baa category by moody s versus those in the aaa rating category this model notably removes the risk free rate itself as an input in the estimation of erp 46 however the erp indication resulting from the dsm is still interpreted as an estimate of the relative return of stocks in excess of risk free securities however the erp indication resulting from the dsm is still interpreted as an estimate of the relative return of stocks in excess of risk free securities at the end of december 2018 the conditional erp calculated using the dsm model was 5 37 this represents an increase of 44 b p relative to the 4 93 erp indication at the end of december 2017 for perspective march 2016 was the last time that the conditional erp calculated using the dsm model was this high as a reminder this was also around the same time duff phelps had increased its u s recommended erp from 5 0 to 5 5 47 conclusion based on market conditions prevailing at year end 2018 we found sufficient evidence for increasing the duff phelps u s erp recommendation from 5 0 to 5 5 for valuation dates as of december 31 2018 and thereafter we will maintain our recommendation to use a 5 5 u s erp when developing discount rates until there is evidence indicating equity risk in financial markets has materially changed we are continuing to closely monitor the economic outlook and financial market conditions while financial markets may see a rebound from the depressed year end levels we will carefully evaluate whether the combined trends in the risk factors we regularly review warrant a change in our recommendation the current erp recommendation was developed in conjunction with a normalized 20 year yield on u s government bonds as a proxy for the risk free rate based on recent academic literature and market evidence of a secular decrease in real interest rates a k a the rental rate and lower long term real gdp growth estimates for the u s economy we are reaffirming our concluded normalized risk free rate of 3 5 established as of november 15 2016 48 the combination of the new u s recommended erp 5 5 and the reaffirmed normalized risk free rate 3 5 results in an implied u s base cost of equity capital estimate of 9 0 5 5 3 5 adjustments to the erp or to the risk free rate are in principle a response to the same underlying concerns and should result in broadly similar costs of capital adjusting the risk free rate in conjunction with the erp is only one of the alternatives available when estimating the cost of equity capital were one to use the spot yield to maturity of 2 9 on 20 year u s treasuries as of december 31 2018 one would have to increase the erp assumption accordingly one can determine the erp against the spot 20 year yield as of december 31 2018 inferred by duff phelps

after a disappointing outcome in 2017 2018 when the growth in nav per share had failed to match inflation for only the second time since 2000 performance in this most recent year was more encouraging with growth in nav per share matching the msci uk index 7 9 and outstripping the uk retail price index 2 4 the portfolio has remained defensively positioned with some 20 of the portfolio at the end of the year being held in either cash or short term government bonds despite this overall performance measured up well against equity markets several risk asset classes contributed to this as noted in the investment manager s report as did the sizeable holdings in us inflation linked bonds further weakness in sterling after a period of sterling dollar strength in the previous year also helped performance a very important feature of the performance of the company s net asset value in recent years has been to offset excessive market movements notably on the downside as a result of portfolio positioning in conjunction with the successful application of the discount control policy which has limited share price volatility the absence of significant setbacks in portfolio value has been an important element in preserving shareholder value dividend and earnings the revenue return per share after tax and expenses for the financial year was 51 12p a sharp increase for the second year in a

more sustainable the switch in asset allocation from zero dividend preference shares towards short dated corporate bonds has boosted gross revenues meanwhile strict control of fixed costs and a lower average percentage charge for the investment management fee have also improved the net revenue return as in the recent past the board is recommending an underlying dividend which is viewed as at least sustainable in normal circumstances and a special dividend which could be subject to fluctuation in future largely in order meet the requirements of investment trust status a repeat of any such special dividend in succeeding years is not implied this year the board is recommending a total dividend of 35 0p per share comprising an underlying dividend of 23 0p per share and a special dividend of 12 0p per share the total payment of 35 0p per share compares with 27 0p per share last year comprised of an underlying dividend of 21 0p per share and a special dividend of 6 0p per share the board believes that the company s dividend policy which is not a material part of the company s total return is consistent with former years and so recommends this for shareholder approval annual general meeting this year the agm will be held in london at the moorgate offices of smith williamson on tuesday 9 july 2019 at 11 00 a m the notice convening the fifty sixth agm of the company is set out in the annual report we are revising the format this year and our investment managers will be making a short presentation on the outlook for capital markets and the company s investments before we proceed to the formal business of the meeting there will be an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions after the investment manager s presentation and during the formal business of the agm share issuance and buybacks in terms of issuance we issued 2 123 670 shares all at a premium to nav per share for net proceeds of 86 185 000 during the last financial year the company s discount control policy dcp has now been in operation for almost four years it is instructive to look back at the progress since then at the instigation of the policy in august 2015 the company had 2 926 906 shares in issue net assets of 94 56m whilst the daily trading volume was typically less than 1 000 shares with the exception of one short period in late 2015 when the company bought back a small amount of shares at a very modest discount to nav the dcp has operated exclusively in one direction issuing shares at a premium to nav at the latest financial year end there were 7 886 589 shares in issue nearly 2 7 times the august 2015 level net assets were 321 93m and in the latest quarter average daily trading volumes have been in excess of 12 000 shares although the company incurs modest costs for operating the dcp and when renewing shareholder authority from time to time issuance at a premium under the dcp more than compensates and is consistently accretive to nav the board estimates that since inception nav has gained by some 2 56m after all costs with 1 39m of this gain being generated in the latest financial year the expansion in assets under management has had no impact on our investment strategy nor adversely affected our nav per share performance when measured against its twin the hard closed capital gearing portfolio fund the company shows a small positive differential gain in performance over the year to 31 march 2019 the company delivered a nav total return of 7 8 compared to the capital gearing portfolio fund total return of 6 9 this is a consequence of the accretion to nav from issuance at a small premium and the reduction in the ongoing cost ratio examined in greater detail below the board is firmly of the view that the continued implementation of the dcp remains in the best interest of shareholders trading in the company s shares is much more liquid for buyers and potentially for sellers the costs per share of running the company are significantly reduced and issuance at a premium has augmented underlying growth in nav per share to a modest but measurable extent costs the board continues to monitor and exact close control on the costs of running your company the key measure of overall costs is the ongoing charges ratio ocr this has declined yet again from 0 77 in the year to 5 april 2018 to 0 70 this year this is largely due to our fixed costs being spread over a larger asset base but total fixed costs i e excluding the investment management fee which is linked to the size of the portfolio at 0 42m remained at the same level as the previous year before the company commenced its dcp in 2015 the ocr for the much smaller company was 0 96 looking ahead at potential factors that will influence the ocr in future years there are three worthy of mention and only the potential reduction in the investment management fee linked to the amount of assets under management of any significant materiality directors fees were revised upwards on 6 april 2019 to reflect increased time workload and comparisons with other trusts along with the need to attract new directors further detail is provided in the directors remuneration report in the annual report a new agreement between the company and patac which provides secretarial and various administration services will result in an increase of some 38 000 per annum in the fees paid to patac which were set at and unchanged since their appointment in 2015 further details are provided in the directors report in the annual report the investment management agreement with cg asset management has an annual fee of 0 60 of net assets up to 120m 0 45 of net assets above 120m and up to 500m and 0 30 thereafter it is possible if inflows to the company continue at recent rates that this third lower tier of charges will be triggered perhaps even in the current year this would over time have a significant positive impact on the ocr of the company which is already very competitive for what the company aims to achieve for shareholders aifm status currently the company s alternative investment fund manager cg asset management is registered as a small authorised uk aifm however as it now seems possible that the company s assets under management could exceed the upper threshold under the aifm regime of 500 million within the current financial year if the present rate of share issuance persists the board has requested cg asset management to seek permission from the fca to become a full scope aifm this move will require the company to appoint a depositary and thereby incur some additional costs full scope authorisation will also allow the company to gear its balance sheet and to trade in certain instruments e g writing options or buying warrants activities from which the company has been hitherto prohibited it should be stressed that the board has no present intention of borrowing capital or gearing the balance sheet board succession george prescott and i both having served more than nine years on the board are standing for re election at the agm this year however mindful of the need to refresh the board on a periodic basis neither of us will stand for re election at the agm in july 2020 george is relinquishing the chair of the audit committee at this year s agm to be succeeded in this role by robin archibald after george s planned retirement from the board early in 2020 robin will succeed him as senior independent director robin has served as audit chair on other listed investment companies and is a chartered accountant in just over 12 months at the agm in july 2020 i will step down from the chair and will be succeeded by jean matterson as well as having more than four years service on our board jean has two directorships with other investment trusts including eight years experience as chair of pacific horizon investment trust plc she is well qualified and has the full support of the board to take over the leadership of your company in parallel with these changes to the roles of current board members a search has commenced for a suitable candidate to join the board later this year we are taking outside advice in compiling a list of suitable applicants and expect to be well advanced in making an appointment before the end of this year outlook despite the recent rebound in equity and fixed interest markets from a sharp sell off at the end of calendar year 2018 confidence in financial markets appears narrowly based central banks have recently blinked when confronted by investor reaction to the possibility of higher short term rates this has provided some temporary relief but major unresolved issues such as brexit the rise and impact of populist politics the sino us trade negotiations and conflicting signs of a slowdown in global growth could at any time lead to an evaporation of this market rally whilst a case can be made that in certain equity markets valuations are discounting some of these worries we believe that the market volatility of the past 12 months looks set to continue pockets of value do occur from time to time in the markets we survey though in the investment trust field discounts are very tight and liquidity often non existent it will come as no surprise to our shareholders that in this climate it is the preservation of capital value which remains our priority graham meek chairman 28 may 2019 investment objectives and investment policy investment objectives the company s dual objectives are to preserve shareholders real wealth and to achieve absolute total return over the medium to longer term investment policy the company aims to achieve its investment objectives through long only investment in quoted closed ended funds and other collective investment vehicles bonds commodities and cash as considered appropriate given the diverse attributes of closed ended funds and other collective investment vehicles as well as the lower risk characteristics attached to the other asset classes in which the company invests a flexible approach to asset allocation is adopted it is anticipated that under most market conditions a broad mix of assets will be maintained and a maximum 80 exposure to either equity or fixed interest securities including index linked securities and cash may be held at any time the investment manager has the authority to invest in any geographical region and has no set limits on industry sector or country exposure the company will not invest more than 15 of its investment portfolio in any single investment the company does not have a formal benchmark but uses the uk retail price index rpi as the minimum target for returns to be achieved over the medium to longer term thereby aiming to at least preserve the real value of shareholders investments the company in pursuing total return does not aim to invest for income to support any target dividend payment since capital return is likely to be the largest component of the absolute return objective the maximum proportion of the company s gross assets that can be held in other uk listed investment companies which do not have a stated investment policy to invest no more than 15 of their gross assets in other uk investment companies is 10 in accordance with listing rule 15 2 5 it is however the aim of the company to maintain a maximum 6 investment level in such companies in order to avoid any potential breach of this rule and to maintain investment flexibility the company may invest in derivatives such as warrants options swaps and forward contracts for the purpose of efficient portfolio management subject to prior board approval investments in other funds managed by cg asset management or by associates of cg asset management will be considered by the board on a case by case basis and are subject to board approval borrowing powers the company has the authority to borrow up to 20 of net assets subject to prior board approval aifmd status the company is an alternative investment fund aif as defined by the aifmd and cg asset management is the company s alternative investment fund manager aifm cg asset management is authorised as a small authorised uk aifm although the investment policy of the company permits gearing including the use of derivatives the company is not permitted to employ gearing whilst the aifm continues to be registered under its present aifm status strategic report investment strategy and business model capital gearing trust p l c seeks to preserve shareholders real wealth and deliver absolute total returns through the construction of multi asset portfolios with a specialist focus on investment trust equities and related securities portfolio construction is the key tool to mitigate capital loss in any given year the fund manager allocates across asset classes based on an assessment of capital markets and macro economic risks with the aim of avoiding capital loss in addition a portion of the portfolio is invested into the investment trust market with the aim of exploiting inefficiencies to generate risk adjusted returns that are superior to those available in more liquid equity markets key performance indicators kpis the board monitors numerous kpi indices and ratios for the purpose of assessing and reporting investment performance the company seeks to achieve capital growth in real terms over both short term and long term periods the board monitors the performance of the investment manager against rpi over the short term 3 years and the msci uk over the longer term 10 years in addition the board monitors the following kpis share price premium discount to nav an important measure of demand for the company s shares and a key indicator of the need for shares to be bought back or issued at the start of the year under review the premium to nav was 2 6 compared with 2 2 at the year end and ongoing charges percentage calculated using the methodology recommended by the association of investment companies which enables the board to measure the control of costs this percentage was 0 70 for the year to 5 april 2019 2018 0 77 principal risks and uncertainties the directors have

in detail by the investment manager at each meeting the investment manager is formally appraised at least annually by the management engagement committee premium discount level the company s share price could be impacted by a range of factors causing it to be higher than at a premium to or lower than at a discount to the underlying nav per share excessive demand for or supply of share can create liquidity issues restricting the ability of investors to buy and sell shares in the secondary market fluctuations in the share price can cause volatility which may not be reflective of the underlying investment portfolio the company operates a discount premium control policy dcp under which it will purchase or issue shares to ensure in normal market conditions that the shares trade close to their underlying nav per share the dcp increases liquidity and reduces volatility by preventing the build up of excessive demand for the company s shares which the board believes is in the best interests of shareholders the levels of issuance buyback of shares are reported to the board on an ongoing basis and at each board meeting the board considers the manager s ability to invest new proceeds in the case of issuance and maintain sufficient liquidity in the case of buybacks to meet the demands of the dcp the company secretary monitors the relevant authority levels which are regularly reported to the board to maintain as far as possible uninterrupted operation of the dcp operational the company is reliant on third party service providers including cgam as investment manager patac as company secretary and administrator and northern trust as custodian failure of the internal control systems of these third parties could result in inaccurate information being reported or risk to the company s assets the audit committee formally reviews each service provider at least annually considering their reports on internal controls further details of the company s internal control and risk management system is provided in the corporate governance statement in the annual report regulatory the company operates in a regulatory environment failure to comply with s1158 of the corporation tax act 2010 could result in the company losing investment trust status and being subject to tax on capital gains failure to comply with other regulations could result in

15 to the financial statements in the annual report brexit and other political situations are considered a component of market risk employee human rights social and environmental matters the board recognises the requirement under section 414c of the companies act 2006 to provide information about employees human rights and community issues including information in respect of any policies it has in relation to these matters and their effectiveness these requirements do not apply to the company as it has no employees all directors are non executive and it has outsourced all its functions to third party providers the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the company has limited direct impact on the environment it invests primarily in closed ended and other collective investment vehicles or government bonds the sectors chosen do not generally raise ethical issues the board monitors and is satisfied with the underlying investee companies policies to act with due regard to community welfare and environmental factors the board aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly and has sought to ensure that cgam s management of the portfolio of investments takes account of social environmental and ethical factors where appropriate gender and diversity the board supports the principle of boardroom diversity in its broadest sense in terms of gender expertise geographic background age and race the company is specialised and the board s priority to shareholders is to have a board with the requisite abilities to look after the company s investments in addition the board should be able to conclude that any new appointee would make an appropriate contribution it is the board s policy to review its composition regularly and when appropriate to refresh the board through recruitment with the aim of having the blend of skills and attributes that will best serve shareholders in the future at the end of the year under review the board comprised four male and one female director bribery and corruption the company s policy in relation to bribery and corruption can be found in the directors report in the annual report investment manager s report review for a portfolio as defensive as capital gearing trust s to deliver high single digit returns almost everything had to go our way in the year many assets that were selected primarily for their defensive characteristics delivered double digit returns in sterling terms these notably included material holdings in swedish and german property companies renewable and pfi infrastructure funds and the near 25 holding in us inflation linked government bonds the strong performance of these assets allowed the company to deliver acceptable returns whilst holding in excess of 35 of the portfolio in cash or short dated high quality sterling bonds and preference shares these defensive cash and cash like holdings were important in minimising nav declines during the equity market weakness of late 2018 stock selection and asset allocation worked together to protect the downside in short it was a fortunate year in the conventional equity portfolio we initiated one large new position investor ab which is now the core of our conventional european equity exposure investor ab is a liquid swedish holding company which itself holds a range of high quality listed and unlisted european businesses in the summer of 2018 investor ab was trading at unusually wide discounts at a time that the swedish krona had weakened markedly against the euro this combination offered an attractive entry point whilst it is early days for our holding it has outperformed the broader european equity market by more than 10 since we bought into the company the property and alternative portfolios delivered exceptional returns given their relatively low risk profile the fund participated in new stock placings in john laing environmental assets the renewables infrastructure group greencoat uk wind foresight solar fund and greencoat renewables this renewable infrastructure portfolio delivered in excess of 20 returns due to strong demand for stable investments with environmental credentials after a weak year in 2017 2018 the pfi infrastructure funds also delivered strong returns boosted by the move to take john laing infrastructure fund private and out of the public market the most outstanding returns came from the company s circa 2 holding in swedish commercial property the principle holding castellum ab returned in excess of 25 as demand for commercial office space in sweden dramatically outstripped new supply even the circa 2 position in loan funds delivered double digit returns helped by discount narrowing in a new position p2p global investments as always we had some notable underperformers although they were limited in number over the last 12 months for a second year running ground rents income fund delivered double digit declines as political scrutiny of the ground rents market continues whilst this was a setback we continue to believe that long term return prospects are strong more disappointing was the fortunately small investment in catco reinsurance opportunities fund catco purchased in early 2018 our timing was poor as a catastrophe prone year followed and furthermore catco was subject to a probe regarding its historic reserve policies catco is now in managed wind down that will certainly result in a small permanent capital loss the episode demonstrates that discounted opportunities in the investment trust market are a flag of risk as well as an opportunity generally with investment trust discounts at historically narrow levels we remain wary of the risk of discount widening in a bear market the steady inflow of funds into the company from the dcp has had no impact on the asset allocation which has stayed largely unchanged over the last 12 months within the risk asset portfolio new investments have primarily focused on property and infrastructure given these areas offered the more exciting opportunities within the bond portfolios the new inflows have allowed the lengthening of the us inflation linked portfolio to circa 9 years duration in a cost efficient manner outlook the long experiment of persistently stimulative monetary policy conducted by the federal reserve looked last autumn as though it might be ending however in december chairman powell capitulated as even modestly rising interest rates proved problematic for the over indebted us economy the market now anticipates that the next move will be a cut accommodative monetary policy combined with large deficit funded tax cuts has kept the us economy moving forward even supporters of these stimulative policies recognise their possible toxic effects including asset price bubbles over leveraging misallocation of capital socially undesirable distributional effects and difficulties in funding insurance and pension obligations implicitly these costs are acceptable because the alternative a recession with elevated debt levels could spiral into something significantly worse in europe the bold experiment of the ecb doing whatever it takes to protect the integrity of the eurozone is still a work in progress trend growth is so slow that the threat of recession is ever present growth rates anticipated for italy in 2019 are close to zero which will require fiscal tightening if deficit targets are to be met more likely another political row between the european commission and the italian government looms this highlights that the structural reforms that are required to provide stability to the currency union are nowhere in sight and a redenomination crisis cannot be excluded arguing against that outcome is the almost religious belief that the euro is critical to the future of the european project and the fear of the huge losses that any restructuring would crystallise so the euro will likely muddle through but at a huge cost the ecb looks likely to enter the next downturn whenever that will be with a weak banking system inflation below target and negative nominal interest rates to resist a deflationary spiral from that starting place will require heroic monetary policies combined with a significant fiscal stimulus under current constitutional and treaty constraints neither of these policy paths are available one thing seems certain real interest rates will be negative for a long time to come with real rates set to remain at historically low levels it is not easy to identify a short term catalyst that will bring an end to the current business cycle and the associated powerful equity bull market the fragile macro economic backdrop combined with elevated equity and bond valuations suggest that portfolio returns will be modest over the medium term and could be negative if there is a period of recession as with the past year capital preservation remains the key objective of portfolio allocation until valuations return to more attractive levels an objective of merely preserving capital sounds modest but if it can be delivered over a period of normalising asset prices it will represent a significant achievement and lay the foundation for potentially more exciting returns in the future peter spiller alastair laing christopher clothier 28 may 2019 directors report extracts going concern the company s investment objectives and business activities together with the main trends and factors likely to affect its future development and performance are described in the board s strategic report the financial position of the company including its cash flows and liquidity positions is also described in the strategic report and financial statements note 15 to the financial statements describes the company s processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and its exposures to market price interest rates foreign currency credit and liquidity risk the directors believe that the company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and consider that the company has adequate resources an appropriate financial structure and suitable management arrangements in place to continue in operational existence for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements the directors do not consider that there are any material uncertainties to the company s ability to continue to adopt this approach over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements viability statement the board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity the board has drawn up a risk map of the risks facing the company and has put in place appropriate processes and controls in order to mitigate these risks as far as practicable the principal risks which have been identified and the steps taken by the board to manage these are detailed above the company is a long term investor and the board believes it is appropriate to assess the company s viability over a three year period in recognition of our investment manager s long term horizon and also what we believe to be investors horizons taking account of the company s current position and the potential impact of the principal risks and uncertainties as shown above the directors also took into account the liquidity of the portfolio when considering the viability of the company over the next three years and its ability to meet liabilities as they fall due the directors do not expect there to be any significant change in the principal risks that have been identified and the adequacy of the controls in place also the directors do not envisage any change in strategy or objectives or any events that would prevent the company from continuing to operate over that period as the company s assets are liquid its commitments are limited and the company intends to continue to operate as an investment trust the directors believe that only a substantial financial crisis affecting the global economy could have an impact on this assessment based on this assessment the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years portfolio analysis distribution of investment assets

timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of financial position date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the statement of financial position date a net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when on the basis of all available evidence it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis the tax effect of the allocation of

company ordinary shares zero dividend preference shares exchange traded funds and fixed and index linked securities that are held in accordance with the company s investment objectives cash and liquid resources that arise directly from the company s operations and debtors and creditors the main risks arising from the company s financial instruments are market risk interest rate risk foreign currency risk and credit risk the board regularly reviews and monitors the management of these risks and they are summarised below other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest and are short term in nature and accordingly are stated at their nominal value market risk market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments held it represents the potential loss the company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements the company invests in the shares of other investment companies these companies may use borrowings or other means to gear their balance sheets which may result in returns that are more volatile than the markets in which they invest and the market value of investment company shares may not reflect their underlying assets to mitigate these risks the board s investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value stock selection is therefore based on disciplined financial market and sector analysis with the emphasis on long term investments an appropriate spread of investments is held in the portfolio in order to reduce both the systemic risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a country or sector the investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the board which meets regularly to consider investment strategy a list of the investments held by the company is shown above all investments are stated at bid value which in the directors opinion is equal to fair value price risk sensitivity the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net return after taxation for the year and the net assets and net asset value per ordinary share to an increase or decrease of 5 in market prices this level of

the appropriate level of yields given the economic background key determinants include economic growth prospects inflation the government s fiscal position short term interest rates and international market comparisons the investment manager takes all these factors into account when making any investment decisions as well as considering the financial standing of the potential investee company returns from bonds and preference shares are fixed at the time of purchase as the fixed coupon payments are known as are the final redemption proceeds this means that if a bond is held until its redemption date the total return achieved is unaltered from its purchase date however over the life of a bond the market price at any given time will depend on the market environment at that time therefore a bond sold before its redemption date is likely to have a price different from its purchase level and a profit or loss may be incurred interest rate sensitivity the following table

fellow liberians four months ago during my state of the nation address i reported to you that the state of the nation remains strong this is still true today as i deliver my second major national address in 2019 george manneh weah president of the republic of liberia i wish to speak today to you fellow citizens my brothers and my sisters on matters of critical national importance i wish to speak to liberians across our beloved country and to liberians in diaspora and to liberians of every tribe age religion and political affiliation i have dedicated all of my energy compassion and solidarity over many decades to you all today we share a determination to see our people prosper and our country develop we the liberian people are strong and capable we know this because we have overcome the division and destruction of war we conquered ebola and we have peacefully transferred the honor and duties of political leadership in accordance with our constitution and the rule of law i am proud to say today that liberia is a democracy where people who seek to do so lawfully peacefully and responsibly can and do express their opinions whether in our legislature on our campuses in teashops and in peaceful demonstrations this is not sudan where one man ruled for 30 years and now the military is in control this is not venezuela where citizens are denied their rights where the legislature is unable to play its role and humanitarian aid is blocked from reaching people in desperate need in liberia while we will continue to face many challenges such as managing inflation creating jobs and fighting corruption our commitment to democratic principles is strong and central to our country s development and stability my fellow citizens a nation is not defined only by easy and happy times when everything is going well rather a nation is defined by the ability of its people to overcome difficult moments in their history and this is only possible when we come together as one people our strength will always lie in our unity because if we are divided we will never overcome the ills of our society fellow citizens we liberians have had some difficult moments but those moments do not define us those dark times did not define us we overcame that gloomy history and today liberia is a shining multiparty democracy in which freedom is supreme with the help of our regional and international partners we overcame both war and the disease liberia has since remained a haven of peace and has undergone a successful democratic transfer of power today the peace and security of this country is in the hands of liberians themselves after the withdrawal of all united nations troops in 2018 today we have a multi party active democracy in which political dissent or criticism is tolerated today we have unprecedented press and media freedom and have decriminalized free speech by law today liberia is a democracy where civil society groups and organizations can advocate openly for issues they care about today liberia is a democracy in which our integrity institutions monitor our implementation of law and policy my fellow liberians it is these freedoms that will define us as a people it is our toleration of political opposition and opposing ideas that will enrich our national dialogue and discourse liberia is no longer receiving the emergency aid that came in the years after war and large grants from our multilateral partners have also dried up the amount of remittances we receive from abroad in us dollars has also declined president george manneh weah it is our ability to manage this culture of freedom and tolerance for criticism that can sustain our peace it is reconciliation and social justice for all liberians that will bring us all together to face and overcome our difficult moments today we face a difficult economic moment but this moment like other moments of our history will soon come to pass the economic challenge we face today has to do with the structure of our economy we have lost significant revenue from the fall in the prices of iron ore and rubber and several of our rubber farmers have lost their income and ability to spend in the economy liberia is no longer receiving the emergency aid that came in the years after war and large grants from our multilateral partners have also dried up the amount of remittances we receive from abroad in us dollars has also declined all of these realities complicate our macroeconomic situation the sudden drop in us dollar inflows puts pressure on the economy and devalues the liberian dollar moving prices upward the macroeconomic policies we have today are policies tailored to the time that we had free inflows of united states dollars we are now changing these policies to reflect the economic realities of our time and so my fellow liberians i want you to know that i am aware of the difficulties and hardships that the rising exchange rate is causing you and the effect it is having on prices of all goods and commodities in the market i am deeply concerned about these issues and i am working day and night to resolve them i will now summarize the broad actions that government is taking to stabilize our economy we are delivering a new and improved fiscal policy that will be announced with the passage of a credible national budget for the 2019 2020 fiscal year in the last several years we have passed a budget that exceeds our revenue potential we are now working together with counterparts in the other branches of government to pass a realistic budget to achieve this will require sacrifices from all our actions will involve reform of our large wage bill rationalizing government spending to put more resources to critical sectors like health education and agriculture improving the way government makes payments to government entities and vendors who supply the government with goods and services and some actions on domestic arrears that the government owes local vendors as a stimulus to the economy on the monetary front we are taking actions to instill greater confidence in the central bank of liberia and the banking sector at large the integrity and independence of the central bank will be assured and protected under my administration and this resolve will be critical in the years ahead in this regard i wish to announce that the government of liberia under my leadership will no longer borrow from the central bank of liberia for its short term liquidity needs for monetary policy to work liberians must develop confidence in the banking sector today most of the liberian dollars in our economy is outside the banking sector we are shortly going to announce new policy initiatives that should increase the confidence of liberians in the liberian dollar these polices will provide strong incentives for liberians to keep their money in the bank and for commercial banks to invest more in the liberian dollar economy my fellow liberians in spite of the difficult economic conditions we did not default on our responsibility to ensure that the lives and livelihood of our people are improved utilizing domestic revenue which has increased as compared to the previous fiscal period we implemented several infrastructure and social programs that are impacting our people significantly these projects include the pavement of roads in the various communities in monrovia and some leeward counties the hiring of an additional 2000 health workers to greatly reduce the capacity gap in the health sector the complete reconditioning of jfk medical laboratory along with ongoing comprehensive renovation of the facilities the construction of hundreds of housing units for low income earners the introduction of tuition free education in all public universities in liberia the training of more doctors for specialization in various fields of medicine the payment of all waesce students fees in 2018 the allocation of over us 6 million united states dollars to the liberia electricity corporation which enabled it expand connections to more communities the pavement of several major highway corridors in the country we implemented these and many other projects to directly and positively affect the lives of our people my fellow citizens for a few months now there have been speculations and allegations surrounding the printing and delivery of our local currency the liberian dollar with some suggesting that an amount of up to sixteen billion liberian dollars had somehow gone missing in that process for monetary policy to work liberians must develop confidence in the banking sector today most of the liberian dollars in our economy is outside the banking sector we are shortly going to announce new policy initiatives that should increase the confidence of liberians in the liberian dollar these polices will provide strong incentives for liberians to keep their money in the bank and for commercial banks to invest more in the liberian dollar economy my government felt that it was important to investigate these allegations and in this regard a presidential investigative team was commissioned to do so in order to ensure an independent view a second investigation was simultaneously launched with the support of the united states government which facilitated the hiring of an international audit firm kroll associates the recently submitted reports of both of these investigations found that an amount of 15 5 billion liberian dollars was printed and delivered to the central bank of liberia however both reports presented evidence that additional liberian dollars had been printed in excess of the amounts contracted and had been imported into liberia but could not be accounted for it is important to note however that apart from the unauthorized surplus the reports indicate that all other bank notes ordered were properly accounted for and that there was no missing money immediately upon receipt of these reports the government of liberia commenced the prosecution of officials and employees of the central bank of liberia whose duty and official responsibility it was to manage the printing and delivery of liberian dollar bank notes as you are all aware those prosecutions are on going through the liberian legal system under due process of law no one has been arrested illegally or detained unjustifiably in connection with these trials i hereby pledge to ensure that the trials will continue until the courts of liberia issue final verdicts in this matter my fellow citizens i am fully aware of the negative impact of the declining exchange rate on the economic well being of the liberian people and i know that this is causing serious hardship for everyone but most especially for the ordinary liberians who have no financial cushion to protect them from these harsh conditions in order to slow down or halt the depreciation of the liberian dollar and thereby bring some much needed relief to the suffering of our people my government was advised by its economic management team in close collaboration with the central bank of liberia to make an infusion of 25 million into the economy through the central bank the purpose being to mop up the excess liquidity of liberian dollars at the completion of the mop up exercise criticisms and allegations were made that the process had not been done in a proper and professional manner and that there had been irregularities and issues of mis management these issues were referred by me to the minister of justice and attorney general of liberia for further investigation he thereupon referred the matter to the general auditing commission upon completion of its investigation the general auditing commission has reported its findings to the minister of justice who has recently announced these findings to the general public the investigative report found that of the us 25 million authorized to be used for the mop up only us 17 million was used and that this was exchanged for an equivalent ld2 6 billion liberian dollars the gac report also provides accounting evidence that the amount of ld2 6 billion liberian dollars was deposited into the central bank however major concerns were raised surrounding several cbl listed businesses that are denying that they participated in the mop up exercise as well as other cbl listed businesses that were found not to be in existence at the time of the gac audit the report also found major discrepancies and unexplained variances in the accounting records of the cbl the minister of justice and attorney general has now requested the liberia anti corruption commission to investigate these irregularities the aim of this exercise is to determine criminal liability all those found criminally liable will face the full weight of the law my fellow citizens all of these reports and lapses point to a major lack of systems and controls at the central bank of liberia and call into question the ability of its present leadership to effectively revamp its internal mechanisms to provide greater accountability and professionalism so that confidence and credibility would be restored to the institution to provide the opportunity for the central bank to have a new direction i have accepted the resignation of the deputy governor for economic policy the executive governor is scheduled for age related mandatory retirement in the next three months during that period we will work to transition the bank to a new management the new cbl leadership will be recruited by a vetting committee to be established it will be composed of an independent team of professional liberians to be named shortly any qualified liberian interested in becoming a part of this new leadership team may submit applications to the vetting committee whether they are resident in liberia or abroad and regardless of gender or political affiliation meanwhile i will also announce a new board of governors next week my fellow citizens my government will shortly announce a series of policy measures that are intended to stabilize our economy in the short term and position it for growth in the medium to long term we are working with stakeholders on measures that are intended to bring down prices we are working to attract new investments in agriculture and we are working to improve our business climate to reduce the costs and hurdles of doing business in liberia we are privileged to have the support of the united nations the african union and ecowas as well as our other international partners who have invested in our future and who continue to offer the assistance and advice we need to improve our country we wish to assure our international development partners that we are committed to upholding the norms of good governance soon we will welcome a team from the international monetary fund coming to create an imf program tailored for liberia such a program will help us to take the needed steps to stabilize our economy restore confidence in our currency and offer technical assistance to continue social services an imf program requires greater discipline across government budgets we will be introducing salary caps for government workers and asking our legislators to share the burden as well we will review performance and revenues from our state owned enterprises ensuring that leakages or inefficiencies do not undercut the ability of government to support its people we have seen other african countries including ghana rwanda and senegal benefit from imf programs and i believe liberia can do so as well my fellow citizens we liberians should work together in our attempts to tackle our toughest problems and seek to make the choices that will lead to changes that have broad positive effects for our country to attract investors and create jobs for our people we need to start reforms now that will pay off in the future my government is committed to the pro poor agenda that will lift up all of our people not only a few education and healthcare are at the heart of our agenda but we are also prioritizing roads and infrastructure to grow economic opportunity even as we build a better future we are addressing the problems of the past that still cast shadows over our people s lives we are implementing land reform and local governance laws passed by our legislature last year and we are supporting dialogue at the local level with assistance from international partners that advances reconciliation and unity we are also strengthening our legal system training magistrates and judges and shortening pre trial detention to improve access to justice my fellow citizens we intend to intensify our fight against corruption but as we battle corruption our fight will be based on the facts and the evidence of corrupt activities that is adduced by reports from audits that have been professionally conducted rather than mere perceptions and unsubstantiated allegations in the next several days my government will begin the review of all general auditing commission audits over the past 10 years and will commence legal actions against every person that is implicated in these audit reports anyone found culpable will face the full force of the law in this same spirit my government also intends to contract international auditing and investigative firms to go after all monies and resources that were illegally taken from liberia over the last 10 years we must all take the fight against corruption to a new level as a form of social justice for all our people my fellow citizens our national dialogue must be based on truth facts and evidence and our national discourse must also be civil in this age of social media let us use this medium as a resource for nation building and the promotion of peace rather than a tool of national destruction my fellow citizens article 17 of the liberian constitution deals with the rights of all citizens to peaceful assembly as well as the right to present petitions to their government for the sake of clarity i would like to quote article 17 in its entirety quote all persons at all times in an orderly and peaceable manner shall have the right to assemble and consult upon the common good to instruct their representatives to petition the government or other functionaries for the redress of grievances and to associate fully with others or refuse to associate in political parties trade unions and other organizations unquote my fellow citizens in closing l once again wish to pledge my absolute commitment to the protection of each and every right and freedom granted to each and every one of you under our constitution it is the use of these freedoms that will define us as a people it is our toleration of political opposition and opposing ideas that will enrich our national dialogue and discourse it is our ability to manage this culture of freedom and tolerance for criticism that can sustain our peace it is reconciliation and social justice for all liberians that will bring us all together to face and overcome our difficult moments god bless us all and bless liberia our native land

russia shifted 100 billion of dollar denominated reserves into renminbi euros and yen in 2018 in general the increasing weaponisation of economic sanctions since president trump s inauguration but also before is driving countries to seek refuge from the long arm of us financial authority no country wants their main bank to be fined billions of dollars as occurred to france s bnp paribas in 2015 for not adhering to another state s foreign policy as if to underline the growing doubt in the current monetary order at the last european state of the union address european commission president jean claude juncker emphasised it is absurd that european companies buy european planes in dollars instead of euros what s more emerging asian economies are looking for ways to reduce the boom and bust cycle associated with the dollar and they may get that opportunity as trade in asia becomes less dependent on the us these countries may find it to their advantage to sign swap agreements with the chinese central bank and conduct trade in the renminbi which increasingly reflects their trade patterns structural shifts in china changes in chinese demographics imply a need to internationalise the

statistical review 2017 a dollar down cycle after spending six of the past seven calendar years on the up another dollar down cycle may begin in 2019 concerns about us twin deficits are re emerging renewed political polarisation in the us on the right and now increasingly the left imply budget deficits as far as the eye can see driven by tax cuts and higher social spending congressional budget office forecasts show us debt hitting 152 of output by 2048 from 78 today the us twin deficits will eventually catch up with the expensive dollar and we could see the currency fall materially in less than two years of course us interest rates still favour the dollar but there is also every chance that us rates will converge lower what will the next global currency shift look like the emergence of a genuinely multipolar world will have a profound impact on markets and portfolios after seven years of a dollar up cycle and a de rating in emerging market assets investors should be aware that the nature of the opportunity unfolding could be structural rather than purely cyclical given the uncertainties of a currency transition we have identified three scenarios full renminbi internationalisation china s capital account fully opens over the next decade renminbi regionalisation rising renminbi use is concentrated in emerging asia a reduced role for the dollar this would ultimately lower us living standards it is worth noting that these three scenarios are not mutually exclusive for instance it is possible that full chinese capital account liberalisation occurs during a period of a prolonged dollar decline ultimately we think the most likely scenario is the second one which we briefly discuss below scenario two renminbi regionalisation in the second scenario china never fully opens its capital account the renminbi serves as a reserve currency within an asian trading bloc while the chinese maintain some capital controls a renminbi bloc would not only project china s strength but would be built on strong and complementary trading relationships we ve already seen signs of increasing regionalisation as reflected in china s belt and road initiative and the people s bank of china swap agreements with emerging market countries to facilitate trade so what are the investment implications increased regionalisation could lead to a general decline in risk premia in emerging asia and reduce the boom and bust of the dollar funding cycle the second broad impact is a transformation of asian emerging market economic cycles increased invoicing in renminbi will mean that other economies will trade more in line with china s economic and financial cycles this should boost investment strategies that are related to this transformation none of this is to imply that the us dollar will not remain a key international currency if not the most important one for some time to come never the less the coming market cycle is likely to be different for all the reasons discussed above the rise of a challenger such as china that is less willing to subscribe to a us led order as japan and germany did is a fundamentally different development the emergence of a genuinely multipolar world will have a profound impact on markets and will affect nearly every asset class investors should be aware that the nature of the change unfolding could be structural rather than purely cyclical dm philip saunders is co head of multi asset growth and sahil mahtani is a strategist at investec asset management
advertisement over the past weeks investors regarded the central bank s move towards lowering the interest rate by 1 from 17 75 to 16 75 as positive economic news especially as the central bank is further discussing arrangements to lower the interest rate further more along this year in this article we explain the implications of this factor and its recent history and economic significance to both individuals and investors who makes the decision to lower fix or raise interest what is the mpc interest rate reduction is a decision that falls within a committee that includes central bank leaders including the governor of the central bank and his deputies along with a representative from the ministry of finance and a number of experts consultants and advisers this committee is present in any country and is usually referred to as the monetary policy committee mpc the egyptian mpc has been formed by a decision by the board of directors of the central bank of egypt to be formulated of seven members namely the governor of the central bank of egypt deputy governors and four board members including a member from the ministry of finance to maintain constant coordination between the central bank and the ministry on monetary policy decisions made by the committee the committee holds its meetings on thursdays every 6 weeks 8 times a year and the schedule of the meetings until the end of this year is announced on the website of the central bank of egypt the mission of the committee is to set policies to achieve price stability combat inflation stimulate growth and reduce unemployment accordingly the central bank of egypt is committed in the medium term to achieving lower rates of inflation to stimulate investment and economic growth the mpc reviews reports economic and financial studies analysis and indicators prepared by the monetary policy unit of the central bank of egypt that include recent local developments that tackle current statistics regarding inflation interest rate monetary and credit developments as well as other financial indicators along with risks associated with inflation and other estimates and factors while on the other hand the mpc also reviews global trends and indicators in terms of inflation rates growth interest rates and future forecasts before deciding on interest rate amendments what is the meaning of reducing interest on deposits and loans a reduction in interest on loans means a reduction in the amount of expenses to be paid over the principal amount of the loan by an investor on the other hand the reduction in the interest rate on the deposit means a reduction in the amount of profits to be paid over the principal amount of the deposit to the individual accordingly it will be more appealing to invest money in business rather than savings and with the decreased cost of establishing new projects and companies people and companies are therefore motivated to borrow more to establish new enterprises employing workers or expanding their existing businesses that will lead to increased production local market coverage and accordingly less imports exports increase unemployment decreases and economy grows and that is mainly why economists see this development as a positive indicator for economic growth the history of interest rates in egypt over the last 30 years the world is broken into two types of economies either advanced or emerging economies advanced economies are countries that have developed capital markets with high levels of liquidity large market capitalisation high levels of per capita income and is characterised by lower interest rates on the other hand emerging economies are countries in the process of rapid growth and development with lower per capita incomes and less mature capital markets than developed countries as well as characterised by higher interest rates egypt in an emerging economy that has a relatively high interest rate compared to advanced economies egypt went through 4 stages of interest rate amendments and currently we are entering a fifth stage of dynamic changes based on economic performance the stage of the nineties crisis brought along with the gulf war had some economic reforms yet regrettably were incomplete the stage of stability in the millennium with the governments of atef ebeid and ahmed nazif the stage of the outbreak of the revolution that witnessed increased subsidies and spending that lead to depletion of reserves and was accompanied by a neglect for an economic reform for fear of public distress and chaos and the stage of a real economic reform plan that started to formulate in mid 2014 and was launched in november 2016 over the first stage the interest rate was between 12 20 over the second phase the interest rate fell between 8 12 over the third phase the interest rate was fixed between 8 and 12 over the fourth stage interest increased between 11 and 20 the previous 4 stages are over we are now living in the fifth phase of amendments that still has not been completed the stage at which success of economic reforms is the main engine in developing economic performance and hence mirrored through the series of interest rates reductions from 20 to 16 75 interest rates around the world other countries have taken the same path in their economic reform turkey raised interest rates to about 250 at the beginning of its 1995 economic reform as mentioned in my previous article currently turkey s interest rate is 8 on the other hand brazil raised its interest rate to 45 at the beginning of its 1999 economic reforms while currently its interest rate is 6 5 note that interest rate is linked directly to the rate of inflation inflation level is the reaction to the interest rate level for example in countries where there is a lower inflation rate you will note much lower interest rates like most of the g20 countries euro 0 england 0 5 united states 1 75 russia 7 25 china 4 35 india 6 japan 0 1 mexico 7 5 in africa the highest interest rates are in congo angola ghana and mozambique 18 to 20 in south america the highest interest rates are in argentina 27 25 in asia the highest interest rates are in iran 18 in europe the highest interest rates are in ukraine 17 top five for highest interest rates in the world argentina venezuela haiti the congo and angola egypt is ranked 11th in the world at the highest interest rates list but the successive reduction of its interest rate since last january have improved its ranking while before the current reductions we were in sixth and seventh place place 5 when the interest rate was raised along with the egyptian pound s floatation and throughout 2017 economists said it was a good decision too what caused this contradiction it is not a contradiction it is flexibility is not a contradiction it is flexibility and adaptation to the economic variables expected through the primary stage of economic reform along with the current economic situation when launching the reform plan inflation was peeking and to reduce it spending needed to be reduced accordingly with the incentive of a higher interest rate on savings people started to save their money in banks for a higher profit on deposits while transferring their us dollar savings into egyptian pounds to gain from the interest rate yields thus yielding us dollars and killing the black market by the new floatation rate while managing the difference treasury bills issued in us dollars for foreign investments to cover our pilled up financial commitments that were large at the time yet with the current commitments lower reserves increasing and inflation falling from 35 to 14 thus there is no need for a high interest rate on the contrary we need to reduce the interest rate to stimulate growth and investment 6 in conclusion according to the views of a large number of international institutions and investment banks it is expected that by end of 2018 interest rate may reach 13 to 15 taking into account the mid year subsidy adjustment within fuel and electricity the biggest sector benefiting from the interest rate cuts is the real estate sector because it is a safe stable secure and non risk investment and comes second after investing in banks the sector is characterised by its stability over the instabilities of 2011 to date with no fluctuations on the other hand egypt s growing population and over 90 of unused land serves as a fertile opportunity for its sustainable growth the real estate sector affects multiple sectors in the economy and is the most important sector that leads growth within the egyptian economy and even most of the world s economies as it is linked to large labour intensive sectors the growth of this sector impacts growth in about 90 secondary sectors linked to the construction industry thanks to the massive national projects under way and growing infrastructure there is a wave of new cities along with the new capital the number of these new cities is more than 15 cities that are currently in progress on the other hand it is worth noting that date for the principal money invested by individuals in high yield deposits at 20 as well as the suez canal deposits are close to maturity and accordingly people will look for alternative safe investments and property will be the ideal alternative the central bank and the government in their move are looking further more towards developing msmes and offering over 20 public companies in the stock market from variable sectors such diversification is recommended for an economy to develop its growth
it s very likely that q3 will see a new policy panic as policymakers realise that a global recession is drawing close as for the outlook for us rates mr garnry said the market is increasingly pricing in a fed rate cut with the probability now standing at 58 per cent for the september meeting given the current spread between the two year and the effr a 25 basis point move would be pointless it will be 50 basis points at minimum and could go as far as a 75 bps an outrageous prediction but not impossible move to get ahead of the curve it s crucial to remember though that every time the fed begins cutting the fed funds rate it means trouble it means that the us central bank is forecasting a recession more importantly the fed is always late so a cut means that recession is right around the corner for local investors the focus is data this morning advertisement the focus in asia will temporarily shift to australian data as first quarter reading of private capital expenditures is expected

the initial boost to confidence from president donald trump s first wave of tax policies appears to have faded in the united states according to the ranking while still setting the pace globally for levels of infrastructure and economic performance the competitiveness of the world s biggest economy was hit by higher fuel prices weaker hi tech exports and fluctuations in the value of the dollar singapore s rise to the top was driven by its advanced technological infrastructure the availability of skilled labor favorable immigration laws and efficient ways to set up new businesses hong kong sar held on to second place helped by a benign tax and business policy environment and access to business finance lithuania took 29th place in the ranking the country climbed 3 steps up compared to 32nd place in 2018 the imd world competitiveness rankings established in 1989 incorporate 235 indicators from each of the 63 ranked economies the ranking takes into account a wide range of hard statistics such as unemployment gdp and government spending on health and education as well as soft data from an executive opinion survey covering topics such as social cohesion globalization and corruption economists regard competitiveness as vital for the long term health of a country s economy as it empowers businesses to achieve sustainable growth generate jobs and ultimately enhance the welfare of citizens in a year of high uncertainty in global markets due to rapid changes in the international political landscape as well as trade relations the quality of institutions seem to be the unifying element for increasing prosperity a strong institutional framework provides the stability for business to invest and innovate ensuring a higher quality of life for citizens said arturo bris imd professor and director of imd world competitiveness center the research center which compiles the ranking the effects of rising fuel prices influenced the ranking with inflation reducing competitiveness in some countries stronger trade revenues helped oil and gas producers such as this year s biggest climber saudi arabia which jumped 13 places to 26th and qatar which entered the top 10 for the first time since 2013 switzerland climbed to fourth place from fifth helped by economic growth the stability of the swiss franc and high quality infrastructure the alpine economy ranked top for university and management education health services and quality of life this information feeds into four categories economic performance infrastructure government efficiency and business efficiency to give a final score for each country there is no one size fits all solution for competitiveness but the best performing countries tend to score well across all four categories indonesia

southern asian country is characterized by the lowest cost for labor across the 63 economies studied the asia pacific region emerged as a beacon for competitiveness with 11 out of 14 economies either improving or holding their ground led by singapore and hong kong sar at the top of the global chart venezuela remains anchored to the bottom of the ranking hit by inflation poor access to credit and a weak economy the south american economy ranks the lowest for three out of four of the main criteria groups economic performance government efficiency and infrastructure the united arab emirates ranked

leads the way globally for investment incentives the handling of public sector contracts and areas such as image branding and talent management portugal posted the biggest fall in the region down six places to 39th a reversal from gains made in the previous year competitiveness across europe has struggled to gain ground with most economies on the decline or standing still the nordics traditionally a powerhouse region for competitiveness have failed to make significant progress this year while ongoing uncertainty over brexit has seen the united kingdom fall from 20th to 23rd thailand driven by an increase in foreign direct investments and productivity advanced five places to 25th position in 2019 middle east a story of two halves in the region as fossil fuel producers such as uae qatar and saudi arabia climbed the rankings while inflation had a negative impact on turkey 51st and jordan 57th israel 24th declined mainly because of a negative performance across different government

victor ariole when you are marginalised by those who appropriate to themselves greater stakes in politics or economics your views are also seen as marginal so also everything about africa is seen either as marginal or at best as emerging nigeria being the most populous country in africa is still seen as marginal or an emerging economy so its budget can only take the shape of a marginal budget in a world dominated by knowledge economy as majority of its people remain in the margins of knowledge acquisition seventy percent in the north uneducated 11million out of school hence a budget of margins just for tiny portion of nigeria reacting as termites what i read in the budget of supposedly great economies of the west is how to reduce budget deficit not necessarily what they earn or what they spend though reducing budget deficit imply such issues as earnings and spending focus is on waste eliminator not to create ants to destroy their wealth it also implies that as long as people are productive and at work deficit reduction could mean an austerity measure which has never worked as stimulus has always prevailed basically the us congress refusal to approve 5billion border wall of the usa s president is to reduce the huge budget deficit that the usa has been incurring over the years 23trillion debt yet it is the economy rated as greatly performing with more people getting into the job market than any other country it is also known that the mayor of new york operates far greater capital budget than found in nigeria s current budget of mere n8trillion about 20 billion yet 23 of capable hands in nigeria are not finding jobs to enhance the overall economic carrying capacity of nigeria that shows greater marginalization upon which budgeting could only be seen as voodoo budgeting hinged on weak thinking or marginal thinking what is there to budget for when most nigerians seem to be on their own except the politicians marginal activity is what the proposed earning and spending of the budget is based and it could only yield marginal result that exclude the majority or operates in disdain of capable hands begging to be included so as to form the real norm yet to be used in the budgeting process one of the basics you learn in mba class that concerns accounting is that until average cost equates marginal cost where marginal cost is seen as the contribution of each activity in the assumed average cost of all activities remaining proportional to the value of such activity to the entire activity it is seen as not yet optimising this is where subsidy tends to be seen as eroding optimisation process in effect nigeria s budgeting process that always see the legislators raising the oil benchmark is completely a weak thinking process and quite a voodoo economic activity as generally the oil price is not determined by nigeria but by those who are directly or secretly in charge of both the oil pricing mechanism and its supply chain the leading powers and even the central bank of nigeria that must ensure that it does not release into nigeria s economy more than nigeria is contributing to the world albeit marginally vis à vis what such greater stakeholder see as partaking in the average costing of maintaining the global economy costed and regulated by seen and unseen hands of organizations like uno imf world bank nato etc these are strategic organisations incurring costs towards regulating world s economy and they are very strict in making sure that a given nation does not earn more that it deserves sanctions could be imposed or whatever they deem necessary to frustrate such nation s economic prospects nigeria has been clamouring to be among the 20 most developed economy in the world for decades and a small country like taiwan had been there for decades and taiwan basically operates its budget on earning as function of added value from whatever it is importing from others to reach final products which is better in attaining optimisation nigeria needs to think along that line in its budgeting process as against the legislators arbitrarily raising oil price like taiwan like south korea smaller in size but greater in gdp than nigeria the minimalist way of evaluating our legislators must be to see the laws that they are making that give nigerians and investors operating environment that encourages adding values to what the nigerian knowledge base its people and its resources comparative advantage prospects add in terms of national wealth for example it was known that south korea enacted a law and greatly marketed that law which enabled any investor in the 70s to come with a given amount of dollar and open industry with some tax free benefits as long as such industry engaged in exportable goods their aim was for foreign reserve booster and it worked some nigerians were known to have participated in the making of that prosperity it was even a time when people there were eager to acquire nigerian university degrees paying for it in dollars in south korea as nigeria takes back manufactured products like air conditioners fridge and computers today south korea is one of the 20 most industrialized nations from their former poor state in effect till nigeria starts getting out of the margins with its paltry earnings that is far below its optimization capacity it will be baseless discussing marginal budgetary presentation that makes more mockery of the system as legislators go into executive function of allocating more funds to themselves instead of questioning spending that do not reflect right earnings i have never heard any where that legislators make more appropriation to themselves as against either adopting or querying the spending patterns of the executive the current budget of about n8trillion does not reflect the production capacity of nigeria upon which taxation could be extracted from the entire nigeria s people and resources hence quite a marginal budget and as majority of nigerians remain marginalized in the production system so also will the progress of the entire country remain marginalized in the greater economy of the world time to open the space and allow youthful nigerians and women participate effectively in a small scale operations for more wealth creation and it is seen in the great input of the diaspora as reflected in their remittance and gnp which has not been matched by internal policy of citizen diplomacy as no succor for some of them thriving abroad ariole is a professor of french and francophone studies university of lagos

states ramps up other barriers to trade the outlook for the financial sector on both sides of the pacific is starting to change part of a broader decoupling between the two economies there are growing

screens showing stock market movements at a securities company in beijing may 20 2019 image lam yik fei the new york times beijing president donald trump s trade war with china has prompted a broad rethinking of how the two economies have become so intertwined leading some manufacturers to trim supply chains in china and american authorities to start cutting off crucial technology for chinese companies now another important area is getting a close look financial markets some trade experts and others urging the trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the white house should curb china s access to wall street chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through american financial markets in recent years steve bannon trump s former chief strategist said there were continuing efforts inside and outside the administration to rethink china s role in american stock markets in part because of a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of chinese companies the new york stock exchange and nasdaq are breaching their fiduciary responsibility to institutional investors the pension funds of hardworking americans bannon said it s outrageous all of it should be shut down immediately adding fuel to the discussion alibaba the chinese e commerce giant that held a hugely successful initial public offering in new york five years ago is now considering also listing its shares in the semiautonomous chinese city of hong kong according to a person familiar with the matter the person who asked for anonymity because the discussions were not public said the move was not under consideration because of geopolitical worries as the united states ramps up other barriers to trade the outlook for the financial sector on both sides of the pacific is starting to change part of a broader decoupling between the two economies there are growing calls on the u s side for complete decoupling which is causing chinese enterprises to re

escalating trade tensions between the us and china can turn into a blessing in disguise for the indian economy industry watchers and economists hope the ongoing tussle may slow down the world s two biggest economies and channel some overseas investment to india the ongoing tariff war may also benefit select industries and cap the upside in crude oil prices which can help ease the pressure on india s current account deficit in an escalation of the standoff the us on may 10 increased tariff on 250 billion worth of chinese goods from 10 per cent to 25 per cent president donald trump also threatened to impose higher tariffs on the remaining 325 billion chinese imports in the coming months if china fails to agree on a trade deal china retaliated by increasing tariffs on 60 billion worth of us imports from 5 per cent to a 5 25 per cent this provides an opportunity for companies from countries like india to grab market share from a de risking perspective the us companies importing goods from china could be looking at alternative countries for imports says rusmik oza head of fundamental research kotak securities economists look at both china and india as long term growth stories the trade war will also rattle investors who are looking at china from the emerging markets pack with a long term perspective karun marwah head of international business at motilal oswal financial services said any trade war like this brings lots of volatility with it investors from north america like to see substitution towards a market like india where they perceive lesser volatility and which is not subject to the vagaries of trade war with the us chinese capitalists may also look at india if things worsen he said overseas brokerage ubs earlier this month said india has not been able to gain much from the trade war and managed only a marginal growth from the increment that it was already witnessing from usual diversification away from china a majority 37 per cent of fund managers who took part in a recent bofa merrill lynch global fund manager survey rated trade war as the biggest tail risk for markets followed by china slowdown 16 per cent and us politics 12 per cent leading indian industrialist and mahindra group chairman anand mahindra on wednesday said a wave of chinese investment to india may be imminent in the wake of intensifying trade war between the us and china even if they settle a chinese firm with large exports to the us would be wise to hedge and invest in a subsidiary in india and transfer its scale manufacturing skills he said in a tweet sher mehta director of macroeconomic research and econometrician virtuoso economics says chinese investment in india is likely to rise and oil prices might be capped due to escalation of trade war which could be positives for india s current account deficit the rupee and inflation he said select commodity exports and industries like chemicals lubricants mobile phone makers and readymade garments will also benefit the ongoing trade tensions one space where india could truly benefit is china s commodities market indian exports to china in this category can be a lucrative proposition given that us exports a substantial amount of commodities to china we can tap export opportunities in corn oranges wheat and certain dry fruit varieties to china india has additional duty concessions compared to other countries under the mfn most favoured nation status of apta agreement said mehta meanwhile if china allows yuan to depreciate against the us dollar to reduce the impact of higher import duties it may impact other emerging market currencies including the rupee oza believes that if yuan is allowed to depreciate then there could be same kind of depreciation in other emerging market currencies which could be beneficial for india s export driven sectors the rupee is already hovering around its two and a half month low of 70 51 against the dollar due to foreign fund outflows and renewed worries over rising crude oil prices brokerage icicidirect com said crude oil above 70 is likely to keep the rupee appreciation in check a move in the chinese yuan would also be a key trigger for emerging market currencies including the rupee in the backdrop of renewed escalation in trade tensions
sen elizabeth warren is swinging for the fences with her policy platform the democratic presidential contender from massachusetts has a sweeping agenda to deal with things like student debt affordable housing child care the racial wealth gap and more it also includes taxes levied on the richest americans a big new wealth tax a new corporate profits tax and a hike in the estate tax of course any genuinely ambitious agenda is also going to attract a swarm of mainstream worrywarts various experts told the washington post they re concerned the rich will evade warren s taxes that her plans will balloon the debt and that her taxes will slow economic growth none of these concerns are particularly persuasive and ironically they completely miss the one big macroeconomic issue that could trip

news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up according to conventional market economic thought taxing the wealth people build up is something you should do as little as possible if you tax savings you ll get less savings michael strain an economist at the right wing american enterprise institute told the post that will hurt investment which will hurt productivity and that will hurt wages but the standard economic story is wrong the connection between savings and investment is actually extremely tenuous most of the money businesses use to grow comes from either their own revenue or from bank financing now you might argue that bank loans are provided by other people s bank savings but that s not right either when a bank makes a loan it s creating the money out of nothing we talk about the government s money issuing powers as residing with the federal reserve but it s more accurate to say the central bank manages national money creation most of which is undertaken by the private banking system banks are profit driven firms that make loans based on how much revenue they think they ll get back on the loans which is determined by the potential of the investment in question when banks take savings in from customers that alters their portfolio which can marginally increase their profits but they don t need customers money to make loans the mainstream argument that investment not consumption is the core driver of economic growth and thus should be taxed less is backwards without consumption there is nothing for investment to pursue and the stronger consumption is the stronger investment will be thus warren s taxes will not hurt economic growth what about the national debt as i mentioned the u s government is the source of all dollars even mainstream economists acknowledge this but they tend to avoid fleshing out the consequences if the u s government can never run out of dollars it can never suffer a debt crisis it can always pay its debt obligations and those payments will never crowd out other government programs interest payments on government debt are themselves spending into the economy which could be inflationary in theory but in practice the distribution of who actually owns most government bonds makes this possibility highly unlikely even if warren s plan does add to the debt that s not a big deal next are the concerns with tax evasion which have more bite to them tax evasion by the wealthy is a real problem and wealth taxes like warren s are much more vulnerable to it wealth involves a lot of assets like stock real estate and ownership stakes in private businesses that fluctuate with the market and don t really have a defined dollar value until they re sold assessing that potential value on a year to year basis is a lot more conceptually complicated than measuring people s income at the same time there isn t really a policy fix for this problem the two main challenges are lack of enforcement and the tendency of politicians to give into lobbyists and blow new holes in the tax code the solutions to both problems are really just political will from congress and the president sustained over time the best warren can do is create as tight a tax proposal as possible in the here and now gabriel zucman one of the foremost experts on tax evasion by the wealthy told the post that warren s plan is specifically designed in a way that limits tax evasion allowing no exemptions increasing enforcement by the irs and imposing heavy fines on people who try to skirt the tax by undervaluing assets hiding their wealth abroad or renouncing their u s citizenship also the underlying reason people worry about tax evasion is that warren would bring in less revenue than she predicts and thus the national debt would increase but as we ve already noted more government debt is basically a non issue finally what s the other problem that could be a real issue for warren s plan it takes us back to that point about the u s government being the source of all u s dollars the assumption is that taxes need to match spending dollar for dollar because the money from the first flows into the second that is indeed how it works for state or local governments but not for the federal government it doesn t need to get the money from anywhere what the federal government needs to do is manage the economy make sure it doesn t overheat it or leave us in a permanent semi slump the purpose of federal taxes is to remove demand from the economy and make room for more spending to keep the economy on an even keel the wrinkle is that the wealthy spend way less of their income than the poor and the middle class therefore one dollar taken from or given to the poor and the middle class removes or adds significantly more demand than the same dollar taken from or given to the wealthy taxing the wealthy still removes demand from the economy but not as much per dollar because warren s taxes are focused on that population but her spending is much broader even if she matches both dollar for dollar she still might not remove enough demand and wind up driving the economy closer to overheating but then that could also be a good thing despite our low unemployment rate most indicators from the economy suggest we re still a ways off from full capacity warren has room to maneuver demand wise and after decades of semi slumps leading to wage stagnation and rising inequality a bit of overheating could be just what we need
ottawa the bank of canada left its key interest rate steady wednesday as it looked to balance mounting evidence of a domestic economic pickup against the expanding risks of international trade conflicts the central bank kept its trend setting rate at 1 75 per cent and governor stephen poloz appeared to be in no hurry to make a move even as he pointed to economic improvements at home the bank said in a statement that there s accumulating evidence the economy has been re emerging in the second quarter of this year following a period when economic growth nearly came to a halt overall recent data have reinforced governing council s view that the slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019 was temporary said the bank which was widely expected to stick with a rate that s been in place for seven months several recent economic indicators have been unexpectedly robust the central bank said data has shown the oil sector is beginning to recover the national housing market is stabilizing and job growth remains strong the numbers it added also point to growth in consumer spending exports and business investment however the economy also faces expanding trade risks the bank said following the escalation of international conflicts and chinese restrictions on canadian goods that are already having direct effects on exports a bilateral diplomatic dispute that has festered for several months has led china to block some shipments of canola pork and other products from canada the trade dispute between the united states and china the world s two largest economies and canada s top two trading partners could have a big effect on the canadian economy other details of canada s trade picture were seen as positives the bank said the removal of steel and aluminum tariffs as well as encouraging signs the updated north american free trade agreement is moving closer to ratification will help canadian exports and investment taking these factors into consideration the bank of canada said the current policy level is appropriate governing council will remain data dependent and especially attentive to developments in household spending oil markets and the global trade environment the statement said the bank of canada has been cautious with the interest rate due to the accumulation of high levels of household debt which has built up after years of very low borrowing costs many experts expect the central bank to leave its key interest rate untouched until at least late in the year and perhaps longer some have predicted a rate cut will come before the next increase frances donald head of macroeconomic strategy with manulife asset management said the bank appears increasingly optimistic about the economy at home the biggest challenge right now she added is tied to all the uncertainty in the world economy those global trade concerns could derail the domestic economy in canada said donald who expects the bank of canada to leave the interest rate unchanged until the international trade issues sort themselves out the bank of canada just like all economists is wrestling what to do when the domestic economy looks much better but the global economy looks worse bmo chief economist douglas porter wrote in a report following wednesday s announcement that it seems like the bank has settled in for a long pause on the interest rate and gave every indication that the bar is very high for a move in either direction the next rate decision is scheduled for july 10 when the bank will also release its updated economic forecasts in its quarterly monetary policy report canada will receive another important piece of information friday with the release of its economic growth report for the first quarter last month the weaker economic data led poloz to set aside talk of rate increases the sudden down shift over the winter caused mostly by a drop in oil prices forced the central bank to cut its 2019 growth forecast the reduction came after the economy ran at close to full tilt for most of 2017 and 2018 a stretch that saw poloz hike the interest rate five times

the origins of the trade war can be traced to campaign promises trump made to go after china over its large trade surplus with the united states which he attributed to currency manipulation the argument was that by intervening in currency markets buying up u s dollars china was propping up the value of the dollar against its own currency this makes chinese goods and services relatively cheaper to u s consumers and makes u s goods more expensive to chinese purchasers the net effect is to increase u s imports of chinese goods and reduce u s exports to china thereby leading to a large trade deficit while most economists now acknowledge that china was intervening in currency markets in the last decade they did not acknowledge the currency intervention at the time they insist that this is no longer an issue china is no longer a large net buyer of dollar denominated assets so the argument goes therefore it is not currently keeping down the value of its currency against the dollar as i have argued elsewhere this argument ignores the effect of china holding well in excess of 3 trillion worth of dollar denominated assets its decision to hold a massive stock of dollar assets depresses the value of the chinese yuan against the dollar thereby maintaining the competitive advantage from a lower valued currency this is the same logic that applies with the fed s decision to hold trillions of dollars worth of assets that it acquired as part of its quantitative easing program even though the fed is not currently buying assets most economists argue that its holding of assets still works to keep down interest rates perhaps in the next decade they will acknowledge that the same relationship holds with china s massive stock of dollars and the relative value of the dollar and the yuan but for now they insist that currency intervention was only an issue in the past this is important background because currency values will directly affect our trade balance with china and thereby impact the number of manufacturing jobs in the united states while reducing the trade deficit will not get back most of the relatively high paying manufacturing jobs that were lost in the last decade it would likely still be a plus for relatively less educated workers who still rely on manufacturing as a source of higher paying jobs although currency is mostly off the table in trump s trade war intellectual property is very much on the table and here trump has the support of economists across the political spectrum who argue that he has a legitimate complaint even if they don t endorse his go it alone cowboy tactics the complaint is the china is not respecting our intellectual property this lack of respect takes two main forms one is simply not honoring the patents copyrights and trademarks of u s corporations the other is requiring technology transfers by u s corporations that locate operations in china this usually means taking on a domestic chinese company as a partner which will then gain expertise in the use of the u s company s technology it is very impressive how the bulk of the economics profession has been willing to legitimate the switch in focus of trump s trade war he had run around the country in his campaign denouncing china as a world class currency manipulator he pledged to take punitive actions against china for its currency practices on day one of his administration getting china to raise the value of its currency against the dollar actually would have provided some benefit to u s workers but now currency is off the table and we are fighting a trade war to protect our intellectual property if it s not obvious already it is not our intellectual property that trump and his bipartisan crew of economist cheerleaders are interested in protecting it is the intellectual property of large corporations like boeing ge pfizer and microsoft very few people in the united states are in a position where they have to worry about china using their patents or copyrights without compensation this is a real concern to many large u s corporations the question is whether it should be a concern to the rest of us most immediately the concerns of ordinary workers are likely to go in the opposite direction if companies like boeing and general electric don t have to worry about being forced to transfer technology to chinese companies when they outsource to china they will have more incentive to outsource to china that s about as straightforward as it gets instead of reducing our trade deficit in manufacturing goods this change is likely to increase it but this goes to an even deeper issue we have seen a massive increase in wage inequality over the last four decades most economists probably believe some version of the skills biased technical change story that new technologies have placed a greater premium on skills like math science and engineering while reducing the value of less educated workers trump s trade war gives us an insight into the real story it was not technology that led him to focus his efforts on protecting intellectual property to the neglect of currency issues it was a political decision made in response to the political power of the most affected groups and boeing ge and the rest have far more political power than the workers who labor in their factories or indeed less educated workers as a class trump and the political elites more generally are prepared to have a trade war to protect the intellectual property of large u s corporations and indirectly to benefit the more highly paid segment of the labor force they would not do the same to increase the employment and wage prospects for less educated workers the two thirds of the labor force without a college degree to be clear there is an issue that we should not be allowing china to take at no cost the technology that we spent hundreds of billions of dollars to develop that is a reasonable argument but that hardly implies that we need to force them to respect patent and copyright protection we need to ensure that china and other countries share in the cost of developing new technologies there are far more modern and efficient mechanisms than patent monopolies which are a relic of the medieval guild system while negotiating sharing mechanisms may be a difficult process it is not obviously more difficult than preserving the patent system president obama likely would have had the trans pacific partnership completed and approved by congress before he left office if it had not been for haggling over terms of drug patent related protections it is also important to recognize that we will likely have far more to gain from having access to china s technology than the other way around china is already far and away the global leader in clean technologies with as much installed solar and wind energy as the rest of the world combined and an electric car industry that now produces as many cars as all other countries put together china currently spends roughly the same share of its gdp on research and development as the united states its economy is already 25 percent larger than the us economy and will be more than twice as large in less than a decade rather than focusing on bottling up u s technology a forward thinking trade agenda would be focused on ensuring our access to chinese technology unfortunately trade policy is not crafted in the national interest it is crafted with the goal of making the rich richer this is what donald trump s trade war is all about and as is the case with so many other wars it is about working class people being forced to sacrifice by paying high tariffs to advance the goals of the rich this article is reprinted with permission from the center for economic and policy

democratic socialism has emerged from its longtime obscurity and marginality in the united states buoyed by a longtime oracle bernie sanders and a youthful rising star alexandria ocasio cortez negatively this development reflects a widespread recognition that global capitalism works only for a minority and is ecologically harmful positively the revival of the name attests that there is no substitute for the historic goal of democratizing economic power nor any common ground for progressive movements without it but no movement for democratic socialism can afford to ignore the ambiguous history of the struggle for it social democracy has created the world s most humane and generous social systems and it is battered and reeling almost everywhere that it exists needing an infusion of fighting democratic spirit in germany the social democratic party spd has capitulated to neo liberal capitalism and is habituated to its junior partner alliance with the conservative party albeit with co determined enterprises in sweden the social democratic party has disavowed its historic attempt to democratize major enterprises the meidner plan which folded in 1992 after a ten year run in britain the labour party has slightly revived by turning against its entire past generation of accommodation breaking the global economic oligarchy has never been more imperative but social democratic and worker parties are consumed by the battle to save the welfare states they created and no european socialist party has dismantled the culture of white supremacy in which it developed the struggle for economic democracy has been left to stubborn types who learn from the history and failures of social democracy every social democratic party is a reminder of the nineteenth century dream of democratic socialism a fully democratized society in which the people control the economy and government no group dominates any other and every citizen is free equal and included the founders of continental social democracy believed that capitalism is antagonistic toward democracy and socialism is intrinsically democratic many contended that a proletarian victory would make democracy possible others said that democracy is the road to socialism some said the sequence depended on circumstances social democrats puzzled that no socialist revolution occurred in an advanced capitalist society but when they founded the socialist international in 1889 they believed that socialist revolutions were inevitable democratic socialism and social democracy became different things because democratic socialists were wrong about socialist revolutions occurring in all advanced economies or any social democracy became synonymous with its political record something less daring and interesting than democratic socialism revisionism is always a response to this situation revising the democratic socialist idea and its politics democratic socialist and revisionist have been linked ever since eduard bernstein powerfully criticized orthodox marxism in 1898 99 but revisionism is not another name for democratic socialism revisionism names the periodic necessity of adjusting the socialist idea to real world circumstances in germany the revisionist watersheds were 60 years apart the bernstein controversy and the bad godesberg program of 1959 in sweden a similar watershed occurred in 1928 under per albin hansson who built a social democratic powerhouse in britain the parallel benchmarks came in 1955 and 1994 when hugh gaitskell and tony blair respectively took over the labour party each of these revisionist episodes was a creative response to a stagnant orthodoxy and a blow to the conviction that socialism names something definite and credible bernstein said the marxist ideology of the spd was less credible and democratic than the party s everyday reformist politics hansson committed swedish social democracy to the bernstein approach gaitskell and theorist politician c a r crosland sought to replace the fabian collectivism of the labour party with pluralistic economic democracy the godesberg program belatedly endorsed bernstein s critique of marxism and his emphasis on socialist ethical values blair replaced leftover fabianism with neo liberal opportunism advertised as new labour being open to revision is indispensable but also perilous for revisionism is linked historically to the loss of socialist conviction and fighting spirit charles fourier in france and robert owen in england propounded the original idea of socialism in the 1820s it was to achieve the unrealized demands of the french revolution which never reached the working class instead of pitting workers against each other a cooperative mode of production and exchange would allow workers to work for each other socialism was about reorganizing society as a cooperative community soon there were many kinds of socialism conceived by pierre joseph proudhon mikhail bakunin karl marx ferdinand lassalle georgi plekhanov karl kautsky sidney webb eduard bernstein rosa luxemburg v i lenin and g d h cole most of them blamed capitalism for all of society s ills but religious socialists did not so there were christian and jewish versions of every kind of socialism every kind of socialism retains the original idea of organizing society as a cooperative community yet there is no core that unites the many schools of socialism or democratic socialism and democracy is as complex and variable as socialism i believe that the best candidate for an essential something in democratic socialism is the ethical passion for social justice and radical democratic community this ethical impulse retains the original socialist idea in multiple forms playing out in struggles for freedom equality recognition and democratic commonwealth conceiving democracy in terms of the character of relationships in a society not mere voting rights no definition of socialism as economic collectivism or state control of the economy or any particular ownership scheme is common to the many traditions of socialist thought historically marxism played the leading role in reducing for many the idea of socialism to collective ownership marx taught that the structure of economic ownership determines the character of an entire society and socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production a sufficient condition for fulfilling the essential aspirations of human beings he developed the most powerful and illuminating critique of capitalism ever conceived inspiring numerous traditions of marxian criticism his focus on the factors of production and the structural capitalist tendency to generate crises of overproduction and crash made permanent contributions to socialist thought his achievement was so great that even non marxian traditions of socialism have to be understood in relationship to his thought but marx s dogmatic determinism catastrophe mentality and doctrine of proletarian dictatorship wrecked immense harm he developed his theory during an era in which democracy was merely a form of government and thus of low importance to him his denigration of moral everything obscured his own ethical wellspring and his fixation on collective ownership wrongly identified socialism with a totalizing goal every social democratic and workers party has a history of contention over these issues the name democratic socialism conveys this history self consciously marxists contended that capitalism had to be abolished before real democracy would be possible they denigrated democracy as bourgeois hypocritical and not the point compelling democratic socialists to name themselves self consciously to democratic socialists it was unacceptable to say that democracy and liberal rights were secondary values that would emerge from a socialist revolution socialists had to be democratic and liberal on their way to achieving socialism dictatorship of the proletariat was repugnant even as hyperbolic motivational rhetoric for socialism had nothing to do with disallowing the bourgeoisie from voting this was already the majority position among spd members when bernstein rocked the spd in 1898 99 he became the symbol of democratic socialism among continental social democrats because he was a hero of the spd and a guardian of its marxist orthodoxy during the party s glory years of persecution and ascension then bernstein espoused the democratic socialist alternative to orthodox marxism with historic distinction england had no bernstein figure until the 1950s because england had deep traditions of cooperative christian and ethical socialism it had no significant traditions of marxism or anarchism and it lacked even a workers party until 1893 robert owen founded cooperative communities that wiped out his manufacturing wealth launched a national union movement that perished and inspired a rich british tradition of cooperative organizing frederick denison maurice an anglican theologian and founder of christian socialism taught that cooperation is the moral law of the divine order and producer cooperatives are the economic basis of a good society william morris an epic poet and romantic utopian novelist wrote brilliant propaganda for the socialist league until it turned anarchist in the 1890s and he resigned in disgust all contended eloquently that socialism is an ethical vision of a cooperative society christian socialism and secular ethical socialism ascended together in england in the 1880s the supposed ever upward climb of the world s first industrial power had stopped prices began falling in england in the mid 1870s and kept falling into the early 1890s railway construction ran out of territory and shipbuilding passed through an overproduction phase absolute output kept expanding in england but growth decelerated just as the german and u s economies rapidly industrialized germany and the united states had newer equipment and technology and did better at developing human capital both nations raced past england in making steel the key to the next great wave of industrialization economic historians subsequently debated whether england had a great depression in the 1880s or merely a bad recession to the late victorians who lived through it the depression seemed fully great and crushing they had never experienced structural unemployment now unemployment became an everyday concept something integral to the economic order liberal politicians had no answer for it and the unemployed protested in the streets demanding the right to a job christian socialism in the 1860s had retreated to worker education and support work for cooperatives now it revived dramatically it ministered to the urban poor quoted maurice surged into oxford and created a dozen new organizations it had a sprinkling of congregational baptist quaker and unitarian leaders but was overwhelmingly anglo catholic espousing a sacramental vision of cooperative commonwealth some anglican socialists were stubbornly cooperative in the owen and maurice mode some joined the fabian movement after it arose in 1884 many joined the social union reformers who came out of oxford some gave higher priority to socializing land than socializing industry many joined the independent labour party ilp or one of its religious affiliates after the ilp was founded in 1893 and some became leaders of the guild socialist movement that took off in 1912 long before the fledgling ilp morphed into the labour party in 1906 british clerics were accustomed to an active role in socialist politics taking positions on state funding for cooperatives the merits of marxism and fabianism whether england needed a workers party and how to oppose british imperialism after the labour party was founded they still did meanwhile the fabian society became a powerhouse of middle class state socialism fabian ringleaders sidney webb beatrice webb and george bernard shaw advocated evolutionary socialization based on cultural progress and the growing reach of government britain they said did not need marx s glorification of revolutionary violence or his exotic doctrines all it needed was to proceed on its present course of gradual collectivism this process was relentless beneficial and civilizing it tamed the predatory impulses of capitalism by making society rational socialism was government collectivism directed by elite managers that is fabians the fabian society fought internally over the importance and reach of socialist values there were constant battles for the soul of fabian socialism because the webbs and shaw did not let socialist morality intrude on their racism colonial conceits bureaucratic rationality and political opportunism many ethical socialists resigned from the fabian society after it refused to condemn the boer war others subsequently resigned when the webbs campaigned for eugenics legislation this long running battle escalated in 1906 when dissident fabians began to convert to guild socialism meanwhile the webbs joined the labour party in 1914 and in 1918 sidney webb crafted its constitution the labour constitution had four planks full employment and a living wage common ownership of industry progressive taxation and surplus spending for the common good clause four demanding common ownership of the means of production distribution and exchange defined the party for 42 years and formally for 35 years after that it did not say that socialization means nationalization clause four was consistent with guild socialism worker ownership consumer cooperatives municipal ownership competitive public enterprises and mixed forms of these models but nationalization was popular in 1918 and demanded for the coalmines and railways to some nationalization was the preferred mode of socialization to many including sidney webb it was the only one that mattered in common usage socialism came to mean nationalization notwithstanding that state socialism was the historical latecomer aside from germany fabian socialists sealed this outcome in britain during the very period that an upsurge of guild socialists ardently fought the equation of socialism with nationalization after the guild socialists lost they had to settle for keeping the worst parts of fabianism out of labour politics guild socialism was a blend of syndicalism fabian theory christian socialism and medieval guild nostalgia usually without citing marx although it had key affinities with marxism syndicalism the idea that unions should run the economy and whatever government might exist in a revolutionary society had a rich history in french labor unions and significant movements in italy spain france and the usa but it had a marginal status in scotland and england under syndical leaders james connolly and tom mann as british workers spurned the rhetoric of overthrow guild socialism played out differently by playing down the syndical fantasy of one big strike former fabians s g hobson and arthur penty dissident fabians a r orage g d h cole holbrook jackson and william mellor and anglican socialists maurice b reckitt conrad noel p e t widdrington and young r h tawney said that socialism should be about worker self determination not building a collectivist government the productive life of the nation should be organized and operated by self governing democratic organizations embracing all workers in every industry and service these national guilds would emerge from the existing union movement the guilds would organize industry but not own it they would be owned by the state which provided the capital while the guilds produced the goods guild socialism attracted christian socialists from the maurice tradition ethical socialists from the morris tradition followers of roman catholic author hilaire belloc who wanted to recreate the medieval guild economy and disciples of anglo catholic political theorist j n figgis a guild pluralist for a decade the guild socialist movement fired the radical wing of the labour party and made britain seem less exceptional it was variously for and against world war i but agreed that the real war was against capitalism the guild socialists wrote a profusion of books campaigned in churches and trade unions and founded a national guilds league that was funded by the labour party albeit while antagonizing labour officials now even british socialists fought over worker self government versus state socialism cole reckitt and s g hobson were the guild ringleaders writing wonky policy books and spirited propaganda then the bolshevik revolution frightened the political class the economy crashed in the early 1920s the guild movement lost its financial basis in the party and the season for exotic experiments ended cole and reckitt were crestfallen but adjusted to normal labour politics the social credit movement of c h douglas morphed out of guild socialism but was very tame by comparison tawney meanwhile became britain s leading socialist by espousing a christian ethical version of fabian ideology tawney and his closest friend and ally theologian william temple caught christian socialism during its early twentieth century heyday at oxford both were deeply involved in worker education during their early careers temple took a clerical track and tawney was a budding historical economist when world war i began he doubted that england was worth defending but joined the army and was nearly killed in battle returning to england as a war hero he argued that it needed to become a society worth defending tawney helped webb write the labour constitution and had strong feelings about what it did not mean it did not mean that all enterprises should be socialized or that nationalization was the preferred mode of socialization tawney had opposed nationalizing anything until 1918 then he swung to the fabian approach because nationalization was the only solution to the coal crisis he already belonged to the fabian society sidney webb was his friend guild socialism faded tawney was pragmatic the labour party was home to him and he adored beatrice webb he treasured the webbs even after they became apologists for stalinism tawney s books had perfect pitch for his audience and time three of them acquired scriptural status for british socialists the acquisitive society 1920 argued that capitalism turned decent people into shallow consumers and materialists religion and the rise of capitalism 1926 charged that capitalism trivialized christian ethics and ruined the field of economics equality 1931 expounded tawney s basic principles all human beings possess divinely imprinted equal worth and dignity socialism is moral and democratic freedom and equality go together inequality curtails liberty tawney said that inequality was practically a religion in england to eradicate it the nation had to abolish inherited wealth and transform the school system he did not write about racism which he considered a negligible issue in britain or feminism as he had no feminist impulse or imperialism as he believed that british imperialism was inadvertent misguided merely commercial and not so bad a good labour government would surely relieve england of its unfortunate empire tawney was an apostle of the claim that england needed to abolish its actual religion class rule class thwarts the flourishing of human fellowship tawney conceived democratic socialism as a cure for privilege and tyranny the two essential features of capitalism privilege is a function of interrelated social and economic power usually as a byproduct of wealth converting to social power and tyranny is a function of the distribution of power equality is the antidote to privilege and democratizing power is the antidote to tyranny democratic socialism makes it possible for human fellowship to flourish by democratizing economic and social power tawney argued that a good society respects people for what they are not for what they own it provides for all children what parents want for their children it respects all people and feels awe toward none it abolishes the reverence for wealth by abolishing the existence of an upper class it spurns all forms of authority that breed arrogance in a privileged class and subservience in a dominated class authority must rest on consent and power is tolerable only to the extent it is accountable to the public this version of democratic socialist aspiration was carefully vague and mid level fusing tawney s christian ethical principles to fabian politics socialism was universal to tawney he believed that everyone should be a socialist and that his role was to enunciate unifying ethical principles and values tawney did not contribute to the labour party s intense debates of the 1930s over fabian versus keynesian strategy labour leaders clement attlee herbert morrison and economist hugh dalton described socialism in technocratic terms as the solution to systemic breakdown waste and the rule of economic royalists to them economic planning was direct and physical downplaying any reliance on the price mechanism the state took direct control of the major means of production in order to carry out its social and economic goals creating an efficient society labour economists e f m durbin james meade douglas jay and hugh gaitskell countered that labour needed to take more from john maynard keynes than from webb showing that only socialists were capable of enacting the best liberal ideas to them economic planning meant macroeconomic management using fiscal and monetary policies to manipulate aggregate demand positively the goal was to achieve full employment on a noninflationary basis negatively it was to keep nationalization to a minimum neither side in public said the other was flat wrong each side appropriated aspects of the other approach making it possible for labour documents to offer a synthesis still the differences between direct control and macroeconomic management were steep and fateful it mattered which side got the upper hand to advocates of direct control the point was to supplant market forces by socializing the economy socialism itself was at stake and the wreckage of the depression provided ample reason to enact clause four to advocates of macroeconomic management what mattered was to achieve socialist ends something attainable by supplementing market forces and holding back inflation labour had to stop relying on clause four to define socialism and itself because nationalization is a very limited tool tawney supported attlee out of personal loyalty and subsequently joined attlee in concluding reluctantly that britain would have to fight germany again labour played a significant role in winston churchill s coalition government during world war ii meanwhile morrison temple and liberal fabian sociologist william beveridge developed historic reconstruction proposals and britons entrusted labour with reconstruction after the war ended electing attlee as prime minister the attlee governments of 1945 1951 transformed britain into a social democracy labour made health care a fundamental right for all citizens nationalized one fifth of the economy significantly increased the incomes of wage earners sustained the full employment economy that the war created instituted a steeply progressive income tax and a pension system abolished anti union laws abolished restrictions on the rights of women to own property established a minimum wage for agricultural workers and got colonial britain out of india pakistan burma myanmar ceylon sri lanka and palestine the labour governments substantially democratized british society and politics lifting equality to a social value and broke the stranglehold of british colonialism they made huge gains for equality of opportunity and condition carrying out exactly what they promised even as britain reeled from the massive losses it suffered in the war tawney celebrated the transformation and took warranted pride in contributing to it on the other hand labour tried and failed to break britain s concentration of wealth and labour did not even try to democratize the culture and management of nationalized industries boasting of doing nothing in 1951 half of britain s wealth was still held by 1 percent of the population the party s long simmering divide over direct control versus macroeconomic planning roiled labour through its glory years of governance and for a decade following morrison conducted a fabled bonfire of controls in 1948 terminating wartime controls over industry transport and prices that many left wing socialists wanted to keep the labour government touted its achievements in technocratic terms that obscured for many the party s ethical moorings as a vehicle of social justice many britons accused labour of squandering the british empire an emotional charge that compelled labour leaders to rely on efficiency arguments downplaying moral claims that cut no ice with accusers the party spent enormous energy and political capital creating a welfare state over believing the fabian doctrine that every act of collectivization is a worthy end in itself attlee s technocratic style kept moral and ideological arguments to a minimum and his success exhausted labour s agenda in remarkably short order the nationalization list shrank to nothing and labour was left with rearguard battles over its achievements by 1950 the party s official shopping list was down to a handful of industries water supply cement meat sugar refining and industrial insurance the following year there was no list trade unions opposed nationalization and the party seethed over its ideological disagreements soon the question shifted to whether labour should press for full orbed socialism getting rid of capitalism was it a socialist party if it stuck with a social democratic agenda of reforming capitalism the labour mainstream led by morrison settled for defending the party s achievements the labour leftwing led by aneurin bevan pressed for more nationalization gaitskell c a r crosland and for a while richard crossman countered that morrison versus bevan was the wrong debate being backward looking industrial ownership no longer mattered very much because the new class of corporate managers and government bureaucrats ran the world anyway the new task of socialism was to transform an increasingly managerial order into a society defined by democratic socialist values labour socialism had to be pluralistic experiment with decentralized models of socialization accept the mixed economy and emphasize its ethical socialist ideals crosland wrote the bible of the revisionist movement the future of socialism 1957 crossman cushioned the blow to fabian pride by titling his movement reader new fabian essays 1952 gaitskell won the party leadership but lost the 1959 election and died three years later at the age of 56 meanwhile crossman reverted to fabian orthodoxy which at least had ideological starch and a mass base today the revisionist upsurge of the 1950s is remembered chiefly for discrediting fabian orthodoxy and not for its creative attempt to rethink democratic socialism the revisionists had many ideas but no big idea to replace the one they discredited after which they were remembered for failing to realign labour politics they said forcefully and correctly that the fabian mentality was too bureaucratic and managerial tawney cringed when they said it forcefully since that disparaged historic labour achievements but he supported the gaitskell revisionists fabian socialism though remarkably successful convinced too many people that socialism is about nationalizing major enterprises replacing that belief with a richer ethical culturally pluralistic decentralized and radically democratic socialism would take a generation or so they said sixty years later the labour party is still working on it while refighting the battle over clause four party leader jeremy corbyn has rallied the party with a desperately needed fighting spirit what he would do in power is much less clear william temple while serving as archbishop of canterbury in the early 1940s keenly understood that defending the indispensable gains of social democracy is not enough during the period that temple morrison and beveridge conceived the british welfare state temple wrote books advocating a socialized monetary system social use of land and economic democracy he was incredulous that citizens of modern democracies tolerated big private banks imploring that the process of investment is too important to be ceded to private bankers he tried to restore the land issue to its former prominence in christian socialism describing rent like henry george in the 1880s as a toll levied by monopoly since god created the land for everyone and society creates the increment in the value of land the increment should go to society the key to creating a just society is to tax the increment of land values appropriating the unearned value temple said he saw no reason why anyone should be paid large sums of money for merely owning the land on which our cities are built george was never refuted on this point only defeated whereupon socialists wrongly dropped the subject lastly temple had a guild socialist proposal that abjured wonky blueprints he called for an excess profits tax payable in the form of shares to worker funds that gradually gained democratic control over enterprises in the 1970s german and swedish unions pushed hard for this idea with no mention of temple in sweden it was called the meidner plan and enacted in 1982 big business and the financial class fought it assiduously for eight years the charter ran out in 1990 social democrats lost the 1991 election and conservatives wound up the social funds the following year that marked another sad ending for guild socialism terminating the last significant program for economic democracy at the national level when british and german socialists revised democratic socialism in the late 1950s the story to many was that they betrayed socialism this judgment defined socialism too simply but it rightly caught that the struggle for economic democracy demands a fighting spirit otherwise selling out is very much the issue the labour party and spd went on to become so deeply integrated into welfare state capitalism that it was hard to see socialist aspiration in either of them later it was undeniably left behind in both party mainstreams the same thing happened in sweden where unions pushed for the meidner plan and social democrats gave it only timorous support preferring to consolidate the welfare state then economic globalization threw every social democratic and workers party on the defensive the struggle for economic democracy has been left to the stubborn types in the back rows i am against giving up on national scale strategies but also against identifying economic democracy solely with them democratic socialism expands the cooperative public bank and social market sectors mixes various modes of social ownership dismantles white privilege male privilege and heterosexual privilege repudiates eurocentric presumptions and upholds ethical commitments to freedom equality community and ecological flourishing it is far more complex and unwieldy than the supposedly inevitable outcomes that marxists and fabians predicted economic democracy is the heart of democratic socialism and the test of its ambition for social justice above all it is an ethic of radical democratic struggle

educators in honduras have been on a general strike since thursday and university students doctors and nurses have carried out demonstrations and partial strikes since may 20 against the government of juan orlando hernández joh of the national party pnh all regions of the country have seen roadblocks marches and university occupations including a march of tens of thousands of people monday and tuesday in the country s capital tegucigalpa virtually all have been met with violent repression by the honduran police and military this follows an initial week of strikes that began on april 26 against two proposed reforms aimed at privatizing health care pensions and education the reforms are dictated by the international monetary fund imf and involve expedited budget cuts and mass layoffs on monday night a large contingent of demonstrators protested in front of the us embassy in tegucigalpa in an acknowledgement that the social attacks imposed by the honduran ruling class originate in wall street boardrooms and in washington dc amid a growing resurgence of the class struggle including among tens of thousands of us teachers fighting in defense of public education the honduran trade unions and the opposition parties have done everything possible to keep workers from appealing to their class brothers and sisters across the region and particularly the united states for a common political struggle against social austerity militarization and corporate attacks led by us imperialism on may 21 as the protest movement reached new proportions the trade union of public education employees siempe and the honduran medical association convoked a national assembly of departmental platforms for the defense of health and education as a negotiating table to contain the protests and channel them behind talks with the ruling national party the corporate media along with the student and pseudo left organizations including those that orbit the ostensible opposition party libre have promoted the president of the medical association dr suyapa figueroa as the spokeswoman of the protests citing her vocal condemnations of the social crisis in an interview with cnn last friday for instance figueroa said the health care system has not been able to perform surgeries there have been instances of no water for developing x rays no water at operating rooms to wash one s hands she soon added however that the protest movement was apolitical and that this struggle has a lot of people that belong to the ruling party which is only natural and they are supporting us the government however has made clear that it will respond to any challenge to the interests of the honduran and international financial elites in a totally uncompromising and ruthless fashion the corresponding ministers announced yesterday sanctions and firings against teachers along with criminal charges against medical personnel and the hiring of replacement scabs a new criminal code that went into effect may 15 criminalizes demonstrations in the broadest terms with up to four years in prison and 15 years for leaders or promoters it also establishes a prison term of 3 to 10 years for carrying out abortions during the last week teachers have repeatedly denounced to reporters and in social media the presence of the tigres special forces participating in the repression against demonstrations national police officers and the lethal tigres were recorded accompanying a plainclothes agent on monday unsuccessfully trying to kidnap two teachers seeking refuge at a restaurant in the town of santa cruz de yojoa on april 29 a plainclothes police officer shot a teacher protester in tegucigalpa with live ammunition the honduran special forces deployed against workers and youth were trained by the us green berets for urban combat in 2015 the us army described their training many periods of instruction focused on instilling fundamental principles of close quarters battle and knowing how to execute them amidst the chaos that is combat the commander of the us 7th special forces group in charge of the training col christopher riga declared during the graduation i promise you at some point in time together we ll be on target killing terrorists and drug traffickers together the last decade has been marked by deadly military and police crackdowns against mass antigovernment protests and activists in honduras to resist the dramatic deterioration of living standards this escalation of the police state measures to enforce social attacks has proven to be the purpose of the military coup orchestrated by the democratic party administration of barack obama in june 2009 to topple president manuel zelaya emails released in 2010 by wikileaks showed that the state department under hillary clinton backed the coup and used the organization of american states to undermine opposition by other governments it is the preparation of new imperialist crimes including the continued backing of the murderous regime in tegucigalpa that is fueling the ongoing persecution by washington of wikileaks founder julian assange and the jailing of the former army specialist who leaked those diplomatic cables chelsea manning the honduran congress approved the education and health care bills after a month of negotiations between the regime and the international monetary fund imf which finally agreed to a two year deal involving a credit line and policies to improve the framework of macroeconomic policies elevate the quality of public spending and strengthen the rule of law the immediate step announced by the chief imf negotiator esteban vesperoni was a 311 million loan to the honduran government partially to rescue the state owned national electric company enee ironically this money will facilitate the implementation of the structural electric sector law which privatized the distribution of electricity in 2014 vesperoni also ordered revising the contract with the empresa energía honduras eeh to incorporate the necessary incentives in 2016 in the words of eeh general manager german garcía the whole distribution network of the country was given in a trust to ficohsa and we won the bid the example of enee spells the fate for the still unannounced measures regarding health care and education the latest loan adds to hundreds of millions more flushed by the imf in this period through the bankrupt enee the privatization of which has channeled vast wealth to the honduran and international financial elite handing out slices to wall street creditors through the imf other beneficiaries include ficohsa owner and honduran billionaire camilo atala as well as colombian magnate william vélez the majority owner of eeh through his grupo ethuss one of the other uses for these funds has also been expanding the honduran military which became a top debtor of enee in the final analysis the working class has paid the cost through more than 2 000 layoffs and other concessions at enee as well as constant hikes of the electricity rates thousands more have been fired under the hernández administration in the aqueduct and sewer authority sanaa honduran telecommunications hondutel the national port company the state tax agency dei and other public agencies as part of the escalated drive of privatizations and social cuts dictated by the imf the government has denied that the education and health care bills will result in mass layoffs but it has openly stated their goal saving 300 million the bulk of which will go to servicing the public debt to financial vultures and building up the repressive apparatus the wreckage of the health care system including the outward stealing of hundreds of millions of dollars by the pnh regime under porfirio lobo has led to thousands of unnecessary deaths while feeding the business of private clinics while expanding the ranks of the super rich in honduras the effects for most of the population have been calamitous with the poverty rate increasing more than 10 percent since the 2009 coup to roughly 70 percent of the population economists at the national autonomous university unah predicted that 110 000 more people will fall below the official poverty line this year despite the brutal repression by the honduran state the struggles against these intolerable conditions which in turn fuel thousands of yearly killings from gang warfare will only grow larger and more militant hundreds of thousands of educators doctors students other workers and peasants from honduras and the region continue to seek safer and better conditions for themselves and their families by migrating north in the face of the anti immigrant policies by both democratic and republican administrations that have culminated in the militarization of the border squalid detention camps family separation and the gradual destruction of asylum rights by the trump white house the number of apprehensions at the us mexico border mostly of migrants from northern central america topped 100 000 per month in march and april nearly doubling the record highs in 2014
the great depression the great depression was one of the longest depressions in history what made this stand out from the rest was its endurance and geographical spread it lasted for more than three years it originated in the united states but engulfed many countries most of them lost up to 15 per cent of their gross domestic product in the united states particularly interest rates dropped to low levels a depression directly or indirectly affects all walks of society the unemployment rose to 25 per cent wages for workers who still had jobs fell and the us gdp fell to a half this led to global financial distress that had significant geopolitical ramifications times like these require strong leadership the world needed a hero franklin d roosevelt tried to become one the most important skill required of leaders during times like this is effective communication and a capacity to sell hope this is because a recession is exacerbated and triggered by a loss of confidence in the economy roosevelt knew the strategy which his predecessor didn t he literally talked the united states out of this crisis he started a series of radio talks where he addressed several problems of the economy roosevelt gave people hope and strategy to fight this depression in addition to moral support he created jobs provided unemployment insurance and allowed unionization these programmes have survived malaysia malaysia is one of the most successful non western countries to achieve a relatively smooth transition to modern economic growth over the past decade malaysia is a major supplier of primary products to the industrialized countries such as tin timber rubber liquefied natural gas and palm oil the malaysian economy advanced 4 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 malaysia had a financial crisis in 1997 where their ringgit exchange rate fell from rm 2 42 to 4 88 to the us dollar this resulted in a heavy outflow of foreign capital the government imposed strict regulations and tried to curb the outflow of capital the ringgit was curbed to 3 80 against the us dollar after depreciation malaysia in its moment of crisis understood the importance of effective bankruptcy laws the government managed to create additional courts and made regulations to restructure firms financials as a result of this companies were able to reorganize their assets this proved very fruitful and within two years financial distress of the firms was resolved additionally the government stopped the operation of illegal share markets instead of having a lot of shares registered in the name of a handful of nominee companies the stock exchange made it mandatory to register the shares in the names of beneficiary owners a recovery in the stock markets followed immediately china the chinese economy advanced 6 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 china had to face the brunt of the global financial crisis of 2008 the us and europe were forced to cut back on consumption and the demand for chinese goods plunged to overcome the financial crisis china took the simplest of steps first they stimulated the domestic demand by enhancing public expenditure by introducing a stimulus package of 4 trillion yuan the government reduced taxes pushed vat reforms business tax cuts and raised the threshold of individual income taxes rigorous steps were taken that involved cutting down the interest rates and quota control on lending by commercial banks was removed the bank reserve requirement ratios were lowered and china managed to inject a huge amount of liquidity to the banking system we understand that the economic crisis in pakistan is bad but the world has seen worse and gotten it what needs to be done first and foremost an increase in direct taxation is the key as opposed to increasing the general sale tax this will help alleviate the inflationary pressure on the general public without affecting tax collection the government should turn its focus on improving quality control units so that people buy local products as opposed to products from multi national companies this will avoid foreign exchange leakage and promote local industries a country cannot buy success from outside it has to be developed internally secondly the government should strengthen the financial and regulatory authorities through the appointment of competent leadership and minimize all sorts of political interference the state bank of pakistan must be given functional autonomy there are several benefits to having an independent and competent regulator thirdly the government should modernize the financial system to combat tax evasion and money laundering the high fiscal deficit in pakistan is due to low tax collection rates black markets have taken over and continue to siphon off wealth abroad these markets are responsible for creating an imbalance between the supply and demand for dollars lastly the government should spend more on education rather than cutting the annual budget for it pakistan lacks scientists and academics business friendly policies should be formed to encourage people to invest in pakistan pakistan has great potential the government needs to convince the market to harness that potential once it has done that the rupee will be on the run and our balance of payment worries will end the writer is head of sales in bima mobile pakistan

us president donald trump has made huawei the biggest story in tech right now by banning it from doing business with us companies huawei china s tech champion has lost access to google s android and intel s chips and it s even seen other international partners like arm and panasonic bowing to american influence and discontinuing trade having previously been on track to becoming the world s biggest smartphone maker huawei is now in such dire straits that the best metaphor its founder could come up with to allay fears is that the company is like a plane with a hole in its side not doing great but still up in the air bludgeoning huawei with the ban hammer is by trump s own admission a negotiating tactic to focus china s attention on american discontent with the existing trade relationship between the two countries it lands atop a pile of punitive 25 percent tariffs he s imposed on many chinese imports to the us and a promised further round of such tariffs on practically every chinese export imaginable two expert china observers tell the verge that china very much cares about these restrictions on its most important overseas market and it has every incentive to respond whether to alleviate the sanctions or as a show of its own economic strength but both agree that china has few if any good options available veteran diplomat hosuk lee makiyama asks pointedly what does china have left to retaliate with it s already imposed tariffs on the few classes of goods for which it wants to protect its internal market and it s excluded american internet giants like google and facebook so what can china realistically threaten to do as a counter measure some observers such as ben thompson in stratechery note that china took the first shots in the present trade war when it threw out many us tech firms and it is now the us who is finally responding lowy institute s elliott zaagman has spent the past 10 years living in and observing china and he argues that the country s economic prosperity is more brittle than it first appears china s already at a point where growth rate is not an output it s an input meaning the government sets the goal it wants to hit each quarter and banks lend to hit that number beijing has done more monetary expansion he says than the us fed the bank of japan and the eu combined this has spawned a number of toxic asset bubbles such as in housing which has had trickle down consequences of people taking on debt backed by overpriced real estate talking to him and lee makiyama you get the sense that china s economy is closer to a pyramid scheme than a truly thriving and flourishing giant china is not quite the unstoppable force that it seems from a distance retaliation is particularly risky because china s economy relies on ever increasing trade with the world as evidenced by the massive belt and road initiative to develop land and sea routes for faster transport of goods and huawei though a privately held entity has been very helpful in procuring high value overseas business with its lead in network infrastructure 5g equipment and most recently premium smartphones lee makiyama notes that because the country lacks a social safety net it cannot afford to ever take its foot off the gas which is what the huawei setback inevitably represents economists he says have long held 6 5 percent economic growth as the threshold below which china can t dip if it s to sustain its growing debt and china reported 6 4 percent growth in the first quarter of 2019 before trump s harshest tariffs had taken effect it s in this context that we must look at china s apparently formidable arsenal of weapons it could deploy against the us there are also more sophisticated kinds of financial warfare china holds a trillion dollars of us debt which it could dump on global markets and thus trigger an interest rate spike for the us economy the washington post s robert j samuelson explains the mechanics of this succinctly however he argues that china would be doing almost as much harm to itself in the process a slowdown in the us economy would lead to even less appetite for chinese exports the us dollar might also go down in value and make chinese goods less appealing and whatever us treasuries china is left with would also be worth less this illustrates the inherent symbiosis between chinese production and american consumption which have together formed the backbone of the global economy over the past 20 years the most threatening retort since huawei was turned into a trade pawn by trump has been a visit by president xi jinping to a rare earths facility this was a wordless reminder of china s dominance in collecting and processing the rare earth minerals essential to every smartphone laptop hybrid car and practically anything more advanced than a gas oven the ceos of two us headphone manufacturers tell the verge that china is the only place to buy the neodymium magnets required for their products one said china is the sole source the other said it controls 95 percent of the market if you struggled to wait a few weeks for those sweet new powerbeats pro to go on sale try waiting months and months for an alternative source of magnets and yet as my colleague james vincent has already set out rare earths are not the secret weapon china imagines them to be they re not all that rare the response to beijing hoarding its supply would be production becoming economically viable and ramping up elsewhere and the ultimate outcome would be fewer jobs and fewer exports for china lee makiyama sees this as an untenable scenario and points to china s ill fated attempts to use rare earths as a trade cudgel in its dealings with japan and the us in the past both countries would suffer from severing their symbiotic relationship but china is more vulnerable to the effects finally and most obviously the chinese government could just do the tit for tat response of imposing sanctions on american businesses operating within its borders even with some older model iphone assembly in india the vast majority of apple s smartphone business is built on chinese land chipmakers are even more dependent as an analysis from hsbc finds that apple compatriot qualcomm has 65 percent of its revenue vulnerable to disruption in trade with china other us tech firms with similar exposure include broadcom at 54 percent micron at 51 percent and amd intel and texas instruments all pinning at least a quarter of their revenues on continuing trade with china us consumers can also be hit through impositions on brick and mortar retailers chinese imports account for 26 percent of walmart s merchandise which is on the low end compared to a more typical number like target s 34 percent according to ubs additional research by ubs says the trump administration s tariffs imposed on chinese imports could put 40 billion of sales and 12 000 stores at risk the american apparel footwear association calls the next round of tariffs a self inflicted wound that will be catastrophic for the nation s economy if tariffs are catastrophic what would a total ban from china look like this is arguably the most effective weapon beijing could wield in its negotiations with washington but the corresponding hit on chinese trade would be every bit as disastrous in lee makiyama s estimation no scenario that involves china cutting off or constricting business with the outside world will be palatable to the country economically even with its rapidly growing national consumer market china is still in need of more consumers for its goods and services and with apple and its compatriots like nike general motors and walmart employing millions of chinese workers trump has the leverage he needs to play hardball that situation won t last long the diplomat warns and now might prove to be the last good chance for the us to lean on the mutual dependency it has with china if the trade relationship remains as it is china will eventually grow its way to be colossal both as producer and consumer and then american influence would be null beijing was caught off guard by the brusqueness of trump s trade stance for the us what s at risk are company revenues and profits the country s broader economy may suffer but lee makiyama says few people would notice if the gdp growth rate dipped from 3 to 2 percent the same contraction for china s economy he contends and zaagman agrees would be disastrous this asymmetry is at the heart of why the trump administration can afford to be self destructive in its tariff regime while china cannot indulge in similar costs to score trade negotiation points huawei p30 pro photo vlad savov the verge the chinese government was definitely caught off guard by the brusqueness of trump s actions says zaagman which was not anticipated at all that might explain why beijing didn t make fuller or better contingency plans for a situation like today then again xi might find consolation in the fact that the same surprise must also be reverberating inside the offices of us tech giants as asia economic observer tony nash formerly of the economist intelligence group questions why american companies hadn t diversified their manufacturing sooner their lack of preparedness may give china some reassurance that hostilities won t escalate much beyond their current point without china firing back the damage has already been done and things will not be the same again without having a clear and coherent plan for its reaction which neither lee mikayama nor zaagman believe beijing is even close to right now the best strategy for china is to do nothing material and maintain a strong and silent posture which is exactly what the country is doing commenting only to say that it won t flinch

highlights slowing global growth rising trade tensions and soft inflation have led to expectations that the federal reserve s next move will be a rate cut rate cuts have typically coincided with recessions but not always the fed cut rates by 75 basis points in 1995 and again in 1998 taking out insurance against the possibility of an economic deterioration that ultimately proved successful in avoiding it these two instances offer some lessons as to what factors may push the central bank toward insurance cuts in the first case 1995 the catalyst was domestic economic deterioration following a relatively swift tightening in policy in the second 1998 global factors and an extreme bout of risk aversion in financial markets led the fed to cut rates of the two episodes the latter experience shows more parallels to today u s economic activity has held up relatively well but global conditions are fragile and financial markets remain on edge in response to trade wars should a policy shock tip the scale the fed is one of the few central banks that can respond by easing policy and the most likely to do so when the federal open market committee fomc raised the federal funds rate in december 2018 its preferred inflation metric sat at the 2 0 target 1 it has since softened to 1 6 this slowdown along with comments by a handful of fed members has raised market expectations that the fed s next move will be a rate cut the notion of insurance cuts harkens back to the mid 1990s which was the last time the federal reserve adjusted policy in what with hindsight proved to be outside of a recession faced with softer than expected economic growth the fomc cut the federal funds rate by a cumulative 75 basis points from july 1995 to january 1996 it did so again in late 1998 due to deterioration in the global economy and a rapid tightening of financial conditions chart 1 our baseline expectation is for the federal reserve to remain on hold over the remainder of this year but the notion of insurance cuts cannot be readily dismissed should policy or external shocks prompt further economic deterioration or should financial conditions tighten significantly today s international backdrop sits on a thinner growth cushion relative to past years leaving it more susceptible to forecast misses or policy shocks even if modest in nature likewise the u s domestic economy has come down from its 2018 cloud as leading indicators on business sentiment show some convergence to global peers simply put unintended outcomes today carry more risk than those of yesterday insurance cut versus trial and error process there was a clear distinction between the two non recessionary periods where the fed cut 75 basis twice over in the 1990s the 1994 1995 period can be characterized as part of the trial and error process of the federal reserve searching for the appropriate neutral rate we ve written extensively on this topic noting that there s theory but not precise science backing the setting of a neutral rate between january 1994 and february 1995 the federal funds rate had risen a steep 300 basis points to 6 0 this was an aggressive response that included rate hikes of 50 basis points two meetings and 75 basis points two meetings based on the data the fed had on hand at that time the american economy was expanding at an average rate of roughly 4 0 through 1994 theory supported an economy pushing swiftly into excess demand territory where inflationary pressures would threaten the stability of the expansion if left unchecked following the rapid adjustment the fed went into wait and see mode to gauge economic activity and inflation by july of 1995 it become clear that a more rapid deceleration was materializing relative to the fed s forecasts the fomc minutes from that meeting noted sluggish consumer spending decelerating business investment and a substantial decline in nonfarm payroll employment in may 101k after a small decline in april adding to the body of evidence was a rising unemployment rate and a swiftly plummeting leading indicator the ism manufacturing index moved deeply into contraction territory falling nearly 13 percentage points in less than eight months chart 2 there was clear supportive evidence that the fed s rate setting exercise may have overreached and this motivated an adjustment to rates with a 25 basis point cut in july thereafter the fed returned to wait and see mode monitoring the data although the economy stabilized a subsequent deceleration in inflation opened the debate on whether the economy had more room to run six months after the first cut the fed followed through with a second noting since the last easing of monetary policy in july inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions the fomc cut a final 25 basis points in january 1996 at the time a government shutdown had resulted in the delay of several key economic data releases sound familiar still what data was available pointed to somewhat slower growth and weaker inflation enough for one last cut lower rates better job market today there are a few obvious differences between the mid 1990s experience and today first today s fed has lifted rates cautiously at roughly one third the pace seen then this leaves the real inflation adjusted rate at a mere 1 0 compared to 3 9 at the height of the 1995 episode 2 even after cutting rates during that period the real fed funds rate was 225 basis points above where it is today second the pullback in labor demand factored materially into the fed s decision to edge down the policy rate in contrast the labor market of today seems to repeatedly defy expectations on the upside looking past typical month to month data volatility the year to date trend is holding at 190k jobs slightly below the pace set this time last year with an economy that produced 3 gdp growth for the year recent upward movements in the unemployment rate have had more to do with an influx of workers being enticed back into the market than weakness in labor demand still the unemployment rate of 3 6 in april sits 70 basis points below the fomc s median long run estimate while the economic backdrop differs today from 1995 the period offers a glimpse of the fed s willingness to be flexible when data deviates from their prior assumptions in the trial and error exercise of setting monetary policy indeed there have been some unfavorable data trends unfolding today that could prompt a cut should further deterioration become apparent take the manufacturing ism index this leading indicator has come off the boil falling eight points in eight months however it remains in expansion territory at 52 2 a sustained breach below the 50 threshold alongside softening labor demand or inflation could trigger a red flag at the fed as it did before chart 3 clear parallels to 1998 in global backdrop however we are more intrigued by the late 1990s experience where there are several interesting parallels to today s environment in 1998 the domestic economy was relatively stable with only some pockets of softness as we see today but the global environment had become precarious and financial conditions had weakened considerably in the lead up to rate cuts as it was then the greater concern today is a kick up of market anxiety due to the intersection of escalating trade wars and an already weakened global economy risk averse behavior can reignite emerging markets woes through currency fluctuations and capital flight in turn these forces would reach the real economy through deteriorated confidence and income channels here is the situation that led to a series of cuts during 1998 that summer volatility spiked and stock markets declined precipitously over the course of a month with the s p 500 losing almost 20 of its value chart 4 at the same time yields on long term u s government debt plummeted with movement concentrated at the long end that swiftly compressed the entire curve the decline in financial market sentiment was largely due to events abroad the asian financial crisis which began in 1997 was still fulminating and was joined in august 1998 by the russian debt crisis in the same month moody s investment services threatened to downgrade japan s bond rating 3 flight to safety caused the trade weighted u s dollar to rise by over 20 from the beginning of 1997 domestic economic data began to show some cracks but nowhere of the magnitude of the mid 1990s however inflation slowed with core cpi at just 2 2 and falling energy prices pulling down headline inflation to just 1 7 the fed s expectation that a tight labor market would put upward pressure on inflation had failed to materialize much like we see today in response to the international storm clouds the fed employed the first of three 25 basis point insurance rate cuts in september of 1998 this first cut helped to initially shore up market confidence but lacked staying power by early october the s p 500 had returned to within a hair of its pre rate cut nadir and the yield curve went briefly negative the carnage was enough for the fed to announce a rare intermeeting 25 basis point cut in october less than three weeks after the first one analysts expected the fed would cut rates again when it met officially in november and it did exactly that bringing the fed funds rate to 4 75 this was enough to stabilize financial market sentiment and thwart the threat of strong negative wealth effects passing through the economy and eventually undermining real economic activity by june of the following year the fed regained the confidence to hike rates again financial conditions matter fast forward to today and we find some similarities that could prompt the fed to ease policy under a deteriorating global landscape but it would likely require an acute and sustained deterioration in financial market conditions on escalating trade disputes that threaten the health of the american economy cutting the policy rate on subdued inflation dynamics alone seems like a long shot absent other transmissions from global and domestic strain in some ways we already saw a glimpse of the fed s reaction function at the start of the year with its pivot to patience following the deterioration in financial conditions in late 2018 in response to this shift in fed communication financial conditions improved dramatically with stock prices rallying and corporate bond spreads narrowing however without rate cuts the yield curve has remained on the cusp of inversion with the spread between 3 month t bills and 10 year treasuries flirting with negative territory on any given day should a second wave of trade related fears sweep over financial markets the impact could be both a steep sell off in equity markets rise in risk spreads and a yield curve that moves further into inversion territory than it did in 1998 chart 5 should this take place in an environment of soft inflation as in 1998 the fed may indeed decide the balance of risks warrants some insurance via a cut to interest rates bottom line the two periods of insurance cuts in the 1990s may not predict exactly how the fomc will respond to changing economic conditions today but they do provide examples of the fed s reaction function and the circumstances that could lead to a change in policy stance as in the 1990s debates about the level of economic slack and the seeming disconnect between a tight labour market and soft inflation remain as pertinent as ever perhaps the most notable difference on this front is that at that time lower inflation was viewed as a positive rather than a sign of failure ultimately the data to date does not meet the bar for the fed to move off its current patient stance with respect to data economic growth is still running above fomc members long term trend assumptions the unemployment rate is a hair away from historical nadir and the job market has shown few signs of slowing down inflation excluding food and energy has slowed but other core measures have been much more stable around the fed s now explicit 2 target while the bar is high for a rate cut the outcome cannot be dismissed given the asymmetric risks created by escalating trade tensions and a weaker economic backdrop both global and domestic relative to a year ago a test of market confidence that places the economy at risk could move the notion of insurance cuts from the history books to the playbook end notes

out our regulatory tracker below for updates legislative lowdown free file find if you can the internal revenue service irs is investigating allegations that some tax filing companies involved in the agency s free file program have been taking advantage of low income taxpayers senate finance committee chair chuck grassley r ia and ranking member ron wyden d or want answers the senators sent a letter to internal revenue service irs commissioner chuck rettig asking the agency to review its agreement with free file companies and take any necessary actions to ensure the integrity and purpose of the free file program including amending the memorandum as necessary to bar whatever deceptive acts and practices the irs might uncover as a result of its investigation on thursday house ways and means committee chair richard neal d ma ranking member kevin brady r tx and oversight subcommittee leaders john lewis d ga and mike kelly r pa also wrote to rettig requesting the results of the irs investigation into the free file program the letter asked the irs to specifically include in its response a review of its marketing practices oversight of the program and additional opportunities to improve taxpayer participation in the program the congressional inquiry follows allegations that h r block and intuit have been making it harder for lower income taxpayers to find free tax prep offerings and instead steered taxpayers towards products they would have to purchase as of sunday a class action lawsuit was filed against intuit in the u s district court of northern california alleging that impacted taxpayers were intentionally misled and deprived of the opportunity to make an informed decision about their tax filing service seize the gap the tax gap or the difference between the amount of tax liability owed by taxpayers and the amount that is paid on time has become a hot topic in recent weeks following an announcement by irs commissioner charles rettig that the agency plans to update its tax gap estimate next month for the years 2011 to 2014 in anticipation of the tax gap update the house ways and means committee held a hearing on may 9 entitled understanding the tax gap and taxpayer noncompliance to explore the current gap estimated to be between 400 and 460 billion the committee heard testimony from a panel of witnesses representing the irs the government accountability office gao and the department of the treasury the discussion centered around a number of topics including the appropriate level of funding for the irs the effectiveness of the irs s use of data and technology the impact of the emerging gig economy on the tax gap fairness in audits and simplification of the tax code among others all witnesses agreed that the irs requires more funds to operate efficiently and to adequately address the tax gap democrats and republicans on the committee however disagreed on this point with most republicans instead suggesting that smarter audits and a simpler tax code are better solutions than increased funding with regard to causes it was widely agreed upon that underreporting makes up the bulk of the tax gap with failing to meet the deadline and non filing making up the rest with regard to solutions witnesses j russell george treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta benjamin herndon chief research and analytics officer irs and a few members from both sides of the aisle discussed compliance program changes that can be made to address the gaps in payment from the gig economy tip reporting and virtual currencies finally there was significant discussion on fairness in audits and the impact it has on the tax gap specifically there were questions as to why low income individuals particularly those receiving earned income tax credit eitc benefits receive the lion s share of audits while higher income individuals are subject to far fewer audits despite their potential for a much greater return according to a fy 2018 treasury report about one quarter of eitc claims were issued improperly the high rate of improper payments is the reason the eitc is such a focus for the irs however some tax experts including the taxpayer advocate service an independent office within the irs argue the estimate is too high retirement kerfuffle excitement for a house retirement savings bill hit a snag this week as a coalition of education unions came out in opposition to one key aspect of the proposed legislation expanded options for tax advantaged 529 accounts the bipartisan setting every community up for retirement enhancement act of 2019 h r 1994 passed out of the house ways and means committee by a unanimous voice vote on april 2 the bill would make various changes to how americans access retirement savings accounts and maintain portability of lifetime income options from one plan to another however the national education association and american federation of teachers this week reportedly began pressuring committee chair and original sponsor richard neal d ma to remove the 529 expansion provisions previously a contentious sticking point in tax cuts and jobs act p l 115 97 deliberations the bill would expand the benefits of 529 college savings plans including adding student loan repayments as a qualified expense allowing the same secondary expenses that are covered by coverdell education savings accounts academic tutoring textbooks supplies and equipment allowing plans to be used to pay for apprenticeship programs and homeschooling it is unclear as to whether democrats will pull the 529 provisions from the bill doing so may come at the cost of losing republican support for what was supposed to be a bipartisan bill house ways and means committee ranking member kevin brady r tx has asked democrats to keep the provisions saying i cannot comprehend a reason why anyone especially educators would object to families saving more for books and tutoring and what it takes to get kids to their highest potential today some democratic staff have indicated the provisions will likely be stripped from the bill a house vote may still be scheduled prior to memorial day recess the senate is expected to consider its own version of the bill and the two chambers are will likely have to have to convene a conference committee to reconcile differences between

employees are fully vested and the accounts are portable there was bipartisan agreement on the committee that oregonsaves could serve as a model for federal legislation part time workers and small businesses many senators discussed the need to find a way for part time workers to increase their retirement savings particularly as the gig economy continues to grow sen mark warner d va suggested the creation of a universal savings account granted at birth as a potential safety net the panelists had not considered the proposal but they seemed open to exploring the idea further there was also agreement that making it easier for small businesses to provide retirement plans is essential small businesses often have limited administrative resources and cannot focus on providing retirement plans for their employees reducing administrative burden and making it less prohibitive for small businesses to offer retirement plans for employees was a shared priority for many senators paying off student debt while saving for retirement the panelists highlighted the importance of educating workers on the value of saving early ranking member ron wyden d or discussed the retirement parity for student loans act s 1428 which would allow 401 k 403 b simple and governmental 457 b retirement plans to make matching contributions to a worker s retirement plan as if their student loan payments were salary reduction contributions in other words the bill would allow employers who are currently only allowed to match retirement contributions if the employee is contributing to their retirement plan to make matching contributions to retirement accounts if their employees are paying off student loans this would allow workers to save for retirement while paying off student loan debt at the same time changing age requirements there was discussion about decreasing the minimum age for a child to be able to make their own ira contributions to 17 years under current law which varies by states iras are held by parents for their children until the age of majority usually 18 or 21 lowering the age would permit individuals working at age 17 to be auto enrolled in their employers plans

bill from sanders office reports that credit card interest rate from stores like macy s or kohl s can reach up to 27 allowing credit card companies to earn 180 billion in interest revenue last year

entirely secure according to a government accountability office gao report released last week the government watchdog found the internal revenue service irs has not developed standards to adequately protect taxpayer information when used by tax preparers or e filing providers noting the standards established through the security summit are outdated the report also found that in 2018 about 90 of taxpayers had their returns filed electronically by paid preparers or used tax prep software to do it themselves which has left many vulnerable to fraud and id theft the gao says the irs does not have the ability to regulate the security systems used by these paid preparers and the few regulations in place are outdated while irs commissioner charles rettig has indicated that bolstering the agency s cybersecurity is a top priority outlining a six year plan to upgrade its technology the irs rejected a number of the gao s recommendations saying it does not have the statutory authority to establish security requirements the gao on the other hand believes the irs needs no additional authority to implement its recommendations 2020 vision trump plays sport as the house ways and means committee

topics such as social cohesion globalization and corruption this information feeds into four categories economic performance infrastructure government efficiency and business efficiency to give a final score for each country there is no one size fits all solution for competitiveness but the best performing countries tend to score well across all four categories regions asia the asia pacific region emerged as a beacon for competitiveness with 11 out of 14 economies either improving or holding their ground led by singapore and hong kong sar at top of the global chart indonesia leapt eleven places to 32nd enjoying the region s biggest improvement thanks to increased efficiency in the government sector as well as improvement in infrastructure and business conditions the southern asian

position in 2019 japan fell five places to 30th hampered by a sluggish economy government debt and a weakening business environment europe competitiveness across europe has struggled to gain ground with most economies on the decline or standing still the nordics traditionally a powerhouse region for competitiveness have failed to make significant progress this year while ongoing uncertainty over

the region down six places to 39th a reversal from gains made in the previous year middle east a story of two halves in the region as fossil fuel producers such as uae qatar and saudi arabia climbed the rankings while inflation had a negative impact on turkey 51st and jordan 57th israel 24th declined mainly because of a negative performance across different government efficiency indicators such as its budget deficit saudi arabia achieved the biggest climb in the global rankings up 13 places to 26th despite a fall in its overall economic performance score it registered the highest global ranking for investment in education and fared well in public and business finance latin america latin american countries continue to fare poorly on the ranking venezuela was cemented at the bottom of the ranking for yet another year as the political and economic crisis continues to take its toll the highest ranked country from this region chile suffered the largest drop this year down 7 places to

the number of corporate insolvencies recorded in certain markets such as the us and the uk has remained consistently low in recent years with likely delays to further interest rate rises in the us and possibly even cuts the status quo looks set for the foreseeable future though the number of corporate insolvencies has remained relatively low a number of notable companies have entered bankruptcy over the last 12 months particularly in the retail sector in the us payless shoesource diesel usa sears fullbeauty brands and david s bridal have filed for chapter 11 in the uk debenhams patisserie valerie lk bennett and many others also entered administration united states van c durrer ii skadden arps slate meagher flom llp the first days of 2019 definitely saw more insolvency activity in the us although we are hearing anecdotally that the second quarter of 2019 has been slower president trump s recent pressure on the federal reserve to delay further rate increases or even to cut interest rates may afford troubled companies with a postponement of their day of reckoning nonetheless the ongoing china us tariff dispute should cause enough disruption in capital markets and elsewhere to force more restructuring activity the upcoming escalation of the trade war is scheduled to occur in june 2019 so we will see what impacts it may have during the second half of 2019 unless peace breaks out argentina fernando hernández marval o farrell mairal due to several factors including the raising of interest rates by the us federal reserve the inability of the argentine government to perform structural changes and reduce the fiscal deficit the increase of the argentine government s inflation goals for 2018 and a historical drought that affected crop production during 2018 the argentine peso depreciated 103 83 percent against the us dollar as a consequence inflation for 2018 increased 47 6 percent in an attempt to control the us dollar exchange rate and inflation the federal government and the argentine central bank adopted a series of measures including raising interest rates in pesos to more than 70 percent and reducing the fiscal deficit united kingdom david bryan bm t european restructuring solutions in absolute terms the numbers of corporate insolvencies have remained very low as they have for many years however the latest government figures for q1 2019 do show a significant uptick with the number of insolvencies up 6 3 percent over q4 2018 a recent red flag alert report showed a 16 percent increase in businesses in significant financial distress insolvency statistics are at their highest numbers for five years but those last five years have been at very low levels by historic standards businesses are facing a raft of headwinds with increases to the minimum wage increases to pension contributions and increased business rates ireland frank flanagan mason hayes curran a key driver in the irish market continues to be the sale of distressed debt by banks under pressure to reduce their non performing exposures npes the secondary lenders acquiring this debt tend to move quickly to resolve the portfolios they have acquired however we are seeing a significant decrease in the appointment of receivers to corporates this is indicative of an increase in consensual settlements generally involving refinancing numbers of creditors voluntary liquidations have remained fairly constant but the market perception is that many of these arise from directors tidying up zombie companies that have been through a receivership to enable them to return to business as usual spain andrea perelló cuatrecasas according to the data published by the general council of judiciary the number of corporate bankruptcies in spain remained almost the same in 2018 as in the previous year there were 4131 bankruptcy proceedings in 2018 and 4095 in 2017 the autonomous community in catalonia saw a major increase in the number of corporate bankruptcies last year up from 747 cases in 2017 to 970 in 2018 in madrid the number of bankruptcy proceedings has remained largely unchanged in terms of sales volume the increase in bankruptcy petitions came from those companies with a sales volume lower than 1m switzerland daniel hayek prager dreifuss ltd the economic situation in switzerland is generally favourable and there have been very few sizeable bankruptcies in recent years however bankruptcies of small and medium sized enterprises reached an all time high in 2018 in october 2018 521 companies had to file for bankruptcy in switzerland a year on year increase of 10 percent on october 2017 while there was a general increase in insolvencies for smaller businesses in switzerland certain regions recorded a substantially high amount of bankruptcies compared to previous years the cantons of uri and glarus showed the highest increase in bankruptcies in 2018 with 26 1 percent and 31 percent respectively austria thomas trettnak cerha hempel spiegelfeld hlawati rechtsanwälte gmbh in 2018 the number of businesses filing for insolvency in austria decreased slightly there were 4980 applications for insolvency proceedings down 1 9 percent on 2017 in total insolvency proceedings were opened against 2985 companies and 1995 such proceedings were dismissed due to a lack of assets to cover costs with fewer than 5000 insolvent companies in 2018 statistics show that this is the lowest number in the past 20 years however the slight decrease in the number of companies filing for insolvency proceedings has been relativised by the increased amount of liabilities and the number of employees affected romania catalin nichifor bm t european restructuring solutions i believe we need to totally separate restructuring and insolvencies especially as locally no more than 4 percent of insolvent companies are finalising a successful reorganisation i am of the opinion that once a company files for insolvency it will most probably end up in bankruptcy destroying value for creditors shareholders employees and the community in romania more than 8000 companies filed for insolvency in 2018 which was in line with the previous few years but what is interesting is that bigger companies are becoming insolvent producing ever more losses looking ahead the volume of distressed companies and insolvencies is expected to grow india nikhil shah alvarez marsal in 2016 india legislated a unified insolvency resolution framework the insolvency bankruptcy code ibc this was put into place against the backdrop of a decade of increasingly stressed assets the new law has helped fast track the resolution of the insolvencies of several large stressed assets over the last 12 18 months leading to a recovery of around 10bn a 43 percent recovery for financial creditors the government and bankruptcy regulator are proactively strengthening the law and building capacity to accelerate the resolution of many bankruptcies and bring more certainty as the law matures australia brett lord ey formal insolvency appointments have continued to decline during the year ended 30 june 2018 with a 3 5 percent reduction compared to the prior corresponding period this also represents a 28 percent decline from peak formal insolvency appointments which occurred during the year ended 30 june 2012 worth noting is the change in the types of appointments generally occurring it is no great surprise that the number of receiverships is down 14 5 percent of total appointments in 2010 to 6 2 percent in 2018 however what is interesting to note is the almost corresponding increase in liquidation appointments up to 78 2 percent in 2018 from 70 9 percent in 2010 confirming that secured creditors are significantly less likely to intervene in a company led insolvency appointment

imd world competitiveness rankings 2019 fuelled by its advanced technological infrastructure and favourable immigration laws singapore has ranked as the world s most competitive economy knocking off previous leader the united states the availability of skilled labour and efficient ways to set up new businesses in the asian economic giant also play a key role in driving singapore to pole position its first time since 2010 the us on the other hand saw weaker hi tech exports fluctuations in the value of the dollar and higher fuel prices which dragged down its position down to third which was held by singapore last year according to the imd world competitiveness rankings and while the trump administration s first wave of tax policies triggered an initial boost to confidence this appeared to have dimmed added imd world competitiveness center which compiled the rankings see also hong kong retained its second placing supported by a benign tax and business policy environment and access to business finance the research centre said the imd rankings was established in 1989 and assessed 235 indicators across 63 ranked economies taking into account hard statistics such as unemployment gdp and government spending on health and education as well as soft data from an executive opinion survey covering topics such as social cohesion globalisation and corruption the asia pacific region came up strong on the index with 11 of 14 economies either improving or retaining their rankings indonesia led the pack in most improved placing climbing 11 notches to 32nd position which the imd attributed to improvement in infrastructure and business conditions as well as increased efficiency in the government sector the asian market also had the lowest labour cost amongst the 63 economies evaluated thailand stepped up five places to 25th fuelled by an increase in foreign direct investments and productivity japan and mainland china however fell in their rankings with the former dropping five places to 30th dragged down by a sluggish economy weaker business environment and government debt the chinese economy dropped one step to 14th position competitiveness across europe also struggled to gain ground with most economies on the decline or stagnant according to imd which noted that the ongoing uncertainty over brexit pushed the united kingdom down to 23rd from 20th ireland though climbed five notches to 7th propelled by improved business conditions and a strengthening economy it also led its global peers in terms of investment incentives the handling of public sector contracts and areas such as image branding and talent management director of imd world competitiveness center arturo bris said in a year of high uncertainty in global markets due to rapid changes in the international political landscape as well as trade relations the quality of institutions seem to be the unifying element for increasing prosperity a strong institutional framework provides the stability for business to invest and innovate ensuring a higher quality of life for citizens singapore refutes us allegations of currency manipulation meanwhile singapore has rejected allegations from the us treasury that it manipulated its currency for export advantage in a statement released wednesday the monetary authority of singapore mas said the country s monetary policy framework was centred on the exchange rate and aimed to ensure medium term price stability the industry regulator said it manages the singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate within a policy band not unlike how other central banks conducted their monetary policies by targeting interest rates mas explained whether they target the exchange rate or the interest rate central banks aim to keep consumer price inflation low and stable as their primary mandate mas does not and cannot use the exchange rate to gain an export advantage or achieve a current account surplus a deliberate weakening of the singapore dollar would cause inflation to spike and compromise mas price stability objective it further called for singapore s current account balance to be viewed in context noting that the country ran persistently large current account deficits in its early years of development at close to 10 percent of gdp between 1965 and 1984 when its investment needs were greater than available saving the nation s investment needs tapered off as its economy matured while national saving rose turning the current account into a surplus position mas added that it expected rising affluence to fuel consumption and singapore s current account surplus would be reduced when public and private savings were drawn down to support the needs of an ageing population the central bank s comments were in response to a report by the us department of the treasury that added nine trading partners on its monitoring list for their currency practices including six asian markets singapore china japan south korea malaysia and vietnam germany ireland and italy also made the list the us government agency said it aimed to ensure trade expanded in a way that helped us workers and companies as well as protected them from unfair foreign trade practices us treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said treasury takes seriously any potentially unfair currency practices and treasury is expanding the number of us trading partners it reviews to make currency practices fairer and more transparent related coverage singapore aims to build up ai skills for digital economy country s government has introduced

basis chairperson s statement for the period from 1 october 2018 to 31 march 2019 the six month period ending 31 march 2019 was one of two very distinct quarters q4 2018 was one of the most challenging periods for markets in recent years as federal reserve fed chair powell threatened to raise interest rates through the neutral rate thereby scaring market participants of a potential policy error and geopolitical concerns increased both in europe and in the trade tariff talks between the us and china however q1 2019 in contrast was the complete opposite as powell reiterated that fed policy was fully data dependent helping repair sentiment further was more conciliatory rhetoric from the us china talks and article 50 being extended to 31 october in order to give more time to find an orderly brexit deal elsewhere there was a degree of relief as the european central bank ecb announced another round of targeted long term financing operations ltro thereby helping the transmission mechanism in the eurozone and alleviating any talk of a bank liquidity issue in the uk the brexit negotiations dominated the tory conference and the uk autumn budget as talks failed around the key irish border issue the negative brexit sentiment weighed on uk assets although the broad based global rally in q1 2019 was still the dominating factor the first half of the period was one of widening spreads and poor market liquidity whereas the second period was one of buoyant market sentiment and tighter credit spreads of course this translates to limited opportunities for the portfolio managers to source suitable assets and hence no new shares were issued in the 2nd quarter whereas there was the opportunity for a tap in october 2m and one in november 1m overall the income generation of the company continued to comfortably maintain the monthly 0 5p dividend and the portfolio managers remain satisfied that the amortisation profile of the company required no notification of any change to the dividend payment in the near to medium term the board continues to monitor dividend cover closely on a monthly basis there was a significant drop in total comprehensive income for the period and whilst the dividends during the period were paid out of the company s reserves there was sufficient income earned to pay each dividend at each dividend date in accordance with the company s dividend policy as described in note 18 and this does not affect the viability of the company the decline in total comprehensive income is predominantly due to the realised and unrealised revaluation of securities over the period although there were two new share taps during the period the portfolio managers and the board of directors continue to adhere to a strict discipline of only accepting new share issuance when suitable investment opportunities exist at the start of the period there were 182 179 151 shares in issue and 185 179 151 at the end of the period on 31 march 2019 the strong technical backdrop currently being enjoyed by the market is expected to remain in place unless an unexpected event occurs close attention is being paid to the forthcoming earnings season and the eu elections in may for the coming quarter the portfolio managers have advised the board that they are confident that the assets in the portfolio will continue to perform and that reinvestment risk is not an immediate concern claire whittet chair 28 may 2019 portfolio manager s report for the period from 1 october 2018 to 31 march 2019 as advised in the chair s statement this was a period sharply defined by two very distinct quarters q4 2018 was a considerable challenge for investors that started with a weak tone following disappointing earnings from a number of bellwether corporates such as amazon and caterpillar from there on market conditions deteriorated with sentiment being weakened by the international money fund downgrading global growth expectations but the backdrop really changed following a very hawkish commentary from fed chair powell who mentioned the possibility of fed funds being tightened beyond the perceived neutral rate this led to us indices erasing much of the year s gains and global stocks saw their worst month in 6 years the benchmark 10y us treasury ust yield breached the 3 25 resistance level and the key 2 10s curve briefly steepened to 34bps then geopolitical events took hold again and ust yields retreated back with volatility being stoked further by president trump who took a very public swipe at powell reiterating his disapproval of the fed s current tightening stance sensing a repeat of the bernanke tantrum of 2013 jerome powell turned 180 degrees and adopted a dovish tone in the november statement which created a degree of confusion for fed watchers but resulted in a sharp change of direction in the rates market with the 10y ust yield dipping below 3 and 2y 10y treasury yield spread curve flatten by c 20bps over the month as expected the fed hiked fed funds to 2 25 2 50 on 19 december but the market began to question whether the fed will hike at all in 2019 resulting in a drop in the dollar and a decline in 10y ust yields to 2 76 as the year drew to a close then at the american economic associations aea meeting in atlanta on the 4 january powell who was joined by janet yellen and ben bernanke emphasised a data dependent stance saying he wouldn t hesitate to adjust the balance sheet reduction if it was causing problems for the economy this was taken by the market as confirmation of a supportive fed leading to a sharp rally in all sectors of the credit markets and rapidly reversing the widening of q4 2018 adding to the now dovish fed there was welcome conciliatory language emanating from the us china trade talks which added to the gains in both credit and rates there was an improvement towards the end of 2018 in emerging markets following the decision by the turkish courts to release the us pastor and in brazil the more market friendly candidate bolsonaro won the brazilian presidential campaign the dovish fed led to a weaker usd and this in turn helped the emerging markets em sector recover some ground as the year end approached in the eurozone italian government bonds btps continued their recent volatile sell off as the rhetoric between the eu and the italian government intensified over the deficit increasing budget set by the new coalition government in rome unsurprisingly moody s downgraded italy s sovereign rating to baa3 italy continued to lag the rest of the euro sovereigns as the new year started and the coalition government refusing to change course despite the bank of italy predicting a deficit of over 3 in 2019 however the downside was softened by the positive tone across the general market with the ecb continuing with supportive rhetoric including the introduction of another round of targeted ltros here in the uk the brexit negotiations dominated the tory conference and the uk autumn budget talks failed around the key irish border issue resulting in a number of key resignations in the ruling conservative party and turmoil reigned in parliament as prime minister may decided to delay the vote in the house in the hope of some additional concessions from the eu a new deadline leaving date of 31 october has done little to bring harmony in the ruling conservative party or indeed across the house of parliament speculation continues to grow that a second referendum and a threat albeit minor of a corbyn led government could materialise and hence a weaker tone for uk assets remains elsewhere in germany the ruling christian democratic union lost one of its key states in the hesse elections which ultimately resulted in angela merkel announcing her resignation as head of the party although she intends to stay on as chancellor until the end of her term in 2021 and in france president macron s popularity hit a low point as he caved in to demands from a populist uprising against the perceived elitist nature of the french government all in the market traded poorly throughout q4 2018 but recovered strongly in q1 2019 as supportive central bank policy appears to be back with a vengeance as we head into q2 there is a lack of geopolitical headwind brexit being the obvious exception a number of idiosyncratic events leading to sharp sell offs in credit risk with several companies seeing bonds sell off 10 points or more merely on the announcement of slightly disappointing results or news flow illustrate the fragility of the market and investors lack of appetite for volatility portfolio commentary given the weak sentiment in q4 2018 the portfolio managers took the opportunity where possible to add favoured bonds particularly those with relatively short duration although a lack of new issuance volume and secondary flow meant that sourcing additional assets was frustratingly lower than the portfolio managers hoped with the sharp turnaround in market sentiment in q1 2019 the portfolio managers found it increasingly more challenging to source suitable assets although the re financing of the original at1 issues in 2013 and 2014 are now occurring in the market and this is expected to create some opportunity overall it was an interesting six months split between two diverse quarters the euro hy coco hy and hy indices all recovered from significant negative returns at the calendar year end to end the period 1 69 3 21 1 39 and 2 73 respectively the portfolio managers cut one position in the us hy space due to a loss of confidence in the credit which resulted in a slightly disappointing performance for the period with the company generating a 0 5 return foreign exchange accounting the company s policy is to hedge foreign exchange currency risk however the company does not formally designate the hedges or adopt hedge accounting under ifrs9 any movements in foreign exchange rates are monitored daily and the hedge is adjusted when necessary to ensure that currency exposure remains within strict limits the net foreign currency losses on the portfolio recorded within net losses on financial assets at fair

recent audited annual financial statements except for ifrs 9 financial instruments and ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers c significant judgements and estimates in the current financial period there have been no changes to the significant accounting judgements estimates and assumptions from those applied in the most recent audited annual financial statements d standards amendments and interpretations effective during the period the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those used in the annual report and audited financial statements for the year ended 31 september 2018 as disclosed in those annual financial statements ifrs 9 financial instruments and ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers were applicable for financial reporting periods starting 1 january

under ifrs 9 other receivables and cash and cash equivalents classified as loans and receivables under ias 39 have been reclassified to amortised cost under ifrs 9 the new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost and the standard mandates the use of the simplified approach to calculating the expected credit losses for trade receivables the impairment calculation is based on the company s historical default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward looking estimates given the historical level of defaults and the credit risk of the investment portfolio there is a negligible impact because of the lifetime expected credit loss to be recognised versus the previous impairment model applied by the company therefore the carrying amount of other receivables remains the same under ifrs 9 as the expected credit losses on the financial assets have been assessed as immaterial cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of ifrs 9 and the identified impairment loss is also assessed as immaterial ifrs 15 assessment ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers specifies how and when to recognise revenue as well as requiring entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative relevant disclosures the standard provides a single principles based five step model to

period no credit securities held by the company are classified as level 1 credit securities which are not traded or dealt on organised markets or exchanges are classified in level 2 or level 3 credit securities priced at cost are classified as level 3 credit securities with prices obtained from independent price vendors where the portfolio manager is able to assess whether the observable inputs used for their modelling of prices are accurate and the portfolio manager has the ability to challenge these vendors with further observable inputs are classified as level 2 prices obtained from vendors who are not easily challengeable or transparent in showing their assumptions for the method of pricing these assets are classified as level 3 credit securities priced at an average of two vendors prices are classified as level 3 where the portfolio manager determines that the price obtained from an independent price vendor is not an accurate representation of the fair value of the credit security the portfolio manager may source prices from third party dealer quotes and if the price represents a reliable and an observable price the credit security is classified in level 2 any dealer quote that is over 20 days old is considered stale and is classified as level 3 there were no transfers between level 1 and 2 during the period however transfers from level 3 to level 2 occurred based on the portfolio manager s ability to obtain a more reliable and observable price as detailed above due to the inputs into the valuation of credit securities classified as level 3 not

cctv footage played the key role in identifying the suicide bombers of the easter sunday attack however the ways and means of breeding such terrorism on sri lanka s soil is still under investigation in the aftermath of the easter attack there is heighted attention on countering financing of terrorism informal illegal remittance schemes can be seen as one of the main mechanismsused for fund transfers by terrorists international soft law making bodies such as the financial action task force fatf and domestic law enforcement authorities make efforts to put frameworks in place to curb informal and illegal remittance schemes however reports of investigations into terrorist activities reveal that such systems are in operation parallel to formal financial systems this article intends to highlight some salient aspects of illegal remittance schemes which pose severe threats to national security integrity of financial systems and promotion of economic growth informal value transfer systems according to the financial crimes enforcement network fincen any system mechanism or network of people that receives money for the purpose of making funds or an equivalent value payable to a third party in another geographical location whether or not in the same form is considered as an informal value transfer system ivts a system called hawala in middle east and asia fei chin in china huikuan in hong kong pei kwan in thailand hundi in pakistan and india and undiyal among sri lankan tamils black market peso exchange in colombia and padala in philippines are examples of ivts this article will focus on the hawala scheme which is considered a widely used form of ivts it has originated in the middle east and south asia although at its origins the hawala system facilitated trade and helped to mitigate therisk and inconvenience of physical transportation of money it is reported that after 9 11 attack hawalabecame associated with terrorism financing however in areas where there is lack of access to conventional banking hawala functions as an alternative remittance system what is hawala in the arabic language hawala means transfer trust between the involved parties is the main attraction of the hawala system moreover the low or no cost for the remitters speed of the transfer anonymity convenience for the recipients and the lack of rigid formalities suitability for cultural aspects are considered as other attractive elements of the hawala system it is also observed that the hawala is used to evade currency controls international sanctions and taxes as well as to transfer criminal proceeds modus operandi moving money without money moving at all the multifaceted description of hawala indicates that it is a mechanism of transferring money without physically moving it the diagram elaborates a simple hawala transaction customer usually a migrant worker but it could be any other person approaches a hawala broker hawaladar and gives him a sum of money to be sent to a recipient in another country contacts their hawala partner in the recipient country via phone or fax or email gives the information on the beneficiary amount name address telephone number of the recipient to however doesn t remit money to agrees to settle it later and pays to the recipient d therecipient will have a password or code number to get money from no written contract for the transaction is available and the deal is secured by the trust between parties two hawaladars i e and settle their dues at a later stage through under invoicing transferring money through banks or cash carriers researches reveal that hawala brokers mostly involved in import export activities they charge a modest commission and use a more favourable exchange rate than the mainstream banks the hawala broker in the recipient country does the delivery of money free of charge since the hawala does not create a paper trail it gains traction for illicit transactions such as terrorist financing tax evasion exchange control violations and import export frauds therefore the debt settlement can be done by manipulating invoices i e under invoicing or over invoicing shipments of goods smuggling gold and precious items is another way of settling dues between hawala brokers in an article titled a banking system built for terrorism published in time magazine 2001 the following description had been given for illegal remittance systems in the labyrinthine depths of old delhi nobody seems to be doing any work until the phone rings then numbers are furiously scribbled followed by some busy dialling and whispered instruction although it s far from obvious in the innocuous setting these men are moving money to exporters drug traffickers tax evaders corrupt politicians and terrorists the regulatory empowerment in sri lanka should also be widened to detect such money movers in the country who are engaged in criminal activities susceptibility ofhawala for money laundering and terrorism financing it is observed that criminals take advantage of the anonymity of the hawala system to move the proceeds of illegal activities since the documentation involved in the hawala deals is minimal it makes the system vulnerable to be abused for money laundering and terrorism financing according to timothy o brien al qaeda has used the hawala system to fund the american embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in 1998 columbian drug traffickers have also used hawala as their main remittance system the irish times reported 2016 that hawala was used to fund the paris attack in 2015 as per the international business times 2015 the boko haram organization in nigeriais known to receive money through hawala in 2005 fatf also acknowledged the potential misuse of hawala by criminals the fatf states that hawala controlled by criminals functions as networks for other offences including tax fraud currency offences and corruption according to the interpol reports the hawala system facilitates money laundering by placing illegal proceeds in formal financial institutions pretending they are earnings of a legitimate business front companies operated by hawala dealers assist these placements they complete the layering of criminal proceeds distributing transfers over a period of time at the integration stage of the money laundering process illicit money is invested in legitimate businesses purchase of property or import export invoices netherlands authorities have found out that laundromats grocery stores and phone shops have been used as illegal money remittance businesses during 2010 2012 eight million euros have been seized by the public prosecutor s office in amsterdam in 2011 manhattan federal court arrested a person operated an unlicensed money transfer business between the usa and pakistan one of its transactions was used to fund the attempted car bombing in new york city s times square in 2010 the owner of an ice cream shop named carnival ice cream was arrested in brooklyn in 2003 he maintained an account in j p morgan chase bank to collect the funds to be transferred to al qaeda the uae in collaboration with the united states department of treasury blocked albakarat s a somali based hawala operation assets in dubai discouraging the existence of informal remittance systems opportunities available for ivts operators such as hawala should be restricted through effective compliance with laws applicable to money transfers in terms of the regulations issued under the foreign exchange act no 12 of 2017 a person arriving in sri lanka may carry any amount of foreign currency in the form of foreign currency notes bank drafts cheques travel cards etc if that amount exceeds 15 000 or its equivalent in any other foreign currency or such a person intends to take back foreign currency notes exceeding 10 000 a declaration shall be made to sri lanka customs according to available reports cash carriers facilitate hawala operations hawala brokers can settle each other through cash carriers as well therefore the vigilance of sri lanka customs over currency imports needs to be strengthened analysing such cash declaration reports would also facilitate conducting investigations into terrorism financing and money laundering regulations issued under the financial transaction reporting act ftra no 6 of 2006 are applicable when funds arechannelled through banks there is a possibility of detecting bulk remittances by hawala brokers if such funds come through banks both the remitting and recipient banks are required to exercise enhanced due diligence over the source of funds purpose of the remittance and ultimate beneficiary of a fund transfer according to section 7 of ftra irrespective of the amount involved all suspicious transactions strs are required to be reported to the financial intelligence unit fiu of the central bank of sri lanka cbsl any cash transaction or electronic fund transfer that exceeds rs 1 million or its equivalent in foreign currency is reported under cash transaction reports ctrs to the fiu as per the section 6 of the ftra compliance of financial institutions with the said reporting requirements and thorough analysis of the patters of transactions local credits to accounts inward and outward remittances based on above said ctr and str is of paramount importance in identifying local cash pools of hawalabrokers money launderers and terrorist financiers frankfurter allgemeinezeitung 2000 reports that it would be difficult to recognise concealed use of conventional banking by hawala operators as their accounts are registered in the name of individuals small businesses or the like whose background the bank is unlikely to examine thoroughly among the red flags of transaction patterns that are often associated with hawala systemscredits to the accounts ofbusinesses that do not have an apparent link with other businesses activities significant deposit activity in cash cheques different book keeping methods for customers and transactions that have no commercial or economic sense for a personal account can be highlighted officers of banks and financial institutions have therefore a critical role to play in reporting such suspicious transactions this responsibility to exercise enhanced due diligence over the customers extends to the designated non finance businesses stipulated under ftra as well these include real estate agents dealers in precious and semi precious metals lawyers notaries accountants etc strengthening the legal framework to combathawala in terms of the foreign exchange act foreign currency can be purchased for permitted transactions only from authorised and restricted dealers in sri lanka licensed banks and authorised money changers function as such dealers in foreign exchange authorised money changers have been appointed to enhance the flow of foreign currency into banking channels if they do not deposit the foreign currency purchased by them as per the conditions stipulated in the permit issued by the director foreign exchange of the cbsl there may be possibilities of selling such funds to black market operators including hawalabrokers the fatf has also revealed that in many countries regulated money transfer agents are reportedly used to conduct illegal hawala transactions separately and covertly in addition to their regulated activities such market structure makes it more difficult for the regulators to implement the law against offenders although the transfer of funds overseas by persons in or resident in sri lanka using hawala system is prohibited under section 4 3 of the foreign exchange act there is no prohibition for persons in or resident in sri lanka to receive funds through hawala system from a foreign entity person in terms of the provisions of section 3 of the foreign exchange management act of india receiving funds by a resident via reverse hawala operations is an offence assistance of all stakeholders to expedite the amendments suggested by the department of foreign exchange of cbsl would be important in combating hawala in all its different forms effectively fatf is of the view that completely unregulated remittance operators are particularly vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks as they permit funds to be sent with no customer due diligence requirements funds remitted through hawala cannot be monitored as there is no paper trail such systems can be discouraged by promoting formal remittance channels particularly through reducing transaction costs promoting formal remittance schemes enhancing the competitiveness in the remittance industry in accordance with special recommendation vi of the fatf would also be helpful in curtailing the use of hawala operations for money laundering and financing of terrorism it will also be advantageous to attract worker remittances to legal channels such competition should however be supported by proper governance and risk management practices in developed countries hawala and other informal remittance schemesare allowed to be licensed or registered thisenablesmaking unlicensed unregistered entities illegal and taking actions against them according to fatf recommendation vi each country should ensure that persons or legal entities that carry out the money transfer service illegally are subject to administrative civil or criminal sanctions however such a comprehensive framework to distinguish black and white hawala requires providing adequate resources and securing the assistance of law enforcement agencies for the regulators the uae issued abu dabi declaration imposing a licensing requirement while recognising the need for hawala operation for legitimate purposes of unbanked communities the imf says that informal fund transfer systems declined in the countries where financial systems are liberalised the provisions of the payments and settlements act no 28 of 2005 of sri lanka provide for licensing money transfer service businesses however identifying the dynamics of hawala and other similar remittance services in the broader context ofthe financial system is important prior to designing anall inclusive regulatory regime for the remittance market adverse economic impact scholars point out that continued existence of hawala threatens the country s economy as it is beyond all the standard instruments of macro economic policy informal remittances are not recorded in official statistics or the foreign assets of a recipient country they are not reflected as liabilities of the remitting countries since the informal remittances increase the circulation of cash in the recipient country and affect the composition of broad money there may be an adverse impact on monetary policy there may also be a negative fiscal implication as the funds routed through informal channels are not subject to taxes according to the imf accurate compilation of informal fund transfer systems such as hawala in balance of payments accounts is difficult studies carried out by the united nations and interpol state that the volume of financial transactions in the hawala network at times substantially exceeds that in the formal banking sector it is estimated that more than 7 billion enters into pakistan every year through hawala interpol estimates the size of hawala at possibly 40 of the india s gdp it is also estimated that every year approximately 200 billion moves around the world through hawala system without being detected by regulators when informal fund transfer systems operate efficiently without any disturbance tendency to channel legitimate transfers also through those systems maybe created in 2018 workers remittances to sri lanka has declined by 2 1 to 7 015million as depicted in the table it would be interesting to know whether the decline of the use of banking channels by migrant workers have also contributed tothe reduction of remittances according to ratha 2006 the funds remitted to sri lanka annually through informal channels could be as much as half of formal remittances received by the country attracting worker remittance through formal channels would be important in discouraging informal remittance schemes in sri lanka particularly in the context of the current elevated threat levels which demand increased vigilance against terrorist financing it can be suggested that the sri lanka foreign employment bureau can implement a strategic plan in collaboration with banks and the foreign missions abroad to attract remittances by undocumented workers workers with expired visa and first time migrant worker to formal channels it can also be suggested to make the requirement to open a personal foreign currency account by expatriate workers as a condition at the time of giving approvals for foreign employments engaging with the formal sector however will be discouraged if the recipients are supposed to travel long distances to collect their money and required to fulfil rigid formalities in order to expand the access to formal remittance channels by migrant workers and their recipients the competition in the market needs to be enhanced new entrants coupled with technological advancements such as digital payments mobile payments should also be promoted financial sector stakeholders will have a role to play in balancing technological development and financial inclusion while preserving the integrity of the system conclusion smooth coordination and timely sharing of relevant and reliable information among law enforcement regulatory authorities and financial institutions as well as the other public agencies are of paramount importance in effective combating of the hawala system it reduces the delays in investigation processes and facilitates bringing perpetratorsto book while preserving the public confidence in the legal system hawala has proved to be an effective mechanism to hide the illicit origin of money and its destination and break the audit trail of money therefore awareness of all the above mentioned stakeholders and the general public regarding the informal remittance systems should be enhanced political commitment is also essential to tackle all sources techniques and channels of terrorist financing as long as there are safe spaces for money launders terrorist financiers and other criminals they continue to pose threats to the national security integrity of financial system and accuracy of economic fundamentals we need new partnerships in fighting terrorism and

there s no question that many farmers are struggling this year with incomes down and bankruptcies up though some of the more dire reports on the farm sector recorded in the media are exaggerated what is indisputable is that prices for major commodities such as corn are on a downward trend and are significantly lower than they were less than a decade ago when prices were at or near record highs it s natural to blame any declines in the farm economy on the tariff war with china the trade dispute has certainly hurt the farm sector as the higher chinese tariffs on american agriculture has reduced demand for their crops especially the farm belt states of the midwest even president donald trump himself has admitted that the trade war has hurt farmers which is why he wants to send some of the money raised by his tariffs to the farmers directly but something else is going on here that is negatively impacting the farm states that existed before any trade war the daily headlines of a tariff war have overshadowed what might be an even bigger and longer term problem for farmers tight monetary policy at the federal reserve which has squeezed commodity prices across the board over the past year an index of all commodity prices including everything from oil to copper to timber to soybeans has recorded a price reduction of roughly 10 eight of the 10 major agriculture commodities have been falling in price why is that happening it isn t good weather or bumper crops because the losses are being felt across regions and hitting almost all the major crops one explanation for the farmers woes is tight money we know from historical experience that when money is loose and the printing presses shower the economy with cheap dollars commodity prices soar as in the 1970s when grocery bills soared when money is excessively tight as it is now commodity prices fall when almost all of the commodities from corn to copper to timber start to fall in price at the same time it is a pretty good signal that our monetary system is out of whack farmers are often the frontline victims of commodity deflation the extreme example of course was the great depression when farm bankruptcies skyrocketed with thin profit margins to begin with in a highly competitive global food market many farmers are being unnecessarily hurt by having to swallow an 8 reduction in prices following a similar decline last year of course free markets not government subsidies or fed monetary policy should determine which farmers should stay in business and which will fail the way to reduce artificial price fluctuations in the agricultural sector of our economy and get quick relief for our farmers is for the fed to increase dollar liquidity into our high flying american economy this would be an effective and overdue way for our nation s farmers to experience greater profits this reflation policy makes sense now given that the threat of economy wide inflation at this stage is minimal to nonexistent the dollar is strong thanks to world demand for dollars and the growth in output due to tax cuts and deregulation is pushing out the supply of goods and services which is deflationary not inflationary there isn t a whiff of inflation in consumer prices except for education and health care the wall street journal reports that the fed has undershot its inflation target 2 growth in the consumer price index for four months running the fed is hesitant to cut interest rates because it believes wrongly that a booming economy causes inflation which is a long ago dead keynesian idea a modest reflation would put some extra juice into the farm sector this would put added pressure on the chinese to make a deal with the trump administration that deal would press for the elimination of china s punitive tariffs on our farm products and open up markets to other made in america products this would also counter the brazen chinese strategy of meddling in american elections by intentionally targeting tariffs on farm products produced by rural voters in key battle ground states in the 2020 elections america has the most productive farmers in the world so a trade agreement that ratchets down tariffs on both sides of the pacific would greatly benefit the farm belt combining that with a monetary policy by the fed that allows the economy to continue to grow without inflation would help our farmers and workers across all industries and without one dime of taxpayer assistance copyright 2019 creators com
