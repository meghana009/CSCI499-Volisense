ahead of the herd has been digging into why central banks are buying a lot of gold recently what we ve found is eyebrow raising to say the least it may be the best reason you ve ever read for wanting to buy gold take this headline from the northern miner editorial central banks are major gold buyers in 2019 citing statistics from the world gold council the northern miner reports that central banks netted 51 tonnes in gold purchases the most since october 2018 when they increased gold held in central bank vaults by 105 tonnes switching to ounces the miner states that gold holdings grew by a startling 2 9 million ounces in january and february 2019 versus 1 9 moz during the same period of 2018 this is the highest level of gold buying by central banks since the first two months of 2008 during the financial crisis central banks backed up the truck for gold in 2018 buying 651 5 tonnes versus 375 tonnes in 2017 that s the largest net purchase of gold since 1967 the miner suggests that anti us sentiment is at the root of all this central bank gold buying and yes there is a distinct geopolitical element to it all as these central bank buyers are predominantly from countries that stand in direct economic or political opposition to the u s and so are keen to move away from the u s dollar as a foreign reserve currency case in point the top two purchasers were russia and turkey russia is actively seeking to reduce its dependence on the greenback in an effort to skirt us sanctions for among other things interfering in the us presidential election and invading crimea the kremlin stopped buying foreign currency in september 2018 to prevent the ruble from crashing due to sanctions instead the russian central bank turned to gold buying a record 274 3 tonnes in 2018 according to bne intellinews while selling a whack of us treasuries bringing its share of the us dollar as a foreign reserve down from 43 7 to 20 between march and may of last year russia sold off 84 of its us debt holdings leaving just 14 9 billion in its us reserve account turkey needs gold to protect itself against a sluggish economy over the past year the lira has lost 30 of its value making it difficult for consumers to buy imported goods gold buying is one way to support the lira versus purchasing us treasuries which is difficult to do with the relative strength of the us dollar a couple of years ago turkey s president erdogan called on citizens to buy gold and they have those who keep dollar or euro currency under their mattresses should come and turn them into liras or gold goldcore summarizes the situation in turkey viz a viz gold the push for support for gold is two fold first it is an attempt to boost trust in the central banking system which is in increasingly dire straights the second is to support the underlying currency which is central to the axis of gold h t jim rickards that is russia china turkey and iran both of these things push back against us dollar hegemony and there we have it the reason for central banks recent gold accumulations has little to do with safe havens and a lot to do with chipping away at the us dollar s role as the reserve

regain some of its footing meanwhile nine weeks of losses in the last 10 have the lira sliding back toward six to the dollar the level that set alarm bells ringing last year ankara s economic reform plans announced on wednesday failed to impress markets and investor meetings with finance minister berat albayrak at the imf and world bank spring meetings did little to change that ankara s row with

originally published on marc to market in the big picture we argue that the dollar s appreciation is part of the third significant dollar rally since the end of bretton woods the first was the reagan volcker dollar rally spurred by a policy mix of tight monetary and loose fiscal policies the rally ended with g7 intervention to knock it down in september 1985 after a 10 year bear market a second dollar rally took place it can be linked to the tech bubble and the shift to a strong dollar policy the carving out of the internet drew capital into the u s and induced americans to keep their savings here it may or may not have been enough to fuel a multi year dollar advance rubin replaced bentsen at the helm of treasury and nearly immediately articulated a shift in policy no longer would the u s use the dollar as a trade weapon as previous administrations and officials had the u s would not engineer a weaker dollar to reduce its debt burden this is the essence of the strong dollar policy the u s first unilaterally disarmed and then succeeded in convincing the g7 and g20 that de weaponizing the foreign exchange market was the best practice however old habits die hard during the clinton dollar rally the euro was born and immediately depreciated it fell from around 1 19 to below 0 85 they cried quit picking on our euro though the market was really accumulating u s assets in october 2000 after summers replaced rubin and at the request of europe there was coordinated intervention to buy the euro and sell the dollar the official action and the popping of the tech bubble marked the end of the clinton dollar rally the greenback went into another multi year bear market the obama dollar rally began from extreme levels in 2008 the euro reached 1 60 sterling was above 2 00 the australian dollar was near 1 00 and the canadian dollar was above parity in the face of the great financial crisis and despite the slowness to recognize the magnitude of the problem the u s acted relatively early and relatively aggressively this unleashed the key fuel for the obama dollar rally divergence the u s economy recovered sooner and stronger than most of the other major centers europe was hit not only by the financial shock that emanated from the u s and their bank exposures but it paralyzed the relationship between creditors and debtors in europe the european phase of the crisis began in greece and despite the geography lessons by various officials every debtor country became greece japan already had very low interest rates before the great financial crisis the yen s role as a financing currency gave it the appearance of a safe haven when its strength largely a function of short covering retail investors mostly focus on the appreciation of the asset they buy institutional investors also seek to lower their funding costs and borrowing the low yielding yen to finance equity or bond purchases is a common tactic used by leveraged accounts aside from the japanese investors themselves japanese officials seemed to dawdle until abe was elected and kuroda became the governor of the bank of japan the second phase of the obama dollar rally began with the election of trump in 2016 both leading candidates in the presidential election promised fiscal expansion the federal reserve began the gradual process toward policy normalization the combination of expanding fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy was a repeat though on a smaller scale of the reagan volcker policy mix with fiscal stimulus winding down the dollar may enter the third phase of its super cycle a return to divergence recall the global slowdown began in the second half of 2018 but the fiscal stimulus that is saddling the u s with more a trillion dollar a year deficit helped mitigate the pressure it grew at an average pace of 3 8 percent in the middle two quarters last year the german and japanese contraction in the third and fourth quarter was only a little better the italian economy contracted in both quarters the european central bank s policy response has been to push out its commitment not to raise interest rates and prepare for a new long term loan facility tltro iii the bank of japan unlike the ecb continues to buy a range of assets including corporate bonds and equities abe has appointed a couple of members to the bank of japan board that dissent in favor of new measures to reach in the inflation target but there seems to be little appetite for more asset purchases or deeper negative interest rates pressure is building to postpone again the sales tax increase that is to kick in oct 1 the government has already enacted measures that are hoped to offset the economic impact of the tax increase abe campaigned for his third term last year backing the tax increase over opposition that wanted to abolish it entirely the u s economy began the year on soft footing it appeared to have nearly stagnated the atlanta fed s gdp tracker started the quarter with a sub 0 5 percent projection it now stands at 2 3 percent a touch above fourth quarter 2018 s 2 2 percent pace this is a little above what most fed official see as the long term non inflationary pace the high frequency data in the coming days should depict an economy that is on the mend a return to the status quo ante the pre stimulus pace of growth the average u s quarterly growth annualized in 2017 of 2 5 percent and 1 9 percent in 2016 manufacturing output likely increased for the first time this year the broader measure of industrial production may have also accelerated the american consumer likely made up for lost time retail sales fell at an annualized rate of about 4 5 percent in the december through february period march retail sales rose by 0 9 percent according to the median forecast in the bloomberg survey the components used for gdp calculations are expected to rise by 0 5 percent after falling 0 2 percent in february the leading economic indicator averaged 0 5 percent in the third quarter of 2018 and fell to 0 1 percent in the fourth quarter it may have risen by 0 4 percent in march which would be the strongest since last september it lends credence to our hypothesis that the economy did hit a soft patch but it is resilient and is already emerging the most important data point from the euro area will be the flash april pmi on april 18 recall that in march france s manufacturing and service pmi were below the 50 boom bust level the german manufacturing pmi was below 50 a small to modest improvement is unlikely to change the ecb s assessment that risks to its outlook remain on the downside three headwinds impacting the u s have lifted the drop in equities reversed and bond prices are higher the government re opened and the weather is less extreme europe is not as fortunate its headwinds have barely lifted the uncertainties over brexit continue the disruption from turkey has not been fully absorbed policy initiatives seem frozen ahead of european parliament election at the end of next month the u s announced 11 billion in tariffs on european goods for subsidies to airbus that the world trade organization ruled illegal this was a shot across the bow and warns of difficult trade talks that lie ahead the u s continues to threaten 25 percent tariffs on auto imports which would be a significant blow especially at a time when european industry is already challenged japan moves into the spotlight next week as the bilateral trade talks with the us formally begin in washington prime minister abe is expected to visit the u s later this month before trump visits tokyo next month and meets the new emperor pulling out of the trans pacific partnership has trump playing catch up other agriculture surplus countries like canada and australia have better access to the japanese market now the u s is defending a little more than a 20 percent market share of japan s agriculture imports japan cannot give the u s better terms than it conceded in tpp negotiations which ironically the u s played an important role japan enjoys around a 65 billion trade merchandise surplus with the u s the u s runs a chronic surplus in services with japan the u s is fond of citing the merchandise imbalance while forgetting the service surplus tariffs on autos and auto parts like the u s threatens would be a shock for an economy that seems to be barely growing u s japan talks could have two parts the first is to pick the low hanging fruit like granting the u s the same terms as the tpp this would give trump a success while not distracting japan ahead of the upper house election in july and the g20 meeting it hosts for the first time in late june disclaimer
a spate of recent extreme weather events from hurricanes and wildfires in the u s to heat waves in europe has put a spotlight on climate related risks yet climate related portfolio risks have been hard to pinpoint until recently advances in climate and data science now allow us to assess the financial risks on a localized level chart of the week estimated u s gdp impacts under no climate action scenario 2060 2080 sources blackrock investment institute with data from rhodium group march 2019 notes the map shows the projected gdp impact in 2060 2080 on u s metropolitan areas under a no climate action scenario climate changes are measured relative to a 1980 baseline the analysis includes the effect of changes in crime and mortality rates labor productivity heating and cooling demand agricultural productivity for bulk commodity crops and expected annual losses from coastal storms it accounts for correlations across these variables and through time and excludes a number of difficult to measure variables such as migration and inland flooding see rhodium group s march 2019 paper clear present and underpriced the physical risks of climate change for further details on its methodology forward looking estimates may not come to pass we can now analyze direct physical risks such as probabilities of flooding and hurricane force winds on a granular level across the u s researchers across blackrock have used data from rhodium group to estimate potential direct financial damages as well as indirect effects such as the impact of rising average temperatures on crop yields or labor productivity the heat map shows projected changes in regional economic activity under a no climate action scenario assuming ongoing use of fossil fuels the risks are asymmetric some 58 of u s metro areas would see likely gross domestic product gdp losses of 1 or more by 2080 with less than 1 set to enjoy gains of similar magnitude we estimate the biggest likely losers arizona the gulf coast region and coastal florida investing implications the potential losses from a changing climate are not baked in as suggested by our recent publication getting physical assessing climate risks decisive actions to curb carbon emissions could mitigate the damage but the vulnerabilities revealed in our evolving research led by blackrock s sustainable investing and global fixed income teams can help investors get a better handle on physical climate risks the risks are especially relevant for physical assets with long lifespans it is why blackrock s research first focused on three sectors with long dated assets that can be located with precision u s municipal bonds commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and electric utilities our early findings suggest investors must rethink their assessment of vulnerabilities climate related risks already threaten portfolios today and are set to grow we find take the potential impact on the creditworthiness of u s municipal bond issuers a rising share of issuance in the 3 8 trillion market is set to come from regions facing climate related economic losses blackrock s research shows within a decade more than 15 of the current s p national municipal bond index by market value would come from u s regions suffering likely average annualized losses from climate change of up to 0 5 to 1 of gdp we estimate climate risk is also a growing concern for cmbs owners to illustrate we overlaid rhodium s hurricane modeling onto the roughly 60 000 commercial properties in blackrock s proprietary cmbs database the median risk of one of these properties being hit by a category 4 or 5 hurricane has risen by 137 since 1980 we found lastly we assessed the exposure to climate risk of 269 publicly listed u s utilities based on the location of their plants property and equipment a key conclusion vulnerability to weather events is underpriced in u s utility equities this leaves owners of such securities exposed to temporary price and volatility shocks we plan to extend our analysis across global markets asset classes and sectors as data availability improves from the early focus on u s assets the key takeaway climate change is increasingly a risk that investors cannot afford to ignore integrating insights on climate related risks is important for investors in all asset classes and regions and can help enhance portfolio resilience we believe week in review the european central bank kept its policy unchanged and signaled the potential for more support for the weak eurozone economy minutes from the federal reserve s latest policy meeting confirmed the patient stance adopted by policymakers china s new bank loans in march grew more than expected reflecting ongoing stimulus efforts chinese exports beat expectations but imports remained subdued crude oil prices rose above 70 a barrel for the first time in five months supported by output cuts led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and sharp drops in venezuela s production the u s threatened tariffs on 11 billion worth of european union eu products the latest escalation in a 15 year fight over government subsidies to plane makers

u s a slowing but still growing economy underlies our positive view we prefer quality companies with strong balance sheets in a late cycle environment health care and technology are among our favored sectors europe weak economic momentum and political risks are challenges to earnings growth a value bias makes europe less attractive without a clear catalyst for value outperformance we prefer higher quality globally oriented firms japan cheap valuations are supportive along with shareholder friendly corporate behavior central bank stock buying and political stability earnings uncertainty is a key risk em economic reforms and policy stimulus support em stocks improved consumption and economic activity from chinese stimulus could help offset any trade related weakness we see the greatest opportunities in em asia asia ex japan the economic backdrop is encouraging with near term resilience in china and solid corporate earnings we like selected southeast asian markets but recognize a worse than expected chinese slowdown or disruptions in global trade would pose risks to the entire region fixed income u s government bonds we are cautious on u s treasury valuations after the recent rally but still see them as portfolio diversifiers given their negative correlation with equities we expect a gradual steepening of the yield curve driven by still solid u s growth a fed willing to tolerate inflation overshoots and a potential shift in the fed s balance sheet toward shorter term maturities this supports two to five year maturities and inflation protected securities u s municipals we see coupon like returns amid a benign interest rate backdrop and favorable supply demand dynamics new issuance is lagging the total amount of debt that is called refunded or matures the tax overhaul has made munis tax exempt status more attractive in many u s states driving inflows u s credit a still growing economy reduced macro volatility and a decline in issuance support credit markets conservative corporate behavior including lower mergers acquisitions volume and a focus on balance sheet strength also helps we favor bbbs and prefer bonds over loans in high yield european sovereigns low yields european political risks and the potential for a market reassessment of easy ecb policy or pessimistic euro area growth expectations all make us wary on european sovereigns particularly peripherals yet any further deterioration in u s european trade tensions could push yields lower european credit low for longer ecb policy should reduce market volatility and support credit as a source of income european bank balance sheets have improved after years of repair underpinning fundamentals yet valuations are rich after a dramatic rally we prefer high yield credits supported by muted issuance and strong inflows em debt prospects for a chinese growth turnaround and a pause in u s dollar strength support both local and hard currency markets valuations are attractive despite the recent rally with limited issuance adding to positives risks include worsening u s china relations and slower global growth asia fixed income a focus on quality is prudent in credit we favor investment grade in india china and parts of the middle east and high yield in indonesia we are cautious on chinese government debt despite its inclusion in global indexes from april we see rising funding needs outstripping foreign inflows other commodities and currencies a reversal of recent oversupply is likely to underpin oil prices any relaxation in trade tensions could boost

officer thank you shub good morning i m pleased to speak to you this morning about our first quarter 2019 results it s been two months since our last call and a lot has happened in that time including kicking off a few strategic initiatives promotions in our agency network leadership and some notable industry awards importantly we got off to a good start with our financial results in the first quarter organic growth was 2 5 and was in line with our internal targets our operating profits and ebitda margin of 13 for the quarter exceeded our expectations the improved performance is attributable to a number of factors including the continuing benefits from omnicomwide cost initiatives the impact of dispositions completed in 2018 and a small gain from a few additional dispositions completed in the first quarter of 2019 the upsides were offset in part by the negative effect of foreign exchange on our operating results phil will provide you more detail when he gets to his remarks and eps for the quarter was up 8 3 to 1 17 per share excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit from the successful resolution of foreign tax claims recorded in the first quarter of 2018 the results continue to demonstrate the consistency and diversity of omnicom s operations our ability to deliver consumer centric strategic business solutions to our clients and our best in industry creative talent combined with market leading digital data and analytical expertise in the quarter we grew organically in every geographic region of the world with the exception of latin america this growth was achieved through broad participation across all of our agencies disciplines and client sectors looking first across disciplines advertising and media was up 5 1 crm consumer experience was down less than 1 strong performance in our precision marketing group business was offset by a negative performance in our events business healthcare was up 6 8 with virtually all of our businesses in this discipline performing well pr was down 0 5 we are seeing some positive signs in certain areas of our pr operations and believe the growth strategies being implemented by our management teams will result in better performance and as expected crm execution and support was down 3 3 during the quarter we sold marketstar a provider of outsourced sales support and services based in utah marketstar is a very similar business to sellbytel which we sold in the third quarter of 2018 as i previously mentioned we also divested a few other small businesses in our portfolio during the quarter in line with our strategy of divesting non core and underperforming operations advertisement advertisement turning now to our performance by geography the us was up 2 in the quarter driven by strong performance in advertising and media healthcare and our precision marketing group offset by the decline in our events business beyond the us the north american region primarily consisting of canada was up 6 1 in the quarter the uk was up 1 3 led by advertising and media precision marketing and healthcare this performance was offset by declines in our events and crm execution businesses overall growth in the euro and non euro region was 4 in the euro markets the netherlands and spain have better than average growth and germany also performed well france was negative in the quarter primarily due to the loss of the specialty print production client in the non euro markets the czech republic and russia had very good growth asia pacific s first quarter organic growth was 2 1 as australia india and new zealand performed very well in the quarter china was negatively impacted by the delay of several projects and events it s our current expectation that these projects will go forward but later in the year latin america was down 3 as another quarter of solid operating results in mexico was offset by the continuing negative performance in brazil we expect 2019 will continue to be a difficult year in brazil our smallest region the middle east and africa grew 12 8 let me now discuss what we were seeing in the industry and how our strategies enable us to achieve consistent financial performance over the past couple of years omnicom initiated numerous changes in response to our clients needs as a result we are continuing to adjust and reorganize our businesses and management teams in order to improve the speed of decision making we are organized within our network structure into 12 practice areas the last practice area we formed the omnicom retail group was announced in march we ve expanded a number of top clients in our global client leaders group from 25 to 100 we have further consolidated our data and analytics and technology services and investments at annalect we launched omni our proprietary data and analytics platform the platform is in the process of being rolled out to our top clients we ve also expanded our investments in training and development of our people so they can use these tools we ve expanded our consulting services and capabilities and we ve consolidated our production services across all major markets and as i ll get to in a couple of minutes we continue to streamline our media offering expanding on some of these initiatives in march we announced the formation of a new center of excellence to advance our commerce capabilities omnicom retail group the new group is leveraging expertise to increase conversion and transactions for clients both online and offline it brings together five award winning agencies with exceptional creativity strategic thinking and deep client and category experience the integer group tracylocke haygarth tpn and the marketing arm these agencies together employ over 2 500 people across 19 markets omnicom s retail group agencies will continue to invest in advanced shopper knowledge and drive innovation and thought leadership in shopper and retail marketing sophie daranyi formerly the ceo of haygarth a creative agency specializing in brand shopper and retail marketing was named ceo of omnicom retail group advertisement advertisement turning now to our global client leaders group we ve expanded this group to 100 clients the responsibilities of the global client leaders include ensuring our clients are receiving the highest quality marketing and communication services from our agencies creating and managing agile client teams with best of breed talent and skills breaking down existing agency silos by organizing internal teams within and across practice area groups and offering our clients the breadth of our services as their needs change we also expanded our c suite consulting services last year we added credera and levo to our other consulting services which include batten daggerwing sparks honey tlgg and several other consulting units that have been developed organically to serve our clients needs as a result we are increasingly changing the manner in which we engage with our clients as these practices develop we expect to have more opportunities to offer our clients tip of the spear solutions that tackle business problems during the quarter we also made some important strategic changes in our media operations as you may recall about a decade ago we formed accuen for programmatic services and resolution media for search social and performance marketing at the time when these services were in their formative stages we needed dedicated units with real subject matter experts to support our media agencies today these services are no longer a specialty they are at the core of how we work with our media clients as a result we are fully integrating these capabilities involving about 600 people in the united states alone into our media agencies hearts science omd and phd with this reorganization we ve simplified our structure by expanding the capabilities of our client teams we expect these changes to increase our speed agility and the quality of service to clients to further this effort omnicom media group made several management changes to ensure that the next generation of media agency leaders have an understanding of creativity and a deep expertise in digital data and analytics scott hagedorn was named ceo of north american operations at omnicom media group following his previous positions as the ceo of hearts science and ceo of annalect he began his career as a brand planner at rapp scott will be partnered with john swift who was named coo of omnicom media group north america john has substantial operating experience having led our us media buying organization as well as developing a number of our specialty media business units with scott s move erin matts who previously served as ceo of annalect north america has been named ceo of hearts science in the us following the integration of resolution media and accuen capabilities into our media brands george manas has been named chief media officer at omd us and anthony koziarski is taking the same role at phd usa resolution media will continue as an agency focused on non network clients that seek dedicated performance only media services while we have undertaken numerous organizational changes our philosophy to support strong brands and cultures so they can be vital incubators for creativity and innovation as well as magnets for the best talent has not changed we believe our approach is a significant competitive advantage in retaining and hiring the best people and in servicing our clients our major brands have their own unique positioning and go to market strategies but a common overarching theme is our commitment to the concept of connected creativity we are using data analytics cultural insights and technology tools from our omni platform to create and deliver a powerful brand voice that connects with consumers across every touch point whether it s marketing sales service or support and through all mediums it s important to distinguish that omni serves as a platform of extremely valuable information just as important our agencies continue to significantly invest in educating and training their people and hiring new talent that can interpret and use this information this is a fundamental and constant change at our agencies and one which will allow us to remain a key partner for innovation to our clients especially as the marketplace rapidly evolves as evidence that these key themes and strategies are positively impacting our work let me just mention a few of the recent highlights of our agencies being recognized around the globe omd was named adweek s 2019 global media agency of the year in warc s best of the best rankings bbdo was ranked the number 1 network bbdo new york received number 1 agency followed by adam eve ddb omnicom won the world s most awarded holding company ketchum was named best agency of the past 20 years at the 20th annual prweek awards at

to the talent here at omnicom we ve always strived to be a great place for people to work which includes creating a safe and inclusive environment for all employees regarding of race religion gender or sexuality part of the commitment to attracting retaining and developing the best talent means continuing to place a strong emphasis on our diversity and inclusion efforts indeed we ve made some strides in diversity and inclusion in the first quarter for the third year in a row we received 100 on human rights campaign corporate equality index the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertinent to lgbtq employees omnicom also received distinction of the best place to work for lgbtq equality and omnicom is an official member of the valuable 500 a global movement putting disability inclusion on the leadership agenda of businesses in summary we ve made significant strides in changing our services capability and organization we are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter which continue to reflect the benefits of our strategies while it is early in the year we re on track for where we expect to be for the full year 2019 advertisement advertisement i will now turn the call over to phil for a closer look at the first quarter results phil philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john and good morning as john said our results for the first quarter of 2019 were better than our expectations while organic revenue growth was within our expected range our operating profit and margins were stronger than we expected our results were driven by several items including the strong performance of our agencies the continuing impact of our cost efficiency initiatives plus some benefits from the repositioning actions we took in the third quarter of 2018 including a favorable change in business mix in the quarter from the disposition of certain non strategic under performing agencies in the second half of 2018 in addition we recorded a net gain on a few smaller dispositions in q1 which after considering the effect the negative impact fx translation had on our operating profit also had a slightly positive impact on our margins starting on slide 3 for the first quarter organic revenue growth totaled 2 5 or 91 million additionally due to the continued strengthening of the us dollar since the second half of last year changes in currency rates negatively impacted our reported revenue by 122 million or 3 4 advertisement advertisement and finally dispositions in connection with our repositioning actions primarily in our crm execution and support discipline exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter as we continue to cycle through the disposals we made in the second half of 2018 the net impact from acquisitions and dispositions reduced our first quarter revenue by 130 million or about 3 6 in total our reported revenue decreased 4 4 to 3 5 billion in the quarter in a few minutes i will discuss the drivers of the changes in revenue in more detail turning to slide 1 in the income statement items below revenue our q1 ebita was 451 million up 1 million from q1 of 18 or 0 3 with the resulting ebita margin of 13 up 60 basis points our operating income or ebit for the quarter was 429 million up 1 7 when compared to the first quarter of last year while our operating margin of 12 4 represented an 80 basis point improvement over q1 of last year a few key points in regards to our margin improvement we continue to seek out opportunities to increase operational efficiencies these initiatives are primarily focused in the areas of real estate back office services procurement and it and continue to positively impact our operating performance additionally as we described last quarter we continue to see benefits from the change in business mix resulting from the disposition of several non strategic lower margin or underperforming agencies and lastly during the quarter we recorded a net gain on the disposition of a few agencies including marketstar a us based sales support business which after considering the effect of the negative impact of fx translation on our operating profit had a slightly positive impact on our margins net interest expense for the quarter was 46 million down 900 000 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 7 1 million versus q4 of 2018 interest expense on our debt increased 3 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus q1 of 18 reflecting higher rates on our fixed to floating interest rate swaps which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on commercial paper compared to the prior year to take advantage of a unique opportunity in february 2019 we issued eur520 million of short term senior notes in a private placement to an investor outside the united states the notes are unsecured non interest bearing and mature in august 2019 as a result in the first quarter of 2019 we were able to substantially reduce our other short term borrowing needs including our commercial paper issuances the reduction in commercial paper borrowing is expected to continue through the maturity of the notes in q3 interest income increased 1 6 million versus q1 of 2018 reflecting higher cash balances available for investment and when compared to q4 of 2018 interest expense on our debt decreased 2 9 million due to the decrease in commercial paper activity as described above interest and amortization expense on our pension obligations also decreased versus last quarter and lastly we also saw an increase in our interest income versus q4 advertisement advertisement regarding income taxes our reported effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26 8 in line with our expected 2019 full year rate as a reminder last year s q1 tax rate benefited from the successful resolution of foreign tax claims which reduced last year s quarterly income tax expense by 13 3 million earnings from our affiliates was marginally negative in the first quarter of 2019 while the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased to 16 5 million due to our disposition activity as well as the impact of fx as a result net income for the first quarter was 263 million down slightly when compared to our reported q1 2018 net income but after excluding the 13 3 million addition to net income from the settlement of the foreign tax claims from last year 2019 s net income would have increased 4 9 now turning to slide 2 income available for common shareholders for the quarter was also 263 million and our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 3 1 versus q1 of last year to 224 2 million as a result our diluted eps for the first quarter was 1 17 which increased 0 03 or 2 6 when compared to our reported q1 eps for last year the positive impact from the settlement of the foreign tax claims increased last year s eps by 0 06 so excluding this item the increase versus last year s first quarter would have been 0 09 or 8 3 turning to components of our revenue change in the first quarter which are detailed on page 3 on a year over year basis us dollar s continued strengthening created a large headwinds in our reported revenue the impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 3 4 or 122 million in revenue for the quarter and as has been the case for the last two quarters the strengthening was widespread on a year over year basis in the first quarter the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies the largest fx movements in the quarter are from the euro the uk pound the australian dollar and the brazilian reis looking forward if currency stay where they currently are fx could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 2 5 during the second quarter but then moderate in the second half of the year resulting in a negative impact of approximately 25 basis points for the second half and 1 5 for the full year but obviously it s difficult to make assumptions on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the balance of 2019 advertisement advertisement the impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 130 million in the quarter or 3 6 primarily driven by the sellbytel disposition and other actions we took in the second half of last year and a few dispositions we completed in the back half of the first quarter based on transactions we ve completed to date and since we will cycle through the most significant of last year s dispositions by the end of the third quarter our current expectations are that the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will continue to be negative approximately 4 for the second quarter and approximately 3 for the third quarter and for the full year turning to organic growth which was up 91 million on a global basis for the quarter were 2 5 the performance of our disciplines was mixed our advertising and healthcare disciplines both had solid organic growth in the quarter crm consumer experience was marginally negative due primarily to reductions in revenue at our events businesses which offset strong performance in our precision marketing agencies in the quarter and pr was down a bit while crm execution and support continued to underperform geographically all regions were positive in the quarter except for latin america with our domestic and continental european regions having the strongest performance slide 4 shows our mix of business by discipline for the first quarter split was 55 for advertising and 45 for marketing services and as for the organic growth by discipline our advertising discipline was up 5 1 advertising s organic growth continues to be led by our media businesses notably the continued strong performance by hearts science while our global and national advertising agencies performed well with only a few exceptions advertisement advertisement crm consumer experience was down 0 6 for the quarter primarily driven by declines in our events businesses which faced a very difficult comp partly driven by last year s winter olympics in south korea results for the rest of the discipline were mostly positive driven by strong performance from our precision marketing group branding which also had growth while our shopper and sales promotion businesses were down slightly while crm execution and support continued to underperform this quarter our domestic businesses while negative versus the prior year did show improvement versus q4 pr was down 0 5 performance in this discipline was also mixed by geographic regions the uk and asia were both positive north america was marginally negative with continental europe and latin america both lagging in the quarter and healthcare was up 6 8 as has been the case over the past few quarters the growth has been well balanced with positive results across all regions on slide 5 which details the regional mix of business you can see during the quarter the split was 54 in the us 3 for the rest of north america 10 in the uk 18 for the rest of europe 11 for asia pacific 3 for latin america and the balance for the middle east and african markets as for the details of our performance by region organic revenue growth in the first quarter in the us was 2 led by our advertising and media agencies as well as our healthcare agencies with mixed performance from our crm consumer experience agencies while our crm execution and support agencies declined our uk businesses were positive again this quarter up 1 3 and led by our advertising healthcare and pr agencies however the continuing uncertainty surrounding how the british government will formalize its departure from the eu certainly clouds the outlook for the market the rest of europe was up 4 organically in the quarter in the euro markets italy the netherlands and spain continued to turn in strong performances across disciplines this quarter germany returned to positive organic growth while france lagged our organic growth in europe outside the eurozone was positive as well organic growth in the asia pacific region facing a fairly strong comp to q1 of 2018 was 2 1 with australia india japan and new zealand leading the way this quarter our greater china agencies were down organically in total for the quarter largely from the impact of non recurring project revenue from q1 18 in our events agencies in that market latin america was down 3 in the quarter with the continuing issues in the brazilian economy dragging down the region s performance overall elsewhere in the region we continue to see positive performance from our agencies in mexico in the middle east and africa which is our smallest region was up 12 8 for the quarter on slide 6 we present our revenue by industry sector in comparing the first quarter revenue for 2019 to 2018 you can see a slight shift in our mix of business an increase in the contribution from our pharma industry clients offset with the decrease in the percentage of revenue from our technology clients primarily resulting from the sellbytel disposition turning to our cash flow performance on slide 7 you can see that in the first quarter we generated 341 million of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital as for our primary uses of cash on slide 8 dividends paid to our common shareholders were 135 million down slightly versus q1 last year due to the reduction in our outstanding common shares as a result of repurchase activity over the past year the 0 05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that we announced in february will impact our cash payments from q2 forward dividends paid to our non controlling interest shareholders totaled 17 million capital expenditures were 27 million down compared to 2018 due to less leasehold improvement activity acquisitions including earn out payments totaled 7 million reflecting a decrease in activity so far this year when compared to our q1 activity last year and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled 284 million reflecting an increase in the activity this year versus last year all in we outspent our free cash flow by about 130 million in the first quarter regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter our total debt is 5 5 billion up about 600 million since this time last year and as of this past year end as we mentioned earlier in february of 2019 we issued short term senior notes of eur520 million in a private placement to an investor outside the united states the notes are unsecured non interest bearing and mature this august and therefore are classified as short term on our balance sheet our net debt position at the end of the quarter was 2 04 billion up about 800 million compared to the year end december 31 2018 balance the increase in net debt was a result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter which totaled about 740 million as well as the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately 130 million these increases in net debt were partially offset by the cash we received from our disposition activity of 65 million and the effect of exchange rates on cash during q1 which increased our cash balance by about 25 million compared to march 31 2018 our net debt is down 282 million the decrease was primarily driven by the positive change in our operating capital during the past 12 months of approximately 340 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the past year of 370 million partially offsetting these increases over the past 12 months was the overspend of our free cash flow of approximately 170 million and the negative impact of fx on our cash balances which totaled just over 200 million as for our debt ratios they remain solid our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2 3 times reflecting the issuance of the euro denominated debt this quarter while our net debt to ebitda ratio fell to 0 9 times and due to the year over year increase in our interest expense our interest coverage ratio decreased to 9 8 times but remain strong and finally on slide 10 you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions for the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio was 25 while our return on equity was 52 6 and that concludes our prepared remarks please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator speaker o operator thank you very much operator instructions our first question will come from alexia quadrani with jpmorgan please go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you very much just a couple of questions if i may john maybe if you can provide a bit more color on kind of what you re seeing behind the healthy underlying business especially in the us which has seen some improvement in the last couple of quarters after lagging for a couple of years you gave some broader color but i m wondering if there is anything specific that is sort of driving improvement in the us and then maybe for phil i think you highlighted a couple of divestitures that you ve downsized over the last 12 months or so which has helped improve the profitability of the business i guess i m wondering if you could tell us if that s going to help improve the profitability going forward should we see some margin benefit the next couple of quarters and maybe how much how many more of these sort of underperforming businesses do you think you still have that we could see the opportunity of further divestitures john d wren chairman and chief executive officer hello alexia in terms of the color or our performance this quarter versus prior same quarters in prior years is the marketplace is changing all the time they are changing in a number of ways the competition set is pretty much what competition set was last year at the end of last year we were able to we had a very good run in the third quarter in terms of new business and so we re seeing some of that reflected in the performance of the first quarter and you ll see it throughout the rest of the balance of this year that s probably the biggest single component the other thing as you know is organic growth for net of what you win how your clients grow or decline and what you lose and we ve been fortunate of late not to have the leaky bucket syndrome so i am pretty optimistic philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer and then just to follow up in terms of of divestitures alexia i think for future expectations for the balance of the year and the rest of the quarters i think our expectation is for the businesses to continue to perform well and i think we would expect to achieve probably 20 basis points to 30 basis points of improvement over last year the first quarter relatively speaking is traditionally small relative to the rest of our quarters so the first quarter doesn t always necessarily make a definitive trend for us but we re going to continue to focus on ebit dollars as we always do and we d expect 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the balance of the year but we re also going to continue to invest in the business and invest for growth as we always do and try to find the right balance so that we can find and fund sustainable growth in terms of future divestitures and the process we go through i think you ve seen over the last three or four years that it is a part of the process we follow i think we re through an awful lot of what we plan to do strategically but we re going to continue that process we look at it every quarter and annually every year late in the year as we look at the new year and reevaluate where the businesses still fit strategically and what might be some opportunistic things that come up which is essentially what you saw with the sellbytel disposition in the third quarter of last year and then marketstar disposition in the first quarter of this year both of those were similar businesses different geographies but they were opportunities for us to take advantage of situations where we weren t prepared to continue to invest in what was needed for the future of those businesses yet we re able to find buyers that made much more sense than us for those businesses alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you that was that s very helpful can i just ask you one quick follow up could you quantify the gain of marketstar that you captured in the quarter philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t think from our perspective it s significant enough to quantify i think between marketstar as we said as far as the gain and the translation loss we had on fx those two together were essentially less than 10 basis points alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst okay thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question in queue will come from dan salmon with bmo capital markets please go ahead daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning everyone john maybe with your comment earlier about the competitive set not changing that much ultimately the answer to this question maybe no but nevertheless i d be just interested in your thoughts a bit more high level but when you look at some of the moves in recent weeks where non traditional competitors like accenture have been buying maybe what we viewed as a bit more traditional competitors like droga or a transaction like we saw over the weekend with publicis and epsilon if i put aside everything to talk about disciplines and capabilities and where the future of the business heads if i put that sort of aside if i put aside your normal sort of discipline on m a and valuation in the past and just sort of what deals may be available and just try to isolate the variables in your head that line up to say does m a in sort of a mid to larger scale make more sense or less sense based on what s going on around you do you sense any sort of notable change in how you might look at the landscape in that sense john d wren chairman and chief executive officer speaking purely from an omnicom point of view we can take these apart in as examples in two parts accenture buying droga which is a very good agency i already have a lot of really good agencies so that is not something that would buying another agency wouldn t be of it wouldn t be appeal to me the hiring ph which we are acquiring large and consultative type of it practices not sapiens of the world because we think those big builds of the past are of the past but like credera which we did last year and a few others we would continue to do those but i don t see them to be terribly expensive and what epsilon and i don t know what i haven t looked at epsilon in a long time but from what i ve observed of epsilon they are good company they have some good clients they don t have anything from what i can observe as unique or self proprietary in terms of what it does that it s if necessary is not replicated jonathan nelson who is head of our for all of omnicom our digital practices is sitting here with us today jonathan you want to add anything on that jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital at omnicom we ve been working on this idea of mass personalization at scale for well over a decade our investments in annalect our platform omni and the precision marketing group along with hearts science are just our latest examples of how we re focused on this as we proceed on this we are really focused on three key areas one is to keep the platforms open as i previously talked about we would rather rent and partner on data and technology rather than own that s not to say that in a few strategic instances we won t develop our own data assets we do develop our own data assets like our inventory graph but we generally believe of modular open approach is best for ourselves and our customers two we have been doing this on a global basis for over a decade our data platforms our technology platforms have been rolled out in every major region of the world as of right now and three the hardest part about this is doing integration with your traditional assets at scale anybody who does this can tell you that mass personalization at scale is extremely hard and we have been dedicated to this training thousands of our employees across all over the world in every major discipline across omnicom for the entire time that we ve been doing this so those three things open versus closed global and integration at scale are how we re approaching this problem john d wren chairman and chief executive officer so now back to john final answer to your question if i or my team felt threatened in any way we would look for the appropriate acquisitions to complete our offerings to our clients i simply don t feel that way right now operator okay thank you and our next question in queue will come from adrien de saint hilaire with bank of america please go ahead adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst hello good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question actually a very easy one i don t think you ve really repeated your 2019 outlook for 2 to 3 organic sales growth so could you just say whether you re still happy with this thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i don t think there s anything in our view that would change that outlook for the year at this point about 2 to 3 growth for the year adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst okay thank you very much indeed and also would you mind sharing how much did accuen grow year on year dollar wise q1 versus q1 philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so accuen grew actually accuen grew in the us by about 2 million so it s basically flat and on a worldwide basis accuen is down 4 million which also is roughly flat going forward or overall just to comment on the programmatic business so the programmatic business certainly in our view continues to be strong but we continue to see the transition of some clients from our performance based bundled solution to the traditional agency approach and going forward as john had said earlier the programmatic offering is being integrated into our agencies and into the agency offering so we think that s the right answer for the business ultimately because it is something that is just part of what our agencies do on a day to day basis but ultimately the business is strong it continues to perform well adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst okay thanks very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question in queue will come from julien roch with barclays please go ahead julien roch barclays analyst yes good morning guys thank you my strategic question on m a has been asked so i will do more simple number question for phil if fx is minus 100 basis point across the board i e not a big impact from one country or another what s the rough impact on margin that s my first question the second one is for a while you ve said that you ve done the bulk of dispositions but you re looking at the portfolio on a continuing basis and you ve increased the guidance from 2 5 to 3 going forward in 2021 what s the best way of thinking about acquisition less disposition put a flat number or put like a minus one number because you ll continue to trim the portfolio and then last question is interest guidance for the full year because of the benefit of the private senior note until august thank you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so on fx i think your question is a hypothetical one if fx was down 100 basis points what would the impact on margin be i think the answer is it depends depends on where the fx positive or in this case a negative would be but i think i think it s pretty direct to say if fx is up or down 100 basis points to 200 basis points typically the impact on our margins is minimal and in this quarter the impact that negative fx had on margins the margin percentage was less than 10 basis points which sometimes when fx is up or down in the neighborhood it was this quarter we do tend to see a larger impact on our margins on the margin percentage but that didn t happen this quarter the fx decline was kind of across the board didn t have a big impact on margin percentage when you looked at the totality of omnicom as far as dispositions go we don t forecast certainly into 2020 and 2021 i think the bulk of the dispositions we ve done to date we will cycle through by the end of q3 of this year the size of the dispositions we did this quarter just they re not that large that they re going to have a significant impact on the number going forward and as far as strategically we will continue to pursue the same strategy as far as acquisitions are concerned we d rather do more than less our capital allocation strategy isn t going to change to the extent we can find accretive acquisitions that fit our strategy fit the culture and meet the needs of what we think we will work well and integrate with the business we re going to try and find more of those deals and do more of those deals we re not going to set an acquisition dollar target and then have an m a group chase deals so that we can we can meet that target but we re going to continue to pursue deals we re pursuing them today but less of the right fit we re pretty disciplined about it we re going to continue to be disciplined about it so ideally as you get out a year or two the goal would be to have certainly back in the more acquisitions mode the disposition process will continue but certainly the bulk of what we intended to do we re through the bulk of it but we re going to continue to look at opportunistic things if they come up and if they re right for the business disposition might be the right answer but the goal is to do more more acquisitions certainly on interest expense i think we don t have i don t have the number in front of me we could take that offline but we certainly expect that the reductions that we ve been able to achieve in our cp borrowings because of the opportunistic debt offering we did the private placement we did in january or in early february excuse me is going to reduce our cp borrowings we ll probably have a little bit of negative year over year increase in interest from our floating or fixed and floating swaps but we do have a debt offering coming we do have a 10 year bond offering that s coming due that we re going to replace and there should be some savings from that offering because 10 years ago the rate was certainly higher than we expect to refinance today so we can take that offline and we can give you some more detail adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst okay very clear as usual thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question in queue will come from michael nathanson with moffettnathanson please go ahead michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst thanks can i just ask one on the numbers and then one if i could to jonathan so just on the numbers when i look at salary and service change i know there s a lot of moving pieces from dispositions and currency is there anyway you can give me a sense of what was where you think the organic growth is for omnicom on salary and services how we think about it for the year just try to strip away all these moving pieces john d wren chairman and chief executive officer i don t know if phil can but i know i can philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t we don t really look at it that way or attempt to look at it that way unfortunately in terms of having a specific answer for your question michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay then i guess the question would be is so you guys within that number you can t take out what currency would be do you think currency is representative of the change of currencies represent the change in salary and services or is there anything unusual about maybe the weighting of salary and services by geographies philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer no i don t think there s anything unusual we actually i don t have it with me for the call but we do have a constant currency calculation that we do so we can give you a follow up on what those ratios were on a constant currency basis so that you get a sense for what those numbers are without currency we typically have that i forgot to bring it with me into the room where we re having the call michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay cool and do you guys mind if i ask jonathan a question philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure go right ahead michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay jonathan a question for you is last year we spent a lot of time in beginning of the year thinking about gdpr and the impact on the market and on agencies i wonder when you look back on what happened last year in gdpr what did you learn and looking forward to what could happen within the us what do you thing is likely in terms of privacy outcomes here for the us jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital well i think that there will be more regulation around privacy in the us that s nearly inevitable with the comments made by a number of people in the industry legislation is going to happen in the us at omnicom we did a deep audit of all of our assets looking at all of our different data providers and partners and came up with policies and procedures to protect ourselves and our clients and what we are trying to do is find that sort of fuzzy line of privacy and take a few steps back from it and i don t i think that policy has worked so far and it will likely work going forward michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay and meaning like you don t see any material change in how you guys running your business because of it jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital not a material change i mean when it comes down to actually on a day to day basis of course it s evolving every day but in the macro it s keep moving forward michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay thanks guys jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital sure philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we have time given the markets about to open i think we have time for one more question operator operator instructions philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer great ok well if not we re right on time john d wren chairman and chief executive officer on time perfect philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer so

specifically is reviewing its anti dumping and anti subsidy measures against distillers dried grains used for animal feed us japan trade talks began in washington yesterday if the us would have remained in the trans pacific partnership both nafta and us japanese trade ties would have been modernized and no need for these talks at the same time it is important to recognize that the tpp and what the us called usmca is treaties and require congressional approval the talks with china japan and the eu are executive agreements no congressional approval is necessary yet just like trump has reversed many of obama s executive decisions these trade agreements may not survive trump s successor the australian dollar approached 0 7200 but has backed off it has not closed above there for a little more than two months there is an option stuck there for about a 555 mln that expires today and reinforces this resistance area we have been looking for it to top out near there support is seen in the 0 7100 0 7120 area meanwhile the dollar continues to probe the jpy112 area it finished the north american session above there for the past two sessions but barely there are no significant

at 3 9 its lowest level in nearly 45 years average earnings excluding bonuses rose 3 4 which is near the best level since the great financial crisis the uncertainty surrounding brexit is understood to keep monetary policy out of play however with earnings holding above inflation we like others suspect that if it were not for brexit the boe would be leaning toward a rate hike inflation figures will

be market movers even in the best of times trade and cpi figures will be released tomorrow followed by retail sales on thursday headline cpi will likely be lifted by food and energy but the underlying

higher ahead of last weekend it entered the gap yesterday but did not close it it is found between last thursday s high 2893 4 and yesterday s low 2896 5 the s p may gap higher again today this gap is likely normal meaning that it is closed quickly still the s p 500 is approaching the record high set last september near 2941
by neil hartnell tribune business editor nhartnell tribunemedia net governance reformers yesterday called for more pressure for change after the imf warned that addressing structural impediments to growth was critical ahead of joining the wto robert myers the organisation for responsible governance s org principal told tribune business that the international monetary fund imf appeared to have taken a page out of our book by calling on the bahamas to lower energy costs boost private sector access to credit and address skills mismatches in the labour market addressing structural impediments and preparing the economy for a further gradual opening is critical the imf argued yesterday following an 11 day visit to nassau for the annual article iv consultation with the government and private sector several steps have been taken to address long standing structural issues boost private investment and lower the cost of doing business planned accession to the world trade organisation wto makes it even more urgent to tackle remaining impediments lowering energy costs improving private sector credit access and tackling skills mismatches in the labour market are critical priorities mr myers in response said we completely concur we re glad to see them reiterate what we ve been saying for the past three to four years we need more pressure for change we need more focus on these things and it s good to hear the international acknowledgement of these issues hopefully the government and future governments will start to adapt accordingly and really focus on these core issues that we ve been calling for unemployment is not really going to decline unless we can really increase gdp and education we ve got to in this country improve the ease and cost of doing business which will increase business and foreign direct investment fdi confidence and then go out and get these people investing in the country while we re training bahamians to be prepared for these jobs mr myers said the bahamian workforce needed to be prepared for a different world and called for more vocational and apprenticeship programmes beyond the one that the government is launching in partnership with the inter american development bank idb the minnis administration will also likely argue it is already moving to address the deficiencies identified by the imf with bahamas power light s bpl agreements with wartsila and shell designed to reduce energy costs and improve supply reliability it can also cite the 30m idb project to digitise government services as a key aspect of efforts to improve the ease of doing business the imf meanwhile yesterday called for the creation of a real estate price index as part of efforts to help bahamian commercial banks and other lenders better value distressed properties and work out non performing loans the banking sector remains sound but credit growth is hampered by non performing loans npls and lack of information about potential borrowers the fund said the 2019 fsap financial sector assessment programme found that the banking sector enjoys healthy profits and maintains high capital and liquidity ratios further progress in supervision of credit underwriting and timely resolution of npls remain key objectives a local real estate price index should be introduced to increase visibility into the residential housing market and improve npl valuations the credit bureau once operational should strengthen the quality and pace of credit activity and improve assessment of lending standards the imf also called for governance at state owned financial institutions to be strengthened in the wake of bank of the bahamas 300m plus bail out so that there was continued effective and independent supervision it recommended that the central bank address the 1 5bn surplus liquidity overhang in the commercial banking system to ensure a soft landing something the regulator has shown itself to be keenly aware of excess liquidity calls for a strengthening of the monetary policy transmission mechanism the imf said the accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate given the cyclical position of the economy and the negative credit gap however a large structural liquidity surplus exists given exchange controls and the absence of a well developed domestic securities market deepening the domestic sovereign debt market through regular auctions is recommended the central bank of the bahamas should continue to reduce its holdings of government debt and adoption of the amendments to the central bank law is recommended to strengthen its governance and define limits on government lending the imf added that the risks associated with the central bank s digital bahamian dollar project need to be well understood and the necessary cyber security safeguards built in and it said potential spillovers into the domestic banking sector from unifying bank licence regimes in response to european union eu pressure needed careful monitoring the current account deficit increased to 15 9 percent of gdp in 2018 in part reflecting one off factors related to the completion of baha mar and an overvalued real effective exchange rate significant albeit declining current account deficits are projected to continue financed mainly by foreign direct investment the imf said in the context of the continued strong commitment to the exchange rate peg structural reforms to boost competitiveness alongside fiscal consolidation and accumulation of foreign exchange reserves are critical to strengthen external buffers
japanified world ahead regular readers may have noticed me slowly losing confidence in the economy your impression is correct and there s a good reason for it as i will explain today the facts have changed so my conclusions are changing too i still think the economy is okay for now i still see recession odds rising considerably in 2020 maybe it will get pushed back another year or two but at some point this growth phase will end either in recession or an extended flat period even flatter than the last decade which says a lot and i still think we are headed toward a global credit crisis i ve dubbed the great reset what s evolved is my judgment on the coming slowdown s severity and duration i think the rest of the world will enter a period something like japan endured following 1990 and is still grappling with today it won t be the end of the world japan is still there but the little growth it s had was due mainly to exports that won t work when every major economy is in the same position describing this decline as japanification may be unfair to japan but it s the best paradigm we have the good news is it will spread slowly the bad news is it will end slowly too i believe we will avoid literal blood in the streets but it will be a challenging time we ll be discussing how to get through it more specifically at the strategic investment conference next month it is now sold out but you can still buy a virtual pass that includes audio and video of almost the whole event click here for information losing decades before i explain why we will follow japan i want to briefly explain how japan got to where it is it was a long slow process that like the proverbial frog in boiling water wasn t fully obvious in real time japan experienced rapid growth following world war ii as the us and others helped rebuild its economy that wasn t all out of generosity the country was geopolitically important as a western bulwark against russia and china we didn t want it to fall under the other side s influence this eventually led to a roaring expansion that culminated in the 1980s japanese asset bubble which popped in the early 1990s there followed what came to be called the lost decade it was really more than a decade as the early 2000s brought only mild recovery gdp shrank wages fell and asset prices dropped or went sideways at best the lost decade had monetary roots namely the 1985 plaza accord that drove the yen higher and inflated the asset bubble the bank of japan tried to pop the bubble with a series of rate hikes beginning in 1989 this chart shows the boj s benchmark rate upon reaching 6 in 1992 the boj began cutting rates and eventually reached zero a few years later since then it has made two short lived tightening attempts shown in the red circles neither worked and that was it no more rate hikes period the boj has now kept its policy rate at or near zero for 20 years making conventional monetary policy essentially irrelevant the boj resorted to increasingly large qe like programs that also had little effect meanwhile the government tried assorted fiscal policies infrastructure projects deregulation tax cuts etc they had little effect too gdp growth has been stuck near zero plus or minus a couple of points so has inflation the only thing that really helped was driving down the yen s exchange rate which successive governments and central bank governors have done enthusiastically which i kind of understand when your only tool is a hammer you treat everything as a nail that said the boj s asset purchases certainly had an effect they more or less bought everything that isn t nailed down including stock etfs and other private assets japan is a prime example of the faux capitalism i described last week all this capital is going into businesses not because they have innovative profit generating ideas but simply because they exist that s how you get zombie companies the result at least so far has been neither boom nor depression japan has its problems but people aren t standing in soup lines the bigger issue is that the population is aging rapidly many say the present situation can t go on indefinitely but there s no exit in sight the bank of japan has bought every bond it can except those the government will create to fund future deficits which is why they are buying stocks not just in japan but in the us as well they are trying to put yen into the system in an effort to generate inflation it simply hasn t worked when you don t have a better answer the default is to do more of the same that s the case in japan europe and soon the us charles hugh smith described it pretty well recently the other dynamic of zombification japanification is past success shackles the power elites to a failed model the greater the past glory the stronger its hold on the national identity and the power elites and so the power elites do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses if lowering interest rates sparked secular growth then the power elites will lower interest rates to zero when that fails to move the needle they lower rates below zero i e negative interest rates when this too fails to move the needle they rig statistics to make it appear that all is well in the immortal words of mr junker when it becomes serious you have to lie and it s now serious all the time do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses is also a good description of federal reserve policy from 2008 through 2016 zero rates having had little effect the fed launched qe and continued it despite the limited success and harmful side effects the european central bank did the same in even larger amounts than the federal reserve also with little effect which brings us to the next point why europe and the us will follow japan too much too fast as noted in the introduction i change when the facts change and in the last few months they did the federal reserve spent 2017 and 2018 trying to exit from its various extraordinary stimulus policies it began raising short term interest rates and reversing the qe program i think it should have done both sooner and not at the same time but both needed to happen in hindsight it now appears the fed tried to do too much too fast which was my point when they started the process either raise rates slowly or reduce the balance sheet but not both at the same time reducing the balance sheet has an effect on effective rates just as actually raising rates does but not as obvious my friend samuel rines calculated that when you include the qe tapering this fed tightening cycle was the most aggressive since paul volcker s draconian rate hikes in the early 1980s they should have started sooner and tightened more gradually for whatever reason they didn t and so the complaints began wall street wasn t happy but more important president trump wasn t pleased with the rate hikes why it surprised him i don t know jerome powell s hawkish bent was no secret when trump made him fed chair whatever the reason the president has made his displeasure with fed policy clear but the real deal breaker may have been the late 2018 market tantrum lenders and borrowers alike grew increasingly and vocally distressed as the yield curve flattened and threatened to invert then this year it did invert at several points along the curve coincident with weakening economic data that was probably the last straw the fed hasn t exactly loosened but there s a good chance it will later this year meanwhile across the pond mario draghi had one foot out the door and until a short while ago had a tightening plan in place that plan is now out the door before draghi is even close to gone so on both sides of the atlantic plans to exit from extraordinarily loose money now look disturbingly like those two little circles in the boj rate chart when it tried to hike and found it could not worse we are also replicating japan s fiscal policy with rapidly growing deficit spending in fact this year we will be exceeding it the japanese deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected to be below 4 while the us is closer to 5 and given the ever widening unfunded liabilities gap the us deficit will grow even larger in the future turning japanese i think we re turning japanese i really think so with a musical nod to the vapors a 6 trillion 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet let me give you the cliffs notes version of how i think the next decade will play out more or less kinda sorta we already see the major developed economies beginning to slow and likely enter a global recession before the end of the year that will drag the us into a recession soon after unless the federal reserve quickly loosens policy enough to prolong the current growth cycle other central banks will respond with lower rates and ever larger rounds of quantitative easing let s look again at a chart courtesy of my friend jim bianco that i showed three weeks ago showing roughly 20 trillion of cumulative central bank balance sheets as of today if i had told you back in 2006 this would happen by 2019 you would have first questioned my sanity and then said no way and even if it did happen you would expect the economic world would be coming to an end well it happened and the world is still here source jim bianco before 2008 no one expected zero rates in the us negative rates for 11 trillion worth of government bonds globally negative rates out of the ecb and the swiss national bank etc things like tarp qe and zirp were nowhere on the radar just months before they happened numerous times markets closed on friday only to open in a whole new world on monday in the next crisis central banks and governments in an effort to be seen to be doing something will again resort to heretofore unprecedented balance sheet expansions and it will have less effect than they want those reserves will simply pile up on the balance sheets of commercial banks which will put them right back into reserves at their respective central banks during the worldwide recession there will be few qualified borrowers but a great demand for liquidity as corporate debt goes from investment grade to junk seemingly en masse which will disqualify them from being bought by pensions insurance companies and many other purchasers normally looking for yield the inverted yield curve is a classic sign that the central bank in this case the federal reserve has tightened monetary conditions too much which is why trump wants the fed to lower rates now plus he doesn t want a recession in an election year and powell and the fed turned so dovish i will admit the fed s 4 trillion balance sheet expansion surprised me at the time fool me once shame on you we ve now seen the new playbook at a minimum they will keep the balance sheet at its present barely diminished size and eventually add a lot more when we go into recession i think 10 trillion is almost a sure thing by the mid 2020s by which point we will have been through our second recession why because we will see a new government at some point that raises taxes enough to actually send a still weak economy into another recession that s pure speculation on my part but is what i foresee what assets will the fed buy under current law that s pretty predictable treasury securities and a few other government backed issues like certain mortgage bonds that s all the law allows but laws can change and i think there is a real chance they will regardless of which party holds the white house and congress in a crisis people act in previously unthinkable ways think 2008 2009 they will think the unthinkable in the next crisis and try everything including the kitchen sink but it will just increase government debt and as lacy hunt has shown us from numerous sources in the academic literature and i ve tried to explain that debt will be a drag on future growth another reason to expect a 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet is that us government debt will be north of 30 trillion on top of that in the next five years the credit markets have to fund 5 trillion of corporate debt rollovers plus new debt plus state and local debt it won t be coming from outside the us and there is only so much that banks and big pension funds and individuals can do unless the federal reserve steps in interest rates will soar and the crisis will become much worse it will have little choice but to step in and buy us government debt yes i know this is a self fulfilling prophecy and it has to end but the question is when we re already seeing serious analysts say it really doesn t have to end this from none other than goldman sachs daan struyven and david mericle economists at goldman sachs said the example of japan could prove instructive as the world s third largest economy had not suffered a debt crisis even though it arguably has the most public debt as a share of its gdp in the world japan s government debt to gdp ratio sits at 236 in 2017 more than double that of the us which stands at 108 according to the international monetary fund i could spend the entire letter giving you quotes like that from mainstream economists note you can quibble with the exact numbers but in any case the bank of japan holds at least 100 of japanese gdp in debt plus an enormous amount of japanese stocks not to mention global stocks the federal reserve holds roughly 35 give or take of us government debt can we even imagine the federal reserve at some point holding 20 trillion of us government debt i don t think the japanese imagined that 20 years ago i keep saying we have to think the unthinkable as we plan for our futures because i can guarantee you that future leaders will when there is a true crisis they whoever they may be will be looking for action and do nothing will not be an option maybe it should be but that is a metaphysical argument for another day they will do something quantitative easing is now on the table and i think will be almost a reflexive move during the next recessioncrisis so will we have japan like flat markets and low growth for years on end will we create a demographic crisis by limiting immigration public pensions and insurers are already struggling to meet obligations after years of low rates those betting on 7 returns and many are won t make anything close to that this will make government debt and state local pension fund obligations a massive problem that the federal reserve and the us government right now are not politically or legally capable of handling will we change the rules in the future tell me who s going to be in charge during that crisis and then let s ask the question but will it play out over a longer period of time than we might think now almost surely yet the world will not end and for those paying attention will be a better world stay tuned and stay with me mastering private markets i recently did a podcast for my friends at smh interviewing fellow rice graduate mike novelli about his real estate investing experiences over the last 20 years i learned a lot and think you will find it interesting too income producing real estate will have value in almost any future monetary environment simply click here give us a little information about who you are and you can either listen or read the transcript please note that i am

tumbles sharply in asian session after dovish rba minutes set out the conditions for a rate cut it s seen as another step towards more monetary easing ahead as markets are expecting two cuts this year the most important part of the minutes is that rba confirmed there could be a need for rate cut it said a lower level of interest rates could still be expected to support the economy through a depreciation of the exchange rate and via reducing required interest payments on borrowing freeing up cash for other expenditure also in a scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trended up a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate in these circumstances nevertheless members agreed that there was not a strong case for a near term adjustment in

successful in achieving the maximum employment mandate it s less successful regarding the inflation objective and to fix this he added fed must be willing to embrace inflation modestly above 2 percent 50 percent of the time for him he would communicate comfort with core inflation at 2 5 as long as there is no obvious upward momentum while the path back to 2 can be well managed for now evans is still expecting that some further rate increases may be appropriate over time he expects growth to be at around 1 75 2 00 this year still he maintained that current patient stance is appropriate given the heightened uncertainty including us china trade war he also emphasized that if activity softens more than expected or if inflation and inflation expectations run too low then policy may have to be left on hold or perhaps even loosened to provide the appropriate accommodation to obtain our objectives fed rosengren prefers inflation range targeting ahead of a broad review on monetary policy framework boston fed president eric rosengren said he d prefer a range targeting approach on inflation that is fed could be forced to accept inflation below 2 during recessions on the other hand fed should commit to achieve above 2 inflation in good times for example a range of 1 5 2 5 rosengren echoed other platemakers comment that the current 2 target is symmetric but in practice people saw that figure as a ceiling he added even though we re only missing by a little bit it actually does matter if you miss by a little bit on a regular basis on the data front uk employment and german zew

in this edition of the interview fair observer talks to lawrence gonzi the former prime minister of malta nestled in the mediterranean sea between italy and tunisia malta is the smallest member state of the european union having joined the bloc in may 2004 a strong economic performance especially in the face of the 2008 global financial crisis and high levels of social capital have helped malta climb to 19th place out of 149 nations on the legatum prosperity index the country performs best on safety and security social capital and economic quality markers in the rankings malta adopted the euro as its official currency in 2008 replacing the maltese lira and survived the eurozone crisis due to low debt and sound banking practices freedom house refers to malta as a parliamentary democracy with regular competitive elections and periodic rotations of power where civil liberties are widely respected in its description of the quality of democracy in malta sustainable governance indicators points out the progresses made in freeing state owned media from government influence rights that have been granted to the lgbtq community and the improvement of gender equality protection however not all is sunny on the island malta suffers from endemic corruption with transparency international s corruption perceptions index 2018 ranking it 51 out of 180 countries in the world scoring worse than rwanda and georgia in terms of the perceived public sector corruption in november 2018 the european commission adopted disciplinary procedures against malta for failing to apply the european union rules to prevent money laundering its highly controversial passports for cash scheme continues despite international outrage in october 2017 daphne caruana galizia an investigative journalist who reported widely on the scheme as well as widespread corruption nepotism money laundering and organized crime in malta was killed when a bomb detonated in her car the assassination carried out in a eu country where the journalists are supposed to be unconditionally protected sent shock waves across the continent yet the case remains unsolved despite the controversies malta is a thriving nation that owes much of its economic and political progress to the leadership of lawrence gonzi who served as the prime minister from 2004 to 2013 in this edition of the interview fair observer talks to gonzi about malta s economy foreign relations the response to the global migration crisis and its bonds with the european union the text has been edited and condensed for clarity kourosh ziabari you served as prime minister of malta for nine years introduced many reforms spearheaded malta s adoption of the euro and also signed the schengen agreement how do you evaluate yourself now that you are not in the office what were some of the most notable achievements and some of the most pressing challenges lawrence gonzi i took my oath of office as prime minister of malta on march 23 2004 practically five weeks before malta joined the european union on may 1 joining the eu was the achievement of a long standing vision embraced by my party the nationalist party in line with its policies centered around the concept of a social market economy the very first challenge achieving national consensus eu membership was an achievement against all odds apart from the fact that malta would be and still is the smallest member state the question whether to join the eu or not was an extremely controversial issue which had been at the forefront of maltese politics at least since 1987 with malta s second largest political party the labour party determined to do anything and everything to undermine this political project i will not go into the details of the enormous effort my predecessor dr fenech adami had to put into the negotiations for membership of the eu but i must highlight the fact that we managed to negotiate a package that was judged by everyone as the best amongst the 10 new members states that joined in 2004 this allowed us to put the question to a referendum in 2003 with the electorate fully informed about the advantages political economic social and cultural as well as the challenges that would face us both in the event of joining the eu but also in the event of a negative vote today 15 years later notwithstanding the financial crisis the arab spring the rise in the price of oil the migration crisis brexit and all the rest there is ample evidence that the challenge to achieve national consensus in malta on eu membership has been overcome the malta labour party has had to change its official policy and adopt a more pro eu approach this is confirmed by a recent eurobarometer survey released in december 2018 showing that the number of maltese who have a positive opinion on the european union is the highest in the eu and stands at 95 of the population i list this achievement at the top of what could be a much longer list because it is a clear indication of the progress registered by malta during the past years as a result of our ability to translate membership into real and effective improvement in the quality of life of our citizens i am personally a staunch supporter of the dignity of every human person and i have never had any qualms to translate this into my migration policies i have gone on public record and stated that the dignity of one single person arriving in malta on a dinghy has the same value as the dignity of one single person arriving on a five star luxury cruise liner it is no secret that malta has no natural resources of its own we suffer the disadvantages of being an island on the periphery of our most important market which means that our manufacturing sector needs to bear the costs of importing raw materials and re exporting the finished products to the european market but remaining competitive in quality and price if one factors into this equation the fact that we do not have sufficient water resources to service our main economic sectors which includes of course tourism then perhaps one starts to understand the daunting challenge we face in maintaining our edge on our competitors chief amongst these water related challenges is the realization a few years back that we could only service our industries by transforming sea water of which we have plenty surrounding us into drinking water using a technology called reverse osmosis i suppose i need not point out that this is an extremely energy hungry process which means that when the price of oil reached 140 dollars a barrel in 2007 we got hit twice over because energy needed to be consumed not only for our electricity needs but also to generate the required water resources for our own needs and for our water hungry industries thousands of jobs depended on our ability to overcome these complex challenges all of which were interrelated in one way or another it is with a sense of pride that i look back on the success of our policies which allowed us to continue to provide universal free health care universal free education right up to tertiary levels including paying a stipend to our students who chose to continue their post secondary studies as well as a relatively strong social safety net that supported the most vulnerable in our society ziabari during your second term as prime minister you implemented successful policies to deal with the repercussions of the economic and financial crisis of 2008 09 including introducing new job opportunities and attracting foreign investment german chancellor angela merkel praised your economy as excellent how did you make malta a popular destination for foreign investment tell us more about the policies you put in place to overcome the economic crisis that had hit europe gonzi a small island such as ours allows us to familiarize ourselves with the challenges and opportunities a lot quicker than anyone else it allows us to design specific solutions to individual problems when larger countries are forced to go for generalized solutions it gives us the opportunity to be flexible when dealing with individual sectors of our industry it provides us with more detailed knowledge of what is truly happening on the shop floor and therefore it gives us better tools to ascertain that the picture we are being given is indeed a real one and not an inflated version of course there are downsides and risks but on balance this flexibility and speed of action gives us an edge on our competitors i personally experienced this during the financial and economic crisis that hit europe and the rest of the world in 2008 as everyone recalls millions of jobs were lost countries that were considered to be paragons of economic success the so called economic tigers faced a major banking crisis collapse of their housing sectors and a credit crunch that suffocated all growth austerity politics dominated the political landscape with the consequent heavy impact on the middle classes and especially on those who were amongst the most vulnerable in our societies the facts recognized by european political and economic leaders indicate clearly that malta managed to sail through this crisis without suffering the damage that a lot of other countries some of whom are our close neighbors have had to go through the reasons are several but i will focus on two very specific ones the first is the fact that very early in my premiership i decided that malta should join the eurozone and adopt the euro as quickly as possible for the moment suffice it to point out that joining the eurozone required us to go through some tough restructuring of our economy in order to achieve what is known as the maastricht criteria i spearheaded this process from day one sending a very powerful message by taking a highly unusual political decision as prime minister namely keeping the finance portfolio under my wing in essence this sent a message to our civil service our private sector and our local and foreign investors that from that point onward restructuring and modernizing of the economy was the most important item on our political agenda for the next four years analysts will understand that this restructuring took place during a period when the global economy was moving at a relatively healthy pace 2004 07 this meant that those thousands of jobs that were lost because of our aggressive restructuring program closing down of non productive government owned industries such as our ship building industry and privatizing the ship repair side of that same industry is one example were compensated by the creation of other new niche sectors that suited the abilities of our present and future workforce the aircraft maintenance sector pharmaceuticals the care sector and financial services sectors are typical examples all the above means that at the start of the financial crisis in late 2007 malta had just completed its most important restructuring phase it was about to introduce the euro on january 1 2008 and was therefore well prepared to weather the perfect storm that was brewing globally but the second reason why we weathered the storm is just as ad possibly even more important it is the fact that our size allowed us to understand earlier than others what needed to be done to support our industries and protect our competitiveness while remaining resilient notwithstanding our vulnerabilities a couple of examples will prove my point as happened in other countries manufacturing was hit hard during the latter part of 2008 companies order books suddenly and quickly dried up european and non european employers were consequently forced to lay off their workforce and in some cases even faced bankruptcy i recall the sleepless nights my colleagues and i lived through each time we were approached for help by some of our most important employers on the island here is why small is beautiful our economic realities allowed us to sit down with individual ceos in order to understand what was required for them to keep their companies operating on minimum resources but without sacking their employees we were able to provide financial and technical support for employers to retrain their employees and to keep them on their books during that very lean period instead of releasing them with redundancy payments this was no social benefit it was an intelligent move which allowed our manufacturers to retain their experienced workforce and to kick start their operations as soon as our main export markets started to regain lost ground and they managed to do so a lot earlier than our competitors which meant that our order books were already full when others had to re employ and retrain workers at enormous cost ziabari how challenging was it to achieve the maastricht convergence criteria and join the eurozone gonzi joining the single currency was one of the most important obligations undertaken by malta together with the other nine candidate countries in 2004 the maastricht criteria included four so called economic convergence criteria namely price stability sound and sustainable public finances exchange rate stability and long term interest rates adhesion to the eurozone and consequently adoption of the euro was not possible if the applicant country failed to achieve any one of these criteria for whatever reason the starting point for malta at the beginning of my premiership in 2004 presented what appeared to be some insurmountable difficulties for example the second economic criteria established a maximum annual budgeted deficit of not more than 3 of gdp and a downward trend in national debt toward a target maximum of 60 of gdp in malta s case the official figures for the year ending in december 2003 indicated a record level at 9 of gdp whereas the national debt in 2004 was registered at 72 of gdp the enormity of the challenge to achieve these criteria was as clear as crystal right from the very start on the other hand i was fully aware of the fact that malta s then currency the malta lira although quite stable and resilient remained the currency of a small nation that depended very much on external factors dominating its most important export markets the vulnerabilities were there for everyone to see especially in the event of worst case scenarios malta s competitiveness was another important consideration our most important markets were part of the eurozone which meant that we were suffering from extra conversion costs every time maltese business dealt with euro denominated counterparts our analysis indicated to us that joining the eurozone would improve our overall competitiveness and reduce costs for our businesses reducing the national deficit from 9 to below 3 in less than three years meant that we had to bite some nasty bullets downsizing the ship repair business closing down of non productive government subsidized entities privatizing certain industries which could be better managed by the private sector freezing all government employment and introducing early retirement schemes for excess public sector employees increasing the retirement age from 60 for females and 61 for males to 65 years of age for both sexes reducing unsustainable subsidies on electricity and water rates whilst incentivizing the use of alternative energy reducing the number of public holidays and a host of other similar initiatives all of which were designed specifically to increase malta s productivity deliver better efficiencies and maximize on our potential to attract foreign and local investment this is why as already stated during my first term i decided to retain the finance portfolio under my wing it proved to everyone that there was political determination to walk the walk from early on we realized that we could only achieve our targets if we managed to persuade maltese families and businesses to take ownership of the euro project as this would be in their very own best interests we decided to set up a national euro changeover committee composed of several well known business personalities including some individuals with strong executive track records one of the more important tasks this committee had to address was related to price stability issues and avoidance of inflation as a direct consequence of the changeover this was a lesson we learned from in some cases bitter experiences of our neighboring eurozone countries that had adopted the euro in the past years the nightmare scenario which was a theoretical one in 2004 became a reality as soon as the global economy suffered this century s worst financial and economic crisis early in 2008 practically coinciding with malta s adoption of the euro on january 1 thanks to the euro but more importantly thanks to the restructuring and the reforms introduced in the preceding three years malta and its people managed to sail through this perfect storm in a manner that allowed it to maximize on its potential in the subsequent years when growth outpaced that of our larger and more important competitors ziabari the libyan crisis is said to have been a major foreign policy challenge for malta under your leadership have the efforts to rebuild libya been successful what is your opinion on the role of international bodies including the united nations in restoring peace and stability in the war hit country gonzi the libyan crisis was a watershed moment for the maltese nation for the best part of the last 50 years malta has had to develop a working relationship with libya and its leadership not least because it remains our closest neighbor but also because thousands of maltese have invested in the libyan economy and have spent a long number of years working with and amongst the libyan people there is no doubt that the people to people relationship with libya was and continues to be one based on genuine friendship and trust but the government to government relationship went through some roller coaster moments especially since the alternating administrations in malta nationalist vs labour over the past 50 years differed substantially both in substance and in political perspective for my party malta s european vocation was always a priority but the same cannot be said for the leadership of the malta labour party whatever the case this relationship was sorely tested during the arab spring and the popular uprising in libya in february 2011 details of my personal experience during those difficult moments are extensively explained in the book gonzi and malta s break with gaddafi recollections of a premier at the time we earned the plaudits of some important world leaders for the way we handled the thousands of refugees escaping from the horrors of gaddafi s wrath at the uprising but today i look back with sorrow and frustration at a missed opportunity by european and world leaders who all failed to follow up on the nice words that were expressed during and immediately after gaddafi was toppled at the time the fledgling libyan administration pleaded for the release of the billions of dollars of libyan funds that had been frozen in bank accounts all over the world as a result of the sanctions authorized by the united nations during the crisis unfortunately those pleas fell on some very deaf ears and that fragile and weak administration was unable to pay its civil servants its teachers its judges its police etc the consequences are there today for everyone to see libya and the libyan people deserve a lot better they have the natural resources to allow them to rebuild their economy apart from a rich patrimony and heritage that is unique in the mediterranean as always it will be up to the libyan people to seek out the best solutions for themselves and their families i only hope and trust that the international community including malta will continue to provide the encouragement support and expertise required for national reconciliation and reconstruction that is so sorely needed by this neighbor of ours ziabari how has malta been affected by the global migration crisis is public as hostile toward immigration as in hungary or the united kingdom gonzi unhcr statistics for malta show that during the two terms of my premiership from 2004 to 2013 a total of 16 406 asylum seekers arrived by boat on our shores that figure represents an annual average of 1 640 arrivals by boat the impact of these figures needs to be measured against the fact that malta s population is less than half a million and that our island is a nation that has the fifth highest population density per square kilometer in the world in other words the landing of a boat with 100 people in malta is equivalent to the arrival of thousands in the uk or for that matter in any other major country in europe the same unhcr statistics quoted above show that in the subsequent four years 2014 to 2017 this average figure decreased to 180 annual arrivals by boat with this dramatic decrease in numbers one would have expected the public negative perception regarding the issue of illegal migration to adjust itself and diminish proportionately however the opposite has happened and the perception remains generally hostile notwithstanding the fact that our economy is becoming increasingly dependent on the economic input of this vulnerable group of persons i am personally a staunch supporter of the dignity of every human person and i have never had any qualms to translate this into my migration policies i have gone on public record and stated that the dignity of one single person arriving in malta on a dinghy has the same value as the dignity of one single person arriving on a five star luxury cruise liner indeed i recognize the fact that i could have done much more to alleviate the plight of illegal migrants arriving on our shores during my premiership but i also recognize the fact that our european union colleagues failed us on this score we received absolutely no support from the individual member states even though they were perfectly aware of the fact that we were facing the brunt of this wave of migrants who in most cases landed in malta by mistake as their original destination was mostly toward northern european states this lack of solidarity by individual member states has poisoned the way our electorate perceives this challenge to the extent that today s surveys continue to indicate this issue as one of their topmost concerns unfortunately few if any of today s maltese politicians have the courage to point out to our electorate that the contribution of irregular and regular migrants to our economy has gradually become an absolute necessity our construction industry our catering establishments our environmental services and nowadays even our care services have all become reliant on the active presence and participation of non maltese and non european migrants living and working on the island ziabari how do you think brexit will change the politics of the european union and the eu uk relations did the british people vote for leaving the european union because they were unhappy with how their jobs were supposedly being taken by the immigrants or were there other factors at play gonzi it is rather difficult for me to answer the second part of this question also because it seems that the british parliamentarians themselves are at odds as to the reasons why the british electorate voted in the way they did as far as regards the first part of the question however in my opinion there are two obvious outcomes so far the first is the fact that as a result of brexit the remaining 27 members seem to have coagulated even more than ever before having been around the eu council table for almost 10 years i have experienced moments in time when disagreement between member states on some major issues threatened to weaken the institution itself this issue of brexit however seems to have galvanized member states in a manner that i have not seen for quite some time with regards to the eu uk relationship considering what we know presently i sense that the two sides are caught in between two stools on the one hand the eu cannot afford to send a message that a non member state will enjoy the same rights and privileges as a member state without shouldering the related obligations but on the other hand it is evident that the relationship between the two will necessarily have to remain based on a pragmatic approach in the full realization of the importance both sides represent to each other in economic financial social and cultural terms ziabari are you personally concerned about the rise of far right in malta parties such as moviment patrijotti maltin and imperium europa are pursuing a nationalistic agenda and their populist ideology seems to be dangerous for a multicultural malta what s your take on that gonzi my short answer to this question is no fortunately the vast majority of the maltese electorate remains firmly located between the center right center and center left of the political spectrum and so far there is no indication that the extremes are gaining any relevant footing amongst us this does not mean that our politicians should be complacent in the face of statements that endorse extreme positions on issues and values that are part of what makes us maltese and that have helped us to succeed against all odds even in the worst of circumstances we need to learn the lessons that emanate from other countries of a similar lineage as ours and learn to avoid making the same mistakes the views expressed in this article

we are accustomed to witnessing strange behavior on the part of government officials in developing countries where the all powerful leader demands loyalty at all costs and directs his minions to do whatever it takes to sustain his position in power apparently according to many of his critics the trump administration is headed down a similar path where anything regardless of ethics integrity or the law is acceptable as long as it enhances the interests of the ruling party can this scenario be bullish for bitcoin the latest shift in logical principles one would expect in the land of the free comes from trump s director of the national economic council larry kudlow who seems to imply that skyrocketing debt is acceptable if supportive the republican party has always espoused fiscal responsibility mr kudlow s career has bounced between stints with ronald reagan and wall street and then culminating in 2001 with becoming an economic media commentator first with national review and later hosting several shows on cnbc in march of 2018 at the age of 71 trump persuaded him to join his team in washington after joining he has become a biased mouthpiece for his boss kudlow has been known to be a supply side evangelist preaching tax cuts and deregulation as cure alls for whatever ails the economy critics contend that his views are at times extreme even strident attracting quick opposition when the evidence at hand argues for a counter position but as a television host his behavior may have been necessary to boost ratings he endorsed trump as a candidate one reason for the close association with the current administration the news today which many of his same critics find appalling is that he has backed away from anything that resembles fiscal responsibility and has endorsed trump s desires for a weak dollar and low interest rates his shocking proclamation was that he wouldn t see another rate hike in his lifetime this remark coming from a man who suffered a mild heart attack last june tax cuts and reckless spending have ballooned the national debt and budget deficits continue to rise with no end in sight the federal reserve has been doing its level best to allow for growth in the economy while keeping inflation at a low hum but bloating debt will sooner or later take its toll forecasts of economic growth are in decline and the possibility of a recession in this or next year is becoming a real possibility one that could upset trump s bid for re election in 2020 kudlow s obvious objective is to do whatever it takes from his position of influence to prevent this scenario from transpiring i e get the fed to back down as per one report of course we know the real reason he threw cold water on rate hawks he s trying to make sure the stock market is as pumped up as possible for trump 2020 so he can keep his job kudlow s economic plan also requires a desperately weak dollar to keep foreign investment funding the debt hole trump blew open with the recent tax reform the crypto community reacted quickly to these events by suggesting that kudlow was making a perfect case for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as protections against total financial mismanagement by those in control of the government the consensus opinion is best summarized by the following remarks i ve never seen a more compelling argument for bitcoin than the corruption and mismanagement that infects so many governments and central banks usually these are in nations like zimbabwe or venezuela where abuse of power has permeated every inch of public governance however disastrous monetary policy festers in the first world too as politicians the world over continue to kick the debt can down the road rather than deal with the tough decisions that might negatively impact elect ability millennials and generation z individuals will have to shudder at the prospect of enormous tax burdens and economic pain that awaits them when those in control now have quietly departed the store of value concept of bitcoin may then become readily apparent as the buying power of fiat currencies deteriorates

the spring meeting of the world bank and the imf during which the latter organization released its fresh world economic outlook has just ended what are the takeaways for the gold market stagnation or acceleration after the slowdown in thursday s gold news monitor we pointed out that the imf significantly cut outlook for the eurozone s economic growth this year from 1 6 to 1 3 percent but what about other economies the imf forecasts now 2 3 percent rise in the american gdp 0 2 percentage point slower than it was projected in january global growth is now projected to be 3 3 percent a downward revision from the 3 5 percent forecasted three months earlier after such cuts in world economic outlook gold should shine shouldn t it well not necessarily you see investors have already acknowledged the current economic slowdown the key question for the markets is whether global growth will accelerate or stagnate from this point onward as we wrote in the latest edition of the market overview we believe that the slowdown will prove short lived and this is exactly what is forecasted also by the imf with improvements expected in the second half of 2019 global economic growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent the reason behind our view is the recent stimulus in china the monetary and fiscal stimuli started in december and we see the effects now credit growth exceeded all estimates in march and the manufacturing sector unexpectedly return to growth while service sector activity accelerated importantly last month beijing announced billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending on top of measures last year so even if we do not see a return of a boom the current global slowdown is not likely to morph into a recession whether gold bulls like it or not another important factor here is the shift away from tighter monetary policy by central banks in particular the fed has changed its view that low unemployment rate will have to spur inflation rather due to global competition and technological progress low inflation rate may stay with us for longer so there is no need for aggressive tightening a more dovish fed and the resulting downward pressure on the real interest rates and the us dollar should support the gold prices moreover trade tensions has somewhat eased at the spring meeting of world bank and the imf u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin said that he was hopeful the u s and china are close to the final round of trade talks last but not least the eu has postponed the deadline for brexit until the end of october raising the odds of orderly divorce and the british politicians seem to be approaching the customs union compromise which would not be as harmful as the hard brexit if these two big risks i e full blown trade war and chaotic exit of the uk without a deal don t materialize the risk appetite among investors may increase which could hit the safe havens such as gold implications for gold the key message from the imf s spring meeting and its recent world economic outlook is that there will be a significant growth slowdown this year however some of the idiosyncratic factors and uncertainties weighing on growth are waning while central banks and government are adopting more accommodative policies here we expect the current slowdown to be temporary and followed by a rebound in the second half of the year what does it imply for gold well the slowdown combined with a more dovish fed are key factors which could make 2019 a better year for gold than 2018 the rebound in growth could be conversely negative for the gold prices however although the us gdp might accelerate later this year the pace of economic expansion is projected to be slower than last year when fiscal stimulus spurred growth and the imf forecasts it to decline further in 2020 as the chart below shows the convergence between the us and europe s economies should ease the upward pressure on greenback and support gold chart 1 half yearly growth forecasts annualized semiannual change for the us green line eurozone red line and japan blue line from h1 2015 to h2 2020 indeed if we see a revival in the eurozone the euro may strengthen against the greenback which would also be supportive for the gold prices after all the current slowdown did not make the yellow metal to rally because it was concentrated mainly in europe
the philippines government said this week it is trying to repair its damaged mining sector with officials stating they will review all policies implemented by former environment secretary regina lopez who took a hardline stance against operations around the country but as that mining nation swings to the better another key metals country has gone the other way with the government implementing a raft of policies that may well decimate the entire sector here tanzania as i ve discussed the tanzania government has gone to war with miners in recent months accusing companies like acacia mining of cheating on export duties resulting in a complete ban on concentrate exports earlier this year and this week officials took the fight to another level passing several new laws that will make mining much more challenging in the country here s what s happening the biggest change is a requirement for state interest in all mining projects with a new law passed tuesday requiring miners to give up 16 percent of their shares to the government at no cost and it doesn t stop there with the law further stating the government has the right to acquire up to 50 percent of the shares of any mining company the law states that such an increase in ownership will be commensurate with the total tax expenditures incurred by the government in favour of the mining company a vague statement that could likely be invoked under a variety of situations the government also granted itself power to nullify any mining and oil and gas contracts as it pleases and stripped local miners of any right to international arbitration related has u s shale wrecked its own recovery as a final stroke officials also increased mining royalties raising rates on precious metals and copper to 6 percent from a former 4 percent uranium royalties will also rise to 6 percent from 5 percent in country firms like acacia mining immediately said they would seek arbitration over the new rules but unless they can pull a rabbit from the hat tanzania s mining sector is going to be very subdued going forward with the new fiscal terms unlikely to be palatable for most firms watch for developments on legal challenges to the new laws and for a big drop off in project activity potentially with some effects on gold supply advertisement here s to self destructing by dave forest more top reads from oilprice com
the international monetary fund imf on monday announced that it will send a staff level mission to pakistan to finalise a bailout programme as finance minister asad umar hoped to secure nearly 22 billion packages from three multilateral agencies in the next three years at the request of the pakistani authorities an imf mission will be going to pakistan before the end of april to continue the discussions said a statement of office of the resident representative of the imf it added that the pakistani authorities and the imf staff held constructive discussions during the imf world bank wb spring meetings in washington dc towards an imf supported programme hours before the imf communiqu√© umar told the national assembly standing committee on finance and revenue that pakistan and the imf have in principle reached an agreement on all policy matters but the finance minister refused to divulge details of the imf conditions saying it could jeopardise the negotiations after the committee meeting the minister did say the electricity prices would go up due to idle capacity payments left behind by the pml n government both the sides have documented the agreement and an imf mission would arrive in islamabad this month to sort out technical details the expected size of the imf loan will be 7 5 billion to 8 billion umar added the dates of the imf visit will be finalised in the next couple of days umar said the agreement has been achieved on the budget deficit exchange rate management energy sector state owned enterprises and public finance management the finance minister insisted that the imf s conditions would not burden the poor the people are facing problems due to the mess left behind by the pml n he said umar said the national electric power regulatory authority nepra would periodically increase the electricity prices to pass on the impact of idle capacity payments to the independent power producers but sources said it is a condition of the imf as the government was initially against the proposal to bridge the gap between electricity generation cost and consumer price through administrative measures the finance minister said in addition to the imf lending the programme loans from the world bank and the asian development bank adb would also resume once the imf programme is approved both the multilateral lenders have suspended pakistan s budgetary support due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions the minister said the three multilateral lending agencies are expected to give a total package of nearly 22 billion in the next three years he said the wb lending could reach to 7 5 billion in next three years while the adb may also give over 6 billion in loans pakistan and the imf have remained engaged for the last eight months and the upcoming imf staff level mission would finalise the programme but the conditions that the imf has imposed in return of the bailout appeared stringent that would keep the pti government on its toes it will also be difficult to approve new legislation due to a thin majority of the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti in the national assembly and its minority status in the senate umar said the international capital markets are also receptive to the government s economic reforms programme and pakistan may issue a bond either towards the end of this fiscal year or at the start of the next financial year umar said the foreign currency reserves that have so far remained under pressure would soon start building up after approval of the imf loan the members of the standing committee asked the finance minister to share the details about the targets agreed with the imf the government cannot share the details until completion of the negotiations as this could jeopardise the whole programme he said after the meeting umar said in the next fiscal year there will be a primary balance on the budget that will be achieved on the back of enhancing revenue collection the government s revenues are not even sufficient for debt servicing heavy taxation under the imf programme may further hurt the economic growth said the pml n s qaiser ahmad sheikh but umar reiterated that it is the imf that changed the position while accepting pakistan s stance he said the imf has now admitted that the economy has responded to the government s policy actions umar said there is no link between the imf programme and the financial action task force fatf he said the government has prepared its draft report that would be sent to the fatf on monday he said the report would become the base for pakistan s second review that will take place in the third week of may the minister said this time the fatf would hold a review in pakistan and would meet the stakeholders umar said the stabilization phase would continue under the imf programme and if the government tried to end it prematurely this could result in the recurrence of high current account and budget deficits 9 2 billion financial assistance by china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates provided a breathing space that was utilized to negotiate a better deal with the imf he added
though the national debt is at a post war high the willingness of policymakers to address it seems as if it is at an all time low the last two years have been defined by massive unpaid for tax cuts and spending increases with little attention to addressing near or long term fiscal imbalances meanwhile commenters on the left and right are increasingly urging washington to ignore mounting debt levels and instead focus on enacting new costly initiatives while protecting special interest tax breaks and spending programs this new debt denialism could not come at a worse time the rapid aging of the population means that deficits and debt are on course to explode in the coming decades with a strong economy and unemployment rate below 4 percent now is the time to begin reducing deficits not increasing them as president john f kennedy once said the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining yet instead of repairing our fiscal situation policymakers seem intent on worsening it never have deficits been this high when the economy was this strong and they are growing we project debt held by the public as a share of the economy will double by mid century under current law from 78 percent of gross domestic product gdp today to over 150 percent by 2050 extending current policy we project debt will rise above 205 percent of gdp by 2050 nearly twice its historic record the consequences of such high and rising debt could be significant in this paper we explain that high and rising debt will slow income growth increase interest payments crowding out other priorities push up interest rates dampen our ability to respond to the next recession or emergency place more burden on future generations and increase the risk of a fiscal crisis this paper describes these consequences and will be followed by further analysis going into more detail this paper also includes a q a in response to some claims that debt does not matter while the economy is strong today policymakers ignore debt at their own peril debt cannot continue to rise indefinitely but can cause significant damage as it grows rising debt slows income growth one key consequence of rising debt is that it slows economic growth which in turn slows the growth of wages and income this slower growth occurs mainly due to the phenomenon known as crowd out whereby investors purchase government debt at the expense of making productive investments in private capital less investment ultimately means fewer buildings machinery equipment and software and even fewer new ventures or technologies as a result workers productivity growth will suffer and ultimately income and wage growth will slow the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that each 1 of new borrowing reduces total investment by 33 cents shifting an additional 24 cents of investment from americans to foreigners who then benefit from much of the returns a more recent cbo working paper suggests the amount of crowd out is even higher over time lower investment leads to slower income growth in a recent analysis cbo projected gross national product gnp per person a rough proxy for average income per person will total about 98 000 in 2048 in today s dollars if debt is reduced to historical levels under current law where debt rises to about 150 percent of gdp average income per person will total 92 000 in other words rising debt will reduce income per person by 6 000 or 6 percent compared to if debt were falling relative to the economy with income growth already expected to slow it would be unwise to further worsen this trend by increasing the national debt rising debt increases interest payments as the federal debt rises so will the cost of servicing that debt through interest payments in 2018 the federal government paid 1 6 percent of gdp for debt service going forward interest is projected to be the single fastest growing part of the budget under current law cbo projects interest payments as a share of the economy will nearly double to 3 0 percent of gdp by 2029 we project they ll double again to 6 3 percent of gdp by 2050 under cbo s alternative fiscal scenario interest will grow even faster reaching 3 4 percent of gdp by 2029 and 8 5 percent by 2050 under our projections for perspective the previous record high is 3 2 percent of gdp over time interest spending will eclipse spending on other programs under current law interest payments on the debt will exceed the cost of medicaid by 2020 and spending on defense by 2025 and it will be the single largest government expenditure after 2050 framed a different way interest payments already consume every dollar raised by the corporate income tax the estate tax gift taxes and federal excise taxes by the late 2040s under current law interest costs will consume all payroll tax revenue the more that is paid on interest the less that is available to fund other priorities or the more that must be raised through additional taxes or borrowing rising interest costs mean less opportunity to invest in the country s future combat important long term threats like climate change maintain a strong national defense or enact important new social spending and tax relief every dollar spent on interest is a dollar unavailable for something else rising debt pushes up interest rates another important consequence of rising national debt is the overall increase in interest rates throughout the economy as the government issues more bonds lenders are likely to demand higher interest rates to compete with other investment opportunities these higher rates are likely to permeate through the rest of the economy increasing the interest costs associated with mortgages car loans student loans and credit card debt not to mention business loans while the claim that high debt leads to higher interest rates may seem suspect given today s low rates a substantial body of literature finds evidence that the link is strong today s low interest rates are largely the result of a slowdown in economic growth unconventional monetary policy and increased foreign demand for safe assets high debt has pushed interest rates up a recent analysis by edward gamber and john seliski at cbo found that each 10 percent of gdp increase in the national debt results in a 0 2 to 0 3 percentage point increase in interest rates another study by economist ernie tedeschi focused largely on post recession data estimates each percent of gdp increase in annual deficits increases interest rates by 0 2 percentage points indeed cbo projects interest rates on ten year treasury notes will rise from 2 9 percent in 2018 to 3 8 percent by the end of the decade and 4 8 percent by 2048 under the alternative fiscal scenario where debt rises even higher interest rates would likely exceed 5 1 percent by 2048 at some point rising debt could increase interest rates much more significantly the figures above assume rates rise due to increased demand for debt financing if debt grew to the point that markets believed there was a risk that the federal government would accommodate inflation or other means of implicit or explicit default interest rates could rise to much higher levels rising debt reduces fiscal space to combat the next crisis during economic recessions as well as wars and other emergencies it may be necessary or even desirable to run large deficits yet the higher deficits and debt are in advance of a recession or crisis the less fiscal space a country will have to finance or combat that crisis a recent study by christina romer and david romer found that countries that enter crises with high levels of debt tend to do less to combat the crisis and thus recover more slowly romer and romer find that both economic and political constraints to borrowing are higher when debt is high they recommend countries reduce their debt during good times to create more fiscal space when the united states entered the great recession for example the country s debt to gdp ratio stood at 35 percent roughly its historical average by 2012 the country had borrowed an additional 35 percent of gdp largely to combat the crisis under our current trajectory it is not clear the united states would have the fiscal space to repeat this magnitude of intervention while there s no way of knowing how much fiscal space the united states has one illustrative measure could focus on the room before reaching the all time record debt level of 106 percent of gdp set in 1946 while it is unlikely this represents an economic constraint on borrowing it does represent when the debt level would be unprecedented and may serve as a political constraint under this illustrative measure the united states has 28 percent of gdp in fiscal space today declining to only 13 percent by 2029 under current law under current policy fiscal space until debt hits record levels would virtually disappear by the end of the decade this deteriorating fiscal space suggests it will become increasingly difficult to effectively respond to future crises importantly less fiscal space could also make it harder for the country to address new challenges and opportunities updating the country s social contract establishing a green new deal or ending impediments to capital growth is extremely hard when debt is so high and potential financing sources are already needed to keep the existing fiscal situation under control rising debt places an increased burden on future generations the national debt is fundamentally a generational issue continued borrowing to finance tax cuts or spending for consumption today creates an increased burden on young and future americans a child born in the united states today will immediately inherit almost 50 000 of national debt while that debt will never need to literally be paid back it nonetheless has costs for one the economic consequences of debt will be felt most heavily by younger and future generations slowing income rising interest rates and declining fiscal space all cumulate over time cbo estimates rising debt will reduce gnp by 1 percent after ten years 2 percent after 20 years and 6 percent after 30 years when compared to falling debt in addition the unsustainable path of the debt means that low taxes or high spending today will ultimately need to be offset to some degree by the future by borrowing more today policymakers are all but assuring higher taxes and lower spending on future taxpayers and government beneficiaries at a minimum younger and future generations will face an increasing interest burden and debt service will continue to climb indeed rising interest costs may already be adversely affecting future generations by next year the federal government is projected to spend more on servicing its debt obligations than it does on all programs and funding for children in other words the government will spend more on funding the last generation s consumption than investing in the future with so many unmet needs already and new challenges and opportunities emerging the united states does not need to spend the rest of the 21st century focused on paying for the past rising debt increases the risk of a fiscal crisis the united states is unlikely to face a fiscal crisis anytime soon but if debt continues to rise and it becomes increasingly clear that trend will not reverse the risk of a crisis will grow the fact that the united states borrows in its own currency makes default or insolvency highly unlikely the country s strong economy steady monetary policy stable political system and full faith and credit in paying our sovereign debt has so far stemmed any worries that the u s wouldn t fulfill its obligations but this may not last forever endless deficit spending tax cuts and refusal to make the tough choices of what to prioritize will eventually lead investors to question our creditworthiness a fiscal crisis could take many forms in a 2010 paper on the topic cbo describes the possibility of a debt fueled financial crisis in this scenario high and rising debt could result in a market panic that leads investors to demand higher interest rates this spike in rates in turn would erode the value of the u s debt held around the world currently about 14 trillion triggering a selloff of federal bonds given the structural role those safe assets play in the financial system the result could be a global financial crisis alternatively a fiscal crisis could take the form of rapid inflation if borrowing were sufficiently high or demand for u s debt sufficiently low the federal government could find itself printing new money in order to pay its debt while countries can often engage in modest monetary expansion or seigniorage without disruption continuously expanding the money supply to chase ever rising deficits is a recipe for hyperinflation the implementation of new heterodox economic practices designed to facilitate such printing could itself spark this inflation by undermining price stability high debt could also force the country to engage in austerity during an economic recession in order to avoid one of the above scenarios this austerity itself could create a crisis by expanding unemployment and holding the economy well below potential for an extended period of time importantly while high and rising debt increases the likelihood of a fiscal crisis it is impossible to predict what might spark such a crisis one possibility is a change in the attitudes of foreign creditors who for economic or geopolitical reasons may choose to sharply adjust their debt holdings a recession or financial crisis could also bleed into a fiscal crisis as has been the case with numerous fiscal crises through history a fiscal crisis could also emerge from a market panic over the sustainability of u s fiscal policy and reliability of the country s institutions which could be undermined by the adoption of new fringe economic theories that put monetary policy in the hands of elected officials luckily the risk of a fiscal crisis in the united states remains low but there is no guarantee it will remain that way the higher and faster debt rises the greater the likelihood a crisis will occur conclusion the u s government is deeply in debt while measuring the country s fiscal position in trillions of dollars or percentage points of gdp may seem abstract the adverse consequences of continuing on our current trajectory are real in this paper we discuss some of these consequences rising debt slows income growth increases federal interest payments pushes up interest rates reduces our ability to respond to the next recession or emergency burdens younger and future generations and increases the risk of fiscal crisis as an addendum to this paper we have also drafted a debt question answer piece responding to some of the claims that suggest debt does not matter in future papers we will discuss other negative consequences of high and rising debt including how it can damage thoughtful policymaking weaken political institutions and hurt the country s geopolitical standing former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen has repeatedly declared the most significant threat to our national security is our debt rather than putting our national and economic security further at risk and enhancing the negative consequences of borrowing by adding more to the debt policymakers should pay for new proposals and come together on policies to improve our fiscal situation without a solution the consequences of debt will gradually worsen over time and may be difficult to reverse for more information read why should we care about the national debt questions and answers

challenge uzbekistan embarked late on the path to market oriented economic reforms compared to other post soviet states until recently the country remained a closed centrally planned economy with growth largely driven by commodity export revenues that financed import substitution industrialization this was achieved through import barriers and restrictions to capital outflows significant directed lending as well as on and off budget subsidies which supported a wide network of state owned enterprises soes and a few private sector participants the economy was sustained by the commodities super cycle but with a deteriorating external environment it became increasingly evident that the economic growth was not accompanied by productivity growth or sufficient high quality job creation leading to substantial outward labor migration following the commodity price shock in 2014 the lack of price flexibility in exchange rates and domestic prices led to the widening relative price distortions and it became evident that existing economic policies were incapable of providing sustained productivity growth and good job creation to meet the needs of a growing and young population in 2017 the country launched an ambitious program of market oriented reforms that are unprecedented in its modern history with the drivers of the old growth model exhausted the new leadership embarked on a strong program of market reforms going forward the government of uzbekistan still needs to address a number of key challenges to achieve sustainable development and growth the current challenges include removing market distortions that undermine allocative efficiency and competition eliminating regulatory barriers to business operations promoting the reallocation of land toward more productive uses mitigating geographic inequities in access to social services promoting the sustainable use and management of natural resources making public administration more

liquidity conditions were likely to tighten in mid april as companies make first quarter tax payments boosting demand for cash and sucking funds out of the market such liquidity concerns earlier this month had prompted some analysts to predict an imminent cut to banks reserve requirements iris pang an economist at ing in hong kong said she maintains her expectation for an rrr cut this month as trade war uncertainties linger on there is a need to keep the fast yuan loan growth to help small private firms survive an rrr cut is needed to facilitate fast credit growth pang said in a note china may not need such fast ongoing credit injection into small private firms that said we believe that the central government will allow speedy credit growth to continue for some time at least until it is satisfied that the job market is stable investors looking for indications of a policy shift will be closely watching the pboc s actions when medium term lending facility mlf loans with a value of 366

beijing china s stimulus measures will shore up economic growth this year and next but may undermine the country s drive to control debt and worsen structural distortions over the medium term the oecd organization for economic co operation and development said in a report on april 16 beijing has stepped up fiscal stimulus to prevent a sharper slowdown in the world s second largest economy which is being squeezed by weaker domestic demand and a trade war with the united states local governments will be allowed to issue 2 15 trillion yuan 320 60 billion worth of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects a jump of 59 percent from last year but s p global ratings estimated last year that local governments were already sitting on hidden debt that could be as high as 40 trillion yuan infrastructure stimulus could lift growth over the projection horizon but it could lead to a further build up of imbalances and capital misallocation and thereby weaker growth in the medium term the oecd said in its latest survey on china s economy the stimulus risks increasing once again corporate sector indebtedness and more generally reversing progress in deleveraging it said china s corporate debt has fallen to about 160 percent of gross domestic product gdp due to a multi year clampdown on riskier types of financing and debt but the level was still higher than in other major economies the oecd said the government in march announced tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan 298 billion for companies this year which will lift its budget deficit to 2 8 percent of gdp this year from 2 6 percent in 2018 china s fiscal stimulus could be as high as 4 25 percent of gdp this year up from 2 94 percent in 2018 the oecd added easier monetary policy should help reduce the risk of liquidity strains which could put further pressure on businesses said ludger schuknecht deputy secretary general of the oecd but he said beijing should prevent any policy overshooting fiscal policy should aim to support the economy while avoiding any side effects he added i m sure government authorities and the pboc people s bank of china are monitoring this carefully it s a matter of implementing it stimulus in the right way he told an event ahead of the release of the report new bank loans rebounded more than expected in march and totaled a record 5 8 trillion yuan 864 1 billion for the quarter as policymakers pushed lenders to support struggling smaller private companies which are seen as higher credit risks than state controlled firms workers in shanghai china johannes eisele afp getty images but there are concerns that looser lending standards may fuel a further rise in bad loans as well as inefficient investment and speculation particularly in the property market underscoring the oecd s warning about debt risks data on tuesday showed growth in new home prices accelerated in march after cooling since november 2018 average new home prices in china s 70 major cities rose 0 6 percent quickening from a 0 5 percent gain in february according to reuters calculation of data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs home prices in china are expected to rise more this year than predicted just a few months ago a recent reuters poll showed as the government urges banks to increase lending and lower interest rates to support the economy the people s bank of china pboc has already slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs but top officials have repeatedly vowed not to open the floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns china s economic growth is likely to slow to 6 2 percent this year the weakest pace in nearly 30 years and growth is expected to cool further to 6 0 percent in 2020 the oecd said the economy expanded 6 6 percent in 2018 in march the oecd cut its 2019 growth forecast from 6 3 percent the oecd s outlook on china s economy was in line with a reuters poll published last week growth of china s exports of goods and services could slow to 4 5 percent this year from 5 1 percent in 2018 amid trade frictions with the united states the oecd predicted china s current account may swing to a deficit of 0 1 percent of gdp this year from a small surplus in 2018 amid its rebalancing towards domestic demand the oecd added by kevin yao

morning my name is gigi and i will be your conference facilitator today at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the blackrock incorporated first quarter 2019 earnings teleconference our host for today s call will be chairman and chief executive officer laurence d fink chief financial officer gary s shedlin president robert s kapito and general counsel christopher j meade all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer period operator instructions thank you mr meade you may begin your conference christopher j meade general counsel good morning everyone i m chris meade the general counsel of blackrock before we begin i d like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward looking statements we call your attention to the fact that blackrock s actual results may of course differ from these statements as you know blackrock has filed reports with the sec which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of blackrock to differ materially from what we see today blackrock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward looking statements so with that i ll turn it over to gary gary s shedlin chief financial officer thanks chris and good morning everyone it s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2019 before i turn it over to larry to offer his comments i ll review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both gaap and as adjusted financial results i will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results blackrock generated 65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter or 4 annualized organic asset growth reflecting our differentiated solutions based approach to addressing client needs our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our integrated business model and the investments we ve made to diversify our investment platform enhance our risk management and technology capabilities and build local expertise at global scale first quarter revenue of 3 3 billion was 7 lower than a year ago reflecting the impact of fourth quarter equity market declines on our 2019 base fee entry rate operating income of 1 2 billion was down 11 compared to a year ago while earnings per share of 6 61 was down 1 as lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non operating income and a lower share count in the current quarter non operating results for the quarter reflected 135 million of net investment income driven by higher marks on our unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments our as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22 and included a 22 million discrete tax benefit related to stock based compensation awards that vested during the quarter we continue to estimate that 24 is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation first quarter base fees of 2 8 billion were down 5 year over year primarily due to the negative impact of non us equity markets and foreign exchange on average aum and an associated mix change favoring lower fee fixed income assets compared to a year ago on a constant currency basis base fees were down 3 year over year sequentially base fees were up 1 or 3 after adjusting for the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter driven by market appreciation organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue on an equivalent day count basis blackrock s fee rate increased from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18 2 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 performance fees of 26 million decreased meaningfully from a year ago reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long only equity products as noted on our fourth quarter earnings call investment under performance entering the first quarter resulted in certain quarterly locking funds falling below high watermarks we saw improved performance in many of these funds during the last three months which better positions us for the remainder of the year continued momentum in institutional aladdin resulted in 11 year over year growth in quarterly technology services revenue and 17 year over year growth on a trailing 12 month basis as larry will discuss in more detail overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions advisory and other revenue of 49 million was down 22 million year over year primarily reflecting lower earnings attributable to an equity method investment on a sequential basis the decline reflected lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments total expense decreased 4 year over year primarily due to lower compensation and volume related expense employee compensation and benefit expense was down 54 million or 5 year over year reflecting lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower operating income sequentially compensation and benefit expense was up 5 primarily reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in issuance and mark to market of deferred compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower performance fees direct fund expense was down 19 million or 7 year over year primarily reflecting the negative impact of equity and foreign exchange markets on average index aum g a expense was up 1 year over year reflecting higher technology expense partially offset by the impact of product launch costs in the first quarter of 2018 sequentially g a expense decreased 61 million reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense lower professional services expense and 31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 41 9 was down 220 basis points from a year ago reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on quarterly base fees and a strategic decision to continue investing responsibly for the long term while we are always margin aware we have deep conviction in the stability of our business model which allows us to better navigate the financial challenges associated with short term market volatility since year end beta has been constructive organic growth has improved and a number of our hedge funds are back above high watermarks all of which contributed to 9 growth in our assets under management and position us well for the second quarter we remain focused on funding our most critical strategic initiatives to optimize organic growth and significantly advance two of these strategic initiatives technology and illiquid alternatives during the first quarter we are confident these investments will enhance outcomes for clients and generate long term value for shareholders last month we announced the binding offer and exclusive agreement to acquire efront the world s leading end to end alternative investment management software and solutions provider as clients increasingly add to their alternatives allocations the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on the single platform will be critical the combination of efront with aladdin will set a new standard in investment and risk management technology and reinforce aladdin s value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world subject to the french works council process we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter we have also announced the first close of long term private capital ltpc is an innovative perpetual direct private equity fund designed to create value for the long term limit reinvestment risk and operate with lower volatility than comparable vehicles it s a crucial new component of blackrock s comprehensive alternative investment capabilities which now include hedge fund solutions real asset private credit and direct private equity ltpc is another example of blackrock s ability to assess the market organically develop our capabilities and deliver the products and solutions clients need most our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases as previously announced we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5 to 3 30 per share of common stock and repurchased 1 6 billion worth of common shares in the first quarter including 1 3 billion repurchased in a private transaction at approximately 413 per share we have now completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019 but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise blackrock is having deeper and more strategic conversations with a greater number of clients than ever before and our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we ve made to assemble the industry s broadest offering of active and index investment strategies coupled with technology and portfolio construction tools the diversity of our platform positions us to serve clients needs in a variety of market environments and enables us to generate consistent and differentiated organic growth quarterly net inflows of 65 billion were positive across active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business blackrock s institutional franchise generated 29 billion of net inflows representing 4 annualized organic asset growth flows were led by momentum in fixed income reflecting continued demand for liability driven investment solutions and our top performing active strategies institutional active net inflows of 15 billion were driven by 13 billion of active fixed income flows reflecting strong activity in our insurance client channel momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continued into 2019 record quarterly net inflows of 6 billion were led by infrastructure real estate private credit and the previously mentioned first close of ltpc in addition we have approximately 22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies representing a significant source of future base and performance fees ishares net inflows of 31 billion reflect a global client demand for a diverse range of strategies including core fixed income factor and sustainable etfs we saw record quarterly flows in fixed income ishares as clients continue to adopt etfs for corporate emerging market and high yield bond exposures approximately 40 of ishares flows in the quarter were in higher fee products outside of the core resulting in annualized organic base fee growth of 7 in line with organic asset growth in the quarter retail net outflows of 1 billion reflected industry pressures in international equities and world allocation strategies partially offset by strength in blackrock s municipal fixed income franchise and event driven liquid alternative funds finally blackrock s cash management platform saw 6 billion of net inflows as we continue to grow our cash business leverage scale for clients and delivered innovative distribution and risk management solutions through a combination of cachematrix and aladdin in summary our first quarter results highlight the breadth of our investment strategies coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities and an ability to service clients on a global scale while we will never be immune to beta headwinds and the impact those headwinds can have on our short term financial results we intend to remain focused on investing in our highest growth priorities and exercising prudent expense discipline to ensure we meet the critical needs of clients and shareholders alike our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic growth in the most efficient way possible with that i ll turn it over to larry laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer thank you gary and good morning everyone and thank you for joining blackrock s first quarter call blackrock s broad investment platform generated 65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter representing 4 organic asset growth and 3 organic base fee growth the breadth of our investment capabilities spanning index alphaseeking alternatives and cash coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities allowed us to generate strong flows and importantly meeting the evolving needs of our global clients blackrock s commitment to staying ahead of our client needs continues to resonate and we are deepening those relationships with our clients throughout the world more than ever before following significant declines in equity markets in the fourth quarter of last year investors reversed their risk tolerance at the start of 2019 us markets have regained their losses and both developed and emerging market equities although not fully recovering around about 10 year to date high yield fixed income the most challenged category last year is now seeing inflows improved investor sentiment has been driven in part by easing concerns around the global monetary policy and trade the federal reserve and other central banks are emphasizing a more patient approach to monetary policy quieting investment investors fears of tightening monetary policy and conditions late in our cycle and investor focus on trade tensions have declined relative to last year as negotiations between the united states and china progresses despite strong market performance year to date average market levels are still lower than they are a year ago and investor optimism remains fragile as geopolitical risks in global growth concerns persist while recent developments in china should increase global capital investment spending notably weak eurozone pmi data it signals further slowdown in europe and the uk although a hard brexit has been avoided in the near term those issues remain unresolved in this global context clients are continuing to turn to blackrock our focus has always been and always will be to listen to our clients goals and challenges so we could better anticipate and evolve ahead of our clients needs today clients are increasingly asking for more transparency they are searching for more value and most importantly like we re seeing in so many other industries clients are looking for more convenience and they want sustainable long term returns but they also want everyone focusing on their outcomes and these are the major issues that are impacting i would say the asset management industry today i wrote in my letter to shareholders this year about the need for more dialogue around long term outcomes as we ve done throughout our history blackrock continues to invest in our investment platform and our technology to deliver the outcomes our clients are looking for every decision we make is centered on enhancing our ability to partner with our clients in two months we will cross the 10 year anniversary of blackrock s announcement to acquire barclays global investors over the last 10 years our strategy behind the merger has resonated being agnostic across alpha and index strategies allows us to have a different voice a differentiating voice for our clients much has changed for our industry and for blackrock in this past decade rather than looking for individual products clients are increasingly seeking a partner to help them create tailored portfolios it s only by delivering that to clients that we can drive growth and create long term value for our shareholders and that is why we continue to evolve our platform and our organization today blackrock s strategy for delivering long term growth is centered on three main drivers capturing the shift from product selection to portfolio construction leading in technology across the asset management value chain and gaining global and local expertise in high future growth markets around the world we do all of this with the ultimate goal again of enhancing our clients experience and deepening our client relationships globally last year we launched the client portfolio solutions team to formally bring together the strategic advantages that enable us to create a whole portfolio solution for both institutional and wealth clients leveraging blackrock s differentiated research our investment and technology capabilities in portfolio construction client portfolio solutions generated more than 11 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and continues to gain strong momentum we are expanding our capabilities across portfolio building blocks and investing in areas of highest client demands and etfs are one of those areas ishares generated 31 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and once again captured the number one market share of etf flows globally in europe as well as the high growth categories including fixed income etfs factor etfs and sustainable etfs this quarter flows reflects the diversity of our ishares platform by region in addition we saw 17 billion of net inflows in us ishares and we generated 15 billion of net inflows in european ishares which represented a 17 organic growth in higher fee ishares categories including fixed income factors and sustainable etf we generated a total of 38 billion of net inflows and core ishare generated 19 billion in the first quarter while these flows were partially offset by outflows from a handful of equity ishares which reflects the reversal of strong fourth quarter tax related inflows ishares continues to benefit from long term secular trends including the global shift to portfolio construction and to fee based wealth management financial advisors are increasingly adopting models to customize portfolio for clients in a simple and scalable way the use of models is driving demand for both etfs and high performing alpha strategies in addition to digital tools that help advisors better see where risks and fees are being allocated and blackrock is well positioned for that after more muted growth in 2018 we are seeing renewed demand for fixed income securities blackrock generated 80 billion of fixed income inflows across active and index products flows were led by increasing adaptation of fixed income etfs which generated 32 billion of net inflows across high yield emerging market bonds and treasuries non etf index fixed income flows of 29 billion were driven by strong demand for ldi strategies as clients immunize their portfolios and we saw diversified flows into our top performing active fixed income platform with net inflows of 18 billion across core fixed income municipal bonds and high yield strategies performance in our active fixed income strategies remain strong with 83 and 85 of assets above benchmark or peer median for the three year and five year period we are constantly innovating across our platform to meet client needs and delivering growth for shareholders for example in cash management where we generated 6 billion of inflows in the quarter we are leveraging our cachematrix technology to improve convenience and transparency for our clients we are also innovating on the types of cash management strategies we offer to clients and last week we launched a liquid environmentally aware fund or leaf as a prime money market fund with an environmentally focused investment strategy the fund will use 5 of its net revenues to purchase and retire carbon offsets and direct a portion of the proceeds to our conservation efforts increasingly clients want sustainable strategies that provide financial returns and target a measurable social or economic impact blackrock s goal is to make those strategies more accessible to more people beyond dedicated sustainable investment funds we re also integrating environmental social and government risk factors across all our investment processes we firmly believe business relevant sustainable data is useful for all of our portfolio managers and ultimately result in decision making that delivers better long term results for our investors and our clients with our continued focus on evolving ahead of clients needs we re also developing an innovative new private equity vehicle designed to meet institutional client needs for the long term high quality private company exposures blackrock long term private capital strategy ltpc offers institutions the opportunity to invest on the continuum between publicly traded equities and leveraged buyout style private equity the fund will have a perpetual structure and an active ownership approach designed to create value for the long term at the end of the first quarter ltpc secured 1 25 billion of capital commitments from cornerstone investments including ltpc blackrock had a record quarter in our illiquid alternative business with 6 billion of net inflows as client continue to search for yield and attractive risk adjusted returns we also deployed 2 billion of committed capital in the first quarter and have another 22 billion of remaining capital to deploy as we look to bridge the gap between public and private assets we also realize that clients benefit when alternative investments are evaluated inside a portfolio level risk management framework that is why we announced last week our exclusive agreement subject to conditions to acquire efront this acquisition will deepen blackrock s strength in two of our strategic growth areas our illiquid alternatives and technology and will enable portfolios that span traditional and alternative asset classes to be managed much more comprehensively technology is changing every aspect of the asset management landscape and blackrock s results milestones and continuum innovation are only possible because we have prioritized making technology essential to our entire business strong global momentum continues in our aladdin business driving 11 growth over year over year in our technology services revenues a number of new client wins in the first quarter including santander the first asset manager to use aladdin in markets such as brazil argentina spain portugal and momentum in investments we re making in technology will continue to drive our technology services revenues growth to the low to mid teens going forward blackrock s long term strategy is to provide technology across asset management value chain and we are expanding our technology platform beyond our core aladdin business to deepen our value proposition with clients and partners and generate direct technology revenues for the firm as the investment management ecosystem seeks deeper integration along investment lifecycles we are extending aladdin to our asset servicing providers to further unlock the network effects of aladdin platform earlier this month we announced a strategic alliance with bank of new york mellon to deliver an integrated data technology and asset management service capability to shared clients through provider aladdin by enabling access to investment management and servicing capabilities on one platform client will be able to further optimize and optimize their operating models and reduce operating expenses what are the biggest opportunities for aladdin going forward is to make the language of portfolio construction for wealth management wealth managers financial advisors individual investors aladdin wealth is now live with nine clients based in the us uk continental europe and asia we see tremendous opportunities for aladdin wealth to become the infrastructure of a wealth management landscape but more importantly it provides blackrock with an opportunity to deepen our value proposition and brand with wealth partners and their financial advisors accelerating trends including the movement toward portfolio solutions and a wider product usage a necessity of operating scale enhanced regulatory reporting are creating the need globally for a more comprehensive and a more flexible technology driven solution aladdin remains well positioned to capitalize on these trends as the industry leading whole portfolio investment operating system just as we continue to innovate and evolve our investment and technology business to meet our clients needs we re also evolving blackrock s leaders and we re evolving our organization to enhance client experiences with blackrock we made organizational leadership changes every few years because we firmly believe these changes bring great benefits to our clients to our shareholders and to our leaders themselves recent announcements are centered on bringing blackrock closer to our clients deepening our relationships with them and more efficiently and more effectively delivering all of blackrock s capabilities to our clients these changes help us maintain our entrepreneurial spirit by bringing in fresh ideas to different areas of the firm and further developing our leaders around the world i can say very proudly that i have never been more excited about blackrock s organization and our people than any time in our history we begin 2019 by maintaining our steadfast focus on client needs this will continue to position blackrock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future with that let me open it up for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from craig siegenthaler from credit suisse your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi craig craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst hey good morning larry so we continue to see blackrock expand further in the tech sector here we saw this again in the first quarter the acquisition of efront my question is how will blackrock clients use this software technology and also more importantly how do you plan on monetizing this technology including potentially supporting your alternative fundraising effort laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer so we look at technology in five business brands across blackrock and we re focused on every businesses actually we had a leadership retreat last week this past weekend and we spoke about how we have to work on technology in every business there s not a business at blackrock that should be untouched with technology technology has to be the component of shaping how we do business so we look at technology in five different areas we look at technology to deliver better alpha using more data sources we re using technology now as i spoke about in my prepared remarks creating technology for more convenient portfolio construction obviously we re using technology with more operational efficiencies aladdin provider is a good example throughout our history we re using more and more technology for risk management and now we re using technology to create more convenience with our clients by delivering better tools for distribution and so we re framing technology across all these businesses efront really is a great example of us using a technology to really help us in delivering two out of the three major long term strategies that we spoke about in my shareholder letter we speak about why technology has to be driving blackrock and why alternatives have to continue to drive the future of blackrock and efront helps us deliver in those two key categories the third one is china if i have to say a fourth one is retirement but those are two of the key characteristics of our forward growth strategy related to efront in itself it is going to be provided as a new revenue set component of aladdin and it is going to be an add on cost to our aladdin platform and so it will be integrated on top of the aladdin platform over time but it will be another sleeve and we re actually you know there were some overlaps with the clients and the remaining new clients that were part of efront so it allows us to have broader depth globally worldwide and so we look at this acquisition as another milestone of us really trying to build technology across all asset categories and we did cite that we had some weaknesses in alternative technology and aladdin and this really helps us accelerate the added sleeves of alternative technology on aladdin so this will be another revenue center for blackrock as a part of the aladdin platform craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you larry operator thank you our next question is from robert lee from kbw your line is now open robert lee kbw analyst great good morning larry good morning everyone thanks for taking my question maybe just flesh out a little bit on the alternatives platform obviously you spent in addition to the efront you spent a lot of time and energy some acquisitions organic growth can you maybe where do you feel like you stand with your alternatives platform in terms of do you feel like at this point you have most of the strategies covered and it s more about kind of scaling with subsequent funds or there s still places you feel like there s maybe holes ph you re looking to fill laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer let me have gary start it off and i ll try to answer it if i need to gary s shedlin chief financial officer yeah rob i think we feel that we re very well situated on the illiquid platform at the moment obviously we ve got a range of products now that span kind of across the more major categories lptc firmly puts us in the direct private equity obviously we have a significant real estate business an infrastructure business a private credit business we have a variety of solutions oriented businesses whether it be fund of hedge funds fund of private equity and broader alternative solutions so i think we feel like we ve got a foot in every one of the high growth markets i think you know when we add it all up today we ve got about 65 plus billion in illiquid plus another 22 billion or so of committed capital to go so that gives us a fair amount of scale i think when you look at the individual businesses one could argue that individually they re not big enough and so that will come obviously with successor funds and continuing to develop continue to deliver the returns that our investors expect and so obviously as we do that successor funds will get bigger and we will continue to opportunistically look for tactical opportunities to create more scale in those businesses but as i think we ve been very very clear culture is incredibly important to us we re not really looking to buy out anybody we re really looking to buy in people who want to be a part of our very differentiated platform and we see those opportunities as we ve seen in the past with our new partners from tennenbaum or first reserve and others we ll do things that basically make sense not only for clients but also for our shareholders so bottom line is we ll continue to see what s out there and be opportunistic but we feel like we ve got a pretty good growth platform right now laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer as you know rob we have been very systematic in how we have been approaching this it has not been what i would call it metamorphic by any means if you think about just our infrastructure platform we started really infrastructure in 2012 by lifting out a team of people we are over 20 billion now in infrastructure growing quite nicely we are raising a couple more funds so it s been very systematic and i think the same thing will be done over with ltpc over time that s going to continue to grow we actually have opportunities that continue to build that out we have real estate and so over time this is a growth area our first quarter was up 6 billion in growth that was a record quarter for us as gary suggested we have 20 billion or 22 billion of the drag of committed capital right now and that they will be put to work we look at this as a real opportunity and our clients are looking to us to be really focused on these type of opportunities so i am pretty constructive on where we are at this point in time robert s kapito president can i add one thing the other part that we are pretty excited about is that we have done some institutional surveys and it shows that the largest reallocation is going to be to the alternative space so we do need to have a wide product base to be able to satisfy our current clients needs but also you know that we are very important to the retail base and they want exposure to the alternatives area so we re also working very closely with our retail distribution partners to create the appropriate wrappers to put the alternatives that have the appropriate risk and reward for those clients that are looking for it so it s not just institutional investors it s also retail investors that are looking to us for some exposure in the alternative space robert lee kbw analyst okay thank you can i ask may be a tactical follow up question larry you mentioned there being some kind of reversal of the fourth quarter etf equity flows that were driven by tax reasons but broadly across the industry despite this big rebound in the market it kind of feels like demand for equities in general both index and active have been pretty muted is this really more just symptomatic of the people bifurcating their portfolios more going to alternatives than obviously better fixed income demand or is there something else going on underneath that business laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer so on the question we saw strong rerisking for those were in cash that allocated back into fixed income we saw that predominantly a lot of investors were believing that interest rates are going to go higher central banks really continue to tighten and obviously the change in central bank forward forecast and their behaviors many investors were underinvested and put duration to work across the board as we have seen as rob kapito just mentioned we are seeing investors continue to barbell i think going more and more heavy into alternative spaces what the first quarter showed also that investors are still selling equity exposures as an industry there were major outflows again in overall global equities as an industry this is one of the reasons why i actually believe we are at a pivot point now where equity markets despite the rally can have much more upside because the amount of under investments investors have in equities they have not rerisked in equities in the first quarter and so to me we believe as you are starting to see renewed economic activity in the united states from the slow pace of the first quarter and we are moving closer to about a 2 5 economy in the second quarter we are seeing stronger economic signals out of china from all the fears we had in the third and fourth quarter so i would argue there is a high probability going forward that investors are going to begin to rerisk across the equity platforms and what we hear from investors and we see investors coming in every day seeing our leaders seeing rob seeing me and the biggest question is we are being asked continuously where should we put our money there is huge pools of money sitting in the sideline and many people now we are going to have the continued downdraft in the fourth quarter they thought interest rate is going to go higher a lot of as i said the bigger risk is that clients are under invested not over invested so we see more upside here especially in equities robert s kapito president so one thing on the tactical comment if you started last year with a 60 40 stock mix which is what most people have by the time you got to somewhere in october that number would have been 80 20 which is really too much risk so you saw a lot of tactical asset allocation changes to get their portfolios back to 60 40 which means you have to sell stock and buy bonds and at the same time the risk free rate during the year went from zero to 3 so bonds look pretty good coming out of cash so i think we saw that in november and december that added to the fuel for the first time being able to take a tax loss for a very long time but now in the first quarter that people are getting back to where they wanted to be i think the risk on trade is coming back into the marketplace and you see that reflected in where they are allocating their money tactically now operator thank you your next question comes from patrick davitt from autonomous research your line is now open patrick davitt autonomous research analyst hi good morning guys laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi how are you patrick davitt autonomous research analyst i am well thanks you mentioned that the nine live aladdin for wealth clients could you update us where you think we are on the ramp up of noticeable incremental flow from those nine go lives update us on the pipeline of new go lives this year and are there any meaningful milestones you are looking to just see a more noticeable uptick in flows from that channel robert s kapito president so we re very optimistic on the aladdin for wealth because for the first time it gives a lot of the financial advisors the ability to look and test their clients portfolios to make sure that they are taking the right risk in them and so as they come on we are building it together they are asking can we do this can we do this what can we show our clients and of course within each system the things that these firms are able to send out to their clients have to be approved to send out that takes a little time so there s a little bit of a lag so there was a lag in implementation and now we are in process with many of them on getting them on to the systems and to understand how it works and what they can actually use for their clients so it has been an eye opening experience for many of their clients what we didn t realize was that aladdin for wealth can be used as an asset gathering tool and most clients in the retail area have accounts at more than one firm and if you are one of the firms that can show your client the risk and reward of their portfolios and then improve it that is a great advantage and we are seeing a lot of money move for those who have aladdin to do with from people that don t have it also the business has moved from individual stock and bond picking to asset allocation and portfolio construction and that s what the financial advisors are expected to be able to do by using aladdin for wealth they are able to take not only one portfolio but hundreds of portfolios and organize them in an appropriate way for risk return using portfolio construction it also helps each of these individual institutions utilize their models as well as have an alternative model to compare it against blackrock s models and so aladdin for wealth is helping the financial advisor to have tools for better decision making right at their fingertips and also of course if they are using our portfolio allocation or our tools there s a high probability that they may look favorably upon our products in portfolio construction today because of the way the compensation system works they want to use the cheapest products that they can find to do that portfolio allocation and those wind up being etfs and index product of which we have a significant market share so aladdin for wealth is helping the financial advisors have the tools to do their job better it s helping us to be part of the infrastructure and the ecosystem to build out better tools and technology for firms that unfortunately under invested in technology and at this time cost is very important to be able to buy it at a good price and have it maintained is i think just going to grow for the future so we are very excited about it but as we have done with aladdin as we have brought clients on we are learning as well what some of the advisors need and we are building it together to have the best tools and the tools will also create an ecosystem that also is working with their custodians so that it s much easier and larry mentioned the word convenience so it s a tool that s right at their fingertips so they can log on and get really good information and very good scrubbed data so that they can have a better system gary s shedlin chief financial officer but patrick just to be clear just some of the terminology i just want to make sure we are clear on i mean the most significant immediate impact from a p l standpoint is obviously to see the revenue show up in our technology services line which is where the aladdin wealth line will hit there s two components to aladdin wealth there s kind of that what i would call more of the top down kind of home office view which is really driving the technology revenue and then there will be that bottoms up impact that basically will happen at the individual advisor level which will generate the flows which i think was your initial question keep in mind a lot of this is happening real time we are rolling it out right now at many places there is an element of training and getting all of these advisors up to speed on all the new tools that they will have at their disposal so the flow the flow deltas which will then drive our base fees is going to take a little bit longer than the immediate impact of that technology revenue that you are going to see much more immediately in other situations like envestnet where we that is not in aladdin wealth but is basically putting our portfolio construction technology on the desktop of the rias that have again i think there you will see basically more impact in base fees because there s no specific technology revenue associated with that type of partnership laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer but early indications for the aladdin wealth users who ve been on the longest there is evidence of increased flows to blackrock we don t have enough statistics to really identify where it is we don t have enough data with all the different users as we said nine clients worldwide and we re in conversation with many more clients so our objective is to have as rob just suggested the architecture for risk in the wealth management channel using aladdin for wealth operator thank you your next question comes from michael cyprys from morgan stanley your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi michael michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey good morning hey thanks for taking the question hey just on another question on aladdin here with efront that now brings you into alternatives just curious as you look across the aladdin platform what other adjacencies could make sense or capabilities that you d like to see strengthened with aladdin particularly as you look across the competitive landscape today gary s shedlin chief financial officer i think we are committed to being an end to end provider for risk management and analytics across from the front to the back so i think we ve been building out a lot of that in particular ourselves i think the decision to do efront was a conscious decision frankly that it was going to take us a lot longer to build that our belief is that the efront transaction accelerates our development in the private asset classes conservatively by five plus years so i think we felt we needed to attack there when we can otherwise i think we ll continue to add on all the obvious adjacencies when we think about an end to end provider and we ll continue again to be tactical and opportunistic to basically balance where we think it makes sense to buy versus where we think it makes sense to build laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer but it s clear that we are if you look at our strategy in terms of inorganic opportunities we are scrubbing we are reviewing we are really trying to understand the whole technology environment that s where we are focused on i have been saying this over quarters and quarters we are not focused on asset management m a in the developed markets we are focused on if there is an inorganic opportunity in technology that adds more opportunities to be as gary said end to end provider whether that s a data provider or a new technology or ai we will continue to be either building it or using it using opportunities to acquire and that s what we re very much focused on and we have a whole team continuously looking at the whole ecosystem worldwide operator thank you your next question is from alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi alex alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question so gary maybe just a refresher on some of the guidance that you guys provided in the beginning of the year given the fact that markets moved pretty considerably over the course of q1 maybe how you guys are thinking about outlook for g a for the rest of the year i think your original guide implies something in a 1 6 billion kind of annual number does that still hold and then any other comments around expenses would be helpful thanks gary s shedlin chief financial officer thanks alex i would say really short answer is no change in guidance i think that as we said at the beginning of the year we are very focused on managing the entire discretionary expense base we continue to see our 2019 kind of core level of g a expense to be essentially flat to our core level for last year and we are continuing to invest i mean as always there are things that come up that are effectively kind of not manageable so we saw another let s call it i would say roughly 15 million to 20 million of kind of like non core g a in this quarter between paying some fees to get efront done and some more purchase price contingency fair market value adjustments and some fx implications but in terms of what we are managing we are continuing to stick to the plan that we laid out for our board in january i think that we try to anticipate we saw some volatility and as i said in my prepared remarks we are very much focused on the long term not trying to manage doing margin on a quarter to quarter basis obviously we saw a lot of that beta come back which obviously better positions us i think we feel a little bit better with the markets where they are right now than when we went into our budgeting season back in the fall but we re going to continue to keep an eye down the field and play offense and continue trying to optimize growth in the most efficient way possible operator thank you your next question comes from jeremy campbell from barclays your line is now open jeremy campbell barclays analyst hi thanks guys just wanted to ask a quick one on the advisory and other line i know you guys had mentioned some items that moves it on a year over year and sequential basis but it was a pretty big step down and so i guess just what s the outlook and how should we think about that line going forward from this lower 1q type level robert s kapito president so our other revenue line item is really made up of three main components the biggest component frankly is an equity method investment that we have had for a number of years which is obviously where we are getting our attributable share of somebody else s earnings and that one is a little more complicated because we don t control that and that frankly on a quarter over quarter basis i am sorry on a year over year basis was the most significant change there the other two businesses that are effectively in that is our fma business our financial markets advisory business as well as our transition investment management business i would say those are both smaller revenue line items where there is significantly more consistency and those are both businesses that are important to blackrock that we continue to look to grow and annuitize as much as we can albeit both of those tend to have some what i would call more capital market centric elements to them so they are a little bit volatile really the biggest piece of that year over year change was the equity method now i think everybody knows who that is and you guys can track that as well as we can operator thank you your last question comes from ken worthington from jpmorgan your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi ken ken worthington jpmorgan analyst hi thank you for squeezing me in can you help us frame how ishares operating margins and ishares margins on incremental revenue have evolved over the last say two years or three years clearly core is much bigger fee rates are down but assets are way up so given the various cross current i was hoping to frame how margins might look in ishares and to what extent the significant growth in core and in ishares overall have impacted the margins on incremental revenue there gary s shedlin chief financial officer so ken as you know we don t talk about margins of our individual businesses we are very focused on a one blackrock model to avoid all of our businesses operating as silos it s very important to our culture and it s how we manage the business day in and day out so we don t have those types of fully allocated p ls for our businesses because we don t think it engenders the right behavior day to day i can help you on the revenue line item i think back in december we were at goldman and we talked about what we see as effectively the long term growth potential for ishares and etfs i think we outlined a 12 to 15 kind of top line asset growth rate i think we do anticipate certain sectors growing faster than others which is why we have tried to point people to an organic base fee rate that will be less than that historically i think we have seen an organic base fee rate somewhere around 6 points to 7 points less than that which is part of the slide we put out at goldman don t hold me exactly for those numbers you ll have to go see it but i think that s about what it was and that takes into account both mix change in terms of faster growth in the core but also as well as some of the strategic pricing investments that we have made and will likely continue to make that makes sense both for clients and for our shareholders alike this quarter in particular we actually saw organic base fee growth equal to organic asset growth it was right in the 7 area and again i think that is a function again of about 40 of the flows being outside of the core and that s an area whether it be fixed income strategic beta factors esg or other precision exposures frankly that tend to be more capital markets centric and the importance of that obviously is that those are higher fee than the core itself and i think we do continue to believe very strongly that as we see growth in the core we also see growth outside of the core as people are tactically allocating portfolios around the core etfs so that s what i would tell you about the revenue i think we feel very comfortable that our ishares business will be growing in excess of our 5 longer term growth target but as it relates to specific margins i ll leave that to you guys to try and sort through we don t manage the business that way operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer i do i want to just thank everybody for joining this morning and your continued interest in blackrock i believe our first quarter results are directly linked to the investments we made over time and our deep partnerships we built with our clients globally i think we differentiate ourselves by continuing to leverage our scale we continue to invest in a broad investment and technology platform to deliver value to our clients and shareholders we are continuing to drive technology as a leading force in the transformation of who blackrock is and the transformation of how blackrock works with our clients and we will continue to do that with that everyone have a very nice spring and we ll be talking to you sometime in july thanks operator this concludes today s teleconference you may now disconnect duration 61 minutes call participants christopher j meade general counsel gary s shedlin chief financial

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com the closing months of 2018 and the early months of this year have seen a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the world particularly marked in europe and in east asia this exceeded expectations and has strengthened fears of a coming recession yet as was argued in the last quarterly note these fears still seem excessive and while growth forecasts have been downgraded for 2019 a recession will hopefully be avoided both this year and next after all some of the clouds that darkened the financial picture last year particularly for emerging markets have lifted e g dollar strength higher u s interest rates fears of inflation surging and some of the eurozone s weakness was generated by temporary effects e g gilets jaunes demonstrations in france new car emission tests or adverse weather conditions in germany the danger of recession is clearly least present in the world s two largest economies both the u s and china are still growing and are expected to continue to do so america is slowing down but the labor market remains robust and forward looking confidence indicators do not point to a future crisis in addition the federal reserve has announced that it will refrain from further interest rate increases over the foreseeable future indeed hints have been dropped that rates might even be cut as for the inversion of the yield curve with long term interest rates now below short term ones a feature often considered as a harbinger of recession this may well reflect changes in the longer term inflationary outlook rather than fears of a slump price pressures have remained very subdued for some time now and not only in the u s market participants may thus have incorporated the expectation of a structural downward shift in future inflation into their pricing of longer term bonds policy is also being relaxed in china on both the monetary and the fiscal front the authorities have accepted that some moderate slowdown is inevitable but will do their best to prevent year on year growth falling below 6 per cent while this is a far cry from the 10 per cent growth rates that china could boast of until recently it should be borne in mind that the absolute boost to the economy in dollar or renminbi terms of a 6 per cent growth rate today is of a similar order of magnitude to that of a 10 per cent growth rate in say 2010 or 2011 import demand for commodities may well continue to slow down but demand for consumer goods should remain healthy a return to somewhat faster growth in china is likely in turn to strengthen the outlook in the developing countries of east and southeast asia as for japan modest growth should continue this year even if expansion in 2020 could be threatened by the imposition of a higher consumption tax europe remains the weakest link at the time of writing there is still great uncertainty on the outlook for the united kingdom the forecast shown below assumes that brexit will take place on amicable terms and that no significant barriers to trade will be erected on the two sides of the channel or in ireland a so called hard brexit however would have significant negative effects on british activity it would also hurt ireland and if to a much lesser extent several other eu economies on the european continent forward looking indicators for the manufacturing sector have been very depressed particularly so in germany and italy this is however not the case for similar indicators for the service sector suggesting that the major reason for weakness lies in external demand export prospects should gradually improve as the turkish and argentinian slumps give way to some recovery in activity as brazil s and russia s lacklustre recent performance improves and as china s reflationary measures raise the country s import demand the main danger comes from trump s protectionist tendencies he has defined himself as i am a tariff man 4 12 2018 and his urge to tweet his achievements might tempt him to put into practice his oft mentioned threat of a 25 per cent tariff on u s imports of cars and automotive equipment ostensibly for reasons of national security the direct effect of such a measure will obviously be negative but need not be overwhelming simulations made by oxford economics suggest that it would reduce euro zone growth by not much more than 0 2 per cent of gdp in 2020 indirect confidence effects however could worsen this picture domestic trends so far at least have remained relatively robust the labor market in particular is still performing well with unemployment declining in a number of countries nominal wage growth is also relatively rapid without this spilling over into inflation real wages therefore are expanding at a healthy pace and so is retail spending in addition policy is very accommodating the latest signals from the european central bank ecb suggest that negative short term interest rates will prevail through 2019 20 and fiscal policy is also moderately expansionary almost everywhere in europe the danger of course is that unfavorable developments on the external front could spill over into domestic trends leading both households and corporations into more prudent behavior a simultaneous slowdown in both external and internal demand could then usher in if not a fully blown recession at least a period of stagnation policy would almost certainly be unable to counter this in an effective way the ecb is highly unlikely to cut interest rates into further negative territory and a resumption of its quantitative easing program may well hit diminishing returns on the fiscal front a return to austerity is out of the question but there are clear limits to any further expansionary moves in some countries this is because of the size of public debt in others particularly germany it reflects policy preferences for budget surpluses spain and ireland remain the strongest performers in the eurozone spurred by reductions in private debt and by structural reforms germany and france are likely to record modest growth broadly in line with their potential italy may well stagnate this year and only grow marginally in 2020 political uncertainties have weighed on activity bank lending to the corporate sector is declining partly reflecting the high burden of non performing loans and

opinion everyone has heard of the federal reserve bank or the fed and that it has something to do with the value of our money and so it must be very important but few even claim to really understand what the fed does and how it does it this past week the economist which in decades past was a serious news and policy magazine stated flat out that president trump had nominated two unqualified cronies to the fed board of course there was no explanation of what the qualifications need to be for these board slots and why i expect if the president had nominated two ph d economists from the faculties of well known left leaning universities the establishment media would have applauded despite again not having a clue as to what the job entails having sat on a financial regulatory board i can attest to the need to have people with a variety of experiences in addition to attempting to conduct monetary policy a concept that becomes ever more elusive the fed is a major regulator of banks and other financial institutions the board needs people with experience in community banking and other businesses in order to have an understanding of how regulations impact small and medium sized banks and their customers when the fed was founded in 1913 the united states had about 27 000 banks there are now only a little over 4 600 left how many were killed by unjustified regulation leaving their customers with less service is there a need for the fed by 1913 most major countries had set up central banks even though the world was on the gold standard in the late 1800s and early 1900s there were a series of panics which we now call recessions most of them were very short lived and self correcting but for some number of months they did cause real pain after the panic of 1907 1908 a commission was set up to try to come up with a solution the solution ultimately became the federal reserve bank system established in 1913 the solution was actually a series of compromises between various vested interests wall street versus main street big banks versus small banks etc to mediate between these various interests the fathers of the fed yes they were all white males set up 12 regional federal reserve banks plus the washington headquarters with seven directors who serve in staggered 14 year terms in addition to serving as the lender of last resort in order to stop a domino effect of bank failures the fed has been charged with maintaining full employment and price stability obviously trying to meet these goals can conflict with each other for instance there was very little change in the value of the dollar from 1790 to 1913 but now the dollar as measured by the consumer price index is about 1 25 of what it was in 1913 oh never mind the stable price problem becomes worse each year what prices are they trying to control assets commodities consumer goods services when people spent most of their income on a few basic commodities wheat corn etc measuring the changes from year to year was straightforward now people are increasingly consuming food as individually prepared meals either frozen or freshly delivered how to compare that with a pound of ground beef the ultimate price measure disrupter is the smartphone which increasingly replaces former individually distinct and priced products and services at little or no cost t is a deflationary tornado traditional economic theory would indicate that interest rates should rise as both government and private debt burdens increase as a percentage of income yet this appears not to be happening despite the huge growth in government debt how do policy makers at the fed conduct monetary policy if markets show little response to changes in debt burdens the fed has an extensive history of policy mistakes too long to even summarize here the problem has been the assumption that the fed had better information and tools than it had at times it was expected to lean against the wind as if it had information not available to the market or smarter people in hayekian terms it suffered from the pretense of knowledge at this point it may be beyond fixing several very knowledgeable economists who have held high level positions at the fed including regional bank presidents have begun discussions about setting up a new commission to rethink the whole idea of a fed and its activities the structure that now exists is a jerry built concoction that has been assembled in bits and pieces for more than a century and increasingly appears to be past its expiration date the global private sector is developing cryptocurrencies and other monetary like instruments and institutions that will replace the fed and other central banks if they don t reinvent themselves in fact it may already be too late for the fed the european central bank home of the euro the bank of japan and others richard w rahn is chairman of the institute for global economic growth and improbable success productions

nearly all members of parliament showing solidarity by attending the next day s session in combat fatigues in washington experts saw the designation as a risky political provocation that would do

act and the 2017 countering america s adversaries through sanctions act the sanctions just keep on coming the reactions were swift when the trump administration designated iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps as a foreign terrorist organization in a move heralded by the white house as the first time that the united states has ever named a part of another government as a fto in tehran leaders

the 2010 comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act and the 2017 countering america s adversaries through sanctions act but these objections have largely overlooked the underlying logic of adding designations despite limited gains in economic pressure a vast institutional legal and surveillance infrastructure now exists that is devoted to the maintenance of economic sanctions today sanctions proponents are actively seeking to apply new restrictions in ways that make the eventual lifting of sanctions more difficult in part to preserve the emergent sanctions industrial complex a network of government agencies law firms technology providers and think tanks with a vested interest in the unceasing expansion of sanctions programs the think tank leader mark dubowitz who was among the most vocal proponents of the foreign terrorist organization designation has called for the trump administration to impose sanctions on iran in such a way as to make it politically toxic and legally cumbersome for a potential democratic president to reenter the iran nuclear deal in 2021 in this way america s financial wars now risk becoming the new forever wars for those committed to the use of sanctions as a tool of coercive diplomacy the important question is no longer how sanctions should be targeted it is whether effective relief is possible when changing political circumstances require the lifting of sanctions the term sanctions relief is odd because unlike relief from natural disasters it aims to counteract the outcome of deliberately chosen policies sanctions relief also appears too feeble a response to sanctions programs increasingly conceived as a means to wage financial war when conflicts end and policies shift from coercion to cooperation lifting sanctions in an effective way requires going beyond mere relief as the effects of economic pressure accumulate efforts toward reconstruction and not merely relief must follow the legal lifting of sanctions only by taking active measures to return the targeted economies to sustainable growth and well being can the benefits of sanctions relief become more credible this in turn would give diplomats increased leverage at the negotiating table unfortunately european and u s policymakers currently lack adequate harm reduction tools as recent events in iran and sudan demonstrate iran s trajectory in the last three years illustrates how even avid users of sanctions such as the u s government often lack the means to effectively lift them a shortcoming that can have grave effects on international politics on jan 16 2016 the united states implemented broad sanctions relief in exchange for tighter controls over iran s nuclear program as part of the nuclear deal with tehran the text of the agreement noted that the deal was meant to produce the comprehensive lifting of all un security council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to iran s nuclear programme including steps on access in areas of trade technology finance and energy but while the obama administration lifted sanctions as a legal fact the benefits of relief to iran largely failed to materialize in the words of then treasury secretary jack lew the obama administration relied on little more than global outreach to help governments and businesses understand the sanctions relief provided u s officials had no experience in lifting such a broad sanctions program they were blindsided by the discovery that a decade of strict sanctions enforcement had fundamentally altered the risk assessment of major companies and financial institutions expected to resume commercial activity in iran no one wanted to go near the country regardless of what washington said in an infamous london meeting in may 2016 then u s secretary of state john kerry met with bank compliance officers to clarify the status of u s sanctions against tehran and encourage their financial institutions to resume iran related transactions but almost a decade of sanctions enforced with billion dollar fines had made many banks steer completely clear of iran bank compliance officers quickly determined that the marginal revenue potential presented by iran was not worth the increased scrutiny from regulators and shareholders especially given the precarious political commitment that underpinned the lifting of sanctions hsbc s chief legal officer stuart levey formerly an undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence from 2004 to 2011 ridiculed kerry in an op ed noting that no assurances were provided as to how would subsequently be viewed by u s regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the event of a change of administration exactly the situation that transpired when president donald trump took office less than a year later even while former president barack obama remained in office the reluctance of banks and lingering sanctions stigma throttled iran s ability to attract much needed foreign investment in a december 2017 to january 2018 survey conducted by bourse bazaar and commissioned by international crisis group 83 percent of senior managers at multinational companies active in iran indicated that their companies were moving slower than they could to the iranian market attributing the slowdown to concerns regarding u s sanctions and the related difficulty in securing banking services by the time the trump administration was preparing to withdraw from the nuclear deal in early 2018 some opponents of the agreement were even arguing that trump should stay in it and avoid a political spat with european allies on the grounds that iran was receiving little economic benefit from the deal trump finally withdrew in may 2018 and has initiated a new so called maximum pressure campaign against tehran this move forced the european signatories to the nuclear deal to scramble to preserve some economic benefit for iran france germany and the united kingdom established instex a state owned trade intermediary the mechanism aims to coordinate payments so european exporters can get paid for their sales to iranian importers from money already in europe balanced with the payments owed by european importers for purchases made from iranian exporters the instex project is an example of how europe is now grappling with a new challenge of sanctions relief how to ensure economic benefits can be delivered to deserving countries in the face of secondary sanctions from a third party country meanwhile iranian president hassan rouhani has been weakened with domestic rivals pointing to the deteriorating economic situation as evidence of both his mismanagement and the error of engaging in diplomatic negotiations with the west iran s embittering experience with sanctions relief may have poisoned the well for future diplomatic negotiations over the country s nuclear program iran is not the only country where failure to improve sanctions relief has contributed to political crisis in sudan too the heedless way in which sanctions ended has destabilized domestic politics after most of the economic sanctions imposed against khartoum in the late 1990s were lifted in october 2017 there have been few material gains for sudanese society as nesrine malik wrote in foreign policy last year two decades of u s sanctions transformed the structure of the sudanese economy the country s isolation spawned an unofficial banking sector disconnected from global finance ending sanctions amounted to a shock form of globalization for sudan after the reopening of trade a major economic crisis gripped the dollar dependent country as inflation rose to 64 percent imports and government revenues fell and the sudanese pound lost 86 percent of its value in 10 months as in iran the failure of western policymakers to reframe discourse about sudan meant that foreign companies did not return to the country drying up foreign investments without a reorientation of diplomatic efforts the reputational effects of sanctions persisted as malik wrote for sudan the sanctions tail the aggregate result of years of economic pressure is proving to be an insurmountable challenge the sudan specialist alden young has pointed out that over time sanctions made sudan more dependent on u s dollars as access to this hard currency became one of the only ways of accessing world markets after they were lifted khartoum faced a lack of dollar reserves foreign direct investment inflows and export markets the government s decision to cut food and fuel subsidies in early 2018 massively increased existing discontent with president omar al bashir s dictatorship and produced mass protests in december the government embarked on a campaign of repression and deflection imprisoning and abusing thousands of protesters while edging closer to direct military rule ultimately it failed to quash the protests bashir s ousting by the military last week is to be welcomed even if it is unclear what a power transition overseen by the military will mean for the country lifting the u s sanctions on sudan was of course the right thing to do they had not worked for two decades and observers agree that they merely strengthened the sudanese regime but hardly anyone anticipated the consequences of lifting them so rapidly and the way in which the measures were removed harmed sudan s economy and society despite bashir s departure the material legacy of economic sanctions will require attention if sudan is to overcome his 30 year reign the economic chaos in sudan could have been averted if sanctions relief had involved more than just national security and foreign policy elites it was entirely foreseeable that without external support structural adjustment policies would impose further costs on the sudanese population strong external financial support was needed immediately in the form of hard currency loans and swap arrangements between central banks more broadly development specialists have to be involved in assisting with reentry into global markets while humanitarian organizations are needed to ensure a stable food supply similar efforts would have also helped address domestic political and economic pressures in iran after the nuclear deal the cases of iran and sudan clearly demonstrate that more proactive and comprehensive approaches to so called sanctions relief must be devised such approaches must anticipate the international and domestic political effects of lifting restrictions addressing this problem is an acute challenge as the trump administration threatens a more expansive program of sanctions on russia and venezuela and is expanding the targeting of specific companies worldwide even sanctions advocates should reflect on the positive effects of lifting many of the restrictions currently in place for a simple reason the overgrowth of sanctions weighs on the world economy so heavily that it destroys any incentive structure for u s adversaries to comply under the current conditions new economic sanctions serve to antagonize allies and rivals alike reimposing sanctions on iran has strained trans atlantic relations overuse of sanctions accelerates the collapse of u s international authority it also spurs national efforts to escape u s controlled networks of globalization to prevent such outcomes a new reconstruction approach to sanctions relief must be developed with interventions for the short medium and long term the immediate short term benefits of sanctions relief would be stronger with the provision of emergency finance in the form of multilateral loans ideally provided by a dedicated international financial institution special loans would also help investors price risk in the new market and reduce the stigma of reestablishing transactions with target countries lending has the inherent advantage of serving to commit the providing countries to the long term implementation of sanctions relief lest they forfeit the debt an even quicker support mechanism could come from swap lines between central banks such as those established by the u s federal reserve during the 2008 global financial crisis swap lines allow central banks to trade national currencies that they control against prevailing exchange rates through swap arrangements the united states could dole out much needed foreign exchange reserves to offset a post sanctions run on the local currency as happened in sudan the local currency pledged to the fed in exchange would then serve as a form of payment for imports from the united states the creation of international trade intermediaries such as instex can help bilateral trade recover more quickly even as banking channels between new trading partners remain limited such measures would help deliver the tangible economic benefits necessary to foster political support in the targeted country for the continued implementation of diplomatic agreements rouhani has seen his popularity fall dramatically as iranians came to realize that the economic recovery he had promised would not materialize medium term sanctions relief must include the provision of development expertise to help strengthen institutions and increase economic well being economic sanctions degrade government institutions and the business environment and they exacerbate mismanagement corruption and income and wealth inequality technology transfers and technical assistance could counteract these problems and remedy sanctions related achievement gaps development economists and nongovernmental organizations are better equipped than national security elites to analyze the harmful path dependencies caused by sanctions and propose effective remedies finally alleviating the long term negative impact of sanctions should include commitments to help remediate environmental damage a growing body of research has made clear that the environmental costs incurred by economies under sanctions can be debilitating for generations with the exhaustion of groundwater supplies and the depletion of biomass and soil erosion economic isolation has encouraged very harmful forms of land and energy use leaving such biosphere destruction unaddressed is irresponsible in a world increasingly gripped by catastrophic climate change together these interventions over the short medium and long term can be melded into a single cohesive program of sanctions reconstruction the need for expansive relief efforts in the aftermath of military conflict is widely recognized similar efforts should likewise become routine after a financial and economic war by presenting such a package western governments will gain at the negotiating table better relief makes the promise of lifting sanctions more credible and more valuable increasing the potential to obtain concessions and establish durable agreements the current trend toward the ossification and retrenchment

will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results blackrock generated 65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter or 4 annualized organic asset growth reflecting our differentiated solutions based approach to addressing client needs our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our integrated business model and the investments we ve made to diversify our investment platform enhance our risk management and technology capabilities and build local expertise at global scale first quarter revenue of 3 3 billion was 7 lower than a year ago reflecting the impact of fourth quarter equity market declines on our 2019 base fee entry rate operating income of 1 2 billion was down 11 compared to a year ago while earnings per share of 6 61 was down 1 as lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non operating income and a lower share count in the current quarter non operating results for the quarter reflected 135 million of net investment income driven by higher marks on our unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments our as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22 and included a 22 million discrete tax benefit related to stock based compensation awards that vested during the quarter we continue to estimate that 24 is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation first quarter base fees of 2 8 billion were down 5 year over year primarily due to the negative impact of non us equity markets and foreign exchange on average aum and an associated mix change favoring lower fee fixed income assets compared to a year ago on a constant currency basis base fees were down 3 year over year sequentially base fees were up 1 or 3 after adjusting for the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter driven by market appreciation organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue on an equivalent day count basis blackrock s fee rate increased from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18 2 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 performance fees of 26 million decreased meaningfully from a year ago reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long only equity products as noted on our fourth quarter earnings call investment under performance entering the first quarter resulted in certain quarterly locking funds falling below high watermarks we saw improved performance in many of these funds during the last three months which better positions us for the remainder of the year continued momentum in institutional aladdin resulted in 11 year over year growth in quarterly technology services revenue and 17 year over year growth on a trailing 12 month basis as larry will discuss in more detail overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions advisory and other revenue of 49 million was down 22 million year over year primarily reflecting lower earnings attributable to an equity method investment on a sequential basis the decline reflected lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments total expense decreased 4 year over year primarily due to lower compensation and volume related expense employee compensation and benefit expense was down 54 million or 5 year over year reflecting lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower operating income sequentially compensation and benefit expense was up 5 primarily reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in issuance and mark to market of deferred compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower performance fees direct fund expense was down 19 million or 7 year over year primarily reflecting the negative impact of equity and foreign exchange markets on average index aum g a expense was up 1 year over year reflecting higher technology expense partially offset by the impact of product launch costs in the first quarter of 2018 sequentially g a expense decreased 61 million reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense lower professional services expense and 31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 41 9 was down 220 basis points from a year ago reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on quarterly base fees and a strategic decision to continue investing responsibly for the long term while we are always margin aware we have deep conviction in the stability of our business model which allows us to better navigate the financial challenges associated with short term market volatility since year end beta has been constructive organic growth has improved and a number of our hedge funds are back above high watermarks all of which contributed to 9 growth in our assets under management and position us well for the second quarter we remain focused on funding our most critical strategic initiatives to optimize organic growth and significantly advance two of these strategic initiatives technology and illiquid alternatives during the first quarter we are confident these investments will enhance outcomes for clients and generate long term value for shareholders last month we announced the binding offer and exclusive agreement to acquire efront the world s leading end to end alternative investment management software and solutions provider as clients increasingly add to their alternatives allocations the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on the single platform will be critical the combination of efront with aladdin will set a new standard in investment and risk management technology and reinforce aladdin s value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world subject to the french works council process we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter we have also announced the first close of long term private capital ltpc is an innovative perpetual direct private equity fund designed to create value for the long term limit reinvestment risk and operate with lower volatility than comparable vehicles it s a crucial new component of blackrock s comprehensive alternative investment capabilities which now include hedge fund solutions real asset private credit and direct private equity ltpc is another example of blackrock s ability to assess the market organically develop our capabilities and deliver the products and solutions clients need most our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases as previously announced we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5 to 3 30 per share of common stock and repurchased 1 6 billion worth of common shares in the first quarter including 1 3 billion repurchased in a private transaction at approximately 413 per share we have now completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019 but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise blackrock is having deeper and more strategic conversations with a greater number of clients than ever before and our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we ve made to assemble the industry s broadest offering of active and index investment strategies coupled with technology and portfolio construction tools the diversity of our platform positions us to serve clients needs in a variety of market environments and enables us to generate consistent and differentiated organic growth quarterly net inflows of 65 billion were positive across active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business blackrock s institutional franchise generated 29 billion of net inflows representing 4 annualized organic asset growth flows were led by momentum in fixed income reflecting continued demand for liability driven investment solutions and our top performing active strategies institutional active net inflows of 15 billion were driven by 13 billion of active fixed income flows reflecting strong activity in our insurance client channel momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continued into 2019 record quarterly net inflows of 6 billion were led by infrastructure real estate private credit and the previously mentioned first close of ltpc in addition we have approximately 22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies representing a significant source of future base and performance fees ishares net inflows of 31 billion reflect a global client demand for a diverse range of strategies including core fixed income factor and sustainable etfs we saw record quarterly flows in fixed income ishares as clients continue to adopt etfs for corporate emerging market and high yield bond exposures approximately 40 of ishares flows in the quarter were in higher fee products outside of the core resulting in annualized organic base fee growth of 7 in line with organic asset growth in the quarter retail net outflows of 1 billion reflected industry pressures in international equities and world allocation strategies partially offset by strength in blackrock s municipal fixed income franchise and event driven liquid alternative funds finally blackrock s cash management platform saw 6 billion of net inflows as we continue to grow our cash business leverage scale for clients and delivered innovative distribution and risk management solutions through a combination of cachematrix and aladdin in summary our first quarter results highlight the breadth of our investment strategies coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities and an ability to service clients on a global scale while we will never be immune to beta headwinds and the impact those headwinds can have on our short term financial results we intend to remain focused on investing in our highest growth priorities and exercising prudent expense discipline to ensure we meet the critical needs of clients and shareholders alike our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic growth in the most efficient way possible with that i ll turn it over to larry laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer thank you gary and good morning everyone and thank you for joining blackrock s first quarter call blackrock s broad investment platform generated 65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter representing 4 organic asset growth and 3 organic base fee growth the breadth of our investment capabilities spanning index alphaseeking alternatives and cash coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities allowed us to generate strong flows and importantly meeting the evolving needs of our global clients blackrock s commitment to staying ahead of our client needs continues to resonate and we are deepening those relationships with our clients throughout the world more than ever before following significant declines in equity markets in the fourth quarter of last year investors reversed their risk tolerance at the start of 2019 us markets have regained their losses and both developed and emerging market equities although not fully recovering around about 10 year to date high yield fixed income the most challenged category last year is now seeing inflows improved investor sentiment has been driven in part by easing concerns around the global monetary policy and trade the federal reserve and other central banks are emphasizing a more patient approach to monetary policy quieting investment investors fears of tightening monetary policy and conditions late in our cycle and investor focus on trade tensions have declined relative to last year as negotiations between the united states and china progresses despite strong market performance year to date average market levels are still lower than they are a year ago and investor optimism remains fragile as geopolitical risks in global growth concerns persist while recent developments in china should increase global capital investment spending notably weak eurozone pmi data it signals further slowdown in europe and the uk although a hard brexit has been avoided in the near term those issues remain unresolved in this global context clients are continuing to turn to blackrock our focus has always been and always will be to listen to our clients goals and challenges so we could better anticipate and evolve ahead of our clients needs today clients are increasingly asking for more transparency they are searching for more value and most importantly like we re seeing in so many other industries clients are looking for more convenience and they want sustainable long term returns but they also want everyone focusing on their outcomes and these are the major issues that are impacting i would say the asset management industry today i wrote in my letter to shareholders this year about the need for more dialogue around long term outcomes as we ve done throughout our history blackrock continues to invest in our investment platform and our technology to deliver the outcomes our clients are looking for every decision we make is centered on enhancing our ability to partner with our clients in two months we will cross the 10 year anniversary of blackrock s announcement to acquire barclays global investors over the last 10 years our strategy behind the merger has resonated being agnostic across alpha and index strategies allows us to have a different voice a differentiating voice for our clients much has changed for our industry and for blackrock in this past decade rather than looking for individual products clients are increasingly seeking a partner to help them create tailored portfolios it s only by delivering that to clients that we can drive growth and create long term value for our shareholders and that is why we continue to evolve our platform and our organization today blackrock s strategy for delivering long term growth is centered on three main drivers capturing the shift from product selection to portfolio construction leading in technology across the asset management value chain and gaining global and local expertise in high future growth markets around the world we do all of this with the ultimate goal again of enhancing our clients experience and deepening our client relationships globally last year we launched the client portfolio solutions team to formally bring together the strategic advantages that enable us to create a whole portfolio solution for both institutional and wealth clients leveraging blackrock s differentiated research our investment and technology capabilities in portfolio construction client portfolio solutions generated more than 11 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and continues to gain strong momentum we are expanding our capabilities across portfolio building blocks and investing in areas of highest client demands and etfs are one of those areas ishares generated 31 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and once again captured the number one market share of etf flows globally in europe as well as the high growth categories including fixed income etfs factor etfs and sustainable etfs this quarter flows reflects the diversity of our ishares platform by region in addition we saw 17 billion of net inflows in us ishares and we generated 15 billion of net inflows in european ishares which represented a 17 organic growth in higher fee ishares categories including fixed income factors and sustainable etf we generated a total of 38 billion of net inflows and core ishare generated 19 billion in the first quarter while these flows were partially offset by outflows from a handful of equity ishares which reflects the reversal of strong fourth quarter tax related inflows ishares continues to benefit from long term secular trends including the global shift to portfolio construction and to fee based wealth management financial advisors are increasingly adopting models to customize portfolio for clients in a simple and scalable way the use of models is driving demand for both etfs and high performing alpha strategies in addition to digital tools that help advisors better see where risks and fees are being allocated and blackrock is well positioned for that after more muted growth in 2018 we are seeing renewed demand for fixed income securities blackrock generated 80 billion of fixed income inflows across active and index products flows were led by increasing adaptation of fixed income etfs which generated 32 billion of net inflows across high yield emerging market bonds and treasuries non etf index fixed income flows of 29 billion were driven by strong demand for ldi strategies as clients immunize their portfolios and we saw diversified flows into our top performing active fixed income platform with net inflows of 18 billion across core fixed income municipal bonds and high yield strategies performance in our active fixed income strategies remain strong with 83 and 85 of assets above benchmark or peer median for the three year and five year period we are constantly innovating across our platform to meet client needs and delivering growth for shareholders for example in cash management where we generated 6 billion of inflows in the quarter we are leveraging our cachematrix technology to improve convenience and transparency for our clients we are also innovating on the types of cash management strategies we offer to clients and last week we launched a liquid environmentally aware fund or leaf as a prime money market fund with an environmentally focused investment strategy the fund will use 5 of its net revenues to purchase and retire carbon offsets and direct a portion of the proceeds to our conservation efforts increasingly clients want sustainable strategies that provide financial returns and target a measurable social or economic impact blackrock s goal is to make those strategies more accessible to more people beyond dedicated sustainable investment funds we re also integrating environmental social and government risk factors across all our investment processes we firmly believe business relevant sustainable data is useful for all of our portfolio managers and ultimately result in decision making that delivers better long term results for our investors and our clients with our continued focus on evolving ahead of clients needs we re also developing an innovative new private equity vehicle designed to meet institutional client needs for the long term high quality private company exposures blackrock long term private capital strategy ltpc offers institutions the opportunity to invest on the continuum between publicly traded equities and leveraged buyout style private equity the fund will have a perpetual structure and an active ownership approach designed to create value for the long term at the end of the first quarter ltpc secured 1 25 billion of capital commitments from cornerstone investments including ltpc blackrock had a record quarter in our illiquid alternative business with 6 billion of net inflows as client continue to search for yield and attractive risk adjusted returns we also deployed 2 billion of committed capital in the first quarter and have another 22 billion of remaining capital to deploy as we look to bridge the gap between public and private assets we also realize that clients benefit when alternative investments are evaluated inside a portfolio level risk management framework that is why we announced last week our exclusive agreement subject to conditions to acquire efront this acquisition will deepen blackrock s strength in two of our strategic growth areas our illiquid alternatives and technology and will enable portfolios that span traditional and alternative asset classes to be managed much more comprehensively technology is changing every aspect of the asset management landscape and blackrock s results milestones and continuum innovation are only possible because we have prioritized making technology essential to our entire business strong global momentum continues in our aladdin business driving 11 growth over year over year in our technology services revenues a number of new client wins in the first quarter including santander the first asset manager to use aladdin in markets such as brazil argentina spain portugal and momentum in investments we re making in technology will continue to drive our technology services revenues growth to the low to mid teens going forward blackrock s long term strategy is to provide technology across asset management value chain and we are expanding our technology platform beyond our core aladdin business to deepen our value proposition with clients and partners and generate direct technology revenues for the firm as the investment management ecosystem seeks deeper integration along investment lifecycles we are extending aladdin to our asset servicing providers to further unlock the network effects of aladdin platform earlier this month we announced a strategic alliance with bank of new york mellon to deliver an integrated data technology and asset management service capability to shared clients through provider aladdin by enabling access to investment management and servicing capabilities on one platform client will be able to further optimize and optimize their operating models and reduce operating expenses what are the biggest opportunities for aladdin going forward is to make the language of portfolio construction for wealth management wealth managers financial advisors individual investors aladdin wealth is now live with nine clients based in the us uk continental europe and asia we see tremendous opportunities for aladdin wealth to become the infrastructure of a wealth management landscape but more importantly it provides blackrock with an opportunity to deepen our value proposition and brand with wealth partners and their financial advisors accelerating trends including the movement toward portfolio solutions and a wider product usage a necessity of operating scale enhanced regulatory reporting are creating the need globally for a more comprehensive and a more flexible technology driven solution aladdin remains well positioned to capitalize on these trends as the industry leading whole portfolio investment operating system just as we continue to innovate and evolve our investment and technology business to meet our clients needs we re also evolving blackrock s leaders and we re evolving our organization to enhance client experiences with blackrock we made organizational leadership changes every few years because we firmly believe these changes bring great benefits to our clients to our shareholders and to our leaders themselves recent announcements are centered on bringing blackrock closer to our clients deepening our relationships with them and more efficiently and more effectively delivering all of blackrock s capabilities to our clients these changes help us maintain our entrepreneurial spirit by bringing in fresh ideas to different areas of the firm and further developing our leaders around the world i can say very proudly that i have never been more excited about blackrock s organization and our people than any time in our history we begin 2019 by maintaining our steadfast focus on client needs this will continue to position blackrock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future with that let me open it up for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from craig siegenthaler from credit suisse your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi craig craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst hey good morning larry so we continue to see blackrock expand further in the tech sector here we saw this again in the first quarter the acquisition of efront my question is how will blackrock clients use this software technology and also more importantly how do you plan on monetizing this technology including potentially supporting your alternative fundraising effort laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer so we look at technology in five business brands across blackrock and we re focused on every businesses actually we had a leadership retreat last week this past weekend and we spoke about how we have to work on technology in every business there s not a business at blackrock that should be untouched with technology technology has to be the component of shaping how we do business so we look at technology in five different areas we look at technology to deliver better alpha using more data sources we re using technology now as i spoke about in my prepared remarks creating technology for more convenient portfolio construction obviously we re using technology with more operational efficiencies aladdin provider is a good example throughout our history we re using more and more technology for risk management and now we re using technology to create more convenience with our clients by delivering better tools for distribution and so we re framing technology across all these businesses efront really is a great example of us using a technology to really help us in delivering two out of the three major long term strategies that we spoke about in my shareholder letter we speak about why technology has to be driving blackrock and why alternatives have to continue to drive the future of blackrock and efront helps us deliver in those two key categories the third one is china if i have to say a fourth one is retirement but those are two of the key characteristics of our forward growth strategy related to efront in itself it is going to be provided as a new revenue set component of aladdin and it is going to be an add on cost to our aladdin platform and so it will be integrated on top of the aladdin platform over time but it will be another sleeve and we re actually you know there were some overlaps with the clients and the remaining new clients that were part of efront so it allows us to have broader depth globally worldwide and so we look at this acquisition as another milestone of us really trying to build technology across all asset categories and we did cite that we had some weaknesses in alternative technology and aladdin and this really helps us accelerate the added sleeves of alternative technology on aladdin so this will be another revenue center for blackrock as a part of the aladdin platform craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you larry operator thank you our next question is from robert lee from kbw your line is now open robert lee kbw analyst great good morning larry good morning everyone thanks for taking my question maybe just flesh out a little bit on the alternatives platform obviously you spent in addition to the efront you spent a lot of time and energy some acquisitions organic growth can you maybe where do you feel like you stand with your alternatives platform in terms of do you feel like at this point you have most of the strategies covered and it s more about kind of scaling with subsequent funds or there s still places you feel like there s maybe holes ph you re looking to fill laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer let me have gary start it off and i ll try to answer it if i need to gary s shedlin chief financial officer yeah rob i think we feel that we re very well situated on the illiquid platform at the moment obviously we ve got a range of products now that span kind of across the more major categories lptc firmly puts us in the direct private equity obviously we have a significant real estate business an infrastructure business a private credit business we have a variety of solutions oriented businesses whether it be fund of hedge funds fund of private equity and broader alternative solutions so i think we feel like we ve got a foot in every one of the high growth markets i think you know when we add it all up today we ve got about 65 plus billion in illiquid plus another 22 billion or so of committed capital to go so that gives us a fair amount of scale i think when you look at the individual businesses one could argue that individually they re not big enough and so that will come obviously with successor funds and continuing to develop continue to deliver the returns that our investors expect and so obviously as we do that successor funds will get bigger and we will continue to opportunistically look for tactical opportunities to create more scale in those businesses but as i think we ve been very very clear culture is incredibly important to us we re not really looking to buy out anybody we re really looking to buy in people who want to be a part of our very differentiated platform and we see those opportunities as we ve seen in the past with our new partners from tennenbaum or first reserve and others we ll do things that basically make sense not only for clients but also for our shareholders so bottom line is we ll continue to see what s out there and be opportunistic but we feel like we ve got a pretty good growth platform right now laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer as you know rob we have been very systematic in how we have been approaching this it has not been what i would call it metamorphic by any means if you think about just our infrastructure platform we started really infrastructure in 2012 by lifting out a team of people we are over 20 billion now in infrastructure growing quite nicely we are raising a couple more funds so it s been very systematic and i think the same thing will be done over with ltpc over time that s going to continue to grow we actually have opportunities that continue to build that out we have real estate and so over time this is a growth area our first quarter was up 6 billion in growth that was a record quarter for us as gary suggested we have 20 billion or 22 billion of the drag of committed capital right now and that they will be put to work we look at this as a real opportunity and our clients are looking to us to be really focused on these type of opportunities so i am pretty constructive on where we are at this point in time robert s kapito president can i add one thing the other part that we are pretty excited about is that we have done some institutional surveys and it shows that the largest reallocation is going to be to the alternative space so we do need to have a wide product base to be able to satisfy our current clients needs but also you know that we are very important to the retail base and they want exposure to the alternatives area so we re also working very closely with our retail distribution partners to create the appropriate wrappers to put the alternatives that have the appropriate risk and reward for those clients that are looking for it so it s not just institutional investors it s also retail investors that are looking to us for some exposure in the alternative space robert lee kbw analyst okay thank you can i ask may be a tactical follow up question larry you mentioned there being some kind of reversal of the fourth quarter etf equity flows that were driven by tax reasons but broadly across the industry despite this big rebound in the market it kind of feels like demand for equities in general both index and active have been pretty muted is this really more just symptomatic of the people bifurcating their portfolios more going to alternatives than obviously better fixed income demand or is there something else going on underneath that business laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer so on the question we saw strong rerisking for those were in cash that allocated back into fixed income we saw that predominantly a lot of investors were believing that interest rates are going to go higher central banks really continue to tighten and obviously the change in central bank forward forecast and their behaviors many investors were underinvested and put duration to work across the board as we have seen as rob kapito just mentioned we are seeing investors continue to barbell i think going more and more heavy into alternative spaces what the first quarter showed also that investors are still selling equity exposures as an industry there were major outflows again in overall global equities as an industry this is one of the reasons why i actually believe we are at a pivot point now where equity markets despite the rally can have much more upside because the amount of under investments investors have in equities they have not rerisked in equities in the first quarter and so to me we believe as you are starting to see renewed economic activity in the united states from the slow pace of the first quarter and we are moving closer to about a 2 5 economy in the second quarter we are seeing stronger economic signals out of china from all the fears we had in the third and fourth quarter so i would argue there is a high probability going forward that investors are going to begin to rerisk across the equity platforms and what we hear from investors and we see investors coming in every day seeing our leaders seeing rob seeing me and the biggest question is we are being asked continuously where should we put our money there is huge pools of money sitting in the sideline and many people now we are going to have the continued downdraft in the fourth quarter they thought interest rate is going to go higher a lot of as i said the bigger risk is that clients are under invested not over invested so we see more upside here especially in equities robert s kapito president so one thing on the tactical comment if you started last year with a 60 40 stock mix which is what most people have by the time you got to somewhere in october that number would have been 80 20 which is really too much risk so you saw a lot of tactical asset allocation changes to get their portfolios back to 60 40 which means you have to sell stock and buy bonds and at the same time the risk free rate during the year went from zero to 3 so bonds look pretty good coming out of cash so i think we saw that in november and december that added to the fuel for the first time being able to take a tax loss for a very long time but now in the first quarter that people are getting back to where they wanted to be i think the risk on trade is coming back into the marketplace and you see that reflected in where they are allocating their money tactically now operator thank you your next question comes from patrick davitt from autonomous research your line is now open patrick davitt autonomous research analyst hi good morning guys laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi how are you patrick davitt autonomous research analyst i am well thanks you mentioned that the nine live aladdin for wealth clients could you update us where you think we are on the ramp up of noticeable incremental flow from those nine go lives update us on the pipeline of new go lives this year and are there any meaningful milestones you are looking to just see a more noticeable uptick in flows from that channel robert s kapito president so we re very optimistic on the aladdin for wealth because for the first time it gives a lot of the financial advisors the ability to look and test their clients portfolios to make sure that they are taking the right risk in them and so as they come on we are building it together they are asking can we do this can we do this what can we show our clients and of course within each system the things that these firms are able to send out to their clients have to be approved to send out that takes a little time so there s a little bit of a lag so there was a lag in implementation and now we are in process with many of them on getting them on to the systems and to understand how it works and what they can actually use for their clients so it has been an eye opening experience for many of their clients what we didn t realize was that aladdin for wealth can be used as an asset gathering tool and most clients in the retail area have accounts at more than one firm and if you are one of the firms that can show your client the risk and reward of their portfolios and then improve it that is a great advantage and we are seeing a lot of money move for those who have aladdin to do with from people that don t have it also the business has moved from individual stock and bond picking to asset allocation and portfolio construction and that s what the financial advisors are expected to be able to do by using aladdin for wealth they are able to take not only one portfolio but hundreds of portfolios and organize them in an appropriate way for risk return using portfolio construction it also helps each of these individual institutions utilize their models as well as have an alternative model to compare it against blackrock s models and so aladdin for wealth is helping the financial advisor to have tools for better decision making right at their fingertips and also of course if they are using our portfolio allocation or our tools there s a high probability that they may look favorably upon our products in portfolio construction today because of the way the compensation system works they want to use the cheapest products that they can find to do that portfolio allocation and those wind up being etfs and index product of which we have a significant market share so aladdin for wealth is helping the financial advisors have the tools to do their job better it s helping us to be part of the infrastructure and the ecosystem to build out better tools and technology for firms that unfortunately under invested in technology and at this time cost is very important to be able to buy it at a good price and have it maintained is i think just going to grow for the future so we are very excited about it but as we have done with aladdin as we have brought clients on we are learning as well what some of the advisors need and we are building it together to have the best tools and the tools will also create an ecosystem that also is working with their custodians so that it s much easier and larry mentioned the word convenience so it s a tool that s right at their fingertips so they can log on and get really good information and very good scrubbed data so that they can have a better system gary s shedlin chief financial officer but patrick just to be clear just some of the terminology i just want to make sure we are clear on i mean the most significant immediate impact from a p l standpoint is obviously to see the revenue show up in our technology services line which is where the aladdin wealth line will hit there s two components to aladdin wealth there s kind of that what i would call more of the top down kind of home office view which is really driving the technology revenue and then there will be that bottoms up impact that basically will happen at the individual advisor level which will generate the flows which i think was your initial question keep in mind a lot of this is happening real time we are rolling it out right now at many places there is an element of training and getting all of these advisors up to speed on all the new tools that they will have at their disposal so the flow the flow deltas which will then drive our base fees is going to take a little bit longer than the immediate impact of that technology revenue that you are going to see much more immediately in other situations like envestnet where we that is not in aladdin wealth but is basically putting our portfolio construction technology on the desktop of the rias that have again i think there you will see basically more impact in base fees because there s no specific technology revenue associated with that type of partnership laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer but early indications for the aladdin wealth users who ve been on the longest there is evidence of increased flows to blackrock we don t have enough statistics to really identify where it is we don t have enough data with all the different users as we said nine clients worldwide and we re in conversation with many more clients so our objective is to have as rob just suggested the architecture for risk in the wealth management channel using aladdin for wealth operator thank you your next question comes from michael cyprys from morgan stanley your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi michael michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey good morning hey thanks for taking the question hey just on another question on aladdin here with efront that now brings you into alternatives just curious as you look across the aladdin platform what other adjacencies could make sense or capabilities that you d like to see strengthened with aladdin particularly as you look across the competitive landscape today gary s shedlin chief financial officer i think we are committed to being an end to end provider for risk management and analytics across from the front to the back so i think we ve been building out a lot of that in particular ourselves i think the decision to do efront was a conscious decision frankly that it was going to take us a lot longer to build that our belief is that the efront transaction accelerates our development in the private asset classes conservatively by five plus years so i think we felt we needed to attack there when we can otherwise i think we ll continue to add on all the obvious adjacencies when we think about an end to end provider and we ll continue again to be tactical and opportunistic to basically balance where we think it makes sense to buy versus where we think it makes sense to build laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer but it s clear that we are if you look at our strategy in terms of inorganic opportunities we are scrubbing we are reviewing we are really trying to understand the whole technology environment that s where we are focused on i have been saying this over quarters and quarters we are not focused on asset management m a in the developed markets we are focused on if there is an inorganic opportunity in technology that adds more opportunities to be as gary said end to end provider whether that s a data provider or a new technology or ai we will continue to be either building it or using it using opportunities to acquire and that s what we re very much focused on and we have a whole team continuously looking at the whole ecosystem worldwide operator thank you your next question is from alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi alex alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question so gary maybe just a refresher on some of the guidance that you guys provided in the beginning of the year given the fact that markets moved pretty considerably over the course of q1 maybe how you guys are thinking about outlook for g a for the rest of the year i think your original guide implies something in a 1 6 billion kind of annual number does that still hold and then any other comments around expenses would be helpful thanks gary s shedlin chief financial officer thanks alex i would say really short answer is no change in guidance i think that as we said at the beginning of the year we are very focused on managing the entire discretionary expense base we continue to see our 2019 kind of core level of g a expense to be essentially flat to our core level for last year and we are continuing to invest i mean as always there are things that come up that are effectively kind of not manageable so we saw another let s call it i would say roughly 15 million to 20 million of kind of like non core g a in this quarter between paying some fees to get efront done and some more purchase price contingency fair market value adjustments and some fx implications but in terms of what we are managing we are continuing to stick to the plan that we laid out for our board in january i think that we try to anticipate we saw some volatility and as i said in my prepared remarks we are very much focused on the long term not trying to manage doing margin on a quarter to quarter basis obviously we saw a lot of that beta come back which obviously better positions us i think we feel a little bit better with the markets where they are right now than when we went into our budgeting season back in the fall but we re going to continue to keep an eye down the field and play offense and continue trying to optimize growth in the most efficient way possible operator thank you your next question comes from jeremy campbell from barclays your line is now open jeremy campbell barclays analyst hi thanks guys just wanted to ask a quick one on the advisory and other line i know you guys had mentioned some items that moves it on a year over year and sequential basis but it was a pretty big step down and so i guess just what s the outlook and how should we think about that line going forward from this lower 1q type level robert s kapito president so our other revenue line item is really made up of three main components the biggest component frankly is an equity method investment that we have had for a number of years which is obviously where we are getting our attributable share of somebody else s earnings and that one is a little more complicated because we don t control that and that frankly on a quarter over quarter basis i am sorry on a year over year basis was the most significant change there the other two businesses that are effectively in that is our fma business our financial markets advisory business as well as our transition investment management business i would say those are both smaller revenue line items where there is significantly more consistency and those are both businesses that are important to blackrock that we continue to look to grow and annuitize as much as we can albeit both of those tend to have some what i would call more capital market centric elements to them so they are a little bit volatile really the biggest piece of that year over year change was the equity method now i think everybody knows who that is and you guys can track that as well as we can operator thank you your last question comes from ken worthington from jpmorgan your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi ken ken worthington jpmorgan analyst hi thank you for squeezing me in can you help us frame how ishares operating margins and ishares margins on incremental revenue have evolved over the last say two years or three years clearly core is much bigger fee rates are down but assets are way up so given the various cross current i was hoping to frame how margins might look in ishares and to what extent the significant growth in core and in ishares overall have impacted the margins on incremental revenue there gary s shedlin chief financial officer so ken as you know we don t talk about margins of our individual businesses we are very focused on a one blackrock model to avoid all of our businesses operating as silos it s very important to our culture and it s how we manage the business day in and day out so we don t have those types of fully allocated p ls for our businesses because we don t think it engenders the right behavior day to day i can help you on the revenue line item i think back in december we were at goldman and we talked about what we see as effectively the long term growth potential for ishares and etfs i think we outlined a 12 to 15 kind of top line asset growth rate i think we do anticipate certain sectors growing faster than others which is why we have tried to point people to an organic base fee rate that will be less than that historically i think we have seen an organic base fee rate somewhere around 6 points to 7 points less than that which is part of the slide we put out at goldman don t hold me exactly for those numbers you ll have to go see it but i think that s about what it was and that takes into account both mix change in terms of faster growth in the core but also as well as some of the strategic pricing investments that we have made and will likely continue to make that makes sense both for clients and for our shareholders alike this quarter in particular we actually saw organic base fee growth equal to organic asset growth it was right in the 7 area and again i think that is a function again of about 40 of the flows being outside of the core and that s an area whether it be fixed income strategic beta factors esg or other precision exposures frankly that tend to be more capital markets centric and the importance of that obviously is that those are higher fee than the core itself and i think we do continue to believe very strongly that as we see growth in the core we also see growth outside of the core as people are tactically allocating portfolios around the core etfs so that s what i would tell you about the revenue i think we feel very comfortable that our ishares business will be growing in excess of our 5 longer term growth target but as it relates to specific margins i ll leave that to you guys to try and sort through we don t manage the business that way operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer i do i want to just thank everybody for joining this morning and your continued interest in blackrock i believe our first quarter results are directly linked to the investments we made over time and our deep partnerships we built with our clients globally i think we differentiate ourselves by continuing to leverage our scale we continue to invest in a broad investment and technology platform to deliver value to our clients and shareholders we are continuing to drive technology as a leading force in the transformation of who blackrock is and the transformation of how blackrock works with our clients and we will continue to do that with that everyone have a very nice spring and we ll be talking to you sometime in july thanks operator this concludes today s teleconference you may now disconnect duration 61 minutes call participants christopher j meade general counsel gary s shedlin chief financial

for autocratic leaders seeking lessons from the toppling of sudanese president omar al bashir avoiding a currency crisis may be key to survival for autocratic leaders seeking lessons from the toppling of sudanese president omar al bashir avoiding a currency crisis may be key to survival it s the same problem that ravaged long standing rulers from angola to zimbabwe and may yet claim venezuela s nicolas maduro al bashir who the military ousted last thursday to end more than 30 years of rule faced months of protests against his government s economic mismanagement repression and corruption one of the root causes of the 75 year old s downfall was his inability to manage the shortage of foreign exchange that sent inflation soaring and hammered living standards sudan s woes can be traced back to the secession of south sudan in 2011 which saw it lose almost all its oil fields and 60 of fiscal revenue according to the institute of international finance iif but the government s decision to ramp up spending while pegging its currency only exacerbated the situation with the loss of oil revenue the government monetised the deficit causing inflation to spiral and reserves to dwindle as the central bank maintained an overvalued exchange rate jonah rosenthal and garbis iradian economists at the washington based iif said in a note the central bank devalued the pound by almost 40 to 47 5 per dollar in october last year but it was too little too late the currency s black market rate tumbled again and now stands at around 75 against the greenback inflation is almost 120 according to steve h hanke a professor of applied economics at johns hopkins university in baltimore al bashir is far from the only strongman to come unstuck in recent years thanks to a balance of payments crisis robert mugabe was pushed out by zimbabwe s army in 2017 as a dollar squeeze caused havoc in the southern african nation while the ruling party in angola pressured president jose eduardo dos santos to resign earlier than he wanted in the same year tellingly one of the first things his successor joao lourenco did was to devalue the kwanza to try and end a dire scarcity of hard currency and algeria s abdelaziz bouteflika who was forced out of power this month faced his own currency problems the 2014 crash in oil and gas prices crimped the arab nation s dollar earnings while it avoided the kind of economic pain seen in sudan it spent more than 100 billion of reserves to prop up the dinar and avoid tough measures such as a devaluation or turning to the international monetary fund for a bailout in venezuela where inflation is more than 1 million percent making the bolivar all but worthless maduro has managed to hold on thanks to continued support from the military and outside powers such as russia but if sudan and zimbabwe are a guide he ll also need to solve the currency chaos nobody survives hyperinflation daniel osorio president of new york based andean capital advisors which advises money managers on latin america said thursday at a debt conference in washington sooner or later it pushes you out bloomberg
by peng bo china daily updated 2019 04 16 07 54 a clerk counts yuan bank notes and us dollar bills at a branch of the industrial and commercial bank of china in huaibei east china s anhui province last week the international monetary fund raised its growth forecast for the chinese economy from 6 2 percent which it had predicted in january to 6 3 percent for 2019 at the same time it downgraded its global growth forecast from 3 5 percent to 3 3 percent owing to poor world economic growth including that of the united states last year despite obstacles such as domestic deleveraging and sino us trade conflicts foreign investment in china increased defying the global downward trend according to ministry of commerce data the actual amount of foreign capital utilized in china last year was 134 97 billion up 3 percent year on year and in china s manufacturing industry the actual amount of foreign capital utilized increased 20 1 percent year on year or 30 6 percent of the actual foreign capital utilized in the country 4 8 percentage points higher than 2017 according to the united nations latest global investment trend monitor the total foreign direct investment globally last year was close to 1 2 trillion 19 percent less than in 2017 with the us still attracting the highest amount of foreign investment 226 billion but the gitm also shows that last year the actual amount of foreign investment utilized in the us declined 18 4 percent year on year this means the gap between china and the us in terms of utilizing foreign investment has narrowed because of the us trade policies leading to trade conflicts with its trading partners especially with china china s gdp grew 6 6 percent last year slower than the previous years because of among other factors the global economic downturn the government work report which premier li keqiang presented at the national people s congress on march 5 said china s gdp growth target for 2019 is 6 6 5 percent slightly lower than last year but compared with the global economic situation china s economy is still growing steadily as for the chinese government s debt ratio it is comparatively low the chinese government plans to increase the fiscal deficit ratio by 0 2 percentage points to 2 8 percent of gdp but the figure would still be lower than the 3 percent international warning line the government work report also stresses that china will continue to implement a positive fiscal policy and a steady monetary policy on march 20 the state council china s cabinet decided to reduce the value added tax for several industries including the manufacturing industry from 16 percent to 13 percent and other sectors such as transportation and construction industries from 10 percent to 9 percent which suggests china is in a position to achieve its growth target this year which in turn will make it more attractive to foreign investment many investors and observers are bullish on china s economic outlook according to the business climate survey 2018 of the american chamber of commerce in china about 60 percent of the enterprises interviewed said china was one of the three major investment destinations and the european union chamber of commerce in china s business confidence survey 2018 said more than half of its member enterprises plan to expand operations in china and if the us federal reserve stops increasing the interest rate and the us stock market becomes increasingly volatile some foreign capital may flow out of the us and a part of that capital could make its way into the chinese market china has implemented new policies and regulations to attract more foreign capital the foreign investment law passed on march 15 indicates china s investment environment will further improve also li has said the foreign investment law will not only better protect foreign investment but also attract more foreign capital as global economic growth slows down and the chinese economy maintains stable growth it is expected that china will attract more foreign investment in the future the author is a researcher at the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation the views do not necessarily reflect those of china daily
the indian prime minister came to power promising to create jobs but five years later much needs to be done new delhi india on april 6 speaking at the university of delhi india s finance minister arun jaitley waxed eloquent about how the world s most populous democracy would become the third largest economy on the planet by 2030 after the united states and china by then the size of india s economy would have more than trebled to 10 trillion from around 2 9 trillion at present he said what was noteworthy was that jaitley s speech hardly dwelt on the performance of the government headed by prime minister narendra modi over the last five years as india votes in the 17th general elections between april 11 and may 19 190410185739389 votes will be counted on may 23 to determine whether the right wing hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp led by modi would be elected for a second term of five years the day after jaitley s speech the bjp released its election manifesto promising huge investments in india s creaking infrastructure roads railways bridges and airports the expansion of an income support scheme for farmers a welfare board for traders simplifying the goods and services gst scheme lowering income taxes setting up medical institutes and technology centres for small enterprises a few days earlier the largest party in the opposition the indian national congress had released its manifesto the highlight of which was a grandiose scheme for income support for the poorest one fifth of families in the country the bjp which had promised between 10 million and 20 million jobs annually before the 2014 elections has played down job creation job crisis even spokespersons of the bjp acknowledge that much remains to be done to provide jobs demonetisation destroyed the country s job creating potential and badly hurt those employed in the informal sector by abhijit sen economist we have to work harder to create job opportunities for the youth we have so far paid attention to investments by government bodies and we now need to boost private investments and create consumer demand by increasing the liquidity in the system gopal agarwal the party s national spokesman on economic issues said of late there has been considerable controversy about data on jobs in india while the government has been accused of suppressing job data leaked data indicate that the unemployment rate in the country at 6 1 percent is the highest in 45 years and that an estimated 20 million young men had dropped out of the job market over the last five years this is a particularly important issue in a country where half its population is below the age of 26 agarwal nevertheless believes that the modi government should be credited with major achievements on the economic front in 2014 when we came to power the indian economy was in bad shape inflation was at double digits the fiscal deficit was at 4 5 percent of the gross domestic product gdp indicators of the ease of doing business were relatively low the country s foreign exchange reserves were not very comfortable and we were not getting much foreign direct investments on all these counts we are in a much better shape today he told al jazeera 190110145940822 we have initiated technology driven solutions to problems encouraged start ups by small entrepreneurs and taken steps to move people out of agriculture and the informal sector some economists concede that one of the positive features of the indian economy in the last five years has been the low rate of inflation but this they argue is largely because the country has benefitted from low international crude oil prices dependent on oil india is dependent on imported crude oil for more than 80 percent of its requirements oil imports comprise around a third of the country s total import bill thus impacting the country s external balance of payments as well as the rate of inflation the performance of the government on the economic front has been pretty bad if you consider the fact that over the last five years the country has benefitted from a massive windfall on account of low crude oil prices to the extent of not less than two percent of our gdp each year said abhijit sen a prominent economist and former member of the now defunct planning commission we have to work harder to create job opportunities for the youth by gopal agarwal the bjp spokesperson he believes that low oil prices kept inflation under check the external balance of payments under control and ensured that the quality of government finances including the fiscal deficits of the state and central governments did not deteriorate under the circumstances the rate of growth of gdp was creditable though not as good as the government is claiming he said as world crude oil prices have firmed up over the last year or so the inflation rate has inched up high real rates of interest have squeezed corporate profits and suppressed consumer demand as well sales of passenger cars and two wheelers are down after coming to power the modi government launched several welfare schemes including a programme to give free cooking gas cylinders to women in poor households and opening bank accounts to allow the transfer government subsidies directly to the underprivileged an insolvency and bankruptcy code was established to resolve problems related to firms with unpaid debts gst mess but the opposition has accused the modi government of not doing enough to prevent high profile businessmen from fleeing india after defaulting billions of dollars of bank loans the biggest reform measure of the government was the movement towards a unified goods and services tax gst in july 2017 that subsumed india s complicated and messy indirect taxes regime spread across 29 states and seven federally administered regions the rolling out of the gst regime touted by the government as a classic instance of fiscal federalism however has been stymied by poor planning and implementation besides an erratic internet infrastructure arguably the most important reason why the beneficial impact of the rollout of the gst was not felt was on account of the unprecedented act of banning 86 percent of the currency in circulation in 2016 190328174935308 modi claimed that the shock decision would constrain the use of illegal money or black money or the money that is not accounted for in government records in the economy and check the use of fake currency notes by terrorists later the government claimed that demonetisation as the note ban was called would usher in a cashless or less cash society former prime minister manmohan singh described the move as an act of organised loot and legalised plunder demonetisation destroyed the country s job creating potential and badly hurt those employed in the informal sector that accounts for over 90 percent of the country s economy sen the economist said critics said that the credibility of the economic data put out has plummeted as the government was accused of trying to manipulate it economists like r nagaraj professor at the indira gandhi institute of development research mumbai claim that instead of a gdp growth of eight percent and 8 2 percent in fiscal years ending 31 march 2017 and 2018 respectively the actual numbers could be two percentage points lower agricultural sector performs poorly even if one accepts the figures put out by the government central statistics office the estimated rate of growth of gdp in fiscal year 2019 has been brought down from 7 2 percent to seven percent the lowest in five years almost all data other than the gdp growth figures including other items in the national accounts statistics shows the economy has been doing poorly in the last five years said surajit mazumdar an economist and professor at delhi s jawaharlal nehru university agriculture manufacturing and construction investment foreign trade bank credit wages government revenues trends in all of these show clear signs of an extremely sluggish economy incapable of creating employment opportunities that so many desperately need he said mazumdar contends that this is not surprising given the fact that the modi government has consistently emphasised fiscal consolidation and reduction of the deficit which is more about the state withdrawing from the economy rather than doing something for the economy one of the reasons for the sluggish rate of growth of the economy has been the poor performance of the agricultural sector both the bjp and the congress party have promised to implement schemes to provide a minimum basic income for farming families with small land holdings and low incomes what is acknowledged by all is that farming in the country has become extremely risky and provides poor returns close to one out of two indians depend on agriculture for their livelihood our performance on the agriculture front has also been pretty dismal with the rate of growth of crop output less than one percent per annum over the last five years sen pointed out 190409091407435 hundreds of thousands of farmers have marched on the streets of the national capital delhi and the country s commercial capital mumbai to draw attention to their plight curiously even as modi has been emphasising nationalism and the country s unity in campaign speeches his political opponents comprising a motley combination of regional political outfits and india s grand old party the congress which has become weaker than ever before have emphasised economic issues the opposition has been hammering the incumbent s government for its failure to create jobs for the youth make farming less risky disrupting the economy by demonetisation allowing bad loans of banks to balloon and increasing the gap between the rich and the poor even if the number of income tax assessments went up after demonetisation many economists believe the big bang decision hurt the weakest sections of india s population the most women and children dependent on them senior citizens farmers daily wage labourers and small traders and shopkeepers
i was sent two papers by thomas palley the other day i have known him for decades he continually disappoints he has become one of those self styled post keynesians who are trying to destroy the credibility of modern monetary theory mmt for reasons that are not entirely clear although i know things i won t write here he thinks that if he drops a reference to micha≈Ç kalecki the polish marxist economist into a paper it qualifies one as being post keynesian but the reality is that his work what limited academic work that he has published sits squarely in the neoclassical is lm synthesis tradition which is not post keynesian nor heterodox at all it is the antithesis of post keynesian so i have never understood how he wants to appear post keynesian anyway whatever the answer to that little puzzle is he definitely has a set on mmt and regularly recycles the same sorts of attacks which continue to have the same problems in other words he does not seem to or does not want to learn he also accuses those who respond of dishonesty playing the pure is me card although his own work on mmt fails in part because he deliberately or not refuses to acknowledge the extant mmt literature which addresses the issues he claims are missing in the mmt approach go figure his latest papers are 1 what s wrong with modern money theory mmt a critical primer april 10 2019 2 macroeconomics vs modern money theory some unpleasant keynesian arithmetic april 4 2019 i don t think they are worth reading but they do allow me to make some points that regular readers often ask about when the swedish economist lars p syll wrote a critique of palley s latest papers april 12 2019 thomas palley claims mmt fails to provide plausible macroeconomics he was met with this response from palley your blog post is misleading to the point of being dishonest i didn t find anything misleading at all with lars p syll s short overview of the problems in palley s work further if you consult the reference list in both palley papers above you will curiously find my own name missing now i am not precious about that but as the person who has written the most of anyone about mmt over the last 25 years and being one of the original academic developers of the work one would think that at least one of my articles books blog posts op ed articles would appear in a piece of work which claims to be a critical primer the reason this is significant is that many of the deficiencies he claims render mmt useless have actually been dealt with in detail in my own work and less so in the work of other mmt academic writers which is not to criticise my mmt colleagues we all contribute in different ways so i am then wondering has palley not read my work the answer is he has and indeed in february 2014 he did cite my work and lied about it he claimed that my work showed that i was a strong advocate of the traditional phillips curve which for anyone who has read my academic work including my earliest articles my phd dissertation and countless other writings would know that i have opposed the traditional phillips curve conception and presented alternative depictions based on buffer stocks and hysteresis the next option then is that palley has decided not to reference my work because he knows that would significantly compromise his case to the point of rendering his attack on mmt a non starter the selective quoting of literature is in fact the exemplar of the way academics construct dishonest scholarship not that palley is working in an academic post despite trying here are some examples central bank and currency issuance in the paper what s wrong with modern money theory mmt a critical primer palley claims that as regards injecting state money to pay taxes mmt is strictly wrong with its claim that the public cannot pay taxes until government has first spent in fact the central bank is the source of such money it can inject money into the system by buying existing government bonds buying private sector assets or by lending to private banks moreover under the current system the central bank can increase the money stock by paying interest on existing money balances that means government spending is not the only way to get state money to pay taxes into the system so did we actually miss that reality clearly not for example in a 2005 centre of full employment and equity coffee working paper essential elements of a modern monetary economy with applications to social security privatisation and the intergenerational debate we produced two diagrams subsequent discussion occurred in my 2008 book with joan muysken full employment abandoned shifting sands and policy failures that is way back then i then reproduced the diagrams with simpler explanations in my suite of blog posts 1 deficit spending 101 part 1 february 21 2009 2 deficit spending 101 part 2 february 23 2009 3 deficit spending 101 part 3 march 2 2009 here are the diagrams for reference diagram 1 essential government non government relations diagram 2 vertical and horizontal relations they were reproduced again in our new textbook macroeconomics with further discussion these diagrams are core mmt both diagrams and the related discussion acknowledge the government sector is the sum of the treasury and central bank in describing the way currency enters the economy vertically in our terminology you will see we include 1 central bank operations open market operations standing arrangements 2 foreign exchange and gold transactions by the central bank 3 government treasury spending mmt has never been strictly wrong on this issue from the outset we recognised the dual role of the government macroeconomic institutions treasury and central bank so why would he write that ignorance vindictiveness all he does is make a fool of himself and discredits his professional standing framing and language palley writes that mmt objects to its being called a constraint as if government were a household however that is a terminological objection moreover old keynesians also recognized it was not a constraint and referred to it as the budget identity or budget restraint later he writes more generally it is pure semantics whether taxes raise money to finance government spending or taxes destroy money in order to create the space for reissue of money to finance spending the second quote comes after a section berating mmt for being politically naive terminology semantics matter a lot in framing arguments and educational dissemination take the first of these quotes first the issue about old keynesians is important because it means palley has not understood what happened in august 1971 in his own nation the us at that point all of the old keynesian analysis about government fiscal restraints became moot because governments around the world freed fiscal policy by floating their exchange rates and introducing fiat currencies the abandonment of convertibility and the gold window was a major turning point in monetary history which apparently escapes palley s comprehension second it is no meagre terminological difference to construct a fiat currency issuing government as a household in the way mainstream macroeconomics does and to break with that construction in the way mmt does the behaviour and possibilities of a currency issuer are not comparable to those of a currency user our perception of what is possible for a currency issuer cannot be informed by our experiences as a currency user a household cannot buy whatever is for sale in the currency it uses a currency issuing government can if it chooses any time it wants clearly there are consequences in doing that but the point is that it can that opens up a completely different dialogue about what our elected governments might do to advance public well being an appreciation of that difference allows us to reject a political narrative that says we have to tolerate mass unemployment because the government hasn t the capacity to provide sufficient work once we understand that the government can create sufficient work then the political options broaden and the quality of our democracies rises there is more accountability for example so framing and language matter and one of the things that the core mmt group has been mindful of and intent on ensuring is that these conceptual points are clear in peoples minds take the second quote leaving aside considerations relating to the allocative reasons for taxes such as imposts on alcohol and tobacco for health reasons there is nothing semantic at all between an awareness that we are paying taxes to a government in order that it can then provide public services and infrastructure for example against the reality that those taxes are not paying for public expenditure a public that thinks that its taxation payments are funding public services is an ignorant public and will therefore be susceptible to spurious arguments from politicians which justify policies that undermine well being but are presented within the tina frame i could construct many examples of how it would dramatically change the political debate if the public understood the way governments spend the capacities the currency issuing government has and the role that taxes actually play in the system we could actually focus on class struggle more squarely by talking about power in relation to issues relating to increased taxes on the rich instead of falling into the mythical story that the rich are somehow important for funding public services which is the current way ignorant progressives are talking i consider class struggle further below inflation palley wrote in 2013 that mmt failed woefully because it did not have an inflation analysis i responded to that criticism in this blog post i wonder what the hell i have been writing all these years february 12 2013 at the time it was a ridiculous claim that suggested he had read very little of our work or was just being a vindictive or both so six years later after i had responded to his claims and pointed him towards our work he writes in the paper what s wrong with modern money theory mmt a critical primer that in mmt inflation is therefore presented as a threshold problem but that is not how inflation develops in the real world instead the economy consists of multiple sectors and some hit the full employment barrier before others consequently inflation starts bubbling up before there is aggregate full employment and government lacks the capacity to target its demand injections sector by sector and market by market this is just a rehashed point from his 2013 critique which i addressed in the blog post cited immediately above but it made me wonder what were all those articles and a few of the books i have written actually about i had thought they were about inflation bargaining conflict the battle of mark ups imported inflation via resource prices incomes policy and indexation and the phillips curve and related articles some with mathematics many with the latest econometric modelling further in our new textbook macroeconomics we summarise a lot of our past work on inflation and costs in the chapters on aggregate supply chapter 16 and in chapter 17 unemployment and inflation i had written draft sections of this in early 2013 but much of the material goes back to my published work starting in 1987 and continuing from there in the textbook we initially present the l shaped aggregate supply as schedule as below which is a simple beginner s approach to understanding the difference between a quantity adjusting economy horizontal supply curve and a price adjusting economy vertical supply curve this is figure 16 3 in our new textbook and also appeared in our previous introductory book published in 2016 and now withdrawn from sale this is the threshold type schema the right angle point is the threshold between those two different types of adjustment responses to increases in nominal aggregate spending but in the text accompanying the graph we write all firms are unlikely to hit full capacity simultaneously the reverse l shape simplifies the analysis somewhat by assuming that the capacity constraint is reached by all firms at the same time in reality bottlenecks in production are likely to occur in some sectors before others and so cost pressures will begin to mount before the overall full capacity output is reached this could be captured in figure 16 3 by some curvature near y thus eliminating the right angle as prices begin to rise before reaching y full capacity we consider this issue in more detail in chapter 17 in chapter 17 further discussion takes place along these lines so you have to ask yourself how can a critical primer be critical if the substance of the criticism has already been dealt with in full along the lines of the criticism the implication of this is obvious he either hasn t read much and therefore should not be holding himself out as any sort of expert on the matter or he has deliberately avoided referring to those sections of our work that are inconvenient for his vindictiveness which disqualifies him through a lack of credibility absence of class another example of this behaviour in palley s paper relates to his accusation that noticeably absent in the mmt discourse are the issues of income distribution and class conflict consequently from an mmt perspective there is no economic need to address income distribution and nor does class conflict pose a problem for government s ability to do as it wishes regarding spending and taxes he is trying to place himself in the same camp as the marxists who criticise our work and i addressed some of their issues in this blog post the conga line of mmt critics marching into oblivion march 7 2019 one doesn t have to search very hard to see that in my own work class struggle has been an important organising concept for example this blog post we need to read karl marx august 30 2011 several academic articles i have published and full employment abandoned edward elgar 2008 and reclaiming the state a progressive vision of sovereignty for a post neoliberal world pluto books 2017 all consider class as a major organising framework within which one should situate modern monetary theory mmt our new textbook has a lot of discussion about class conflict and its implications for the distribution of income the chapter on inflation builds a theory of inflation based on class struggle over the distribution of national income there is a section in one chapter on theories of profits and this discussion is explicitly conducted within the context of class struggle here is a sample of the index if my eyes are not deceiving me it looks like there is discussion about class struggle crises capitalist production etc the textbook is recent but contains material that draws on decades of work by randy wray and myself with help from martin watts in many of my articles i construct an understanding of the monetary system within the context of the struggle between labour and capital my phd centred on that struggle my early 1998 article on modern monetary theory mmt considers class and class power palley either hasn t read my work or deliberately avoids citing it that is not the behaviour of a person acting in good faith concept of costs palley s second paper macroeconomics vs modern money theory some unpleasant keynesian arithmetic covers the proposals for green new deal in the us the nub of the paper to save you reading it is that the gnd as enunciated by the proponents even though it is still lacking operational detail would be a very large intervention and would imply a significant fiscal shift he asserts there would be a final increase in ad of 17 0 per cent of gdp ad is aggregate demand or spending whether that number is accurate is not the point we can agree that the gnd in its totally would be a large shift in public spending he then says that the labour market impacts of that shift would likely produce high inflation and that the central bank could spike interest rates to control ad but he notes that mmt proponents reject using interest rate policy to fine tune the economy which is an accurate statement given how ineffective interest rate management is in accomplishing that task so then palley claims in these situations the inflation situation would be even more dire as a result he argues that major tax increases would be required a 78 per cent increase in the federal tax take and fee take again whether that piece of arithmetic is accurate is not the point here his point is that either way interest rate rises or tax hikes the political costs that would arise from the anti inflationary policies would damage the progressive movement which then leads palley to write mmt proponents are now asserting society can enjoy a range of large government spending programs for free via money financed deficits which has made it very popular with progressive policy advocates that is a dishonest representation i would forgive a non economist not trained in concepts such as opportunity cost etc if they had made that statement a non economist is so conditioned by the faux statements of politicians mainstream economists and financial media types to associate cost with numbers placed in government fiscal documents that they might use the term free inappropriately but palley knows better no mmt proponent thinks a government program is free in the sense that real resources have to be harnessed to make the program operation the larger the program the greater the stress of real resources for example in this blog post very costly fiscal programs are needed december 14 2010 i wrote ultimately when resources are finite political decisions have to be made by government as to which sector uses them if the government determines that its political mandate requires more public use and less private use then fiscal policy has to be used to ensure that the private sector can spend less and here is another blog post of many that consider costs british labour has to break out of the neo liberal cost framing trap april 12 2017 i wrote that if for example we were to take a public employment program that required government to spend x billion in wages capital equipment administration and oversight we might reasonably ask about the cost of that program the conservative frame tells us that the cost is x the figure that appears in the annual fiscal documents against the program an mmt frame considers the x in the fiscal papers to be of little interest the actual cost of the program is the change it causes in the usage of real resources more consumption by the unemployed workers some equipment etc an additional cost would be the opportunity costs of such a program which are minimal given the unemployed are idle in fact in this frame the increased use of the real resources provides benefits to both the individuals and for society so the use of the term cost would be misleading when we ask whether the nation can afford a policy initiative we should ignore the x and consider what real resources are available and the potential benefits the available real resources constitute the fiscal space the fiscal space should then always be related to the purposes to which we aspire and the destination we wish to reach so if the economy is at full employment then political decisions have to be made about whether the nation needs more real resources being diverted into say health care and less into bombing the hell out of iraq or wherever the bombs are falling now the national government is never revenue constrained because it is the monopoly issuer of the currency so it can buy whatever real resources that are for sale in the currency it issues which means that it the nation determines through the political process to drop bombs and leave sick people sick then it can financially accomplish that goal without issue so it is plainly false to claim that the mmt proponents have not considered these issues and just think there is a free lunch palley s poor form is exemplified when he quotes some other article from max b sawicky who i generally find to be reasonable the article january 4 2019 the best way to argue against paygo discusses the paygo debate in the us max sawicky notes that but at some point increased government spending runs up against that capacity constraint if we are already at full employment with full utilization of all productive resources more deficit spending can result in undesirable inflation the above is in fact mmt doctrine but often hard to find in their popular treatments note the distinction between mmt doctrine which is the body of literature that the core mmt group has developed over the last 25 years and the popular treatments which i take to mean the derivative versions of our work by other writers who may or may not be sympathetic to the doctrine i don t use the term doctrine to describe our core work it is a body of knowledge that has stood the empirical tests and is the best explanatory framework currently on offer for people to use to understand how the monetary system operates but that beside the distinction is very important and refutes palley s entire argument that mmt advocates free spending despite him using other quotes in the article out of context to criticise our work i wrote about the gnd in this blog post the erroneous lets have a little some or no mmt narrative february 20 2019 i wrote that the debate should be focused on what a gnd means for real resource usage and what redistributions of access to real resources might be required to ensure that total spending on the available real resources can accomplish the gnd goals without accelerating inflation those redistributions of access is just another way of saying if the current real resource usage is leaving a stock of free or underutilised real resources that is smaller than those required to effectively implement a gnd then the government has to increase that stock by depriving some of the current usages access one way to do that is through taxation which reduces the capacity of the non government sector to utilise real resources by reducing spending capacity there are other ways including through regulation however it is important to understand that if taxes are raised to build a stock of free resources that can be then redirected into productive use via the gnd this has nothing to do with funding the spending outlays that are operationalising the gnd once you fall into the funding narrative you have left mmt thinking and gone back to neoliberalism my other recent post on the gnd the job guarantee is more than a green new deal job creation policy december 17 2018 is critical of those who only see the gnd in cyclical terms as palley seems to do the original new deal during the great depression specifically the relief and recovery elements was largely concerned with implementing what macroeconomists refer to as a counter cyclical fiscal intervention working to redress non government spending shortages which leads firms to lay off workers these expenditure initiatives are not intended to be permanent supports to regions and communities as non government spending returns the fiscal intervention is withdrawn but while the details are to be provided the green new deal proposal is not really primarily about resolving a cyclical shortfall in aggregate spending rather it is a structural program designed to significantly change the patterns of industry output employment and the consumption patterns of households and firms and further it is about fundamentally altering the shifting the line between government and market responsibility for resource allocation both in aggregate but also spatially this shift would go much further than a stimulus package for some regional areas it would involve a fundamental reconfiguration of the concept of government in the us context going against the historical norms that have dominated american society since its inception which means that the way in which the expenditure is introduced and the accompanying policies to ensure that there is sufficient real resource space to accommodate that new gnd expenditure are likely to be different to a purely counter cyclical stimulus approach palley doesn t consider that at all he clearly has decided to ignore many articles i have written on these issues which counter his facile stylisation of mmt he just wants people to think that mmt claims that the us can enjoy a massive permanent money financed program spree that does not cause inflation that might make him feel important but it certainly doesn t help him establish the credibility he has so sorely desired over the years but never seems to find conclusion i only decided to explicitly address the palley papers not because they are important in any way but because some of the points are still raised in e mails i receive from readers who are acting in good faith i get many e mails with many questions and the topics above reflect many of those queries but you can see why palley avoids citing my work because i have already written the stuff he claims mmt ignores so tom you can do better than the pathetic stuff you are pumping out at present it doesn t help your standing at all that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved

in his home village of kanilai read more about the inner circle that helped jammeh steal a billion dollars his route took him past the central bank the social welfare office and the headquarters of the state telecom company these were some of the institutions jammeh pillaged by elevating privileged civil servants to prominent positions and empowering a group of corrupt businessmen led by a key hezbollah financier thousands of documents obtained exclusively by occrp lay bare for the first time the massive scale of jammeh s corruption they show how he hijacked government funds and departments set up private accounts at the central bank and built a patronage network while ruling the country through a combination of guile unbridled power and violence the documents reporters analyzed provide comprehensive insight into jammeh s finances through bank statements contracts government correspondence internal reports and jammeh s own directives they primarily cover the five year period between 2011 and 2016 but reach back as far as 1998 jammeh ruled gambia from 1994 to 2017 what was not withdrawn in cash by jammeh s officials or funnelled to bank accounts controlled by the president went to businesses that received lucrative contracts or for unknown purposes some was sent to foreign shell companies about which little is known the transfers may have violated gambian law just how much of the great gambian heist ended up in jammeh s own pockets through offshore accounts or bags full of cash is still unknown adama barrow the country s current president estimated in 2017 that jammeh stole about 4 billion dalasis 90 million from public coffers an official investigation known as the janneh commission of inquiry is currently examining financial misconduct during his rule and at the end of last year the united states announced that jammeh had been banned from entering the country citing evidence that he had been involved in significant corruption the documents analyzed by occrp show a web of fraud that far exceeds the figure offered by barrow who defeated jammeh at the polls in 2016 but was only able to oust the former president after neighboring states threatened a military intervention occrp receives funding from open society foundation he ran the country like an organized crime syndicate said jeggan grey johnson a gambian activist and communications officer at the

read more about how the state oil company fell prey to the president jammeh spent some of the stolen money on his palace in kanilai where he had his own private mosque built a jungle warfare training camp and kept camels hyenas zebras and other exotic animals the looted funds also supported a lavish lifestyle that jammeh s average official monthly government salary of about 6 000 could never sustain other spending was designed to portray jammeh as a benevolent and generous ruler but not typically in ways that benefitted ordinary gambians who eke out a living in an economy that is literally dependent on peanuts a top export in 2010 using diverted money jammeh held a tribute concert for michael jackson after the pop superstar s death he also hosted a miss black usa beauty pageant in gambia using 1 1 million illicitly diverted from the port authority the spending did little to address gambia s needs the country has poor health care few basic services and under 1 000 km of paved roads according to the world bank its external debt at the end of 2017 was 489 million less than the amount jammeh allegedly stole the former president gave himself five titles insisted he could cure aids but only on mondays and thursdays and proclaimed that he would stay in power for a billion years if allah wanted him to he is now in exile in equatorial guinea where he allegedly spends his days on a farm carved out of the jungle ruling with an iron fist the united nations criticized jammeh during his final election campaign for threatening to kill off the country s most populous ethnic group the mandinkas and put them where even a fly cannot see them the sentiment was typical of a president who ruled through terror at the center of his ability to strip gambia of its meager wealth was jammeh s ruthless control of the government and its institutions after capturing power in a bloodless coup in 1994 at just 29 he quickly deployed an array of official and unofficial security forces to silence dissent the jungulers an unofficial unit of about 40 men largely drawn from the presidential guard carried out the most egregious offenses in its 2015 report on gambia state

official at the state run oil company questioned the president s office on whether its income could be exempt from taxes jammeh responded by seizing control of the company s bank accounts and diverting its funds for his use his micromanagement of government affairs allowed him to exert complete control over gambia said fatou camara who twice served as jammeh s press secretary between 2011 and 2013 every minister would wait for him before they made decisions camara said everything had to wait for the office of the president to agree jammeh s human rights abuses and corruption went largely unchallenged by the international community because of his country s small size and relative obscurity a wave of violence across west africa during his reign in ivory coast liberia and sierra

president yahya jammeh s rule click to enlarge the central bank of the gambia was known as the number one bank among jammeh s staff because they knew its coffers would continually be replenished with public money central banks are only supposed to regulate local banks control currency in circulation and set interest rates typically individuals can t have accounts but jammeh treated gambia s central bank as his personal slush fund much of the time the money he stole flowed electronically between domestic and foreign accounts but sometimes the cash literally traded hands beneath the hum of

about practices at the central bank of the gambia on one occasion when jammeh wanted to withdraw cash from the central bank his office wrote directly to the bank s second deputy governor with a blunt request that circumvented lawmakers and regulators the bank complied amadou colley the central bank s governor from 2010 to 2017 told the commission that jammeh and his cronies exerted significant control over the institution government records testimonies and directives show senior bank officials routinely allowing the president s office unfettered access colley who declined to comment for this story testified that he saw officials close to the president withdraw funds without proper paperwork able to obtain withdrawal notes from jammeh s office only occasionally he resorted to accepting hastily written statements from those retrieving the money that they had been directed by president jammeh the office of the president to make this withdrawal documents obtained by reporters show that jammeh diverted over 71 million from the central bank s reserves in just a few years he used three main techniques hijacking the bank s accounts creating new accounts on which he and his chosen aides were sole signatories and using dormant accounts which are seldom found at well managed central banks sometimes he ordered the withdrawal of cash from accounts without any funds causing them to become overdrawn accounts such as the consolidated revenue fund received millions of dollars every year from income taxes and other sources there is little accounting for how money from the fund was spent between 2007 and 2016 despite laws that require parliamentary approval of expenditures thousands of internal bank documents reviewed by occrp revealed other major accounts jammeh

almost 40 percent of the bank s spending went toward interest payments on debts according to occrp s analysis in a 2015 letter to the international monetary fund while jammeh was still in power central bank officials wrote that the institution remained highly indebted because of significant interest charges bad investments over lending to the government and violations of its own rules described as policy slippages today the central bank remains in dire straits the country owes lenders 130 percent of its gross domestic product mainly due to external arrears incurred by the jammeh

new york china is about to slash the employer contribution rate to the social security fund from 18 20 per cent with some variation across regions to 16 per cent and cut the value added tax vat rate from 16 per cent to 13 per cent for most enterprises this is on top of a previously announced reduction in the corporate income tax charged on the first 3 million yuan 447 000 of taxable income these policy moves are timely and useful in combating the downward pressure on economic growth but they also raise the risk of a future debt crisis the loss of government revenue will not be entirely proportional to these rate reductions as the government can also tighten enforcement to reduce tax evasion still the government expects the tax reform package to lead to a substantial reduction in revenue of some 2 trillion yuan or about 2 1 per cent of gdp this year alone the policy package would likely raise the central government s fiscal deficit from 2 8 per cent of gdp to about 5 per cent and increase central government debt from about 47 per cent of gdp to perhaps 70 per cent over the medium term add to that the liabilities implicit in closing the funding gap in the social security system as well as massive local government debts and overall public debt could grow much larger potentially exceeding 150 per cent of gdp in a few years international experience from developing countries shows that large and growing government debt is unsustainable and often leads to a major economic crisis down the road to avoid such an outcome china can consider three additional reforms first the authorities should make the vat reduction temporary announcing that the 2018 rate will be restored in 2021 with a possible extension if the economy is still not meeting its growth potential a temporary cut would not only put less pressure on the long run value of government debt it would actually boost growth more powerfully than a permanent cut of the same magnitude because households and firms would have an incentive to spend and invest sooner second china should replace administrative restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution with new taxes the scope for doing so is large given that china is the world s largest polluter and carbon dioxide emitter on an annual basis in cumulative emissions the united states remains in the lead and public demand for environmentally friendly policies is growing stronger while china has a modest tradable permit programme for certain pollutants most of the control takes the form of administrative restrictions targeting certain activities by certain firms while such restrictions reduce emissions by raising the costs for firms as a tax would they generate no revenue for the government they can also undermine efficiency by creating disparities in marginal production costs among producers in similar industries a better approach would replace most or all administrative restrictions with taxes on emissions and pollution the two are not the same as some pollution does not involve greenhouse gas emissions and broaden the coverage to other offending activities not currently restricted this includes ramping up the tradable permit programme by lowering the threshold beyond which firms have to pay and eliminating exemptions from permits for firms or industries such actions would not only boost fiscal sustainability the additional revenues could total 2 per cent of gdp but also improve the efficiency of overall resource allocation finally china can lower government spending in the medium term by streamlining its vast administrative hierarchy in recent decades many of the largest global companies have taken advantage of new technologies to reduce the number of employee layers from top executives to factory workers thereby reducing costs and boosting efficiency china s government by contrast has retained the same six layer administrative structure starting with the central government and moving down through provinces prefectures counties townships and villages since the founding of the people s republic 70 years ago this vast administrative apparatus employs over 14 million civil servants and millions more who work for government agencies but do not fall under that classification china is already a global leader in e commerce and digital payment it has all the physical infrastructure to become a leader in e governance using digital technologies the country could eliminate one or two layers of its administrative apparatus this would reduce overall government spending while improving the delivery of government services it would also help reduce corruption one concern may be that downsizing government employment would exacerbate the effects of slowing economic growth but the cuts need not be abrupt a longer term attrition plan could be put in place that takes advantage of retirement and normal resignations to reduce the overall size of the government over time additional voluntary separations could be encouraged by modest inducements to subsidise job searches in this manner the government could be made 15 20 per cent smaller and considerably more efficient within say eight years china s latest tax cuts serve an important purpose to combat downward pressure on economic growth the risk of a future debt crisis should be addressed by a few complementary actions making the vat rate cut temporary broadening taxes on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution and downsizing the government these reforms would make china more efficient and prosperous shang jin wei a former chief economist of the asian development bank is professor of chinese business and economy and professor of finance and economics at columbia

in the eyes of many across the globe including anti establishment figures credited and established economists and consumers the macroeconomy could be on the verge of collapse in fact in a recent bloomberg op ed narayana kocherlakota the former president of the federal reserve s minneapolis arm advised his old employer to prepare for a crisis but bitcoin may be a way out an escape hatch as put by shapeshift chief executive and crypto entrepreneur erik voorhees there has never been a global recession since bitcoin was created next time it happens there is an escape hatch erik voorhees erikvoorhees april 16 2019 the case for a recession while the economy seems to be doing better than ever certain fiscal and economic indicators aren t looking all too hot for instance the u s treasury bond yield curve recently saw a negative spread between the three and ten year notes which is a sign that has historically predicted recessions 1970s oil crisis dotcom great recession debt across the board especially sovereign debt is surmounting all time highs on a daily basis in fact since 2008 s fiscal debacle the nominal value of all forms of debt has increased by dozens of trillions of dollars as central banks across the globe bolster their balance sheets firms borrow more to promote their growth and consumers spend more than ever all while lenders are seemingly becoming more lenient with each passing day according to trace mayer a long time bitcoiner and a zealous anti centralization thinker society has accumulated 87 trillion more debt as humanity s relentless lust for growth continues accentuating that governments and society at large haven t learned from past mistakes the u s alone has seen its national debt breach 22 trillion mere weeks ago up from 8 trillion when the recent recession peaked in response to this swelling statistic the peterson foundation an american financial services group that is focused on amending the nation s economic issues claimed that the fiscal situation is not only unsustainable but accelerating as ikigai head travis kling recently explained the increasingly erratic u s president is yelling at an irresponsible central bank to act even more irresponsibly with its monetary policy while running a 1 trillion deficit for the second year in a row the economy s outlook is so harrowing that ray dalio the co founder of the world s largest hedge fund bridgewater associates recently drew eerie parallels between today and the great depression in a comment made at davos the world renowned investor who has become a market pessimist as of late explained that from 1929 to 1932 there was a lot of printing of money and purchases of financial assets much like today even bitmex s research division has chimed in on the matter of the case for a recession as reported by newsbtc previously the team of researchers and analysts noted that the current financial system is currently unstable and fragile backing their claim by drawing attention to the dichotomy between the overall lack of volatility and sudden spikes in the vix they noted that this instability has only been underscored by low interest rates and a tumultuous political climate think brexit trump china and the yellow vests making it all the more likely that a crisis is brewing under the surface why bitcoin is the answer so what s a way to opt out of a crisis according to many pundits that s bitcoin as the asset isn t centrally controlled has a deflationary supply issuance schedule and is a non correlated asset that exists independently of any traditional system save for the internet as kling a wall streeter turned anti establishment thinker explains the cryptocurrency s value proposition as a non sovereign hard capped supply global immutable decentralized digital money could be just what modern consumers are looking for in a market rife with uncertainty a way out of this ongoing fiscal experiment that many argue benefits the wealthy before the underprivileged the ikigai c suite head adds that central banks and governments are proving the profound need for such a digital asset not discrediting it in other words if any government takes on heavy debt and defaults bitcoin benefits if hyperinflation makes u s dollars nothing more than glorified toilet paper bitcoin benefits you get the point with the u s interest expenses on track to surpass the tax receipts themselves by 2022 meaning that america will be paying more in interest on its debt than the tax it receives creating a negative likely never ending feedback loop only one option will be left print print print the debt away and by then bitcoin would have likely won featured image from shutterstock disclaimer the article is provided for educational

geneva sudan has had three military leaders in the last week however the political upheaval ends the backdrop to this crisis includes multiple conflicts displacement and an economic crunch affecting the living standards of millions humanitarian issues that won t be resolved soon needs have remained stubbornly high for years using up an average of over 600 million in donor funding in each of the last five years just to tackle immediate priorities including food aid health and education the country also hosts more than 800 000 refugees from south sudan a senior un official in khartoum said it was too early to predict the wider impact of political developments in the country of almost 44 million and that the short term priority is getting humanitarian operations back to full speed after days of slowdown we remain extremely concerned about deepening humanitarian needs among the current caseload the official said requesting anonymity due to the sensitive political situation macroeconomic conditions are extremely poor according to the famine early warning system network known as fews net a us funded food security monitor some 13 percent of the population 5 76 million people are in crisis or emergency levels of hunger in addition the national currency is rapidly depreciating against the dollar bread prices have jumped since the government lifted subsidies on imported wheat and fuel price hikes have almost doubled the cost of transport cereal prices are 250 percent above the five year average according to fews net there is already a fast deterioration in living conditions in urban areas due to the economic situation the un official said adding that the limited availability of banknotes is also slowing the wider economy and relief operations the bread price rise was the final straw for much of the urban based population in sudan explained world food programme country director matthew hollingworth the humanitarian and development needs of the people of sudan must be prioritised particularly right now to stabilise sections of the population through this transitionary period risk of further unrest the sudanese military faces continuing diplomatic pressure to allow civilian administration at the time of writing groups backing protests in khartoum had not accepted promises of a two year military transition to civilian rule along with the sacking of president omar al bashir and regional governors a senior african diplomat based in sudan urged caution saying the risks were high if the whole military run edifice was rapidly dismantled given weak institutions and civil society widespread disaffection and smaller conflicts across the country despite the euphoria of the peaceful protests the cracks could start to show and the whole thing start to crumble the diplomat warned they ve got to hold this entity called sudan together the possibility of a political turning point has been vivid in khartoum but sudan s multiple crises have political mismanagement at their root analysts say sudan is so much more than the capital if sudan s patterns of governance do not change the aspirations of millions of marginalised sudanese will still not be met while khartoum s protestors and the formation of an interim government had the limelight root and branch reform was desperately needed to address broader grievances said aly verjee a researcher on sudan and south sudan at the us institute for peace sudan is so much more than the capital verjee said if sudan s patterns of governance do not change the aspirations of millions of marginalised sudanese will still not be met some of the pressure on the poorest and most vulnerable is contained by international humanitarian aid but an opening up of financial assistance is limited by sanctions hollingworth of the wfp warned that sudan s economic problems now risk spreading to other areas causing wider civic and military instability and endangering the pillars of a cohesive society sanctions debt and aid khartoum may hope for help from the gulf in the short term sudan is aligned with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and sudanese troops and militia are fighting alongside them in yemen riyadh quickly promised fuel wheat and medicines in a welcome package to the interim military regime un states and donor nations currently pay over 1 5 billion a year to contain conflicts and humanitarian needs in sudan the un and ngos have prepared a humanitarian response plan for 2019 to support 4 4 million people the final draft with a price tag of about 1 billion was under review by the government before the political crisis erupted on 6 april the un official said the cost of the appeal was similar to recent years longer term development funding for sudan is limited and humanitarian financing is being used for things it shouldn t according to rachel scott of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd scott who has advised donors and the sudanese government on development financing said sanctions were a huge issue that largely stopped sudan from tapping more aid funding or negotiating relief on over 50 billion of debt sudan is listed by the united states as a state sponsor of terrorism and al bashir is wanted by the international criminal court to stand trial for crimes against humanity and genocide committed in darfur various other us un and eu sanctions apply to individuals accused of involvement in the arms trade or of committing rights violations in the darfur conflict these legal limitations add to a wider hesitance to engage with a near pariah state but scott argues that donors should start to get ready for if and when political obstacles are lifted sudan won a reprieve from some us sanctions in 2017 and could aim to open the first stages of a debt relief process with the international monetary fund according to an oecd report one of the largest donors is the european union which funds programmes to limit migration through sudan towards the mediterranean allegedly benefiting militia connected to rights abuses in the absence of loans and development finance from institutions like the world bank so called humanitarian budgets which have fewer political strings attached are plugging gaps that would normally be dealt with by development funds donors should be thinking about where any new development investments should go to win the maximum return on stability for a new day said scott if development doesn t come the fragile peace isn t going to hold darfur and other conflicts as well as darfur in the west a clutch of small scale rebellions and tensions are simmering on the periphery of sudan especially in the southern border areas of blue nile and south kordofan and in kassala in the east a un african union peacekeeping operation in darfur with a budgeted cost of 715 million in the current year is due to close at the end of 2020 handing over some responsibilities to the civilian arm of the un aid groups and the sudanese authorities the african diplomat said the rationale was that the blunt instrument of a uniformed mission may not be the right tool to address darfur today other actors in aid and development need to step in the diplomat said adding if development doesn t come the fragile peace isn t going to hold the armed rebellion in darfur that began in 2003 has been largely quelled but at a very high cost and without resolving many of the land disputes and other issues that caused it the counter insurgency campaign steered by al bashir and government allied militia left tens of thousands dead villages burned civilians bombed refugees fleeing to chad widespread rape and dispossession and the displacement of up to two million people the un african union hybrid mission in darfur unamid started in 2007 to protect civilians facilitate humanitarian aid and to mediate and foster community level peace talks has had only limited success hampered by sudanese intimidation and restrictions on supplies fuel flights personnel and movements years of talks have proved inconclusive while human rights abuses have persisted sudan has urged unamid s closure since at least 2014 arguing that it is no longer relevant human rights watch last year slammed the sudanese government s long practice of intransigence and obstruction in 2018 the un security council again objected to bureaucratic hindrances the peace process mediated initially by qatar in doha is at a standstill according to the un in february 2019 the mission once aimed to be a 25 000 strong force is already winding down troop and police levels are currently set at 6 000 7 000 personnel another peacekeeping operation attempts to stabilise the abyei region at a cost of 282 million in the last budgeted year a detailed process to decide the borders and future of abyei was part of the agreement on south sudan s independence but the agreement broke down and the area remains in an administrative hiatus claimed by both nations and patrolled by the un interim security force for abyei or unisfa two other north south border areas also face intermittent conflict with the nuba mountains of south kordofan predicted to suffer emergency levels of food insecurity later this year by fews net the third area blue nile bordering ethiopia is also the site of a long running and little noted conflict with related civilian vulnerability and displacement sudan also has a significant stake in its southern neighbour news reports point out that khartoum stands to benefit if stability returns to south sudan and oil exports via the north s pipeline resume al bashir had played a role in putting together the latest internal south sudan peace deal and stood as a guarantor of the agreement while hosting some of the key figures despite being at war with southern secessionists for most of his time in power the humanitarian aid commission so far no changes have been announced to the humanitarian aid commission through which the government tightly regulates humanitarian work a sudanese aid worker said the hac and the national intelligence and security service or niss were closely associated with the hac controlling travel permissions project approvals and visas for foreign workers niss offices have been attacked or set on fire in darfur as demonstrators look at them as first enemies the aid worker said i hope the realists can find a way of accommodating the idealists the un official called for the lifting of access restrictions such as travel permits and single entry visas to ease the humanitarian response verjee went further the hac is a combination of military intelligence niss and other mostly obstructionist bureaucrats he said its abolition would be welcome the head of niss salah abdallah known popularly as gosh stepped down last week nevertheless the future role of niss and of the hac are a large question mark for the humanitarian aid sector for the forces of change those restrictions should not be there in the first place the aid worker said adding we can write books about the breadth of manipulation of aid by the hac how such issues will be dealt with by whichever new administration emerges from the current tumult in khartoum is unclear faced with balancing the hopes of protestors and the need to hold the state together the african diplomat said political events were an opportunity and added i hope the realists can find a way of accommodating the idealists bp ag
this article is more than 4 years old 2019 bloomberg finance lp modern monetary theory abbreviated as mmt was first an economic pariah and is now a trend similar to cryptocurrency supported by both senator bernie sanders whose economic advisor in 2016 stephanie kelton remains a major proponent of mmt and representative alexandria ocasio cortez it has become the foundation for how to fund more expansive government programs everything from the new green deal to a job guarantee for all americans it also forms an anti thesis to the economic rationale of cryptocurrency mmt is focused on granting the state the permission to exercise its full economic power while cryptocurrency asserts ways for individuals to have the liberty to pick and choose regulatory regimes and erode some of the awesome power of that same state this tension is one that must be reconciled the foundation for all these ambitious programs is being chipped away slowly by the reach of cryptocurrencies and those who hold cryptocurrencies may inevitably drift away from unconstrained governments there are many beginner guides to the topic of modern monetary theory and its adherents have been very proactive about responding to criticism both from mainstream economists and fellow travellers such as the left wing post keynesians in a crude summary mmt adherents believe the following fundamental truths about economics many mmt believers think that fiscal policy the powers delegated to a government to tax and spend funds represented in most countries as a treasury department and taxation department should supersede monetary policy the ability for a central bank to dictate consumption and savings patterns in an economy by targeting interest rates the default for most developed economies and that the state should essentially combine the functions of both the national treasury and its central bank government deficits don t crowd out the private sector s financial wealth but actually increase it since deficits create credits to the private banking system ambitious government programs should be financed since they don t crowd out private wealth done right these government programs can reduce inequality as opposed to quantitative easing which increased it and aim towards full employment in an economy the level where everybody who is willing to work is working as a fiscal policy of last resort to ensure full employment the government should offer a job guarantee to anybody willing to work and essentially create work to ensure full employment taxes are only useful in order to prevent inflation and to fight economic inequality and not actually to finance the government taxes serve the function of reinforcing the value of a domestic currency since it s assumed that anybody who subscribes to a particular government s services will be forced to pay in the domestic currency in question ensuring that there will be some goods chasing that currency and preventing an erosion in value of the currency itself both cryptocurrency and mmt are a response to what both communities believe are an inherent fault with the world s economic system since nixon took the us dollar out of the gold standard aside from theoretical frameworks and distribution of powers there is essentially nothing that prevents a government with a floating currency to print or create value out of nothing economics has always been an art of constraints telling a prince or king that they couldn t simply create money in the first place because that money would erode in value in time what mmt accomplishes is a theoretical framework for why many modern day constraints on government spending deficit debt theory simply don t matter mmt focuses on centralizing economic power for nation states cryptocurrency focuses on distributing economic power and allowing people to resolve conflicts without needing the power of that same state bitcoin is built on the idea of a limit in the number of bitcoins that can be mined 21 million along with other imposed constraints the number limit on bitcoin was an exogenous constraint and not one that was technologically imposed but a political choice the genesis block of bitcoin illustrates this thinking most sharply the coinbase parameter for it reads the times 03 jan 2009 chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks the response to the global financial crisis was very much on satoshi s mind when he first crafted bitcoin bitcoin is a technological revolution but an actual political retrospective a harkening back to the norms of the gold standard where a government relied on the amount of gold mined in a certain area to limit its spending powers bitcoin allows for the theoretical creation of infinite value but restrains itself due to its exogenous limit and through a cultural ethic of non political intervention in governing protocols to create an internal check on inflation and value erosion consider the debate around szabo s law the cultural ethic in cryptocurrency communities that you should not enforce changes to an underlying blockchain unless it is for technical maintenance this isn t a theoretical debate ethereum classic and ethereum largely forked based on objections to a hard fork that returned funds to dao holders this was an explicitly political decision where desired outcomes were regarded as inequitable and dao holders were made whole for reasons that had very little to do with technical maintenance but rather continued support of the community there are more nuanced examples too bitcoin cash was forked from bitcoin based on the block size limit was that a political choice or technical maintenance that allowed for faster performance for all stakeholders a harder question for sure but the first principles we use to reason with that measure the political scale of an intervention in the codebase vs what is required for technical progress the principles behind szabo s law taken to their logical conclusions are exactly the opposite of mmt cryptocurrencies hold no tax agencies they cannot accrue value or fight inflation by using the threat of force to get people to exchange goods for their domestic tokens they can neither appeal to ethnic nationalism or patriotism to spur support nor can they garnish your wages cryptocurrency holders are those who are explicitly trying to navigate the different political frameworks they are forced to comply with by birth or by choice and still interact with one another despite a shaky legal regime in one area or a corrupt political class in another the political intervention required by mmt on the other hand requires faith in a nation state its ruling class and at its core geographic limits and strictly defined taxation limits on individual liberty to prop up the value of what are essentially domestic tokens perhaps this contrast exists because the mmt community largely consists of academics and politicians who are laser focused on the benefits that can be accorded a physically defined polity whether a university or a nation state and the cryptocurrency community was largely built by borderless technological enthusiasts born of an age where it takes seconds for raj in canada to purchase a product from paul in india economists are by definition optimization seekers working with a limited set of assumptions and datasets that have been recently assembled to be fair cryptocurrency rests on an even newer foundation yet it s critical to acknowledge that economic critiques are directed to a set of nation state based assumptions that have only iterated for a couple of centuries at most mmt theory is simply a continuation of the keynesian consensus that nation states are the guarantors of prosperity for all and that full employment and jobs as well as the cycle of present consumption rest as the primary motivation for the state and its citizens to co exist employment is assumed to be an absolute good but employment in what capacity perhaps the easiest example of how cryptocurrency adherents chip away at mmt and one which mmt adherents may be most sympathetic for is the idea of the second order political consequences of domestic consolidation a benevolent government perhaps represented here in the minds of mmt advocates as a bernie sanders administration in the united states or a jeremy corbyn parliament in the united kingdom may decide to use its new found powers and employment base to banish poverty employ everybody willing to work in a consensual fashion and create an equitable harmonious society where constraints are placed on the state to ensure it is a neutral dispenser of funds but a malevolent government perhaps represented here in the minds of mmt advocates as a trump administration might hire incredible amounts of law enforcement border patrol and investigative authorities instead or perhaps we ll be in a middle ground where a future works progress administration fdr s job guarantee during the new deal builds great objects of national affection but also channels funds politically to ensure re election and conformity from a voter base the last case is more dangerous than it seems as chinese democracy activist noted dissident and nobel peace prize winner liu xiaobo astutely put it in one of his last interviews before dying in a chinese jail cell if our rice bowls were still in the hands of the communist party as in the 1950s people like us would have to keep our mouths shut another consideration is the long term economic implications of a modern day job guarantee in a world where the department of labour struggles to define skilled aspects of computer programming stem fields and others as they emerge and grow a computer programmer is regarded as low skilled mostly because it doesn t require an accredited degree to enter this is a self perpetuating cycle indeed means that public grandesse will ensure a wage and demand obedience for those who benefit from a job guarantee in a world where the rat race has become oriented to skills rather than connections this creates a trap for those employed by the employer of last resort which is a political and economic entity a government also may not be inclined nor perhaps the most capable of keeping continual track of how to do skills training for its population thus the debate in the united states between public schools and charter schools and the need to import skilled immigrants to fill in gaps what may end up happening for those guaranteed a job is skills stagnation and rice bowls in the hands of the government mmt adherents blast other economists for not fully realizing the scope of the world we have inherited from nixon s abandonment of the gold standard cryptocurrency adherents might blast them and mainstream economists for not understanding the second order political consequences of economic theory nor the sweeping changes that have come with a skilled class of nomads that may not particularly need loyalty to one state or another for economic reasons however the centralization required to get mmt theory into practice getting multiple political figures who are influenced by mmt economists voted in by a majority of a nation state s electorate preferably the nation s executive and then getting the legal instruments to change the policy required through both judicial and legislative checks is a discrete step process rather than the slow but increasing trend line of the empirical effects of cryptocurrency and the travels of its users cryptocurrency companies are largely remote technology companies have taken over the top rankings for value by market capitalization and they have a sharply more nomadic workforce than the oil companies of old programs are marketed on the idea of traveling to obtain critical education remote work has been one of the leading themes of our time the number of americans renouncing their citizenship one of the most powerful on earth has increased every year to higher and higher numbers to be sure only 5 000 or so a year but many more than anybody living under a mmt friendly government perhaps one day these two ideas trending in their different ways might reconcile into a hegelian dialectic a compromise there may be nation states that use the mmt framework to wisely invest in infrastructure and science the positive effects from this can resonate across borders and time periods they might accrue a population that is wise and healthy that eliminate the most unpleasant consequences of income inequality and that attract cryptocurrency holders to voluntarily stay within their borders but it is also instructive to think of the switch case of a set of dystopian panopticons who employ more law enforcement agents than the increasing number of criminals the state defines and the economic might to crush any one of their citizens forced to a stapled guaranteed life of domestic currency to ensure obedience and a self perpetuating cycle of economic and political dependence one that can only be escaped through cryptocurrencies and interactions with other systems nation states and geographies for now cryptocurrency is steadily chipping away at both the foundational assumptions of mmt and the dystopian switch case the numbers may be small but they disguise a larger movement away from geographic and political constraints on individual liberty emerson the iconic linchpin of american intellectualism once wrote in dealing with the state we ought to remember that its institutions are not aboriginal though they existed before we were born that they are not superior to the citizen that every one of them was once the act of a single every law and usage was a s expedient to meet a particular case that they all are imitable all alterable we may make as good we may make better he preached the infinitude of the private cryptocurrency adherents are living emerson s principles out

beijing reuters china s stimulus measures will shore up economic growth this year and next but may undermine the country s drive to control debt and worsen structural distortions over the medium term the oecd said in a report on tuesday beijing has stepped up fiscal stimulus to prevent a sharper slowdown in the world s second largest economy which is being squeezed by weaker domestic demand and a trade war with the united states local governments will be allowed to issue 2 15 trillion yuan 320 60 billion worth of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects a jump of 59 percent from last year but s p global nyse ratings estimated last year that local governments were already sitting on hidden debt that could be as high as 40 trillion yuan infrastructure stimulus could lift growth over the projection horizon but it could lead to a further build up of imbalances and capital misallocation and thereby weaker growth in the medium term the oecd said in its latest survey on china s economy the stimulus risks increasing once again corporate sector indebtedness and more generally reversing progress in deleveraging it said china s corporate debt has fallen to about 160 percent of gross domestic product gdp due to a multi year clampdown on riskier types of financing and debt but the level was still higher than in other major economies the oecd said the government in march announced tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan for companies this year which will lift its budget deficit to 2 8 percent of gdp this year from 2 6 percent in 2018 china s fiscal stimulus could be as high as 4 25 percent of gdp this year up from 2 94 percent in 2018 the oecd added easier monetary policy should help reduce the risk of liquidity strains which could put further pressure on businesses said ludger schuknecht deputy secretary general of the oecd but he said beijing should prevent any policy overshooting fiscal policy should aim to support the economy while avoiding any side effects he added i m sure government authorities and the pboc are monitoring this carefully it s a matter of implementing it stimulus in the right way he told an event ahead of the release of the report new bank loans rebounded more than expected in march and totaled a record 5 8 trillion yuan for the quarter as policymakers pushed lenders to support struggling smaller private companies which are seen as higher credit risks than state controlled firms but there are concerns that looser lending standards may fuel a further rise in bad loans as well as inefficient investment and speculation particularly in the property market underscoring the oecd s warning about debt risks data on tuesday showed growth in new home prices accelerated in march after cooling since november 2018 average new home prices in china s 70 major cities rose 0 6 percent quickening from a 0 5 percent gain in february according to reuters calculation of data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs home prices in china are expected to rise more this year than predicted just a few months ago a recent reuters poll showed as the government urges banks to increase lending and lower interest rates to support the economy the people s bank of china pboc has already slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs but top officials have repeatedly vowed not to open the floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns china s economic growth is likely to slow to 6 2 percent this year the weakest pace in nearly 30 years and growth is expected to cool further to 6 0 percent in 2020 the oecd said the economy expanded 6 6 percent in 2018 in march the oecd cut its 2019 growth forecast from 6 3 percent the oecd s outlook on china s economy was in line with a reuters poll published last week growth of china s exports of goods and services could slow to 4 5 percent this year from 5 1 percent in 2018 amid trade frictions with the united states the oecd predicted china s current account may swing to a deficit of 0 1 percent of gdp this year from a small surplus in 2018 amid its rebalancing towards domestic demand the oecd added

10 part series on warren buffett in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc all references must be sourced to cnbc sara eisen so thank you so much for speaking to me again we re here at the imf meetings where everybody s talking about slower global growth what s the outlook for japan right now haruhiko kuroda i think the japanese economy has also slightly slowed down partly because of japan s exports to china has become somewhat weak particularly it related goods and capital goods so because of that japan s production also has become weak however bank of japan s recent business survey showed that corporations are still quite sure that they would make quite robust corporate investment this year so yes exports have become somewhat weak and production has also become somewhat weak but corporations are still quite sure that they can implement a very robust sort of investment for the whole year so that is sara eisen it s mixed haruhiko kuroda yeah and also during the discussions here in washington d c i sensed somehow chinese economy is likely to recover in the second half partly because of the huge fiscal stimulus measures the government has already decided and some of them are already implemented so the first half of the year economy may be a bit weak in china sara eisen you see it turning though haruhiko kuroda yeah but in the second half of the year economy recover accelerate and for the entire 2019 china s economy is likely to grow 6 plus so sara eisen and that he ll help japan haruhiko kuroda that s right yeah sara eisen you ve been very focused on the inflation haruhiko kuroda yeah yeah yeah sara eisen target prioritized that for the last few years but inflation has still remained subdued why haruhiko kuroda that s right sara eisen is that haruhiko kuroda two factors 1 despite the very good corporate profit levels and also despite a very strong labor market situation i mean unemployment rate is only 2 3 which is even in japanese context full employment and yet wages are rising somewhat moderately modestly that is one factor another factor is in the last five six years labor productivity increase in japan was the highest among g7 country higher than united states higher than in germany so wage costs certainly rose but because of labor productivity increase corporations can manage without raising the prices so wages are rising but moderately or modestly prices are not rising much because of huge labor productivity increase so at this stage headline inflation rate is 1 or slightly less than 1 and if you exclude energy items then inflation rate whole inflation rate is only about 0 4 or 0 5 sara eisen so what do you do what do you do about that you ve done everything haruhiko kuroda yeah everything and also as i said the economy s doing quite well the corporate sector enjoys historic high level profit better than they enjoyed during the bubble period in late 80s and the labor market is quite tight probably the tightest in the last 30 40 years so the economy real economy is doing quite well but as i said wages are not rising so fast as we hoped sara eisen so do you feel you have to do more haruhiko kuroda i yeah yeah i think even so i think the wages are now rising and accelerating so by maintaining current extremely accommodative monetary policy the labor market continues to be tight and output gap at this stage output gap is not negative it s now even positive so by maintaining extremely accommodative monetary policy maintaining a tight labor market we are reasonably sure that wages accelerate and prices also accelerate sara eisen i did see that amazon is raising prices in japan for the first time since it s been there that must be some sort of good sign for you did you see that haruhiko kuroda so so i think i mean particularly in the service sector restaurant hotels they are raising prices because they are quite labor intensive and labor intensive sectors finally raising prices so it takes more time than we thought before because we introduced the current extremely accommodative monetary policy in april 2013 already sara eisen six years haruhiko kuroda six years and yet of course when we introduced that monetary policy the inflation rate was 0 5 it s now at 1 sara eisen so it s worked haruhiko kuroda yeah but we have sara eisen it also haruhiko kuroda been patient sara eisen yeah i mean it raises the question though that if we do global economy face a steeper decline or downturn or even recession whether central banks especially yours has the policy ammunition to fight it haruhiko kuroda yeah yeah of course since our policy rate is 0 1 and the ten year jgb rate is around 0 but still we can further reduce interest rates sara eisen how negative can you go haruhiko kuroda i mean japan s negative interest rate is just 0 1 and as you may know in europe they have 0 5 or 9 or 7 or some percent i m not saying that we would do that but still there s room for reducing long term interest rate as well as short term interest rate and also there are other ways to make monetary conditions more accommodative especially through larger asset sales asset purchase programs and so on so forth so i think there are still some room for further monetary easing sara eisen if you need it haruhiko kuroda yeah if needed but at this stage we don t think it s necessary sara eisen do you worry at all about the longer term implications and the side effects of having so much haruhiko kuroda yeah yeah yeah sara eisen accommodation for so long haruhiko kuroda i think a major side effect is its impact on the profitability of the banking sector because banks can make profit through the interest rate gap sara eisen it s crushing them haruhiko kuroda yeah it s almost almost nothing sara eisen right haruhiko kuroda but in the last five years or so japanese banks recorded a relatively respectable level of profit why big banks increased their international lending local banks they cannot increase international lending so that their profit or income coming from the lending business declined but two factors compensated 1 sharply declined credit cost because now bankruptcy is so sara eisen low haruhiko kuroda rare so credit cost has declined that is one point another is local banks sold a lot of jgbs to the bank of japan and also they sold some stock and shares with significant capital gain so because of these two factors they can maintain relatively good profit level but these two factors cannot be continued indefinitely because credit cost is already quite low could could rise credit cost and also they have sold a lot of jgbs as well as stocks and shares and so that this way of making profit is limited so in the long run i mean for the last five six years they maintained but in the long run local banks would have to make some restructuring or acquisition and merges and some new business sara eisen to deal with it haruhiko kuroda that s right but so far it s okay and even local banks have enough capital so that even if their profit becomes negative they can sustain for several years but as i said eventually they have to create some sort of restructuring sara eisen are you surprised at the value of the dollar yen given how much easing you ve done relative to the fed s normalization and where the ten year yield is versus the u s ten year yield haruhiko kuroda yeah yeah sara eisen i mean the japanese yen hasn t weakened that substantially haruhiko kuroda i must say that the before we introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing in 2013 yen was overvalued and in the last five six years yen has stabilized around 110 to 120 or something which is not undervaluation rather i should say excessive appreciation or overvaluation was corrected and the exchange rate has been quite stable now despite sara eisen so you re satisfied haruhiko kuroda yeah yeah so and also as you know exchange rates are affected by many factors not just bilateral interest rate differential but many factors sara eisen yes when the trade war gets worse the i mean it it affects the dollar yen haruhiko kuroda at this stage i don t know trade conflict is between u s and china and i hope trade conflict be solved relatively soon i hope i don t know sara eisen how much do you think it s hurting the global economy haruhiko kuroda i think already because of this uncertainty investment in china has been affected and so if this conflict is solved soon that will be good for the chinese economy and also for the u s economy yeah but this is outside of the central banking sara eisen but it s affecting the outlook i mean actually japan is going to start trade talks with the u s next week haruhiko kuroda yeah sara eisen do you see this as a potential risk factor if our administration pursues the path of tariffs or tariff threats haruhiko kuroda i mean personally i don t think so but of course this is up to trade negotiators so i don t know but sara eisen have you looked at a scenario where if the u s put tariffs on japanese car exports to the united states what would that do the japanese economy haruhiko kuroda i don t know already most of japanese cars sold in the united states are produced in the united states so i really don t think it s necessary for the u s to impose tariffs on japanese car imports and many of them may be components for automobiles produced in the united states and by the way the within the u s trade deficit years ago 20 years ago a large part of the u s trade deficit was with japan but now it s quite small so sara eisen 60 billion the president still wants to eliminate it is that possible haruhiko kuroda i m not quite sure because bilateral trade is not a very important economic indicator i mean global current account sara eisen sure haruhiko kuroda will be quite important but it should be global multilateral and not only trade balance but service trade balance income account balance and so on so forth so i think for any economy important variable is not bilateral trade figure but global current account figure and the from this point of view i think u s has been managing its economy quite well of course some current account deficit but quite manageable and this shows that the u s is importing capital and many of them are fdis but japanese companies european companies come to the u s doing business creating jobs hugely in the united states so i think from this perspective as you know the the g20 under the japanese presidency will discuss global balances how to avoid excessive global imbalances not bilateral trade balances sara eisen right yeah it s good that you re taking over the conversation i guess this year so when you look globally i mean risk assets have performed very well in 2019 haruhiko kuroda yeah yeah yeah sara eisen it s been risk on that s helped the dollar yen it s helped a lot in terms of the economic outlook as well do you expect that kind of environment to continue haruhiko kuroda it s i mean according to the world economic outlook recently released by the imf they also think that this year growth rate will decelerate because last year growth rate was global economy growth rate was 3 6 but this year they expect 3 3 but next year it would sara eisen bounce back haruhiko kuroda accelerate to 3 6 and this is the main scenario and it is most likely if this is realized i don t think there will be any financial market tumble or anything like that but this mainline scenario is mainline sara eisen what s the biggest haruhiko kuroda there are a lot of a lot of downside risks sara eisen what s the biggest risk to the global economy haruhiko kuroda at this stage i must say that trade protection not only between u s and china there are some sort of protectionism that is i think the most serious risk involved in the global economy but as i said i hope u s china trade conflict will be resolved soon by the way imf world economic outlook main scenario does assume u s china trade conflict will not worsen will not become so serious if it worsens and becomes more serious then sara eisen different outlook haruhiko kuroda that s right sara eisen governor kuroda thank you so much haruhiko kuroda thank you sara eisen i really appreciate you speaking to me haruhiko kuroda thank you sara eisen thank you haruhiko kuroda i enjoyed it thank you sara eisen thank you

new york china is about to slash the employer contribution rate to the social security fund from 18 20 per cent with some variation across regions to 16 per cent and cut the value added tax vat rate from 16 per cent to 13 per cent for most enterprises this is on top of a previously announced reduction in the corporate income tax charged on the first 3 million yuan 447 000 of taxable income these policy moves are timely and useful in combating the downward pressure on economic growth but they also raise the risk of a future debt crisis the loss of government revenue will not be entirely proportional to these rate reductions as the government can also tighten enforcement to reduce tax evasion still the government expects the tax reform package to lead to a substantial reduction in revenue of some 2 trillion yuan or about 2 1 per cent of gdp this year alone the policy package would likely raise the central government s fiscal deficit from 2 8 per cent of gdp to about 5 per cent and increase central government debt from about 47 per cent of gdp to perhaps 70 per cent over the medium term add to that the liabilities implicit in closing the funding gap in the social security system as well as massive local government debts and overall public debt could grow much larger potentially exceeding 150 per cent of gdp in a few years international experience from developing countries shows that large and growing government debt is unsustainable and often leads to a major economic crisis down the road to avoid such an outcome china can consider three additional reforms first the authorities should make the vat reduction temporary announcing that the 2018 rate will be restored in 2021 with a possible extension if the economy is still not meeting its growth potential a temporary cut would not only put less pressure on the long run value of government debt it would actually boost growth more powerfully than a permanent cut of the same magnitude because households and firms would have an incentive to spend and invest sooner second china should replace administrative restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution with new taxes the scope for doing so is large given that china is the world s largest polluter and carbon dioxide emitter on an annual basis in cumulative emissions the united states remains in the lead and public demand for environmentally friendly policies is growing stronger while china has a modest tradable permit programme for certain pollutants most of the control takes the form of administrative restrictions targeting certain activities by certain firms while such restrictions reduce emissions by raising the costs for firms as a tax would they generate no revenue for the government they can also undermine efficiency by creating disparities in marginal production costs among producers in similar industries a better approach would replace most or all administrative restrictions with taxes on emissions and pollution the two are not the same as some pollution does not involve greenhouse gas emissions and broaden the coverage to other offending activities not currently restricted this includes ramping up the tradable permit programme by lowering the threshold beyond which firms have to pay and eliminating exemptions from permits for firms or industries such actions would not only boost fiscal sustainability the additional revenues could total 2 per cent of gdp but also improve the efficiency of overall resource allocation finally china can lower government spending in the medium term by streamlining its vast administrative hierarchy in recent decades many of the largest global companies have taken advantage of new technologies to reduce the number of employee layers from top executives to factory workers thereby reducing costs and boosting efficiency china s government by contrast has retained the same six layer administrative structure starting with the central government and moving down through provinces prefectures counties townships and villages since the founding of the people s republic 70 years ago this vast administrative apparatus employs over 14 million civil servants and millions more who work for government agencies but do not fall under that classification china is already a global leader in e commerce and digital payment it has all the physical infrastructure to become a leader in e governance using digital technologies the country could eliminate one or two layers of its administrative apparatus this would reduce overall government spending while improving the delivery of government services it would also help reduce corruption one concern may be that downsizing government employment would exacerbate the effects of slowing economic growth but the cuts need not be abrupt a longer term attrition plan could be put in place that takes advantage of retirement and normal resignations to reduce the overall size of the government over time additional voluntary separations could be encouraged by modest inducements to subsidise job searches in this manner the government could be made 15 20 per cent smaller and considerably more efficient within say eight years china s latest tax cuts serve an important purpose to combat downward pressure on economic growth the risk of a future debt crisis should be addressed by a few complementary actions making the vat rate cut temporary broadening taxes on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution and downsizing the government these reforms would make china more efficient and prosperous shang jin wei a former chief economist of the asian development bank is professor of chinese business and economy and professor of finance and economics at columbia

priority customers on sustainable wealth creation and helping them to identify investment opportunities and risks in domestic and global markets reports collins nweze monetary policy decisions inflation stable exchange rate and global trade tensions among other economic indicators play a major role in what an investor takes home yearly the level of knowledge at the disposal of a bank its customers and even investors is also crucial to their investment decisions that explains why financial institutions ensure that they equip their clients and investors with the right knowledge that

to prepare and react in lagos the event provided an opportunity for its investment and financial market specialists to give insights on key asset classes across global and domestic economies and how to take advantage of the opportunities they present the analysts insisted that global growth is likely to slow while inflation remains under control but central banks are expected to raise rates further they believe that while bonds are offering increasing value especially united states u s dollar bonds the risk reward for equities may deteriorate within the year standard chartered chief investment strategist steve brice predicted an increasing value in bonds and cash especially relative to equities brice said one of the roles of the bank is to advise clients on risks and opportunities in the market he said sell off in equities market and investors going for fixed income securities were normal and were determined by what the investors consider safe at each point also standard chartered bank head wealth management nigeria simpa adaba said wealth management is creating a credible scenario for the client so what really matters to us is that we put clients at the centre of what we do we ensure our clients invest in things we consider appropriate for the risk capital they have expressed to us we also have good investors they do a brilliant job by giving clients context around decisions that they need to take he said according to him the bank sees its client as passionate about earning money the scenario about saving up for one s children s wedding saving up for school the last thing they want to hear is that the money is not available so these things are created in such a way that we give as much information to clients and ensure they have everything clear to guide their investment decisions he said adaba said the bank will continue to provide investment advice to clients if you have a global view on investment you will realise that people internationally are behaving in a particular way at a particular time if you are a nigerian investor and you invested in treasury bills t bills but something just happened and you realised that foreign investors are asking for nigerian t bills for instance foreign investors can take a position on emerging markets and when that happens nigeria does not need to do anything wrong to warrant a selloff except that the country is within the emerging market basket so it will be affected he said continuing he said what the bank found to be very critical for clients is that at every stage someone is talking to them and giving them up to date investment information we also want to make access to our products a lot easier so this year we planned to bring to the market something potentially different like using app to buy t bills or do a federal government of nigeria fgn bonds and even small ticket mutual fund so let these things happen on the platform he said read also standard chartered bank appoints nigeria ceo he said the bank is planning to spend a lot of money on digital technology we need to create new platforms and support the ones we already created using technology there is no doubt that we are committed to this market it is big market too big to be ignored for standard chartered nigeria is a big focus he said adaba said the bank is working very hard to make clients experience better we are not there yet but there is a lot of money that the bank is investing to make the customer experience a lot better you will realise that banking is becoming more of convenience than product it is not about product but the convenience you are bringing so banking is doing the same thing but making it easier for clients to do banking he said related posts experience the ultimate celebration xiaomi fan festival promotion brice also said it is good for investors to diversify their investments to spread the risks adding that recession is likely to occur between 2020 and 2021 hence the need to diversify investments both domestically and internationally he said the lender is doing everything possible to ensure that international perspective it brings to local markets do not have any difficulty i am still talking to the relationship managers giving them the opportunity to ask directly on any faults any concerns that they have about the environment or about what we are doing he said on wealth management adaba said the nigerian franchise is still relatively young our focus is not about the product but the client i think it is involved in a scenario where we are responding to what our client needs and at this point our focus in nigeria and globally is the ease of access to the products for example can our client get on the app and purchase our product we have spent a lot of money as a group to ensure that whatever product we have our client can access it he said he said the success of the last general elections gave people confidence on the economy on the products that the bank offers he said he said the bank focuses on partnering and checking on what the clients want and then meeting such needs on what clients want he said whether in good times or not my investment advisors through our investment management speak to their clients and give them necessary contents because something is going doesn t mean you should jump out as we said earlier if you are clear about why you invested you might want to put more at that point and then we talked about assets people are saying if you invest in a stock and it goes down 30 per cent it s quite difficult to know what to do because it could go down after 30 per cent but if you diversify across you will manage and it might come back over time he said the bank allows the clients to decide where they want to put their money and their choice is within what we offer and that will really help us create a framework for them other analysts said the lender expects global growth to slow down in the year for the first time in three years led by the euro area and china it also expects growth divergence between the u s and other developed economies seen in the second half of last year to continue adding that u s growth is likely to slow modestly still supported by the tax cuts of 2017 while the euro area decelerates to trend growth and china slows further it said monetary policy is likely to progressively turn less accommodative worldwide heading into the year they explained that standard chartered bank is more optimistic on bonds than it was at the start of last year and expect them to deliver positive returns the yields on offer are higher valuations are more attractive in some sub asset classes and we do not expect bonds yields to rise dramatically emerging market em u s dollar government bonds are preferred owing to easing headwinds for em assets the attractive yield and relative value on offer we also see better value in asian u s dollar bonds

today s highlights australian and new zealand dollars under central bank pressure disappointing data for canadian dollar can the pound and euro make hay while the sun shines current market overview the heat is on for the commodity currencies after a raft of global economic data and central bank speeches the australian dollar is the weakest currency currently as the reserve bank of australia rba took another step towards laying the ground for an interest rate cut through their cautious tone and approach to monetary policy the australian central bank was clear about the possibility of dropping interest rates and seeing the need for it given the current declining australian economic conditions australian and new zealand dollars under central bank pressure the rba said a lower level of interest rates could still be expected to support the economy through a depreciation of the exchange rate and via reducing required interest payments on borrowing freeing up cash for other expenditure also they were open about the need to lower rates in a scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trended up a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate in these circumstances the australian dollar took a tumble as a result and markets are now anticipating two interest rate cuts in 2019 across the tasman sea the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz governor adrian orr also had some words of caution and discussed their lean towards monetary easing much of this caution can be attributed to worldwide concerns about a global economic slowdown evidenced through worsening economic conditions in the usa china and europe all of which are having knock on effects on their neighbour countries and currencies disappointing data for canadian dollar in north america another commodity currency has come under pressure the canadian dollar fell overnight after poor results from the bank of canada s boc business outlook survey which also focused on global economic fears and pressure from policy changes in the neighbouring usa which are hitting export sales and trade performance later today canada manufacturing sales and international securities transactions will be released and no doubt scrutinised closely by investors federal reserve flexible on inflation goals following trump s tweet federal reserve bank of chicago president and ceo charles evans said on monday that the federal reserve s policy has been successful in achieving maximum employment he also said they should show willingness to allow inflation to spill modestly over the 2 target 50 of the time setting alight new rumours that the federal reserve will put up interest rates again european markets have strong data results to contend with the markets focus will now turn to employment data from the uk and the all important investor sentiment results from germany uk employment figures and the german zew economic sentiment index are the major focuses for european currency markets today the german zew economic sentiment index surprised markets with an about turn leaping up to 3 1 in april from 3 6 last month and well above expectations of the 0 8 forecast the zew institute attributed this rebound to less pronounced concerns about a global economic slowdown and the postponed date for the uk to leave the eu which could have helped improve sentiment across europe uk employment joint highest on record in the uk we re actually going to be able to get through another currency news update without mentioning that word ending in it what a treat meanwhile data from the office for national statistics ons on uk employment shows that employment in the uk is at the highest figure on record and an improvement on this time last year at 76 1 compared to the figure of 75 4 in 2018 the unemployment rate is at the joint lowest recorded unemployment has not been lower in the uk since 1975 can the pound and euro make hay while the sun shines so both the pound and the euro have some good news to buoy them up can they gain ground against their major currency partners particularly the beleaguered commodity currencies soul searching and it is very sad news about the devastating fire at notre dame cathedral a stunning symbol of french history and a unesco world heritage site it is fascinating from a financial perspective when looking at the money pledged to help support renovations with just one company able to access funds of around eur 200 000 000 for the cause and another offering eur 100 000 000 maybe the global economy isn t in such bad shape after all perhaps we re just looking in the wrong places such a deep emotional connection to a rich and important historical institution is a fantastic financial driver food for thought
finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube has expressed confidence that the rtgs dollar will stabilise and gain value beyond the prevailing market volatility as government forges ahead with implementation of fiscal reform measures he said the new framework under the staff monitored programme smp between government and the international monetary fund imf will help open new foreign financial flows to the economy assist foreign debt clearance efforts and create a stable currency environment prof ncube said he expected the official interbank exchange rate to converge with the raging parallel market rate soon as the government continues to implement prudent fiscal measures that do not fuel the black market the smp from imf has opened doors for immediate foreign financial inflows to support cyclone idai recovery efforts and help mobilise a global financial package for arrears clearance and create a stable currency for zimbabwe the rtgs would stabilise and even strengthen he posted on his twitter account in february the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz floated the local reference currency dubbed rtgs dollar at 2 5 to one us dollar after abandoning the 1 1 fixed rate the rate has steadily gone up to slightly above three rtgs dollars per us dollar while on the black market the rate is between 4 1 and 5 2 this week however prof ncube has said government was maintaining a tight fiscal regime in order to contain the parallel market it s early days we just introduced the new currency regime a little over a month ago so it the new currency is trying to find its way it is trying to find equilibrium it will get there and close that gap between the parallel market and the official floating market he told bloomberg tv in washington the united states the black market cannot carry on you know why because on the fiscal front things are very tight because previously the fiscus was a source of money growth and therefore creating weaknesses on the currency and currency volatility currently things are very tight we are running a surplus for the last four months in terms of primary deficit so we do not expect the currency to come under pressure neither is money supply growing on the contrary expect month to month inflation to go negative in the next few months so the currency rate cannot run away too far prof ncube said foreign currency supply was expected to increase as the tobacco marketing season progressed we are looking forward to an improved tobacco season we earn about a billion dollars from the sale of tobacco globally so we expect that to stabilise the market over the next few months he said
the markets are jittery about a possible recession the u s federal reserve s decision earlier this year to ease off further interest rate increases in 2019 as it keeps a watchful eye on economic signals after doing four hikes in the previous year has only buttressed those fears but former fed chairman alan greenspan does not see a recession on the horizon based on an indicator his firm constructed and tracks right at the moment that particular series shows we re still deleveraging it s very difficult to envisage that sort of economy going into a recession he said during an interview with wharton professor kent smetters faculty director of the penn wharton budget model at a forum focused on greenspan s new book capitalism in america a history which he co authored with adrian wooldridge of the economist greenspan s consulting firm developed an indicator that tracks a company s capital appropriations at the time its board authorizes an investment instead of waiting for the decision to be reflected in the expenditures report months later this signal has been an extraordinarily effective leading indicator of recessions greenspan noted market watchers are concerned about a coming recession because the yield curve has inverted which is when short term treasuries have higher yields than longer term treasuries in a normal yield curve long term treasuries have higher yields to reward investors for holding on to the debt when this relationship inverts it historically has served as an early warning signal for recessions although there have been false signals while greenspan believes that a recession might not be imminent he nonetheless sees the economy slowing not helping matters is the trade war with china both sides already have imposed tariffs and threaten to assess more let s remember what a tariff is a tariff is a tax he said if you impose a tax on your border who s paying your citizens because it makes imported goods pricier taxes withdraw purchasing power from an economy greenspan continued to say basically that we beat china in a trade war essentially means both of us lost in terms of gdp because we put tariffs on our own imports and the economy will go down there is no doubt that we cannot keep moving at a 1 trillion deficit without inflation ultimately emerging at least inflation is under wraps said greenspan a famous inflation hawk asked what he thought of the fed s 2 inflation target he said measuring inflation can be complicated when new products go on the market they come in at relatively higher prices remember that henry ford s model t came in at a very high price and the price went down as technology improved when measuring inflation you don t start to pick up the first level until well into that declining phase so there s a bias in the statistic greenspan said if inflation is measured at 2 it s actually zero for consumers he added but if the u s continues to run a big budget deficit all bets are off there is no doubt that we cannot keep moving at a 1 trillion deficit without inflation ultimately emerging greenspan said if you print a lot of money you will get higher prices looking to sweden social security is another bugaboo for the u s economy greenspan pointed to the stark warning in the back page of the social security administration s annual report they basically say right out that in order to get an actuarially sound permanent social security system we have to cut benefits by 24 every year from now on out that s tough because cutting retirement benefits is something no politician wants to do sweden had the same problem in the 1990s they were doing exactly what we were doing greenspan said but in 1994 the swedish parliament switched to a combination of a defined benefit plan like a pension and a defined contribution plan like a 401 k where citizens put money into and manage their own accounts according to a report by the oecd the u s uses a defined benefit system that periodically has run out of money only to be replenished by general revenues greenspan said they made the social security requirements essentially an application of the american taxpayer he noted that means you ve got a new entitlement without a means of funding it to make social security solvent the u s should move to a defined contribution plan sweden did sweden is doing very well he said if we follow their pattern we would do fine people might argue that what worked for sweden might not work for the u s which has a much larger economy but greenspan disagreed whether you re a larger economy or you re a smaller economy it has to do with the form of your pension fund if your pension fund is defined contribution it would never run out of money the solution to fixing social security s shortfalls is not a great mystery he added the issue is political will even a democratic socialist nation like sweden was able to do it he noted if we follow pattern we would do fine u s resilience despite its many challenges the u s economy remains on top china may be coming close to taking the title but that will not happen in the near future if it does so at all greenspan said the total market value of china s goods and services is marginally higher but on a per capita basis china is still a third of the level of the u s he pointed out we had china s per capita gdp back in 1960 what did we produce back then steel aluminum coal all of the things that are essentially obsolescent in today s markets these key industries withered when technologies related to the transistor emerged that is a hugely different concept of what market value is greenspan said and so the question is can china close the gap the answer is that it is closing the gap but slowly and while china is boosting capital investment to goose its economy this only serves to increase productivity and living standards at a very gradual pace he said i don t want to say that china will pass us at one point if they do pace in which the gap is closing it s pretty well in the future what has kept the u s economy the most resilient in history among large nations i say it s the constitution greenspan said the constitution was constructed to maintain a set of rights basically individual rights and as a consequence property rights that gave all sorts of incentives and in a very short period of time we bypassed britain by the end of world war ii the u s economy stood alone by an extraordinary gap above all others he said the u s even helped germany rebuild instead of imposing penalties on a defeated foe greenspan said the end of the cold war also put a lid on the debate over which economic system was better greenspan said after the berlin wall came down east germany was so obviously inferior to west germany even when they both started at the end of world war ii in a sort of tabula rasa or a clean slate he said back then east germany was the jewel of the soviet system but achieved only a third of west germany s standard of living i don t want to say that china will pass us at one point if they do it s pretty well in the future as such greenspan said it was interesting to see the current socialist tilt in the u s americans are essentially engaging in the same debate that has taken place for decades when the reality is that capitalism raises the standard of living he added fueling the socialist talk is rising income inequality which greenspan said bears a very significant negative on society it doesn t work it s a major problem when new technologies emerge he said a small segment of the population master them so they accumulate wealth society has to find a way to train those left behind but handing out entitlements is not a viable long term solution greenspan sees the entitlement expansion in the u s as a contractionary force because what the data and statistical analysis show is that every dollar of entitlement increase reduces gross domestic savings in the u s by 1 that s what the data shows and the outlook has not fundamentally changed meanwhile as the population ages it is draining savings out of the system political wrangling is blocking solutions from taking root lately politics is even encroaching on the fed s independence but greenspan pointed to the central bank s legislative protections that have served it well for decades let s understand what the federal reserve act in 1913 which created the federal reserve system really stipulated it considered the question of politics involved the act shielded the fed s monetary policy decisions from ratification by the president congress does not fund the fed although it has oversight and members of the central bank s board of governors serve 14 year terms to make sure they last longer than any administration the goal is to keep politicians from using the fed for political gain policy is working if politics managed to get itself straightened out greenspan said

experts have been debating just how does the average american benefit from the dollar s reserve currency status and would the greenback s fall from grace have a negative or positive impact on the livelihood of the average american worker economist steve keen recently told the macrovoices podcast that average investors are overinflating the risks of a weaker dollar or the american greenback losing reserve currency status experts and investors also fear that a weaker dollar and or the loss of reserve currency statis would cause interest rates to surge keen explains it s not the external market that sets u s interest rates but the federal reserve so i can see it as giving america quite a severe jolt but it won t be something which causes interest rates to go sky high they will still be held in a band by the federal reserve you might see rises in corporate rates and so on but not large rises in the rates on american government debt said keen a professor of economics at kingston university london from 2014 till 2018 before retiring from academia to be sure reuters recently reported that saudi arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if washington passes a bill exposing opec members to u s antitrust lawsuits three sources familiar with saudi energy policy said they said the option had been discussed internally by senior saudi energy officials in recent months two of the sources said the plan had been discussed with opec members and one source briefed on saudi oil policy said riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior u s energy officials the chances of the u s bill known as nopec coming into force are slim and saudi arabia would be unlikely to follow through but the fact riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom s annoyance about potential u s legal challenges to opec in the unlikely event riyadh were to ditch the dollar it would undermine the its status as the world s main reserve currency reduce washington s clout in global trade and weaken its ability to enforce sanctions on nation states however keen does see some uncertainty regarding the dollar s reserve currency status you get american imposing its political will on the rest of the world using the fact that it s the reserve currency and of course that s become intolerable under trump so i think the odds are let s say one in three of a serious breakdown in that in the next 10 years he said and if and when most of the world would ditch the u s dollar as the global reserve currency there would be some fallout for america keen explains obviously it s going to mean a reduction in demand for american dollars on foreign exchange markets which must mean a fall in the price over time and it will be complicated by the usual spot and hedge markets keen said but yes seeing a fall in the value of the dollar unless america s financial sector could no longer use the fact that it was american to have the power it has over financial institutions elsewhere in the world so that the scale of the financial sector would be pulled back your manufacturing sector would be more competitive but as you know you don t have the industrial pattern you used to have keen said you ve still got some outstanding corporations and outstanding technological capability but you don t have that machine tool background the skilled workers that used to exist there aren t there anymore so there would be a serious shock to america with more expensive goods to be imported from overseas and a slow shift towards having a local manufacturing capability making up for the damage of the last 25 years keen said i can see a lot of social conflict out of that as well but a positive for the american working class who really have been done over in the last quarter century and that s partly the reason why trump has come about and ironically trump is part of the reason why this might come to an end given how much he s used his bombast and the american reserve currency status as a thug s tool in foreign relations rather than an intelligent person s tool keen isn t the only respected economic voice to express concern recently about the dollar newsmax finance insider peter reagan also urged caution about the strong dollar s future and urged investors to see safety in the traditional safe haven of gold the dollar s grasp on its status of global reserve currency continues to slip away it could start dancing nervously if geopolitical tensions increase from the next wild presidential announcement reagan explained the bottom line is anything can happen as the world pushes away from the dollar and the economic outlook remains uncertain so what can you do reagan wrote corporate inflated stocks carry downside risk even bonds and treasuries aren t a guaranteed hedge but precious metals like gold and silver have been historically proven to do well when the dollar doesn t
by justin bogie and adam michel the daily signal it s nice to have more money in your pocket and thanks to the 2017 tax cuts the typical american is now paying less in taxes but that s not to say we re not still sending a hefty sum of money to washington tally up all the payroll and other taxes on earnings and income and you ll find that the average american household forks over more than 26 000 to the feds each year last year washington collected more than 3 3 trillion in taxes so where exactly does all that money go some believe most of it goes to foreign aid and defense others think corporate subsidies dominate the budget in reality health entitlements medicare medicaid obamacare and social security are the largest and fastest growing programs unless congress fixes these four programs they and the ever growing interest payments on the national debt will consume every dollar of taxes paid by 2041 that leaves no money for anything else uncle sam couldn t spend a penny on defense food assistance highways or education without driving the country further into debt right now medicare medicaid and obamacare subsidies account for more than a quarter 28 8 of all federal spending ten years from now they re projected to gobble up more than a third of the budget meanwhile social security the single largest federal program accounts for roughly a quarter of all federal spending all by itself its trust funds already pay out more than they take in and its finances will only deteriorate faster as more and more boomers retire the social security trustees project that unless congress implements much needed reforms the program will run out of reserve funds by 2034 potentially triggering a 23 cut in benefits other income security programs veterans benefits food and housing assistance federal employee retirement and disability account for 16 of the budget that s more than we spend on national defense and the defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations overseas to the research development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment at 15 of the federal budget defense spending is the last major category of federal spending most of what is left goes to people and corporations who hold washington s ious currently 8 of the budget goes to interest payments on this debt over the coming decade u s debt held by the public is projected to balloon to nearly 93 of gross domestic product but don t blame that on inadequate taxation by 2024 the pro growth tax enacted in 2017 will actually raise more revenue yearly than the old system no the culprit here is runaway spending driven primarily by huge increases in health and social security outlays and the long term consequences of deficit spending are dire economic growth tends to slow in countries with debts that are as big as their economy the u s is quickly joining this group as the debt increases so does the cost of the interest we must pay to those who hold the debt china is currently the largest foreign holder of u s debt left unchecked growing government spending and historically high levels of debt will ultimately require higher taxes and just jacking up taxes on the rich won t cut it paying for big government requires high taxes on middle class americans too eventually rising debt will leave lawmakers with few options to avoid a financial crisis unless we can reverse course it is only a matter of time before every american will be forced to pay higher income and payroll taxes on tax day 2019 be thankful for the extra money the 2017 tax cuts deposited in your pocket but know that unless we insist that lawmakers suppress their seemingly insatiable appetite to spend we could all soon be paying much much more
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire beijing reuters china s stimulus measures will shore up economic growth this year and next but may undermine the country s drive to control debt and worsen structural distortions over the medium term the oecd said in a report on tuesday beijing has stepped up fiscal stimulus to prevent a sharper slowdown in the world s second largest economy which is being squeezed by weaker domestic demand and a trade war with the united states related stories local governments will be allowed to issue 2 15 trillion yuan 320 60 billion worth of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects a jump of 59 percent from last year but s p global ratings estimated last year that local governments were already sitting on hidden debt that could be as high as 40 trillion yuan infrastructure stimulus could lift growth over the projection horizon but it could lead to a further build up of imbalances and capital misallocation and thereby weaker growth in the medium term the oecd said in its latest survey on china s economy the stimulus risks increasing once again corporate sector indebtedness and more generally reversing progress in deleveraging it said china s corporate debt has fallen to about 160 percent of gross domestic product gdp due to a multi year clampdown on riskier types of financing and debt but the level was still higher than in other major economies the oecd said the government in march announced tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan for companies this year which will lift its budget deficit to 2 8 percent of gdp this year from 2 6 percent in 2018 china s fiscal stimulus could be as high as 4 25 percent of gdp this year up from 2 94 percent in 2018 the oecd added easier monetary policy should help reduce the risk of liquidity strains which could put further pressure on businesses said ludger schuknecht deputy secretary general of the oecd but he said beijing should prevent any policy overshooting fiscal policy should aim to support the economy while avoiding any side effects he added i m sure government authorities and the pboc are monitoring this carefully it s a matter of implementing it stimulus in the right way he told an event ahead of the release of the report new bank loans rebounded more than expected in march and totaled a record 5 8 trillion yuan for the quarter as policymakers pushed lenders to support struggling smaller private companies which are seen as higher credit risks than state controlled firms but there are concerns that looser lending standards may fuel a further rise in bad loans as well as inefficient investment and speculation particularly in the property market underscoring the oecd s warning about debt risks data on tuesday showed growth in new home prices accelerated in march after cooling since november 2018 average new home prices in china s 70 major cities rose 0 6 percent quickening from a 0 5 percent gain in february according to reuters calculation of data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs home prices in china are expected to rise more this year than predicted just a few months ago a recent reuters poll showed as the government urges banks to increase lending and lower interest rates to support the economy the people s bank of china pboc has already slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs but top officials have repeatedly vowed not to open the floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns china s economic growth is likely to slow to 6 2 percent this year the weakest pace in nearly 30 years and growth is expected to cool further to 6 0 percent in 2020 the oecd said the economy expanded 6 6 percent in 2018 in march the oecd cut its 2019 growth forecast from 6 3 percent the oecd s outlook on china s economy was in line with a reuters poll published last week growth of china s exports of goods and services could slow to 4 5 percent this year from 5 1 percent in 2018 amid trade frictions with the united states the oecd predicted china s current account may swing to a deficit of 0 1 percent of gdp this year from a small surplus in 2018 amid its rebalancing towards domestic demand the oecd added reporting by kevin yao editing by kim coghill
minister kenneth ofori atta chairman of the african caucus and ms christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund imf co chaired the african consultative group meeting on 12 april 2019 at the imf headquarters they issued the following statement after the conclusion of the group s meeting in washington dc we had very productive discussions on africa s economic developments and prospects the economic recovery in africa is expected to continue however under current policies and amid increased global uncertainty medium term growth for the region is expected to continue to fall well short of what is needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force the key challenge that africa faces is to invest in human and physical capital to create jobs while at the same time reducing debt vulnerabilities against this backdrop we agree that countries need to generate fiscal space enhance resilience including to climate change and create sustained high and inclusive growth including by removing obstacles to greater gender equity this will require in particular i pursuing growth friendly fiscal consolidations where needed that strike the right balance between development spending reducing debt vulnerabilities and meeting essential social needs ii strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy to enhance the monetary transmission mechanism iii enhancing the flexibility of markets to facilitate adjustment to shocks and preserve competitiveness iv removing trade barriers to boost medium term growth including in the context of the african continental free trade agreement and v addressing illicit financing flows and base erosion to enhance governance and strengthen revenue collection ms lagarde stated that the imf will remain closely engaged with its african members the fund will continue to support the authorities efforts to address the current macroeconomic and structural challenges and achieve a stronger durable and inclusive growth to absorb new entrants in the labor force minister kenneth ofori atta echoed ms lagarde on the economic prospects of the continent and the willingness of the sub region to work closely with the imf to tackle emerging concerns he emphasized the need for members to sustain commitment to structural reforms and encouraged the fund to show patience in its program engagement when there is demonstrated ownership by country authorities for successful outcomes transcript of the african department press briefing washington dc 12 april 2019 mr abebe aemro selassie director african department thank you lucie a very good morning to you all thank you for joining us this morning we our regional economic outlook the sub saharan africa economy continues to recover in terms of economic growth this year we are expecting growth to accelerate to 3 5 percent from 3 percent last year but these regional average numbers mask quite a lot of difference in terms of outcomes across the region specifically some 21 countries are expected to grow at 5 percent or more this year and so you know with per capita income increases that are markedly larger than many countries in the rest of the world and these economies that are growing fast tend to be the more diversified economies still there are in other set of countries around 24 mainly resource dependent economies that are facing sluggish growth in the near term and are seeing slower improvements in standards of livings this group includes some of the larger economies in the region the likes of angola nigeria and south africa which account for more than 50 percent of the region s output external and domestic developments are having a betting on the economic outlook on the external front perhaps the most important factors have been the volatility and global financial conditions as well as the volatility in commodity prices which are posing a challenge for policymakers domestically one pressure point remains rising public debt vulnerabilities these are elevated in some countries and posing a challenge the reason for the increase in debt levels tends to be very country specific for some it is due to addressing the large infrastructure needs in others it s been the effect of the commodity price shock that hit countries between 2014 and 2016 and yet in others it s been procyclical policies which have led to the marked increase in debt levels looking ahead we see basically two broad implications for policies first in the fast growing economies the likes of benin ethiopia ghana senegal there is a need to hand over the reins of growth from the public to the private sector in many of these countries public investments has helped spur higher growth while also of course translating into an increase in public debt levels so there is a need to strike a better balance between public debt increase on one hand and the continued investments that are needed in public investment in the slower growing economies the likes of as i just mentioned angola nigeria south africa there is a need to pursue reforms to facilitate economic diversification and address remaining economic imbalances many of these cases private investments remain weak and a strong focus is needed to address the constraints that are holding such investments back one development that we are very hopeful will facilitate growth is increased trade integration in the region we are very encouraged by the progress that has been made towards the african continental free trade area once completed the trade agreement will establish a market of 1 2 billion people with a combined gdp of 2 5 trillion the benefits could be substantial particularly if countries tackle the non tariff bottlenecks to trade including by investing in infrastructure lowering logistical costs and improving trade facilitation what is interesting we think is that intraregional exports in africa are more diversified and have a higher technology content than africa s exports to much the rest of the world and just to give you a couple of numbers on this 40 percent of intraregional trade is accounted for by manufactured goods whereas the region exports to the world 75 percent of such exports tend to be minerals the likes of crude oil and other commodities still one thing to note of course is that to ensure the benefits of intraregional integration are shared by all policymakers should be mindful of the adjustment costs that integration could entail and move swiftly to address those in addition to these more medium term challenges that i ve been noting we see you know countries of course have been hit by significant shocks two such examples i want to highlight i think the first is the security challenge overall the conflict levels in the region tend to be much lower than in the 90s and even early 2000s but countries in the sahel and lake chad basin are facing considerable security threats and this region inaudible economic outlook we have done some work looking at the recent trends and the economic impact that conflicts are having this is an issue of great concern and we are discussing with country authorities how best we can minimize their diversion of resources away from much needed development spending another example of the kind of shocks that policymakers have to contend with of course are weather related shocks as you know cyclone idai has a devastating impact in southeast africa leading to the significant loss of life and damage we are doing everything we can to support the countries that have been affected just to give an example we have moved very rapidly to support mozambique through a rapid credit facility we expect the executive board to consider this request as soon as next week within a month of the hurricane hitting the cyclone hitting mozambique in zimbabwe yesterday we announced a staff monitored program which will support the government s economic policies and we are having extensive dialogue with authorities and then malawi we are in discussions with authorities to provide additional support through the existing ecf arrangement we have with them before i end i would like to stress that sub saharan africa remains a region of tremendous economic potential and while the global environment is increasingly uncertain there is much that the countries are doing and can do to sustain very high rates of growth which we are certain will translate into continued improvements and development outcomes questioner the trump administration is one in that the chinese investment in africa while is good for infrastructure is also can turn out to become death trap and a inaudible takeover we have cases in sri lanka especially because the loans from china end up in the hands of very corrupt government unaccountable government how big a threat is the chinese investment and expansion in africa and finally yesterday the new inaudible president the alarming statistic about africa he said by 2030 nine out of ten extremely poor people in the world will be africans which is bit surprising seeing all the poor in asia and in the u s and in europe is the imf seeing the same thing and finally in terms of statistics we see the imf has 3 5 projection this year and the world bank has a different statistics how does it work why do you have different statistics how do you get to it mr selassie okay a lot of questions there first on the debt issue as i flagged earlier you know in some countries i think it s important to know that you know with many policy challenges and particularly for the region as diverse as inaudible africa it is very important to consider them in a country specific context so the reason why debt has gone up defers from country to country and the sources of financing also tend to be country specific our advice of course always is to make sure that countries are inaudible a healthy balance between on the one hand continue to address their development objectives and second avoiding the sustainability concerns in some cases of course these kind of debt problems can arise from borrowing from bilateral creditors but in other cases it comes from borrowing from commercial banks somebody asked me a question about inaudible not so long ago right the issue with debt sustainability had arisen on the context of borrowing from commercial banks that are hidden in that case so the issue of debt transparency is not unique to china but also to all borrowing that our countries are undertaking and what s important again is making sure that total borrowing levels remain consistent with debt servicing capacity failing to do that of course is very problematic on the outlook for the region in terms of addressing poverty rates you know of course this is exactly why we have this dialogue at these meetings with policymakers you know the brunt of our work is to make sure that the region continues to grow as robustly as possible to create the millions of jobs that our economies need to avoid you know wore outcomes particularly given the demographic challenges that the region faces so this is exactly what policymakers institutions like the imf world bank are all engaged in to make sure that we can facilitate help economies grow as robustly as possible to reduce existing poverty and avoid poverty levels deteriorating any further read the full transcript on the imf website
finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube has expressed confidence that the rtgs dollar will stabilise and gain value beyond the prevailing market volatility as government forges ahead with implementation of fiscal reform measures he said the new framework under the staff monitored programme smp between government and the international monetary fund imf will help open new foreign financial flows to the economy assist foreign debt clearance efforts and create a stable currency environment prof ncube said he expected the official interbank exchange rate to converge with the raging parallel market rate soon as the government continues to implement prudent fiscal measures that do not fuel the black market the smp from imf has opened doors for immediate foreign financial inflows to support cyclone idai recovery efforts and help mobilise a global financial package for arrears clearance and create a stable currency for zimbabwe the rtgs would stabilise and even strengthen he posted on his twitter account in february the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz floated the local reference currency dubbed rtgs dollar at 2 5 to one us dollar after abandoning the 1 1 fixed rate the rate has steadily gone up to slightly above three rtgs dollars per us dollar while on the black market the rate is between 4 1 and 5 2 this week however prof ncube has said government was maintaining a tight fiscal regime in order to contain the parallel market it s early days we just introduced the new currency regime a little over a month ago so it the new currency is trying to find its way it is trying to find equilibrium it will get there and close that gap between the parallel market and the official floating market he told bloomberg tv in washington the united states the black market cannot carry on you know why because on the fiscal front things are very tight because previously the fiscus was a source of money growth and therefore creating weaknesses on the currency and currency volatility currently things are very tight we are running a surplus for the last four months in terms of primary deficit so we do not expect the currency to come under pressure neither is money supply growing on the contrary expect month to month inflation to go negative in the next few months so the currency rate cannot run away too far prof ncube said foreign currency supply was expected to increase as the tobacco marketing season progressed we are looking forward to an improved tobacco season we earn about a billion dollars from the sale of tobacco globally so we expect that to stabilise the market over the next few months he said business chronicle new ziana
